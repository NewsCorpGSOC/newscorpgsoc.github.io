France Issues a Tender for Acquisition of 24 New Maritime Surveillance Coastal Patrol Boats	The French Directorate General of Armament (DGA) has launched a tender for the acquisition of 24 new Maritime Surveillance Coastal Patrol Boats (VCSM), aimed at replacing its current fleet, which is primarily used by the Maritime Gendarmerie for missions related to the State’s action at sea. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Currently, the Maritime Gendarmerie operates twenty-four Élorn-type coastal patrol boats. (Picture source: French MoD) Currently, the Maritime Gendarmerie operates twenty-four Élorn-type coastal patrol boats, designed by Raidco Marine and built by Chantiers Navals Bordelais (CNB) in the early 2000s. However, after Cyclone Chido hit Mayotte in December, two of these boats, the Verdon (P602) and the Odet (P611), are now out of service. The Élorn boats are 19 meters long and displace 41 tons when fully loaded. They are equipped with a 7.62mm machine gun, a water cannon, and a Furuno radar. Operated by a crew of eight gendarmes, these boats can reach a speed of 25 knots and have a range of approximately 400 nautical miles. In 2019, the DGA initiated the replacement process by issuing a tender under the 'New Generation Maritime Surveillance Coastal Patrol Boats' (VCSM NG) program. The shipyard Socarenam was selected to build three new units, two of which were initially intended for French Guiana. However, these plans were altered, and the first two boats, the Maroni and Oyapock, were reassigned to Dunkirk and Boulogne. The third boat, the Aber Ildut, was sent to Cherbourg instead of Roscoff. As the Élorn boats approach the end of their service life, the DGA has recently issued a new tender to replace them. The specifications for the new boats will be similar to those of the VCSM NG units currently in service. According to the terms of this tender, published on February 13, the new boats will be 22 meters in length and must be capable of reaching a minimum speed of 22 knots in sea state 4 conditions. They must be able to perform Category 3 crossings as per merchant marine regulations. Furthermore, they will be 'crewed by a maximum of seven personnel' and equipped with a stabilized long-range optronic system capable of operating during the day, at night, and at twilight. These boats will also need to maintain their maximum speed for several hours and ensure an operational phase of up to 60% of the sailing time at a speed of 8 knots. They will be powered by diesel propulsion with a 'slow-speed maneuvering device.' However, the nature of the materials for the hull and superstructures has not been specified. It is worth noting that the armament for these new boats is not mentioned in this tender. Interested manufacturers will need to demonstrate their ability to supply 24 new boats with a production rate of two boats every six months. For reference, the Maritime Gendarmerie is a specialized unit of the French National Gendarmerie, operating under the authority of the Chief of Staff of the French Navy (CEMM).	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/france-issues-a-tender-for-acquisition-of-24-new-maritime-surveillance-coastal-patrol-boats	2025-02-17T05:13:57-08:00

India Plans to Launch an International Tender in 2025 for 114 Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft	India is expected to issue a tender this year for acquiring 114 multi-role combat aircraft, according to two sources cited by Reuters. This initiative is part of a modernization effort for the Indian Air Force that dates back nearly two decades. The objective is to bolster a fleet currently reduced to 31 fighter squadrons, mainly composed of Russian or Soviet-origin aircraft, even as neighboring China rapidly expands its air capabilities and Pakistan also benefits from Chinese support. Analysts emphasize that India needs to fill its combat aircraft shortfall as quickly as possible, given that the approved operational requirement stands at 42 squadrons. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Illustration image: Gripen E jet fighter armed with IRIS-T and Meteor missiles. (Picture source: SAAB) Industry observers anticipate that several major manufacturers will compete for this contract, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing from the United States, Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation, France’s Dassault Aviation, Sweden’s Saab, as well as the European Eurofighter consortium. Each is preparing by developing supply chain plans, identifying local partners, and refining their proposals to offer aircraft equipped with cutting-edge technology while remaining cost-competitive. Although the Indian Air Force does not yet operate American-made fighter jets, some of its aircraft are already equipped with General Electric engines, and other aircraft using these engines are on order. Lockheed Martin’s willingness to offer the F-21, an evolution of the well-known F-16 adapted to India’s specific needs, illustrates foreign industry’s interest in this huge market. U.S. President Donald Trump has even expressed support for a long-term supply of F-35 fighters, but the Indian government has yet to initiate an official process. Russia, historically India’s main supplier of military equipment, also took advantage of Aero India 2025 to showcase the stealthy Su-57 and discuss the possibility of local production. The two countries had at one time considered a partnership to jointly develop this aircraft, then called the T-50, before terminating that project. With the war in Ukraine slowing down Russian supply chains, India is now seeking to diversify its sources while remaining open to industrial partnerships, provided they guarantee the maintenance and technology transfers necessary over the long term. Swedish manufacturer Saab also aims to position itself with its Gripen E, presented as a more economical solution in terms of both acquisition and maintenance costs. According to Kent-Åke Molin, who heads the Gripen campaign in India, Indian officials have reportedly shown considerable interest in this proposal, underscoring the strength of Saab’s manufacturing and local partnership plan. The current project for 114 multi-role aircraft continues an older program launched in 2007, which had planned the purchase of 126 aircraft. That effort was ultimately abandoned in 2015 when the Indian government opted for a direct purchase of 36 Rafales from Dassault Aviation. The French company, already present in India’s fleet, is obviously among the main contenders for this new phase of Air Force modernization. Experts estimate that an official request for proposals could be issued in the coming months, setting off intense competition among the aircraft manufacturers. India is focusing on industrial cooperation and technology transfer to develop its own production capabilities and reduce dependence on imports.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/india-plans-to-launch-an-international-tender-in-2025-for-114-multi-role-fighter-aircraft	2025-02-17T00:11:29-08:00

A key moment in this transformation occurred on October 20, 2024, when, according to information published by the U.S. Department of Defense, an F-35B Lightning II fighter jet from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Two Three (VX-23) successfully landed on JS Kaga’s deck off the coast of southern California. This marked the first time an F-35B operated from a Japanese vessel, validating the modifications made to the ship. The sea trials confirmed Kaga’s ability to operate the F-35B and paved the way for its integration into Japan’s naval doctrine. JS Kaga can now carry up to 12 F-35B fighter jets, significantly enhancing Japan’s air combat capabilities at sea. Japan has committed to acquiring 42 F-35B aircraft, with an initial purchase of eight aircraft in 2019 as part of a broader plan to modernize its defense forces. The F-35B is the STOVL variant of the F-35 Lightning II, designed for operations from amphibious assault ships and light aircraft carriers. It features stealth capabilities, advanced avionics, and the ability to conduct strike missions, electronic warfare, and intelligence gathering. As part of the Pacific Stellar 2025 naval exercise—running until February 18—JS Kaga is operating alongside the U.S. Navy Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group (VINCSG) and the French Carrier Strike Group (CSG) in a multi-national carrier task force. This exercise underscores Japan’s increasing role in regional security and power projection in the Indo-Pacific, especially amidst rising geopolitical tensions. The U.S. Navy Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group includes the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70), the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Princeton (CG 59), and the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Sterett (DDG 104) and USS William P. Lawrence (DDG 110). The French Carrier Strike Group is led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier FS Charles De Gaulle (R 91), escorted by air-defense destroyers and multi-mission frigates. The JMSDF contingent includes JS Kaga and the Akizuki-class destroyer JS Akizuki (DD 115). Logistics support is provided by the Henry J. Kaiser-class fleet replenishment oiler USNS Tippecanoe (T-AO 199) and the Lewis and Clark-class dry cargo and ammunition ship USNS Charles Drew (T-AKE 10). JS Kaga’s first operational mission as a light aircraft carrier signals a major shift in Japan’s defense posture. Previously, Japan maintained a self-imposed restriction on operating 'offensive' military assets in line with its post-World War II pacifist constitution. However, growing regional threats, including China’s expanding naval influence and North Korea’s missile advancements, have prompted Japan to reinterpret its defense strategy. The integration of JS Kaga with the Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group enhances interoperability between JMSDF and U.S. Navy carrier operations, improving Japan’s ability to respond to regional threats. By fielding F-35B-capable carriers, Japan extends its power projection beyond its home islands, reinforcing regional stability in the Indo-Pacific. Moreover, Japan’s participation alongside the French Carrier Strike Group highlights its growing role in international maritime security and its deepening defense partnerships with NATO allies. The successful deployment of JS Kaga as a light aircraft carrier in Pacific Stellar 2025 marks a transformational moment for JMSDF and Japan’s broader security policy. This development strengthens Japan’s deterrence posture, improves interoperability with allied naval forces, and enhances regional maritime security in the face of emerging challenges. As JS Kaga continues its carrier-based operations, its role in future multinational exercises and real-world contingencies will be closely watched by both allies and adversaries.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/japan-navys-js-kaga-conducts-first-operational-mission-as-light-aircraft-carrier-in-philippine-sea	2025-02-16T02:51:01-08:00

Its ability to operate with minimal emissions makes it less detectable by enemy forces, ensuring survivability on the battlefield. The Gravehawk Air Defense System is optimized for engaging low and medium-altitude threats in short-range engagements. Its primary function is to provide local air defense coverage, protecting military units, infrastructure, and urban centers from enemy missiles, drones, and aircraft. It specializes in short-range engagements, primarily targeting drones, cruise missiles, and helicopters at ranges of up to 30 km. Utilizing R-73 missiles, which are capable of reaching speeds of Mach 2.5, the system ensures fast interception of threats. Guided by passive infrared homing, it operates stealthily, unlike radar-based systems, which emit signals that can be detected and jammed by enemy forces. Its high mobility, thanks to the 8x8 military truck, allows for rapid repositioning based on evolving battlefield threats, while the ability to launch missiles remotely ensures that the operating crew remains at a safe distance from enemy fire. The Gravehawk system is housed within a standard ISO-sized shipping container, making it easy to transport and deploy. The launcher contains two R-73 missiles, stored and fired from inside the container, with integrated power systems providing electrical support for targeting and tracking operations. For mobility, the container is mounted on an 8x8 heavy military truck chassis, commonly referred to as a Drops vehicle. This configuration enables the system to traverse rough terrain, relocate quickly, and reposition as needed. Inside the Gravehawk Air Defense System's container are two R-73 (AA-11 Archer) missiles, originally designed as Soviet air-to-air weapons for fighter jets like the MiG-29. Now repurposed for ground-based defense, these missiles are operated by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. (Picture source: UK MoD) A high-resolution electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) camera is mounted on top of the container, which allows for real-time tracking of incoming threats. The system automatically detects and locks onto enemy drones or missiles, then relays precise targeting data to the missile guidance system. This passive tracking capability ensures that the system remains undetectable by enemy radar detection methods. The Gravehawk system repurposes R-73 air-to-air missiles, originally designed by the Soviet Union in the 1980s and given the NATO reporting name AA-11 Archer, for ground-based launch operations. The Vympel R-73 is a short-range air-to-air missile developed by the Russian company Vympel NPO, which entered service in 1984. It was designed to equip Soviet fighter jets, replacing older infrared-guided missiles such as the R-60 (AA-8 Aphid). The missile became the primary close-combat missile for Soviet and later Russian fighter aircraft, including the MiG-29, Su-27, and their derivatives. The missile features high agility and an advanced infrared seeker, making it capable of 'off-boresight' targeting, where it can lock onto targets even outside the aircraft’s direct line of sight. The missile measures 2.93 meters in length, with a diameter of 165 mm and a wingspan of 510 mm. It weighs 105 kg and carries a 7.4 kg high-explosive fragmentation warhead, guided by passive infrared homing. Its range extends up to 30 km, making it suitable for intercepting short-range threats at high speeds. The missile can reach Mach 2.5, enabling it to engage and destroy fast-moving enemy targets. The Gravehawk Mobile Air Defense System's targeting and tracking system features a high-resolution camera mounted on top of the container. It detects and identifies threats, then relays precise targeting data to the missile for engagement. (Picture source UK MoD) The Gravehawk system is operated remotely, with a five-person crew controlling the system from a portable unit located up to 50 meters away. This remote operation enhances survivability, allowing personnel to launch interceptors while remaining in a secure location. The deployment of the Gravehawk system significantly enhances Ukraine’s air defense network. While not a replacement for high-end SAM (Surface-to-Air Missile) systems like NASAMS or Patriot, it serves as an effective complementary layer in Ukraine’s multi-tiered air defense strategy, focusing on short-range interceptions against drones and cruise missiles. Its ability to reuse existing missile stockpiles reduces costs and ensures an efficient use of Ukraine’s military resources. By repurposing air-to-air missiles for ground-based launches, the Gravehawk system offers a cost-effective solution that does not require developing new interceptors. Unlike Western high-tech systems, which rely on expensive and complex missile platforms, Gravehawk can use Ukraine’s stockpiles of Soviet-era R-73 missiles, allowing for sustained operations without the need for continuous resupply. The containerized nature of the system allows rapid deployment, camouflage, and easy relocation after engagements, making it highly survivable and adaptable. Unlike traditional radar-guided SAM batteries, Gravehawk does not emit active radar signals, making it harder to detect and destroy by enemy electronic warfare systems. Russia has intensified its use of Shahed-136 drones and cruise missiles to target Ukraine’s infrastructure and military positions. The Gravehawk system provides a cost-effective and efficient solution to counter these threats, significantly reducing damage to cities, power plants, and military assets. Its rapid mobility and ability to neutralize incoming threats at short notice make it a crucial addition to Ukraine’s defense strategy. The Gravehawk Mobile Air Defense System represents a crucial advancement in Ukraine’s air defense capabilities, offering mobility, stealth, and cost-effectiveness. By adapting R-73 (AA-11 Archer) air-to-air missiles into a ground-based system, Ukraine is able to maximize its existing missile stockpiles while strengthening its defense against enemy drone and missile attacks.

Greece's new Sarisa II rocket-armed drone confirms combat readiness after three days of live-fire testing	The Greek company SAS Technology completed a three-day live-fire testing campaign for its Sarisa II (also known as SRS-2A) unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) at the Litochoro Firing Range from February 10 to 12, 2025. The tests were part of the certification process for the SRS-2A, confirming its capability to deploy both unguided and laser-guided 70mm (2.75-inch) rockets from Thales Belgium. The trials were conducted under the supervision of the Hellenic Ministry of National Defense, in collaboration with Thales Belgium and Hellenic Defense Systems (HDS), whose technical support contributed to the program.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The tests, which spread out over three days, were part of the certification process for the SRS-2A, confirming its capability to deploy both unguided and laser-guided 70mm (2.75-inch) rockets from Thales Belgium. (Picture source: SAS) On February 10, testing focused on the SRS-2A’s ability to launch unguided rockets while maintaining flight stability. The unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) fired a 70mm unguided rocket (UGR) while hovering, demonstrating control under the effects of rocket jet blast. The rocket followed a predictable trajectory, confirming the functionality of optical sighting methods. On February 11, the Sarisa II/SRS-2A was tested with the FZ275 laser-guided rocket (LGR) from Thales. The UCAV launched the rocket at a 5×5-meter target with a central 2×2-meter section. The impact was recorded with a deviation of 0.2 meters, confirming a circular error probable (CEP) of less than one meter. Due to range constraints and Weapon Danger Area (WDA) limitations, the test was conducted at 1,700 meters, close to the weapon’s minimum operational range. The FZ275 LGR is designed for engagement distances between 3 and 5 kilometers, with a maximum reach of 7 kilometers. The test conditions required launching the rocket at close range, where it reached supersonic speeds and deployed its guidance fins after 400 meters. The SRS-2A’s autonomous flight control system executed the firing sequence without manual operator input. On February 12, a live demonstration was held in the presence of military officials and personnel from the Hellenic Army, Navy, Air Force, and Special Forces, as well as international delegations. The SRS-2A launched a laser-guided FZ275 LGR rocket from an altitude of 450 meters above sea level, maintaining stability and achieving a CEP of less than one meter. Additionally, the Hellenic Special Forces' UCAV Empusa EMPX6T performed precision grenade drops using both training and live grenades in sequential and simultaneous release modes. The planned release of the AIHMI loitering munition from the SRS-2A was canceled due to low cloud cover. The FZ275 LGR, developed by Thales Belgium, is a semi-active laser (SAL) guided rocket designed to bridge the gap between unguided rockets and long-range missiles. It offers targeting precision while reducing collateral damage. The rocket has a range of 1,500 to 7,000 meters, with a CEP of less than one meter at 6 kilometers. It can engage ground vehicles, air defense installations, radar sites, communication infrastructure, aircraft on the ground, small ships and patrol boats, soft bunkers, and snipers. The FZ275 LGR is compatible with standard 2.75-inch rocket launchers and requires minimal integration work. It has various warhead configurations, including a high-explosive variant with a lethal radius of 9 meters and penetration capability against 6mm steel plates. The FZ275 LGR features semi-active laser guidance technology with Lock-On Before Launch (LOBL) and Lock-On After Launch (LOAL) capabilities.

The rocket can be fired from any standard FZ rocket launcher, and Thales Belgium has developed smart rocket launchers, including the FZ606 for helicopters and the FZ800 for aircraft, which enable bidirectional communication and in-flight laser code implementation.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/greeces-new-sarisa-ii-rocket-armed-drone-confirms-combat-readiness-after-three-days-of-live-fire-testing	2025-02-15T23:06:30-08:00	
US Army starts to test the M10 Booker fire support vehicle for future deployment in the Arctic	As reported by Peter George, the Booker Combat Vehicle Product Manager, on February 15, 2025, the U.S. Army is conducting extreme cold weather testing on the M10 Booker combat vehicle at Fort Greely, Alaska. This testing could be seen as part of the US Department of Defense’s Arctic Strategy to assess operational effectiveness in sub-zero conditions. The results will inform decisions on full-rate production and deployment, ensuring the vehicle's performance in harsh environments where temperatures can drop below -50°C.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The M10 Booker is powered by an MTU 8V199 TE23 diesel engine producing 800 horsepower, marking the first use of an English MTU serial production engine in a U.S. Army land system in over four decades. (Picture source: Peter George) The U.S. Army is expanding Arctic operations to improve readiness in extreme environments. As part of this effort, training exercises such as Arctic Forge 25 are increasing, with additional forces deployed to key locations. Arctic Forge 25 will involve 330 U.S. Soldiers from the 11th Airborne Division and the 10th Mountain Division, 40 Canadian troops, and 500 Finnish personnel. Additionally, 110 Soldiers from the 41st Field Artillery Brigade will deploy to Norway to test long-range precision fires in Arctic conditions. The U.S. Army's efforts align with the broader goal of ensuring force interoperability and operational effectiveness in joint military exercises with NATO partners. The Arctic region is strategically significant due to geopolitical competition and environmental changes. Russia has expanded its military presence by reopening Soviet-era bases, while China has declared itself a 'near-Arctic state' and increased activities in the region. Melting ice is opening new maritime routes, increasing the necessity for military presence. The region’s extreme temperatures, low precipitation, and widespread permafrost create operational challenges requiring specialized equipment and training. The U.S. military's emphasis on Arctic operations also supports homeland defense by reinforcing early warning systems and rapid response capabilities against potential threats in the northern hemisphere. The M10 Booker provides direct fire support for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) against fortified positions and light armored threats. Despite a weight of 38 to 42 tonnes, it is classified by the US Army as an armored infantry support vehicle or an assault gun, not as a light tank, because it lacks the armor and firepower necessary for direct engagement with enemy main battle tanks. However, the M10 Booker is not designed to be airdropped due to its weight and structural configuration, requiring transport by aircraft such as the C-17 Globemaster III. The Army plans to field 14 M10 Bookers per IBCT, with the 82nd Airborne Division receiving the first units by late FY2025. The vehicle's integration into IBCTs aims to improve combined arms maneuver capabilities, allowing infantry units to operate with increased lethality and survivability. The U.S. Army has lacked a modern, lightweight, heavily armed vehicle since the retirement of the M551 Sheridan in 1997. Attempts to address this gap, such as the Stryker Mobile Gun System, faced technical challenges and were eventually phased out. The M10 Booker was selected in June 2022 under the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) program. The first production units were delivered in February 2024, with plans to acquire up to 504 units under a contract valued at up to $1.14 billion, and to date, each M10 Booker is estimated to cost approximately $13.95 million. The Army envisions the M10 Booker and its crew of four as a key component in its shift from brigade-centric to division-centric operations, where armored firepower will play a more significant role in large-scale combat operations. The M10 Booker is powered by an MTU 8V199 TE23 diesel engine producing 800 horsepower. This marks the first use of an MTU serial production engine in a U.S. Army land system in over four decades. The engine is integrated into the PowerPack system, which includes transmission, cooling, and filtration components, supporting performance in diverse terrains, including Arctic conditions. Rolls-Royce's efforts to enhance the power output of this engine align with broader modernization initiatives to improve the performance of tracked combat vehicles within the Army's fleet. The M10 Booker is equipped with a 105mm M35 tank gun, a 12.7mm M2HB heavy machine gun, and a 7.62mm M240B machine gun. Compared to the M2 Bradley, the M10 Booker is optimized for infantry support thanks to a greater direct-fire capability, but the Bradley is better suited for mechanized infantry operations due to its troop-carrying capacity and missile armament. The Booker has a maximum speed of 64 km/h, an operational range of up to 560 km, and modular armor for protection. The vehicle features an advanced fire control system derived from the M1A2 Abrams for targeting accuracy. It also incorporates a hydropneumatic suspension system and advanced optics, including Safran Optics 1's PASEO Commander's Independent Tactical Viewer (CITV), to enhance situational awareness and targeting in varied combat environments. Additionally, the M10 Booker’s design leverages lessons learned from past vehicle development programs, ensuring it meets current operational requirements while maintaining future upgrade potential.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-army-starts-to-test-the-m10-booker-fire-support-vehicle-for-future-deployment-in-the-arctic	2025-02-15T07:36:59-08:00	
US Army confirms Precision Strike Missile's capability to engage enemy ballistic missiles	On February 12, 2025, the U.S. Army conducted a flight test at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, involving two Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) Increment 1 engagements. Fired from an M142 HIMARS, both missiles followed their intended trajectories and engaged multiple targets, including a surrogate Scud ballistic missile, radar installations, and rotary-wing platforms. Lockheed Martin stated that this was a step toward full-rate production, following previous test flights in November and the first soldier-led test in December 2024.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Measuring approximately 4 meters in length and 430 millimeters in diameter, the PrSM's design enables two missiles per launch pod, doubling the payload of M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 HIMARS. (Picture source: US Army) Initially developed under the Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) program, the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) is the U.S. Army's next-generation, surface-to-surface missile, replacing the older MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). Measuring approximately 4 meters in length and 430 millimeters in diameter, the PrSM's design enables two missiles per launch pod, doubling the payload of M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 HIMARS launchers when compared to the single-missile ATACMS pods. Featuring a solid-propellant rocket motor, this new short-range ballistic missile employs an inertial navigation system (INS) with GPS guidance. Its pre-formed tungsten fragmentation warhead is suited for a variety of high-value targets, including air defense systems, missile launchers, command and control centers, and troop assembly areas. Additionally, the PrSM features an open-systems architecture, allowing for modular upgrades and future modifications. Development of the PrSM began in March 2016, with Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon competing for the contract. By early 2020, Boeing and Raytheon had withdrawn from the competition, leaving Lockheed Martin as the sole developer. The US Army received the first batch of PrSM missiles on December 8, 2023. Subsequent tests in June 2024 included the sinking of the decommissioned Austin-class amphibious transport dock USS Cleveland in the North Pacific Ocean’s Mariana Island Range Complex, marking the first recorded use of the PrSM against a moving target. Moreover, a recently awarded contract, valued at up to $120 million, will support tooling efforts to increase production capacity to 400 missiles per year. The Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) was originally constrained by the 500 km range limitation imposed by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. However, the U.S. withdrawal from the treaty in 2019 enabled the development of extended-range variants. The PrSM Increment 1, for instance, has an official range exceeding 500 km, while future increments are expected to enhance target acquisition and engagement with a new multi-mode seeker. This technology, expected to be integrated into PrSM Increment 2, will enable the missile to track and strike moving targets on both land and sea. Increment 2, also referred to as the Land-Based Anti-Ship Missile (LBASM), is being developed in collaboration with Australia, which signed a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Army in July 2021. Australia has committed to acquiring PrSM Increments 3 and 4, expanding its long-range strike capabilities. Increment 3 is expected to introduce enhanced warhead configurations for increased effectiveness against hardened targets, while Increment 4 will focus on propulsion and aerodynamic refinements to extend the missile’s range beyond 1,000 km, doubling the range of existing systems. Additionally, the US Army is considering a fifth iteration of the PrSM that could be compatible with autonomous launch platforms such as the Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher (AML), an unmanned variant of the M142 HIMARS. Brigadier General Rory Crooks, leading the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross-Functional Team, has stated that this effort remains in the science and technology phase, exploring potential designs for integration with unmanned ground vehicles.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-army-confirms-precision-strike-missiles-capability-to-engage-enemy-ballistic-missiles	2025-02-15T05:41:09-08:00

Could the future Leclerc Evolution tank succeed without financial support from France?	As reported by Opex360 on February 13, 2025, KNDS France is requesting support from the French Ministry of the Armed Forces for the development and potential export of the Leclerc Evolution main battle tank. This request follows Germany’s initiation of studies for the Leopard 3, an interim solution before the introduction of the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS). KNDS France presented the Leclerc Evolution at Eurosatory 2024, highlighting its modular turret and armament configurations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Leclerc Evolution is armed with the Ascalon system, initially configured with a 120mm gun but designed for retrofitting with a 140mm caliber. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) program, initiated in 2017, is a Franco-German project designed to replace the Leopard 2 and Leclerc tanks by 2040 with an integrated network of crewed and uncrewed platforms. The program is developed by KNDS, a consortium of France’s Nexter and Germany’s Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, alongside Rheinmetall, and focuses on modularity, firepower, protection, and AI-assisted battlefield management. Disagreements remain on key technical aspects, particularly regarding the main armament, with France supporting the Ascalon gun, available in 120mm and 140mm calibers, and Germany favoring a 130mm alternative from Rheinmetall. Belgium, along with Italy and Spain, has shown interest in joining the program. Germany is financing the Leopard 3 as an interim solution while awaiting the MGCS, with the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology, and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) assigning research tasks to KNDS Deutschland, Rheinmetall, and Hensoldt. The Leopard 3 is expected to be introduced within five years, allowing Germany to maintain its main battle tank fleet. In contrast, France has not adopted a similar strategy and will continue operating 200 Leclerc XLR tanks with limited modernization until the more modern MGCS is introduced. However, as the Leopard 3 is expected to fire 130mm ammunition, some people think that it could influence future MGCS armament decisions. During a hearing at the French National Assembly on February 12, Alexandre Dupuy, Director of Systems at KNDS France, stated that the Leopard 3 does not conflict with MGCS, as MGCS is designed as a 'system of systems' integrating multiple platforms. He described the Leopard 3 as another standard within the Leopard series rather than a new platform. Dupuy estimated that MGCS deliveries will take place over an extended period and that the full fleet will not be immediately available, meaning that new tank acquisitions by European countries today do not preclude their participation in MGCS through the 2050s. He also stated that continued investment in French armored vehicle technology is necessary. Additionally, in this same hearing, he also announced that Belgium has received its first Griffon armored vehicle under the CaMo (Capacité Motorisée) program, as well as the Irish interest in armored vehicles from the Scorpion program. Therefore, KNDS France is seeking collaboration with the French Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) to advance the Leclerc Evolution, which was presented at Eurosatory 2024 as a next-generation main battle tank. The company is positioning the tank for potential export, citing restrictions in certain regions on German-manufactured defense equipment as a possible market opportunity. However, Dupuy noted that securing an order from the French Army would be critical to establishing the Leclerc Evolution in the international market. He added that financial backing is necessary to complete the tank’s development. The Leclerc Evolution is armed with the Ascalon system, initially configured with a 120mm gun but designed for retrofitting with a 140mm caliber. The modular turret can switch calibers in under an hour. The Ascalon system includes an autoloader with a 22-round capacity and a recoil management system to support stability. The gun is designed for extended barrel lifespan and reduced maintenance requirements. KNDS France has tested the Ascalon system in 120mm and 140mm configurations, with further evaluations planned in a fully integrated turret. The Leclerc Evolution is configured for a four-person crew, with a deputy commander in the chassis responsible for managing sensor and effector systems. It is equipped with the ARX 30 remote-controlled weapon station for counter-UAV operations and a loitering ammunition launcher with three intermediate-range munitions. The tank’s survivability is supported by a modular armor system, the Galix close protection system, an Active Protection System (APS), and a CBRN filtration system. The vehicle is powered by a 1,500 hp engine, reaching speeds of up to 68 km/h with an operational range of 470 kilometers.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/could-the-future-leclerc-evolution-tank-succeed-without-financial-support-from-france	2025-02-14T03:46:42-08:00	
French Army Shows Growing Interest in Locally Produced MALE Drone Aarok	The French Army is closely following the development of the Aarok MALE drone, designed by Turgis &amp; Gaillard, a project that attracted attention when it was unveiled at the 2023 edition of the Paris Air and Space Show at Le Bourget. Initially, this drone piqued the interest of the French Air and Space Force, particularly General Stéphane Mille, then Chief of Staff of the French Air Force, who expressed curiosity about its ability to transition from the design phase to the first flight tests. He even mentioned being willing to fund the trials if the resources were available. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Since its unveiling, the Aarok has been the subject of a memorandum of understanding with the Ukrainian manufacturer Antonov, aimed at developing a lighter and more 'consumable' version of the drone. (Picture source: Aarok) Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu also highlighted the 'very interesting' nature of the project. He mentioned the possibility of including the Aarok in the 2024-2030 military programming, specifying that the work done with Turgis &amp; Gaillard was of good quality and conducted in collaboration with the ministry's services. The Military Programming Law (LPM), which provides 5 billion euros for drone research, allowed Lecornu to indicate that this budget would enable the exploration of various concepts, including that of the Aarok drone. Since its unveiling, the Aarok has been the subject of a memorandum of understanding with the Ukrainian manufacturer Antonov, aimed at developing a lighter and more 'consumable' version of the drone. It has also begun ground tests and was selected by the Directorate of Aeronautical Maintenance (DMAé) to test the concept of a 'certifiable but non-certified' drone, which aims to reduce the normative requirements for the certification of an aircraft. While the MALE drone segment primarily falls under the French Air and Space Force's responsibility, the French Army has not hidden its interest in this system, especially due to its features suited for surveillance and intervention missions. General Bruno Baratz, head of the Future Combat Command (CCF) of the French Army, expressed interest in the Aarok following a visit to Turgis &amp; Gaillard’s facilities. According to him, the Aarok could provide a 'simple, rugged, and affordable' means of surveillance and intervention, particularly suitable for the Army’s needs. Additionally, its 'decidedly multi-domain' design makes it a potential asset for land forces. General Baratz added that the French Army would closely monitor the development of this project, emphasizing the importance of a close collaboration between industry and the military, and highlighting the strength of the French defense industry in this field. The Aarok, which weighs 5.5 tons, is designed to have an endurance of over 24 hours, thanks to a 1,200-horsepower turboprop engine. It is equipped with a large optronic sensor, an electromagnetic payload, and a multimode radar. The drone can carry up to 1.5 tons of munitions and can be deployed on rough terrain, a feature of particular interest to the French Army. Additionally, its cost is estimated between 5 and 10 million euros, and it is designed without any American-origin components, making it 'ITAR Free' (free from U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations constraints). The possibility of the French Army purchasing the Aarok remains open. During debates on the 2025 finance bill, Minister Lecornu mentioned the possibility of using budget savings related to delays in the European MALE drone project, Eurodrone, to finance the acquisition of drones that could accelerate the 'droneification' of the French military. Therefore, although the acquisition of the Aarok drone has not yet been confirmed, it is not excluded that the French Army may consider acquiring it in the near future.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/french-army-shows-growing-interest-in-locally-produced-male-drone-aarok	2025-02-14T03:11:41-08:00	
Lithuanian Army Conscripts Boost Artillery Firepower with First PzH 2000 Howitzer Training	On February 11, 2025, the Lithuanian Ministry of Defense announced a significant milestone: conscripts of the Lithuanian Army conducted live-fire exercises with the PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzers for the first time. This development marks a pivotal step in strengthening Lithuania's defense capabilities and preparing the next generation of artillery crews. The training of conscripts on these advanced artillery systems is part of a broader effort to modernize Lithuania’s armed forces, ensuring that the country remains prepared for any emerging threats in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Lithuanian Army conscripts stand in front of a PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzer during training exercises, marking their first live-fire drills with the advanced artillery system. (Picture source: Lithuania MoD) Lithuania's acquisition of the German-made PzH 2000 155mm tracked self-propelled howitzers dates back to September 2015, when the Ministry of National Defense signed a contract with the German Armed Forces to procure 21 of these advanced 155mm self-propelled howitzers. Of these, 16 were designated for combat purposes, two for training in firing and driving, and three were allocated for spare parts. The contract also included 26 M577 V2 armored command vehicles and six BPZ2 recovery tanks, all previously utilized by the German military. As part of Lithuania's artillery modernization efforts, the first upgraded PzH 2000 units were delivered to the General Romualdas Giedraitis Artillery Battalion in December 2018. These enhancements improved the fire control software, battlefield management systems, and increased the howitzers' overall efficiency. The PzH 2000 is renowned for its advanced artillery capabilities, boasting a firing range of up to 40 kilometers with standard ammunition, and even greater distances with specialized rounds. Its rapid-fire capability and precision make it a formidable asset on the modern battlefield. The system can fire multiple rounds in quick succession, enabling coordinated strikes on enemy positions, which is a key advantage in counter-artillery warfare. Lithuania's continued investment in these systems ensures that its military remains equipped with cutting-edge technology. Integrating the PzH 2000 howitzers into Lithuania's military arsenal significantly enhances the nation's artillery capabilities, which is particularly important given the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict. The war has underscored the critical role of advanced artillery systems in modern warfare, with artillery being central to Russia's military strategy. This has highlighted the need for Western forces, including NATO allies, to understand and counter such capabilities properly. Recognizing this, Lithuania has taken decisive steps to strengthen its firepower, particularly in long-range precision strikes. Beyond the PzH 2000, Lithuania has further expanded its artillery strength by joining the French CAESAR Mark II program. In December 2022, Lithuania signed a contract for 18 CAESAR NG self-propelled howitzers, with deliveries expected by 2027. These highly mobile systems will complement the PzH 2000 fleet, providing Lithuania with increased operational flexibility. The addition of the CAESAR NG demonstrates Lithuania’s long-term commitment to improving its indirect fire capabilities and modernizing its artillery forces. Lithuania's commitment to defense modernization extends beyond its artillery forces. In 2024, the country increased its defense budget to €2.3 billion, representing approximately 3.03% of its GDP, one of the highest defense expenditures among NATO allies. This financial commitment reflects the growing emphasis on military readiness, procurement of modern equipment, and strengthening Lithuania’s overall defense infrastructure. The funds are being allocated toward acquiring advanced weapon systems, enhancing troop training programs, and reinforcing Lithuania’s border security in response to heightened regional tensions. By equipping its forces with the PzH 2000 howitzers and ensuring that conscripts are proficient in its operation, Lithuania is bolstering its defense posture. This initiative not only strengthens national security but also contributes to the broader stability of the Baltic region, serving as a deterrent against potential aggressors. The training of new artillery crews with the PzH 2000 reinforces the preparedness of Lithuania’s armed forces, ensuring that they can effectively operate and maintain these systems in a conflict scenario. The recent live-fire exercises represent a culmination of years of strategic planning and investment in defense infrastructure. As regional tensions persist, Lithuania's commitment to enhancing its military capabilities underscores its dedication to national defense and its role within the NATO alliance. By strengthening its artillery, increasing its defense budget, and investing in long-term modernization programs, Lithuania continues to demonstrate its resolve to safeguard its sovereignty and contribute to the region's collective security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/lithuanian-army-conscripts-boost-artillery-firepower-with-pzh-2000-howitzer-training	2025-02-14T03:02:15-08:00	
Russian Navy to deploy more Admiral Gorshkov frigates as Severnaya Verf shipyard confirms new orders	As reported by La souris on February 13, 2025, Russian shipbuilder Severnaya Verf recently released its annual financial report, confirming plans to secure contracts for additional frigates. The report details the construction of four new Project 22350 frigates, known as the Admiral Gorshkov class, with hull numbers 929 to 932, along with the continuation of the Project 22350M program, referred to as Super Gorshkov.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Admiral Gorshkov was laid down in 2006 and commissioned in 2018 after delays caused by disruptions in the supply of propulsion systems, primarily due to the termination of deliveries from Ukraine. (Picture source: Russian social media) In recent years, Severnaya Verf has expanded its slipway capacity and modernized its assembly processes to accommodate larger hulls and increase production efficiency for both the Project 22350 and the larger Project 22350M frigates. These enhancements include constructing a new slipway to assemble multiple ships simultaneously and upgrading welding and outfitting facilities to accelerate completion times. The Project 22350, known as the Admiral Gorshkov-class, is a series of guided missile frigates developed by the Severnoye Design Bureau and constructed at Severnaya Verf. The program was initiated in the early 2000s as part of Russia’s naval modernization strategy. The lead ship, Admiral Gorshkov, was laid down in 2006 and commissioned in 2018 after delays caused by disruptions in the supply of propulsion systems, primarily due to the termination of deliveries from Ukraine's Zorya-Mashproekt following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. This led to the necessity of developing domestic alternatives, which resulted in prolonged testing and integration challenges. The program has continued with seven hulls currently under construction and four additional units planned, bringing the total number of planned ships in the class to 12. Compared to Soviet-era frigates, this class features a reduced radar cross-section due to a redesigned superstructure and composite materials, along with an integrated combat system that enhances target acquisition, tracking, and fire control across multiple domains. Currently, three ships (Admiral Gorshkov, Admiral Kasatonov, and Admiral Golovko) are in service, and the four newly announced frigates (hulls 929 to 932) may be named after notable Russian naval figures, following existing class naming conventions. Potential names include Admiral Vysotsky, Admiral Kuroyedov, Admiral Komoyedov, and Admiral Evtukhin. The frigates from the Admiral Gorshkov-class have a full displacement of 5,400 tons and a length of 135 meters. They are powered by a combined diesel and gas (CODAG) propulsion system with two M90FR gas turbines and two 10D49 diesel engines, producing a combined output of 65,400 shp. This allows a top speed of 29.5 knots and an operational endurance of 30 days. The frigates are fitted with the Poliment-Redut air defense system, featuring 32 vertical launch system (VLS) cells capable of deploying 9M96, 9M96M, 9M96D/9M96DM(M2), and 9M100 surface-to-air missiles. Their offensive systems include either 16 or 32 (depending on variant) 3S14 VLS cells for Kalibr, Oniks, Zircon, or Otvet anti-submarine missiles. Additional weaponry includes a 130mm A-192M naval gun, Paket-NK anti-submarine torpedo launchers, and the Otvet anti-submarine missile system. Electronic warfare and radar systems comprise the 5P-27 Furke-4 air search radar, the 5P-20K Poliment AESA radar, and the Zarya-M sonar system for submarine detection. The ships are also equipped with Prosvet-M and Filin electro-optical suppression devices. Finally, a Kamov Ka-27 helicopter supports anti-submarine warfare operations. Nicknamed 'Super Gorshkov', the Project 22350M frigate brings three key improvements over its predecessor: increased firepower, extended operational range, and enhanced survivability. (Picture source: Russian social media) Nicknamed 'Super Gorshkov', the Project 22350M frigate is an upgraded variant of the Admiral Gorshkov-class, bringing three key improvements over its predecessor: increased firepower, extended operational range, and enhanced survivability. The Severnoye Design Bureau completed the outline design in 2019, and a final proposal was submitted for approval in 2023. The updated design includes an increased displacement of approximately 7,600 tons and expanded weapons capacity. Production of the first unit is planned to begin in 2025 following the completion of a new slipway at Severnaya Verf. The Project 22350M frigates will feature an upgraded propulsion system, replacing the CODAG configuration with a more powerful combined gas turbine and gas turbine (COGAG) setup using four M90FR gas turbines to achieve higher sustained speeds. The ships will integrate the Sigma-22350M combat management system, improving real-time target processing and coordination of multi-domain operations. Their electronic warfare suite will include Prosvet-M and additional countermeasure systems to enhance survivability against advanced threats. Their air defense systems will be enhanced with 64 Poliment-Redut VLS cells, enabling them to deploy 9M96 and 40N6E missiles with ranges of up to 400 kilometers. The offensive missile capacity will also be increased, with up to 64 3S14 VLS cells for Kalibr, Oniks, or Zircon cruise missiles. The Project 22350M frigates will feature an upgraded sonar suite, including the Minotavr-M sonar system for improved submarine detection and tracking. The anti-submarine warfare capability will be enhanced with additional Paket-NK torpedo launchers and the integration of advanced Otvet anti-submarine missile systems, increasing effectiveness against underwater threats at greater ranges. With a range exceeding 7,000 nautical miles, the Project 22350M frigates will support extended operations without frequent resupply. The class will accommodate up to two Ka-27 helicopters or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to improve reconnaissance, anti-submarine warfare, and targeting capabilities. The sensor suite will include an upgraded AESA radar, potentially the Poliment-Redut system with improved long-range target detection, along with advanced electronic warfare capabilities, further reinforcing Russia’s ability to conduct sustained blue-water operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/russian-navy-to-deploy-more-admiral-gorshkov-frigates-as-severnaya-verf-shipyard-confirms-new-orders	2025-02-14T02:05:30-08:00	
US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth Prioritizes China’s Indo-Pacific Threat and America’s Response	During the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting held in Brussels on February 12, 2025, U.S. Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, delivered a stark assessment of global security dynamics, underlining the emerging and consequential threats facing the United States. As the world navigates the complexities of military conflicts, particularly in Europe, Hegseth highlighted that the U.S. must not lose sight of the growing challenge posed by China. His remarks underscored the centrality of the Indo-Pacific region, where China’s military rise has become an existential concern for the United States and its allies.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The guided-missile submarine USS Ohio has arrived at Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Japan, for a routine port visit, marking the start of a one-year deployment to the U.S. 7th Fleet. Homeported at Naval Base Kitsap, Bangor, Washington, USS Ohio operates under Commander Submarine Group 7, reinforcing U.S. naval presence and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The Indo-Pacific has become a primary theater of military competition between the U.S. and China, with Beijing rapidly enhancing its military capabilities. China’s expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea, coupled with its modernization of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), pose direct challenges to regional stability. The Chinese military has become increasingly adept in the domains of anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD), cyber warfare, and space operations, all of which are crucial to Beijing’s strategy of preventing U.S. intervention in the region. China’s growing naval power, particularly its fleet of advanced warships and submarines, is seen as a direct counter to U.S. military supremacy in the Pacific. The recent commissioning of aircraft carriers such as the Shandong and Fujian signifies China's intent to establish a more robust and capable naval force capable of contesting U.S. forces in critical waters like the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. Moreover, China’s missile forces, including advanced hypersonic weapons and long-range precision-guided missiles, are designed to hold U.S. assets at risk, complicating efforts to project power in the region. China’s anti-ship missile systems, such as the DF-21D and DF-26, are specifically tailored to target U.S. aircraft carriers and other large surface vessels, which remain cornerstone platforms for American naval power projection. These capabilities are complemented by China’s cyberwarfare and information operations designed to disrupt communications, targeting, and command-and-control functions, further eroding the U.S. military’s technological advantages. Secretary Hegseth’s remarks signal that the U.S. is pivoting towards a more focused strategy in the Indo-Pacific, emphasizing deterrence to prevent conflict with China while maintaining a credible military presence in the region. The concept of strategic deterrence has evolved as the U.S. recognizes the need for a balance between preventing Chinese aggression and avoiding direct military confrontation. As of 2025, the U.S. military maintains a robust and forward-deployed presence in the Indo-Pacific, managed by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) headquartered in Hawaii. The U.S. has positioned over 300,000 military personnel across key locations to ensure deterrence and rapid response capabilities. In Japan, around 54,000 U.S. troops are stationed, including the 7th Fleet at Yokosuka Naval Base, Marine units in Okinawa, and air assets at Kadena Air Base. South Korea hosts approximately 28,500 U.S. troops, primarily at Camp Humphreys, which remains the largest U.S. overseas military base, ensuring regional security while countering Chinese influence. Guam continues to serve as a strategic hub, with Andersen Air Force Base and Naval Base Guam playing critical roles in power projection and bomber deployments. In response to China's growing assertiveness, the U.S. has strengthened its military cooperation with the Philippines under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), granting access to additional bases and bolstering joint military exercises. In Australia, the rotational presence of U.S. Marines in Darwin has expanded, with joint exercises becoming more frequent under the AUKUS security pact. Additionally, the U.S., Australia, and Japan have announced annual joint military exercises aimed at countering regional threats and reinforcing deterrence. Recent developments have further reinforced the U.S. commitment to military preparedness in the region. In April 2024, the U.S. Army deployed the Typhon missile system to the Philippines as part of joint military exercises, enhancing long-range strike capabilities against potential adversaries in the South China Sea. The U.S. Air Force is also set to conduct the REFORPAC exercise in mid-2025, involving nearly 300 aircraft across 25 locations, enhancing readiness and interoperability among allied forces. Despite its clear prioritization of the Indo-Pacific, the U.S. military faces significant resourcing challenges. As Hegseth noted, the reality of resource scarcity means the U.S. must make strategic tradeoffs in its defense planning. This involves balancing commitments to ongoing military operations in Ukraine and Europe with the imperative of preparing for potential conflicts in the Pacific. The integration of advanced technologies such as autonomous systems, artificial intelligence (AI), and quantum computing is becoming increasingly critical to countering China’s military advancements and maintaining a technological edge. The U.S. is increasingly turning to multi-domain operations, where forces are trained to operate across land, sea, air, cyber, and space to ensure a credible deterrence. One key area of focus is the development and deployment of long-range strike capabilities that could target Chinese missile sites and critical infrastructure if necessary, minimizing the need for direct military engagement while maintaining a strong deterrent posture. The B-21 Raider, the U.S. Air Force’s next-generation stealth bomber, is one such platform that will enhance U.S. deterrence by allowing for long-range, precision strikes deep within contested areas. Furthermore, the U.S. is emphasizing the integration of partner nations’ forces into deterrence and response plans. The presence of U.S. forces in countries such as the Philippines, Japan, and Australia serves as a tripwire against Chinese aggression, and the strengthening of regional security alliances will be pivotal in maintaining peace through strength. China’s military ambitions extend beyond simply securing regional supremacy in the Indo-Pacific. Beijing’s global aspirations, particularly its efforts to build a network of strategic partnerships through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its push for military bases in regions such as Africa and the South Pacific, reflect its desire for global influence. The United States views these ambitions with concern, as they could potentially extend China's reach and threaten U.S. interests worldwide. Tensions remain high over Taiwan, where China has consistently signaled its intent to reclaim the island, either through coercion or military action. The U.S. has long adhered to a policy of strategic ambiguity regarding Taiwan, maintaining a commitment to defend Taiwan while stopping short of promising direct military intervention. However, this balance is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain as China's military modernization progresses, with Beijing developing the capability to launch a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. Such a development would not only destabilize the region but would also test the U.S. commitment to its Taiwan Relations Act. The United States' military strategy in the Indo-Pacific is focused on ensuring that China’s ambitions are contained and deterred. While the U.S. must balance multiple threats globally, Hegseth’s statements emphasize that the Indo-Pacific will remain the central focus of U.S. defense priorities in the coming years. Strengthening military alliances, modernizing defense capabilities, and investing in advanced technologies are key to maintaining a credible deterrent against China’s increasingly capable military forces. China's growing military might poses a direct threat to regional stability and global security, but the U.S. remains committed to securing peace in the Indo-Pacific by leveraging its technological, military, and diplomatic advantages. The next decade will be critical in determining whether the U.S. can effectively deter China’s ambitions while preventing a broader regional conflict.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-secretary-of-defense-pete-hegseth-prioritizes-chinas-indo-pacific-threat-and-americas-response	2025-02-14T01:58:13-08:00	
US proposes the F-35 fighter jet to India despite current restrictions on Türkiye	As reported by Reuters on February 14, 2025, the United States has announced plans to increase military sales to India, with newly re-elected President Donald Trump stating that the deal could eventually include F-35 fighter jets. Indian officials clarified that no formal procurement process has begun, and the U.S. offer is still under discussion. The announcement follows India’s ongoing efforts to expand its defense procurement from multiple sources while maintaining its long-standing relationship with Russia.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The proposal is surprising given that Türkiye remains blocked from purchasing the US-made F-35 fighter jet due to its acquisition of Russia’s S-400 air defense system, which India has also procured. (Picture source: US Air Force) Following Trump’s statement, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri confirmed that no acquisition process has been initiated. Misri emphasized that India follows a structured procurement process, requiring proposals from manufacturers and evaluations before any decision is made. Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of the F-35, confirmed that any sale would take place at a government-to-government level, with the Pentagon acting as an intermediary. Since 2008, India has purchased over $20 billion in U.S. defense equipment, including a recent acquisition of 31 MQ-9B SeaGuardian and SkyGuardian drones after negotiations lasting over six years. The U.S. Congressional Research Service estimates that India is projected to spend more than $200 billion on military modernization over the next decade. The proposal is surprising given that Türkiye remains blocked from purchasing the F-35 due to its acquisition of Russia’s S-400 air defense system, which India has also procured. Türkiye was removed from the F-35 program in 2019 after purchasing the S-400, as the U.S. raised concerns that the system could expose sensitive technological data on the aircraft’s stealth capabilities. Despite India also acquiring the S-400, the U.S. has not imposed similar restrictions on New Delhi, likely due to broader geopolitical considerations. Additionally, Russia has recently proposed manufacturing the Sukhoi Su-57 stealth fighter in India in the hope of reinforcing its longstanding defense ties with New Delhi. Under President Trump's renewed administration, the United States is focusing on recalibrating its relationship with India, which is viewed as a key strategic partner to counter China's military presence in the Indo-Pacific. Recent discussions between President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have led to an agreement to initiate trade negotiations aimed at resolving tariff disputes and doubling bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. The U.S. has expressed concerns over India's high tariffs on American goods, with President Trump emphasizing the need for 'fairness and reciprocity' in trade practices. In response, India has shown willingness to reduce certain tariffs and increase imports of U.S. products, including oil, gas, and military equipment. Additionally, both nations are exploring avenues to strengthen defense cooperation and reinforce their commitment to the Quad alliance to counterbalance China's influence. Despite these collaborative efforts, challenges will likely persist, particularly regarding trade deficits, the Make-In-India defense program, and immigration policies, as the U.S. continues to advocate for balanced trade and the repatriation of undocumented Indian nationals. As of February 2025, the Indian Air Force (IAF) operates a fleet of combat aircraft from multiple origins, including France, India, Russia, and the former Soviet Union. The multirole fighter fleet includes 36 Dassault Rafales, 31 HAL Tejas Mk.1s, and 259 Sukhoi Su-30MKIs, with 12 additional Su-30MKIs on order. The IAF also fields 52 Mikoyan MiG-29s, including 12 MiG-29UPGs, and 47 Dassault Mirage 2000s. The SEPECAT Jaguar fleet consists of 115 aircraft, including variants used for training and maritime strike. The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 Bison fleet, currently at 40 units, is being phased out. To modernize its fleet, the IAF has ordered 73 HAL Tejas Mk.1A aircraft, with an additional 97 approved for future acquisition. The IAF’s combat aircraft strength stands at 31 squadrons, below the sanctioned 42 squadrons, reaching its lowest level since 1965 due to the retirement of older aircraft without immediate replacements. Therefore, it is not surprising that India has had previous discussions regarding the F-35. In 2010, Lockheed Martin provided a briefing on the aircraft to the Indian Navy. In 2018, reports indicated that the Indian Air Force had shown interest in procuring 126 F-35A variants and requested a classified briefing. However, the Indian Air Force Chief of Staff at the time denied any formal request had been made. Although discussions have taken place, India has not formally begun the process of acquiring the F-35, and its current focus remains on upgrading its domestic fighter fleet. The U.S. Congressional Research Service estimates that India is expected to spend over $200 billion in the next decade on military modernization, further shaping potential discussions around the F-35. Additionally, as reported by Army Recognition on January 6, 2025, the United States recently approved India's participation in the co-production of Stryker armored fighting vehicles, making it the first foreign country authorized to manufacture this armored vehicle.

US Air Force Begins Initial Operational Tests and Evaluations of MH-139A Grey Wolf Helicopter	The 550th Helicopter Squadron at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana has reached a crucial milestone in integrating the MH-139A Grey Wolf into the U.S. Air Force's nuclear security operations. The squadron's recent participation in the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) phase marks a significant achievement for both the aircraft and the operational requirements of the 341st Missile Squadron. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The IOT&amp;E phase, which began with test flights on January 28, 2025, is designed to rigorously assess the MH-139A's ability to operate effectively in real-world, high-stakes environments. (Picture source: US DoD) The IOT&amp;E phase, which began with test flights on January 28, 2025, is designed to rigorously assess the MH-139A's ability to operate effectively in real-world, high-stakes environments. This process is mandated by Congress to confirm the operational suitability of the aircraft and its ability to replace the aging UH-1N Huey helicopters. The ultimate goal of these tests is to ensure that the Grey Wolf can accomplish a wide range of missions, including those related to U.S. Air Force nuclear security, without any degradation in its capabilities. Three key flight tests were conducted during the week of January 27, 2025. One test focused on the MH-139A's ability to support a convoy, a critical mission to ensure safe transport and operations in potentially hostile environments. The aircraft's communication systems were tested, as well as its support capabilities in coordination with the convoy's ground operations. The other two tests were aimed at evaluating emergency response capabilities, particularly for launch facility recapture and recovery missions. These scenarios required the MH-139A to react quickly to a simulated threat, mimicking the rapid escalation of a nuclear security incident. The aircraft was assessed on its response times, its ability to get airborne quickly, and its capability to carry a full tactical response loadout, complete with its own weapons. The MH-139A's performance during these tests is being analyzed to determine whether it can seamlessly take over the UH-1N Huey’s nuclear security mission. This transition is crucial, as the Huey, which has served for decades in various missions, is reaching the end of its lifecycle. The IOT&amp;E phase ensures that the MH-139A meets the mission's performance requirements, including its ability to survive and perform effectively in demanding conditions. Once the IOT&amp;E phase is complete, the results will be compiled into a report that will be shared with the 550th Helicopter Squadron and the Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). These results will serve as the basis for the formal transition of the nuclear security mission to the MH-139A, allowing the retirement of the UH-1N Huey from Malmstrom Air Force Base. This transition to the MH-139A Grey Wolf is a crucial step in modernizing the U.S. Air Force's nuclear security fleet. The enhanced capabilities of this aircraft are expected to significantly improve operational readiness, ensuring that the U.S. Air Force is equipped to protect its nuclear deterrence infrastructure for many years to come.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/us-air-force-begins-initial-operational-tests-and-evaluations-of-mh-139a-grey-wolf-helicopter	2025-02-14T00:01:47-08:00	
Analysis | Could China’s future Type 004 replace the USS Gerald R. Ford as the world’s most powerful aircraft carrier?	As reported by Rupprecht Deino on February 13, 2025, China is likely progressing with the development of its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the Type 004, as multiple reports and satellite imagery suggest early-stage construction activity at the Dalian shipyard. In early 2024, test sections of the C3 and C4 catapults were observed near the Dalian No. 2 Factory Dock, where the aircraft carrier Shandong was built. These structures are identical to the test section of the Hudong 076 catapult, first identified at the end of 2022. A J-15 mock-up was also reported at the site, reinforcing the possibility that these are the first verified Type 004 modules.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Type 004 nuclear aircraft carrier is expected to carry between 70 and 100 aircraft, including fixed-wing fighters, airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). (CG picture source: 大包CG/Weibo) More precisely, satellite imagery suggests a potential carrier module for the Type 004 has been seen at the Xianglujiao drydock in Dalian, a site used for maintaining the Liaoning and Shandong carriers. Some analysts identify the observed module as a port foredeck segment featuring grooves for catapults, noting that while the twin catapults on the starboard side are parallel, these grooves are crossed. Others suggest it is a test module rather than an indication of full-scale construction. Imagery from May 2024 has led to assessments that work on the Type 004 is progressing, though the exact stage remains uncertain. China’s Type 004 is projected to be the country’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, and potentially the heaviest warship ever made. The vessel is estimated to have a displacement between 110,000 and 120,000 tonnes, making it the world's largest aircraft carrier and the largest warship ever constructed, surpassing the USS Gerald R. Ford, which has a full-load displacement of approximately 100,000 tonnes. The Type 004, estimated at 330+ meters in length and 83 meters in width, would be similar in length but slightly wider than the USS Gerald R. Ford, which measures 333 meters in length and 78 meters in width. The Type 004 is also expected to utilize nuclear marine propulsion, developed under Project Longwei at the Nuclear Power Institute of China (NPIC), providing an extended operational range limited only by crew supplies and maintenance requirements, while the Ford-class requires mid-life refueling after approximately 25 years. The expected speed exceeds 30 knots, comparable to the Gerald R. Ford but surpassing the French Charles de Gaulle. The nuclear reactor for the Type 004 is reportedly being developed under Project Longwei at NPIC in Mucheng. Reports indicate that a land-based prototype reactor has been constructed, with satellite imagery confirming its location at NPIC’s Site No. 1, also referred to as Base 909. Procurement documents from China’s 701 Institute, responsible for aircraft carrier development, identify the reactor as designed for installation on a large surface warship. While technical specifications remain undisclosed, the reactor is expected to support integrated electric propulsion, enabling electromagnetic catapults (EMALS) and other high-energy systems, such as advanced radar and electronic warfare equipment. The reactor’s development aligns with China’s broader efforts to establish independent nuclear propulsion capabilities, with potential applications for future nuclear-powered surface vessels. Reports also indicate China has developed a land-based prototype nuclear reactor intended for naval propulsion. Analysis by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, based on satellite imagery and Chinese government documents, confirms the presence of this reactor at NPIC in Mucheng. The project, referred to as Project Longwei, includes procurement documents from China’s 701 Institute stating that reactor equipment was acquired for installation on a large surface warship. These findings suggest China is working toward nuclear propulsion for aircraft carriers, with the Type 004 program potentially providing technical experience for future nuclear-powered surface combatants, including cruisers and destroyers. The carrier’s design is reported to incorporate an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), enabling the launch of heavier aircraft with greater efficiency compared to steam catapults. In comparison, the USS Ford-class has four EMALS catapults with a maximum sortie rate of 270 per day. The Type 004's arresting wire system will support Catapult-Assisted Take-Off, Barrier-Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) operations. Observations from satellite imagery suggest the vessel’s deck configuration includes twin catapults on the starboard side, while an angled deck layout will facilitate simultaneous aircraft launch and recovery. The internal hangar deck is expected to accommodate a larger number of aircraft for storage and maintenance. China’s Type 004 is estimated to have a displacement between 110,000 and 120,000 tonnes, surpassing the USS Gerald R. Ford, which has a full-load displacement of approximately 100,000 tonnes. (Picture source: US Navy) The Type 004 is anticipated to surpass the Ford-class, which carries approximately 75 aircraft, as the Chinese carrier is expected to carry between 70 and 100 aircraft, including fixed-wing fighters, airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The J-15T, a catapult-capable version of the J-15, is expected to operate alongside the J-35, a stealth aircraft under development. Some reports suggest the carrier could also host a new aircraft model, possibly designated as the J-50. The Xian KJ-600 is expected to provide AEW&amp;C capabilities similar to the U.S. E-2 Hawkeye. ASW operations will likely be supported by Z-20F (or newer Z-20J) and Z-18F helicopters, while UAVs may be included for reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and refueling missions, potentially similar to the U.S. MQ-25 Stingray. The Type 004’s expected defensive systems include close-in weapon systems (CIWS), such as the Type 1130, for countering incoming threats. It may also be equipped with surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, potentially including the HQ-10 short-range air defense system. Electronic warfare suites and decoy launchers could be integrated to improve survivability. Reports suggest the possible inclusion of directed-energy weapons such as railguns or laser-based systems, though no confirmation of these systems has been provided. The construction of Type 004 is reportedly taking place at the Dalian Shipyard, with carrier modules observed at the Xianglujiao drydock. Reports indicate that prototype testing of the nuclear propulsion system has been underway at NPIC, with estimates suggesting the reactor could be prepared for integration with the Type 004 carrier before its projected launch. The construction timeline remains unconfirmed, but estimates suggest module assembly and hull construction could occur between 2024 and 2025, followed by launch and fitting-out from 2026 to 2028. Commissioning into service could take place between 2030 and 2032. China’s aircraft carrier program has progressed from acquiring and studying foreign carriers to developing its own designs. In 1985, China purchased the decommissioned HMAS Melbourne from Australia, using its steam catapult and landing system for research. During the 1990s and early 2000s, China acquired former Soviet carriers, including the Minsk, Kiev, and Varyag, with the latter undergoing modifications before being commissioned as the Liaoning (Type 001) in 2012, becoming China’s first operational carrier. The Shandong (Type 002), launched in 2017 and commissioned in 2019, was the first domestically built carrier, featuring a ski-jump launch system similar to Liaoning. The Fujian (Type 003), launched in 2022, introduced electromagnetic catapults (EMALS) but remained conventionally powered, requiring refueling for extended operations. The Type 004’s nuclear propulsion would allow for longer operational endurance without the need for such refueling stops. The development of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier would significantly enhance the Chinese Navy's ability to maintain naval operations in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. Nuclear propulsion offers virtually unlimited range and endurance, allowing the carrier to operate far from Chinese shores without frequent refueling. This capability enables sustained power projection, extended deployments at greater distances, and rapid response to emerging situations worldwide. Additionally, nuclear-powered carriers generate substantial electrical power, supporting advanced systems such as electromagnetic catapults, which increase sortie rates and allow for the deployment of heavier and more diverse aircraft. This advancement would place China among the few nations—currently only the United States and France—possessing such high-end naval assets. However, the U.S. Navy, which operates 11 nuclear-powered carriers, maintains a significant operational advantage due to its global logistics network and decades of carrier operations experience. If successfully developed, Type 004 would represent China’s first attempt to integrate this capability into its fleet.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/analysis-could-chinas-future-type-004-replace-the-uss-gerald-r-ford-as-the-worlds-most-powerful-aircraft-carrier	2025-02-13T12:14:16-08:00

These upgrades suggest a broader operational role, potentially improving anti-air, anti-submarine, and surface warfare capabilities. Sea trials mark a crucial stage in the ship’s development, allowing engineers and naval experts to test the vessel in real-world conditions. The performance of propulsion systems, weapons integration, and electronic warfare systems are assessed to ensure the ship meets operational standards before being commissioned into service. The sighting of the second Type 054B undergoing sea trials indicates that China is accelerating the production and deployment of these new frigates, likely aiming to bolster its fleet amid rising regional tensions and maritime security concerns. China’s naval expansion has been nothing short of transformative in recent years, particularly when compared to other global naval powers such as the United States. The commissioning of the Type 054B frigates is part of a broader naval modernization effort that has seen China surpass the U.S. in the number of combat-ready vessels. As of 2024, the PLAN had already exceeded 370 warships, a number projected to reach 400 by the late 2020s. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy has struggled to maintain a fleet size above 290 ships, largely due to budgetary constraints, shipbuilding delays, and workforce shortages. Despite this numerical advantage, the U.S. Navy still retains a technological edge. The American fleet possesses superior aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines, and advanced integrated warfare systems. The U.S. has also been investing heavily in next-generation naval capabilities, including unmanned surface vessels, hypersonic weapons, and electronic warfare systems. However, China is rapidly closing the gap. The development of the Type 054B, alongside larger projects like the Fujian aircraft carrier, demonstrates Beijing’s ambitions to secure regional dominance and expand its blue-water capabilities. Beyond the U.S., other global navies are also modernizing, but at a much slower pace. Economic sanctions and industrial limitations have hindered Russia’s naval development, preventing large-scale shipbuilding projects. India has been steadily expanding its fleet with a focus on aircraft carriers and destroyers, but its shipbuilding capacity remains far behind China’s. Meanwhile, European navies, such as those of the UK, France, and Germany, have prioritized high-end but limited naval programs, focusing on advanced technology rather than fleet size. One of China’s greatest advantages in naval expansion is its industrial base. The country’s shipbuilding industry dominates the global market, accounting for the vast majority of commercial and military ship orders. Backed by state-led initiatives, China’s shipyards operate at an unmatched pace, enabling the mass production of warships with high efficiency. In contrast, the U.S. faces significant challenges in shipbuilding due to logistical constraints, labor shortages, and rising costs. The few American shipyards capable of building major warships operate at a much slower pace compared to China’s extensive infrastructure. As a result, while China can rapidly commission new vessels like the Type 054B, the U.S. Navy struggles with delays in programs such as the DDG(X) next-generation destroyer and the Virginia-class submarines. The increasing demand for warships, along with rising production costs, has also led to a reported increase in prices, reflecting the high strategic value and technological advancements of these new-generation vessels. However, with a state-controlled defense industry and lower production costs, China can afford to maintain its shipbuilding momentum far more efficiently than its Western counterparts. The deployment of the Type 054B frigates highlights a key shift in China’s naval strategy. These ships will likely play a vital role in fleet defense, escorting aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships while also being capable of independent operations. Their advanced capabilities make them a formidable addition to the PLAN, particularly in contested waters such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. With the Type 054B and other warships rapidly joining the PLAN’s ranks, China is positioning itself to challenge traditional maritime powers and project naval strength beyond the Indo-Pacific. The increasing number of modernized Chinese warships raises concerns for U.S. and allied forces in the region as the balance of power at sea continues to shift. If current trends persist, the PLAN will not only dominate the regional seas but could also rival the U.S. Navy on a global scale by the 2030s. This rapid naval expansion, combined with advancements in missile technology, electronic warfare, and naval aviation, ensures that China will remain a central player in shaping the future of maritime security worldwide.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-chinas-second-type-054b-frigate-conducts-sea-trials-signaling-the-rapid-expansion-of-chinese-navy	2025-02-12T01:40:53-08:00

These fuzes offer adaptability for engaging different target types, such as hardened structures or open-area threats. Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has been a strategic U.S. partner. Its location in the Middle East provides the U.S. with a strategic presence in a region critical for global energy security and geopolitical stability. Militarily, Israel possesses advanced defense capabilities, supported by U.S. military aid and joint technology development, including missile defense systems. Intelligence-sharing agreements between the two nations have bolstered counterterrorism efforts and regional security initiatives. The U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement (1985) has further strengthened economic ties, particularly in the defense and high-tech sectors. Since the October 2023 conflict with Hamas, U.S.-Israel defense cooperation has intensified, with the United States providing substantial military aid and arms sales, including hundreds of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs), designated locally as 'Para.' At least $12.5 billion in direct military assistance has been allocated through legislative measures, including $3.8 billion from a March 2024 bill and $8.7 billion from an April 2024 supplemental appropriations act. Significant arms deals have also been executed, including a $660 million sale of Hellfire missiles, reinforcing Israel’s defense capabilities amid sustained regional tensions. This approval comes amid a broader surge in U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS). In Fiscal Year 2023, FMS transactions hit a record $80.9 billion, with Fiscal Year 2024 surpassing this, as U.S. military equipment sales to foreign governments rose 29%, reaching $318.7 billion. This growth is driven largely by global efforts to replenish defense stocks depleted by aid to Ukraine and prepare for potential conflicts. Major U.S. defense contractors, such as Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman, have played a pivotal role in fulfilling these contracts. However, in January 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 14169, titled 'Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid.' This order imposed a 90-day pause on all U.S. foreign development assistance programs to review their alignment with American interests and values. The suspension affected various aid initiatives, including health services, education, and emergency projects, with exceptions limited to emergency food assistance and military aid for key allies, including Israel.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/us-to-significantly-increase-israels-strike-capabilities-with-6-75-billion-worth-of-gps-guided-bombs	2025-02-10T02:40:43-08:00	
DGA Launches DROIDE Program to Accelerate Deployment of Ground Robots in French Army	On February 7, the French Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) announced a new phase in the development of military robotics in France by awarding, on December 30, 2024, a seven-year framework agreement to KNDS France and Safran Electronics &amp; Defense. This program, named DROIDE, is part of a broader effort to modernize France’s military capabilities in autonomous systems, to strengthen the use of ground robotic platforms by 2030-2035. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The DROIDE agreement serves as a key instrument for structuring research and development efforts around essential technologies for military ground robots (Picture source: DGA) This initiative represents a significant step in the strategy for integrating robotics into ground combat, a priority that has been under exploration by the DGA for several years. The French Army has been assessing the potential of robotic systems to support military operations in logistics, reconnaissance, and combat roles. The DROIDE framework agreement aims to advance the technological maturity of robotic platforms while considering the specific challenges posed by terrain and operational conditions. The program will lead to the development of a multi-mission ground robotic demonstrator designed to assist combat units and reduce soldier exposure to risk.The recent history of military robotics in France demonstrates a progressive expansion of capabilities in this domain. In 2018, the DGA commissioned a study from a consortium formed by Safran Electronics &amp; Defense and the SME Effidence to anticipate the integration of robots into combat units under the FURIOUS program (FUturs systèmes Robotiques Innovants en tant qu’OUtilS au profit du combattant embarqué et débarqué). This project led to the development of three demonstrators of varying sizes, designed for zone reconnaissance, building exploration, and equipment transport. These systems underwent testing at the Urban Operations Training Center (CENZUB) in Sissonne.Following the progress made under the FURIOUS program, a new contractual phase was awarded to Safran Electronics &amp; Defense in 2022, after successful trials conducted in 2021 at the Urban Combat Training Center. This phase focused on optimizing the modular architecture of the systems, both in hardware and software, to enhance their level of autonomy.Concurrently, the French Army has increased field experimentation efforts, conducting trials with a robotic mule in the Sahel, launching the CoHoMa challenge, and establishing the Vulcain section to explore the integration of robotics in military operations. The Military Programming Law (LPM) 2024-2030 has reinforced this approach by emphasizing the necessity of developing ground robots capable of interacting with soldiers and their environment under human control, reducing the risks faced by deployed forces.During a Senate hearing in November 2024, the French Army Chief of Staff, General Pierre Schill, detailed expectations regarding ground robotics. He highlighted the importance of preliminary research and demonstrator development, noting that while this field remains less mature than aerial drones, it requires sustained investment, particularly in software development. He also outlined concrete applications for these systems, such as engineering operations involving demining robots and logistical support using robotic carriers capable of following armored vehicles to transport supplies forward.However, deploying armed robotic systems presents complex technical and operational challenges. General Schill emphasized the difficulties associated with autonomous movement and fire control, despite proposals from defense manufacturers such as KNDS France, which developed the Optio X20 armed with a 20mm cannon, and MBDA, which has also introduced relevant solutions. The LPM aims for an initial integration of these robotic systems by 2030, while continuing the necessary testing to ensure their effectiveness and safety in operational environments.Within this framework, the DROIDE agreement serves as a key instrument for structuring research and development efforts around essential technologies for military ground robots. It is designed to include third-party partners offering innovative solutions, thereby strengthening France’s industrial and technological ecosystem in this field.Safran Electronics &amp; Defense is expected to leverage its experience from the FURIOUS program, particularly with its Nerva mini-robots and Ultro 600 robotic mule. Meanwhile, KNDS France will build on its collaboration with SERA Ingénierie, a subsidiary of the SOGECLAIR group, which contributed to the development of the Centurio ground robot. The Centurio has already undergone operational testing at the Canjuers military camp, demonstrating advancements in ground robotics.The awarding of the DROIDE framework agreement to KNDS France and Safran Electronics &amp; Defense confirms the DGA and the French Army’s commitment to accelerating the integration of autonomous systems into ground forces. By structuring research and development around a multi-mission demonstrator, the program aims to identify the most suitable technological solutions for future operational requirements while maintaining industrial and technological sovereignty in the strategic field of military robotics.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/dga-launches-droide-program-to-accelerate-deployment-of-ground-robots-in-french-army	2025-02-10T02:06:56-08:00	
Flash News: Türkiye to Strengthen ESSI’s European Air Defense with Locally-Made Missile Systems	According to information published by the Turkish daily newspaper Daily Sabah on February 10, 2025, Türkiye, which joined the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI) in February 2024, is now an official participant in the German-led project aimed at creating a unified and effective missile defense system across Europe and can offer its locally-made air defense missile systems to enhance the capabilities of the ESSI project. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Turkish SIPER long-range air defense missile system, developed by Roketsan and Aselsan, is designed to provide advanced protection against airborne threats, including aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles (Picture source: SSB) The European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI) is a collaborative missile defense program spearheaded by Germany, aimed at strengthening Europe’s air and missile defense architecture through the integration of various air defense systems from participating nations. Designed to counter a wide range of aerial threats, including ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and drones, ESSI seeks to enhance NATO’s overall deterrence and response capabilities. The initiative promotes interoperability among European defense systems by incorporating a mix of existing and new technologies, such as the IRIS-T SLM, Patriot, and Arrow-3 air defense systems. By uniting multiple European nations under a single defensive umbrella, ESSI not only fortifies Europe’s protection against aerial threats but also streamlines defense procurement, reducing costs and enhancing coordination among allied forces. In October 2022, fifteen European nations, including Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania, and the United Kingdom, signed a declaration to join the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI). The initiative, led by Germany, focuses on the joint procurement of air defense systems to enhance Europe’s missile defense capabilities. All founding states are NATO members, with Finland formally joining the alliance in 2023, further strengthening the collective defense framework. ESSI is closely aligned with NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense System (NATINAMDS), reinforcing the alliance’s ability to counter aerial threats through a unified and multi-layered air defense network. In February 2024, the German government announced the addition of Greece and Türkiye to the initiative, marking a significant expansion of ESSI’s geographical coverage and operational capabilities. Türkiye’s participation, in particular, adds a new dimension to the initiative, leveraging its strategic location and advanced indigenous air defense systems. With these new members, ESSI continues to evolve as a critical pillar of European security, fostering greater defense cooperation among NATO allies and enhancing deterrence against potential threats. Türkiye’s inclusion in ESSI is particularly noteworthy given its critical geographic position at the intersection of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. As NATO’s southeastern flank, Türkiye provides essential early warning and rapid-response capabilities against missile threats emerging from volatile regions, including the Middle East and the Caucasus. While the initiative is primarily focused on countering Russian threats, Türkiye’s regional coverage enhances its strategic relevance, reinforcing NATO’s collective security posture. Furthermore, Ankara’s participation could signal a recalibration of its relationships with NATO, the European Union, and the United States, potentially easing tensions in defense cooperation. Beyond strategic positioning, Türkiye brings valuable technological contributions to ESSI. Over the past decade, the Turkish defense industry has made significant advancements in the development of indigenous air defense systems, strengthening its ability to support Europe’s missile defense architecture. Led by major defense companies such as Roketsan and Aselsan, Türkiye has successfully developed and deployed a range of modern air defense systems tailored to counter evolving threats. The HISAR-A and HISAR-O systems provide short- and medium-range air defense solutions capable of countering aerial threats, including aircraft, drones, and missiles. Meanwhile, the SIPER long-range air defense system, with a current range exceeding 100 kilometers and future versions expected to reach 180 kilometers, enhances Türkiye’s capability to contribute to medium- and long-range missile defense within ESSI. Additionally, Türkiye has been investing in high-altitude and layered air defense solutions, such as the Çelik Kubbe ('Steel Dome') system, a fully integrated command-and-control network designed to enhance operational coordination. These advancements demonstrate Türkiye’s growing self-reliance in defense technology and its ability to provide sophisticated capabilities to ESSI, reinforcing NATO’s overall missile defense strategy. Despite the strategic and technological advantages Türkiye brings to ESSI, challenges remain. Political tensions within NATO, differences in procurement strategies, and financial commitments from participating nations continue to pose obstacles to full integration. Moreover, ensuring seamless interoperability between Türkiye’s defense systems and existing European missile defense infrastructure will require extensive coordination. Nonetheless, Türkiye’s involvement in ESSI marks an important step toward deeper European defense cooperation. As NATO prioritizes the enhancement of its air and missile defense capabilities, Türkiye’s participation is expected to play a crucial role in the initiative’s success. This development not only strengthens Europe’s collective security but also reaffirms Türkiye’s significance as a key player in regional and global defense. With geopolitical tensions at a high, the expansion of ESSI highlights the growing importance of multinational defense collaboration in addressing modern security challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-tuerkiye-to-strengthen-essis-european-air-defense-with-locally-made-missile-systems	2025-02-10T01:32:10-08:00	
China to expand its nuclear submarine fleet as the production of Type 093B increases	On February 7, 2025, Tom Shugart shared an image taken on February 4, 2025, showing the Huludao nuclear submarine shipyard, where a Type 093B nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN/SSGN) was observed with its vertical launch system (VLS) hatches open, revealing what appears to be 12 tubes, indicating a considerable increase in firepower for this class of attack submarine. Another image showed a separate Type 093B on the transfer dock, which is typically used for newly built submarines. At least four Type 093 submarines were observed at the shipyard, though it is unclear whether all are newly constructed or undergoing maintenance.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link At the Huludao shipyard, a Type 093B nuclear-powered attack submarine was observed with its vertical launch system (VLS) hatches open, revealing what appears to be 12 tubes, indicating a considerable increase in firepower for this class of attack submarine. (Picture source: Chinese social media and Twitter/Tom Shugart) China seems to have ordered a rapid expansion of the People's Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) submarine fleet, particularly the Type 093B series. According to several analysts, between seven and eight Type 093B submarines have been built in just the past three years, a production rate that exceeds the number of attack submarines China has constructed over the past three decades. When including conventional submarines, such as the new Type 039C, the total number of submarines launched by China in the past three years surpasses 15. Experts now believe that China is steadily increasing its fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, possibly as a precursor to the introduction of the next-generation Type 095 SSN. Until then, the Type 093B is likely to replace aging vessels while achieving a significant qualitative leap in underwater capabilities. The adoption of pump-jet propulsion in the Type 093B suggests an effort to reduce acoustic signatures and improve underwater performance. Pump-jet propulsors are generally associated with submarines designed for higher speeds and reduced detectability. While initial estimates suggested an initial batch of six units, current reports indicate that Type 093B production is ongoing, replacing older submarines and increasing the total SSN fleet size. China’s nuclear-powered submarine development began in the 1970s with the Type 091 (Han-class) SSN, which was later replaced by the Type 093 (Shang-class) nuclear-powered attack submarine to enhance the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) underwater capabilities. Designed with assistance from Russia, its development aimed to address the limitations of the Type 091, particularly in noise reduction and combat effectiveness. The first Type 093 entered service in the early 2000s, featuring improved hydrodynamics, quieter operation, and greater endurance. Later variants, such as the Type 093A and 093B, incorporated vertical launch systems (VLS) for several types of cruise missiles, marking the first time that a Chinese attack submarine has incorporated such a capability. The Type 093B, reportedly featuring an elongated hull and advanced sensors, is believed to serve as a transition toward the next-generation Type 095 submarine, also designated as 09-V. The Type 093B incorporates a streamlined hull designed to reduce acoustic signatures. It uses a pump-jet propulsion system rather than a conventional propeller, a change consistent with recent trends in SSN design. This propulsion system is generally associated with improvements in efficiency and noise reduction at higher speeds. A key feature of the Type 093B is the integration of a vertical launch system (VLS), marking the first known instance of a Chinese SSN being equipped with VLS, allowing it to launch a range of missile types. The observed configuration, which appears to include between 12 and 24 VLS cells, suggests the submarine can be armed with anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), land-attack cruise missiles (LACMs), and potentially submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Satellite imagery from early 2023 showed that China had launched its eighth Type 093-class submarine at Huludao, with at least two confirmed as Type 093B variants. The rate of production suggests a degree of standardization in manufacturing. During the 70th anniversary of the PLAN’s Submarine Force in June 2024, Chinese state media outlined the increasing role of nuclear-powered attack submarines in naval operations. Reports suggest that the Type 093B may be capable of carrying a submarine-launched variant of the YJ-21 hypersonic missile, which has been observed on Type 055 destroyers. If deployed from submarines, this missile would expand China’s strike capabilities. The increased production rate of the Type 093B also raises questions about the future composition of China’s underwater fleet, particularly regarding the ratio of SSNs to conventionally powered submarines (SSKs) such as the Type 039C. The increased adoption of pump-jet propulsion indicates that these new SSNs may be deployed more aggressively than their predecessors. Additionally, beyond the Type 093B, China is continuing to develop its submarine fleet. The Type 094 SSBNs have been used for strategic deterrence patrols, though some analysts suggest that China's nuclear triad is not yet fully operational. There are reports that China may modify some Type 094 SSBNs into SSGNs, potentially increasing their missile capabilities. This will increase the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN)’s capability for blue-water operations, extend its operational range, and strengthen its anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities. SSKs will likely remain part of the fleet for regional defense and littoral operations, while the growing SSN fleet is positioned to conduct long-range patrols, escort carrier groups, and contribute to strategic deterrence in the Pacific and surrounding waters. In parallel, China is actively enhancing the missile capabilities of its main vessels. The Type 055 destroyer, for instance, is equipped with 112 vertical launch system (VLS) cells, capable of deploying various missiles, including the YJ-18 anti-ship cruise missile and the CJ-10 land-attack cruise missile. The YJ-18 features a subsonic cruise mode and a supersonic terminal attack, with an estimated range of 220 to 540 kilometers, while the CJ-10 is a land-attack cruise missile with a range exceeding 1,500 kilometers. Additionally, China has introduced the YJ-21, a hypersonic anti-ship ballistic missile with an estimated range of approximately 1,500 kilometers and speeds between Mach 6 and Mach 10. The recently commissioned Type 054B frigate also features modern missile systems, contributing to China's growing naval firepower, with reports from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) indicating that by 2024, the Chinese Navy had achieved more than 50% of the U.S. Navy's firepower in VLS missile cells.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/china-to-expand-its-nuclear-submarine-fleet-as-the-production-of-type-093b-increases	2025-02-10T01:28:24-08:00	
Indonesia Weighs Aircraft Carrier Acquisition to Strengthen Maritime Operations and Security	Indonesia is currently exploring the possibility of acquiring an aircraft carrier to strengthen its military capabilities in a non-combat role. During a press conference held on February 6, 2025, in Jakarta, the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Navy (TNI-AL), Admiral Muhammad Ali, emphasized the need to modernize the fleet’s equipment and presented several acquisition proposals to the Indonesian Ministry of Defense. Among these proposals is the acquisition of an aircraft carrier designed for non-combat missions, along with the purchase of frigates from Italy and fast missile-armed patrol boats from Turkey. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Rumors have circulated about the possible acquisition of the Giuseppe Garibaldi aircraft carrier, which could indicate a potential agreement with the Italian naval industry for modernization or licensed construction (Picture source: Marina Difesa) For several years, the Indonesian Navy has conducted studies on acquiring an aircraft carrier-like vessel capable of carrying helicopters for both combat and non-combat operations. Indonesia has not yet officially confirmed the builder of its potential aircraft carrier, but several options are under consideration. PT PAL Indonesia, the country’s leading shipbuilder, has already proposed helicopter carrier and amphibious assault ship concepts, making it a possible candidate for a domestic construction project, potentially in collaboration with a foreign partner.Italy could also play a key role, particularly through Fincantieri, which already has ties with the Indonesian Navy for the supply of frigates. Additionally, rumors have circulated about the possible acquisition of the Giuseppe Garibaldi aircraft carrier, which could indicate a potential agreement with the Italian naval industry for modernization or licensed construction.Another possibility is a partnership with South Korea, a country with which Indonesia already collaborates in the naval sector, particularly through Hyundai Heavy Industries or DSME, which could offer a suitable platform. The option of purchasing a second-hand vessel also remains on the table, with potential modernization by the original builder according to the Indonesian Navy’s specific requirements. The final decision will depend on the country’s strategic priorities, budget, and ongoing negotiations with its industrial and military partners.Although the Indonesian Navy is considered one of the most powerful in Southeast Asia, it still lacks sufficient capabilities and ships to safeguard the country’s vast territory and exclusive economic zones. The aging fleet remains a recurring challenge. As part of its armed forces modernization plan, known as the Minimum Essential Force (MEF), the Indonesian Navy plans to operate at least four amphibious helicopter carrier vessels.Beyond the aircraft carrier project, the Indonesian Navy is also pursuing other strategic acquisitions. It has submitted an official request for the purchase of two frigates built in Italy to enhance its fleet’s operational presence and capabilities. Meanwhile, two domestically produced frigates have been prepared for service, reinforcing the country’s goal of increasing industrial and operational self-sufficiency. Additionally, multiple fast missile-equipped patrol boats from Turkey will further strengthen the fleet.Indonesia has also received a grant proposal from Japan, offering two patrol vessels to be stationed at the Balikpapan naval base in East Kalimantan. This location is strategically important as it will bolster the military presence near Indonesia’s future capital, Nusantara, situated close to Balikpapan. Admiral Muhammad Ali stated that these patrol vessels are well suited to the region’s geography, particularly due to their ability to navigate the numerous waterways in the future capital.

Breaking News: Morocco Chooses Israeli ATMOS 2000 Howitzers Over French CAESAR Amid Growing Defense Ties	According to information published on February 8, 2025, by the French financial weekly La Tribune, defense journalist Michel Cabirol reported that Israeli defense company Elbit Systems had secured a contract to supply 36 ATMOS 2000 155mm wheeled self-propelled howitzers to Morocco. These artillery systems will be mounted on Czech Tatra trucks, marking a significant shift in Morocco’s artillery procurement strategy. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The ATMOS 2000 is a 155mm/52-caliber truck-mounted self-propelled howitzer developed by Israeli defense company Elbit Systems. (Picture source: Elbit Systems) This decision follows operational challenges faced with the French-made CAESAR howitzers, which were delivered in 2022 by KNDS France. Citing Cabirol, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (FAR) experienced recurring technical issues with the CAESAR systems, prompting them to seek a more reliable and efficient alternative. France had been anticipating a new order for additional CAESAR howitzers, but instead, Rabat selected the Israeli ATMOS 2000, signaling a growing preference for Israeli military technology over traditional European suppliers. The ATMOS 2000 (Autonomous Truck Mounted Howitzer System) is a 155mm/52-caliber truck-mounted artillery system designed for rapid deployment and superior mobility. One of its key advantages is its adaptability to various high-mobility truck platforms, including 6x6 and 8x8 configurations, providing flexibility based on operational needs. The system is capable of firing extended-range projectiles exceeding 40 kilometers, with a rate of fire between 4 to 9 rounds per minute, depending on the mode of operation. The advanced automatic laying and navigation system ensures high precision, and the system is fully compatible with modern C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers &amp; Intelligence) networks for enhanced battlefield awareness. The ATMOS 2000 is designed for quick relocation, moving within 30 seconds after firing to avoid counter-battery threats. Additionally, its semi-automatic loading system allows it to be operated efficiently by a crew of 2 to 6 personnel, making it a more automated and efficient alternative to traditional towed and self-propelled howitzers. According to Elbit Systems, the ATMOS 2000 outperforms the French CAESAR in multiple aspects, particularly in mobility, automation, firepower, and crew efficiency. Unlike the CAESAR, which is primarily available on French Arquus or Mercedes-Benz trucks, the ATMOS 2000 is adaptable to a variety of truck chassis, including Czech Tatra trucks, allowing Morocco to integrate it into its existing logistics infrastructure. The automation level of the ATMOS 2000 is another key advantage, as it incorporates a semi-automatic loading system, reducing crew workload and enhancing rate of fire. In contrast, the CAESAR uses a manual loading system, requiring a larger crew of 4 to 5 personnel, which increases operational complexity and slows down the artillery system’s response time in combat scenarios. When comparing firepower and rate of fire, the ATMOS 2000 is capable of firing between 4 to 9 rounds per minute, depending on the mission profile and crew efficiency, and supports MRSI (Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact) capabilities, allowing multiple shells to hit a target simultaneously. While the CAESAR has a comparable rate of fire of 6 rounds per minute, operational reports from Morocco suggest that ATMOS provides a more reliable and efficient artillery platform in sustained combat operations. Elbit Systems has also integrated advanced fire control and C4I capabilities into the ATMOS 2000, enabling real-time target sharing, automated fire correction, and enhanced digital battlefield awareness. While the CAESAR also features a modern fire control system, Morocco has reported integration challenges with foreign C4I networks, making it less adaptable for their specific operational needs. In terms of mobility and deployment speed, the ATMOS 2000 has a significant advantage, as it can relocate in under 30 seconds after firing, reducing vulnerability to enemy counter-battery fire. The CAESAR, in comparison, requires approximately one minute to complete its firing sequence and reposition, making it slightly slower in high-intensity combat scenarios. Both systems are compatible with NATO-standard 155mm ammunition, with the ATMOS achieving a range of over 40 km using ERFB-BB (Extended Range Full Bore - Base Bleed) projectiles, while the CAESAR can reach 42 km with the same ammunition and up to 50 km with VLAP (Very Long-Range Artillery Projectile). Since establishing formal diplomatic relations in 2020, Morocco and Israel have significantly expanded their defense cooperation. In 2021, the two countries signed a Defense Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), opening the door for defense contracts, intelligence sharing, and joint military projects. Among the most notable agreements was Morocco's $500 million deal in 2023 to acquire the Israeli Barak MX air and missile defense system, significantly strengthening its air defense network. Additionally, Morocco has integrated 20 Israeli EL/M-2032 radar systems into its F-5E fighter jets, enhancing their air-to-air combat capabilities. The Royal Moroccan Armed Forces have also bolstered their air defense with the acquisition of 75 Barak-LRAD long-range air defense systems, which are part of the Barak-MX missile defense package. The growing presence of Israeli military equipment on the global defense market is becoming increasingly evident, often competing directly with European defense manufacturers, including France. Over the past decade, Israel has expanded its defense exports through strategic agreements, offering modern, combat-proven technology that appeals to nations seeking reliable alternatives to European and American systems. In contrast, France has struggled to maintain its influence, facing delays in deliveries, complex political conditions, and customer dissatisfaction with some of its defense products. The Moroccan shift from the French CAESAR to the Israeli ATMOS 2000 is a prime example of this trend, highlighting the increasing preference for Israeli artillery systems in regions like Africa and Asia. While France had been expecting to secure an additional order for more CAESAR howitzers from Morocco, the selection of the ATMOS 2000 underscores Israel’s growing role as a major global arms supplier, offering combat-proven, cost-effective, and adaptable solutions that appeal to modern militaries. As a result, Israel’s defense industry is steadily increasing its market share, posing a significant challenge to traditional European suppliers like France in the highly competitive global arms market.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-morocco-chooses-israeli-atmos-2000-howitzers-over-french-caesar-amid-growing-defense-ties	2025-02-09T05:28:22-08:00

(Picture source: Open source Intel X account) This event occurs as geopolitical competition intensifies between the U.S. and Russia over defense ties with India. In January 2025, the U.S. President Trump administration urged India to significantly increase its purchase of U.S. military technology, emphasizing Washington’s commitment to countering Russia’s long-standing dominance in India’s defense market, which has seen the delivery of large quantities of Russian military equipment over the years. This event holds strategic significance as India evaluates options for its planned acquisition of 114 multi-role fighter aircraft, a deal that has drawn intense global competition. Russia’s participation underscores its commitment to strengthening defense ties with India, while the U.S.’s continued presence aims to deepen its defense cooperation with the country. Russia’s Sukhoi Su-57 Felon was developed under the PAK FA (Perspektivny Aviatsionny Kompleks Frontovoy Aviatsii) program and made its first flight in 2010, entering service in 2020. Unlike most stealth fighters, the Su-57 integrates thrust-vectoring engines, allowing for exceptional maneuverability in air combat. This design philosophy reflects Russia’s emphasis on close-range dogfighting and air superiority, where agility and speed take precedence over pure stealth capabilities. The F-35 Lightning II, on the other hand, was designed by Lockheed Martin under the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program and first flew in 2006, entering service in 2015. Unlike the Su-57, the F-35 prioritizes stealth, network-centric warfare, and data fusion, enabling it to detect and eliminate threats before being detected itself. A direct comparison between the two aircraft highlights key differences in their design approach. The Su-57 measures 19.8 meters in length with a wingspan of 14.1 meters, while the more compact F-35 measures 15.7 meters in length with a wingspan of 10.7 meters. The Su-57 boasts a top speed exceeding Mach 2.0 (2,450 km/h), outpacing the F-35’s Mach 1.6 (1,930 km/h), and features twin Saturn izdeliye 30 engines, compared to the F-35’s single Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine. The Su-57 also integrates a 3D thrust-vectoring system, making it highly maneuverable, whereas the F-35 lacks thrust vectoring but compensates with superior sensor fusion and electronic warfare capabilities. Stealth is a defining feature of both aircraft, but the F-35 is considered significantly stealthier due to its low radar cross-section (RCS), embedded sensors, and radar-absorbing materials. The Su-57 incorporates stealth features but retains partially exposed engine nozzles, increasing its radar signature. In terms of combat range, the Su-57 has an advantage with a range of approximately 3,500 km, whereas the F-35A’s range is around 2,200 km. Both aircraft feature internal and external hardpoints for carrying weapons, with the Su-57 equipped with a 30mm cannon and advanced hypersonic missiles, while the F-35 carries a 25mm GAU-22/A cannon and precision-guided bombs, including nuclear-capable weapons. The presence of both these advanced aircraft at Aero India 2025 provides India with a rare opportunity to assess their capabilities firsthand, as the country moves forward with its plans to acquire 114 multirole fighters. This competition also plays into broader geopolitical and strategic defense collaborations. The U.S. government’s push for India to increase purchases of American military technology is part of a larger strategic effort to challenge Russia’s influence in India’s defense sector. As part of this effort, Washington has promoted co-production deals for fighter jet engines and combat vehicles, including the approval for India to produce the Stryker armored fighting vehicle under the Critical and Emerging Technologies initiative (iCET). As India seeks to modernize its air force, the showcasing of both the Russian Su-57 and U.S. F-35 at Aero India 2025 will play a crucial role in shaping future defense partnerships. This event not only highlights India’s growing significance in the global defense market but also underscores the strategic competition between Russia and the U.S. in supplying advanced military technology to India.

Russian Navy to soon deploy the modernized Admiral Nakhimov nuclear battlecruiser against the US Navy’s most powerful warships	As reported by TASS on February 4, 2025, the Russian nuclear battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov has entered a new phase in its modernization, with both of its nuclear reactors now operational. The first reactor was activated in December 2024, followed by the second on February 2, 2025, confirming the operational readiness of the ship’s nuclear propulsion system. Currently docked at Sevmash, the cruiser is scheduled to begin sea trials in the summer of 2025, with state trials planned before commissioning in 2026, as the Admiral Nakhimov now has a higher missile capacity than the US Zumwalt and Arleigh Burke classes.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Upon successful completion of the sea trials, the Admiral Nakhimov nuclear battlecruiser will be reintroduced into the Russian Northern Fleet as one of its most powerful surface ships, with a service life projected to extend at least for 30 years. (Picture source: Russian social media) The ship’s extensive overhaul has faced multiple delays, with earlier estimates suggesting a return to service in 2022. However, modifications to the upgrade program and financial constraints have further extended the timeline. The cost of the refurbishment has reportedly exceeded 200 billion rubles, making it one of the most expensive warship modernizations in Russian naval history. According to earlier statements from Russian sources, the goal was to achieve the physical launch of both reactors and initiate undocking procedures by the fall of 2024. However, the first reactor was only activated in December 2024, coinciding with the completion of the ship’s demagnetization process. Originally designated Kalinin, the Admiral Nakhimov was constructed at the Baltic Shipyard in Leningrad as the third nuclear-powered battlecruiser of the Kirov class. It was laid down on May 17, 1983, launched on April 25, 1986, and commissioned into the Russian Northern Fleet on December 30, 1988, before being renamed on April 22, 1992. The ship was placed into long-term maintenance in 1999, with major modernization efforts beginning in 2013. Before this full-scale upgrade, it carried 20 P-700 Granit anti-ship missiles, 96 S-300F Fort-M air defense missiles, six 30mm Kashtan close-in weapon systems, as well as torpedo and anti-submarine systems. The modernization has significantly enhanced the ship’s combat capabilities. Ten 3S14 universal vertical launch systems, each containing eight Kalibr-NK or Oniks cruise missiles, have replaced the previous missile setup, allowing for a total of 80 missiles. The ship has also been equipped to launch the 3M22 Tsirkon hypersonic missile, extending its strike capability. Additionally, the air defense systems have been upgraded, replacing the older S-300F with a navalized S-400 system containing 96 launch cells. Shorter-range defenses now include the Pantsir-ME and a naval adaptation of the S-350 Vityaz, replacing the older Osa-M system. In comparison, China’s Type 055 destroyers feature 112 VLS cells, accommodating YJ-18 anti-ship missiles, CJ-10 land-attack cruise missiles, and HHQ-9 long-range air defense missiles. The Type 055 is equipped with a dual-band radar system and electronic warfare capabilities. The U.S. Arleigh Burke Flight III destroyers are fitted with 96 Mk 41 VLS cells, supporting Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles, SM-6 air defense missiles, and ESSM interceptors. The Zumwalt-class destroyers, with 80 VLS cells, are designed for low-observable operations and multi-mission strike capabilities, including hypersonic missile integration. While the Admiral Nakhimov has a higher missile capacity than the Zumwalt and Arleigh Burke classes, it lacks the integrated stealth features of modern Chinese and U.S. designs, which may affect its survivability. Spanning for over a decade, the Admiral Nakhimov’s extensive modernization has faced multiple delays, with earlier estimates suggesting a return to service in 2022. (Picture source: Russian social media) Compared to the Moskva cruiser, which carried 16 P-1000 Vulkan anti-ship missiles and S-300F Fort air defense missiles, the Admiral Nakhimov has a significantly larger missile arsenal, more modern air defense systems, and enhanced electronic warfare capabilities. The Moskva, commissioned in 1983, used older radar and fire control systems, limiting its adaptability to newer threats. While the Moskva was optimized for fleet air defense with limited multi-role capabilities, the Admiral Nakhimov is configured for a broader range of missions, including long-range precision strikes, air defense, and anti-submarine warfare. Beyond missile armaments, the ship's nuclear propulsion system has been fully restored, with two KN-3 nuclear reactors producing 2×150 MW, supported by two auxiliary boilers and two turbines generating a combined 140,000 hp (103 MW) on shafts. The propulsion system also includes four power plants with a capacity of 18 MW, four steam turbine generators producing 3 MW each, and four gas turbine generators rated at 1.5 MW each, ensuring speeds of up to 32 knots. All electronic warfare and radar systems have been upgraded to modern standards, with improved target tracking and threat detection capabilities. Additional enhancements include the installation of the Redut naval air defense system and the Paket-NK anti-submarine system, increasing layered defense capabilities against aerial, surface, and underwater threats. The final modernization phase will involve extensive testing of the 28,000-ton vessel, with factory sea trials expected in mid-2025, followed by state trials assessing all systems under operational conditions. Upon successful completion, the Admiral Nakhimov will be reintroduced into the Russian Northern Fleet as one of its most powerful surface ships. The vessel's service life is projected to extend at least 30 years, enabling it to engage naval and land-based targets at long range while offering enhanced air defense for fleet operations. The fate of the Admiral Nakhimov’s sister ship, the Pyotr Velikiy, remains under review. In mid-2023, reports suggested it could be decommissioned after the Admiral Nakhimov’s return to service, but the Northern Fleet later denied this. The Pyotr Velikiy remains in operational duty as the only currently active Kirov-class cruiser until the Admiral Nakhimov is recommissioned, though its long-term future within the Russian Navy remains unclear. The Kirov-class nuclear-powered missile cruisers were developed during the Soviet era as the largest non-aircraft carrier surface combatants. Displacing 28,000 tons, they surpass most modern naval combatants, including U.S. Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. The class was designed for multi-role operations, with anti-ship, anti-air, and anti-submarine capabilities. However, their high maintenance costs and reliance on nuclear propulsion have limited their long-term viability, with only two of the original four ships remaining in service, as the Admiral Ushakov and Admiral Lazarev were decommissioned due to their aging systems and expensive maintenance. Originally designated Kalinin, the Admiral Nakhimov was constructed at the Baltic Shipyard in Leningrad as the third nuclear-powered battlecruiser of the Kirov class, and was launched in 1986.

Held during Alaska’s coldest month, JPMRC 25-02 provided approximately 10,000 joint and multinational service members with vital Arctic operational experience. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The Arctic Region is emerging as a key arena for military power projection, driven by a combination of strategic, environmental, and economic factors. Melting ice is opening up new maritime routes, and significant natural resources such as oil, gas, and minerals lie beneath its icy surface. Control of these resources, as well as the ability to secure vital shipping lanes, has made the region a strategic hotspot. The thawing of Arctic waters has also made it easier for military forces to maneuver through previously inaccessible areas, making it imperative for armed forces to be prepared for operations in these harsh conditions. The region’s remoteness and environmental challenges mean that conventional military tactics and equipment must be adapted to operate in extreme cold, high-altitude, and unpredictable weather conditions. These factors emphasize the necessity for specialized training and the development of interoperable forces that can respond to any crisis or conflict in this sensitive region. The U.S. Army’s Arctic Forge 25 exercise serves as a critical training ground for U.S. forces to refine their cold-weather capabilities. Over 330 soldiers from the U.S. Army's 11th Airborne Division and 10th Mountain Division will join approximately 500 Finnish personnel and 40 Canadian troops to enhance their interoperability and survival skills in freezing conditions. The multinational exercise focuses on command and control of a combined battalion while honing cold-weather survival techniques essential for Arctic operations. The 10th Mountain Division is a specialized U.S. Army unit renowned for its expertise in cold-weather and mountain warfare. Trained to operate in extreme conditions, the division is equipped with specialized gear and undergoes rigorous training in winter survival, cross-country skiing, and mountaineering. Its soldiers are capable of performing combat operations in harsh environments, from snow-covered mountains to high-altitude terrains. With a legacy dating back to World War II, the division has proven its adaptability in diverse regions, including Afghanistan, and remains a vital asset for both cold-weather and mountainous combat, often participating in joint multinational exercises to enhance interoperability in such conditions. The exercise is not just about survival, however. It also plays a vital role in NATO’s defense posture, particularly in the High North. 'Operating in the high-north allows NATO forces to train our warfighting tasks to be prepared to respond in conflict or crisis,' said Gen. Christopher Donahue, Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe and Africa. The training helps ensure that NATO forces can operate together seamlessly, reinforcing the Alliance’s defense commitments made during the 2024 NATO summit in Washington, D.C. More than 110 U.S. Army soldiers from the 41st Field Artillery Brigade will also participate, deploying from Grafenwoehr, Germany, to Bardufoss, Norway. This segment of the exercise will showcase U.S. forces' ability to deliver long-range precision fires in Arctic conditions, a critical capability in defending the region’s strategic interests. The U.S. Army’s participation in Arctic Forge 25 and its ongoing focus on Arctic readiness underscore the U.S. military’s commitment to safeguarding national interests in the region. By developing the necessary operational capabilities, the U.S. is positioning itself to respond to any potential threats in a region increasingly seen as vital to global stability. In addition to military preparedness, the Arctic region is also a significant focus of U.S. foreign policy, and recent decisions by former President Donald Trump, following his return to office in 2025, underscore this growing emphasis. The Arctic’s strategic importance has only intensified under his leadership, and his administration’s actions reflect a broader strategy aimed at securing U.S. influence in the region. One of Trump’s first actions was to focus on enhancing the U.S. military presence in the Arctic, particularly as tensions with Russia and China continue to rise. His administration has also revived previous plans, such as the proposal to expand U.S. military operations in the Arctic, which is seen as crucial to maintaining control over emerging shipping routes and securing valuable resources. Trump’s broader defense policies have continued to center on national security and military strength, with a particular focus on ensuring that the U.S. maintains superiority in contested regions like the Arctic. His moves also involve pushing back against growing foreign influence in the region, especially from Russia and China, who have expanded their military and economic activities in the Arctic in recent years. Furthermore, Trump’s emphasis on military readiness is aligned with his broader vision of strengthening U.S. defense capabilities worldwide, making the Arctic a strategic focal point of his second term. Additionally, Trump has pursued a more isolationist and America-first approach to foreign policy, as evidenced by his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement and his skepticism towards multilateral environmental initiatives. Despite facing legal challenges from environmental groups and states like California, Trump remains committed to his vision of promoting energy independence, which includes continued exploration of Arctic oil and gas reserves. Trump’s recent actions also include a continuation of his aggressive stance on China, with new measures aimed at limiting Chinese access to critical infrastructure and strengthening U.S. national security against technological influence from Beijing. This is in line with his previous policies and represents a broader strategy of reinforcing U.S. power in critical regions such as the Arctic. In sum, the Arctic region remains a critical area of interest for global armed forces, and with the continued influence of leaders like Trump, it is likely to see increased military and geopolitical attention. The U.S. Army’s exercises, such as Arctic Forge 25, and the broader strategic shifts under Trump’s presidency, reflect the growing significance of this region as a cornerstone of U.S. defense and foreign policy. As military activities in the Arctic intensify, both NATO forces and Arctic nations will continue to adapt and prepare for a future shaped by global competition and environmental changes.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-us-army-deploys-11th-airborne-and-10th-mountain-divisions-to-arctic-to-secure-strategic-interests	2025-02-06T01:27:41-08:00	
Singapore Navy Relies on MARSEC USVs to Ensure Surveillance of Strait	The Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) officially began autonomous deployments of its Maritime Security Unmanned Surface Vessels (MARSEC USVs) in January 2025.
