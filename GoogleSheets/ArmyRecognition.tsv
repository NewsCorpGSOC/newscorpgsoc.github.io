Its adaptable cargo bay can accommodate up to 108 paratroopers, helicopters, or a mix of troops and cargo, while its onboard systems enable autonomous operations, even on short or rough airstrips. The aircraft can also undertake missions such as medical evacuation, aerial refueling, and transport in crisis zones. The A400M incorporates advanced technologies, including a night-vision-compatible glass cockpit, fly-by-wire controls, and modern defensive aids such as radar and infrared detectors, electronic countermeasures, and flare dispensers. Its robust and innovative design, including composite wings and woven-fiber propellers, makes it more efficient and reliable than its predecessors. Capable of operating at low altitudes or up to 11,300 meters, it offers flexibility, performance, and reduced operating costs, meeting the demands of both military and humanitarian missions. Despite these recognized capabilities, the A400M has struggled to attract new clients in Europe, where countries like the Netherlands and Sweden have opted for Embraer's C-390 Millennium to modernize their aging C-130 Hercules fleets. In this context, Poland presents a significant opportunity for Airbus. The country, seeking to replace its second-hand C-130E/H aircraft acquired from the United States, has been identified by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius as a potential client. During a visit to Airbus's Bremen facility, which produces the A400M’s fuselage, Pistorius confirmed a 'very specific interest' from Poland and noted that discussions are ongoing. Reports suggest that the Polish Air Force could consider acquiring ten aircraft. However, the A400M program faces substantial challenges. German labor unions warn that production could cease as early as 2027 or 2028 if no strategic decisions are made. This outlook raises concerns, particularly for workers at the Bremen facility, a key site in the aircraft's manufacturing process. Following Pistorius's visit, A400M program director Gerd Weber emphasized the critical situation. While Germany, as the largest operator with 53 aircraft, has met its contractual obligations, export orders remain insufficient to offset reduced purchases from historical clients such as Spain and France. This situation has also highlighted tensions over the distribution of production value. According to observers cited by Hartpunkt, it is problematic that France and Spain retain equivalent shares in production despite their reduced orders, as this contradicts the usual European practice of proportional value distribution in defense projects. In response, German unions have proposed relocating the A400M’s final assembly line from Seville to Bremen, adding to the existing challenges among European partners. Amid this uncertain environment, Airbus and its partner nations are intensifying efforts to promote the A400M internationally. German Defense Minister Pistorius has reaffirmed his government’s commitment to supporting the export of this strategic aircraft, while negotiations with Poland offer a potential lifeline for the program. Nonetheless, the A400M’s future depends on swift decisions and strengthened cooperation among stakeholders to overcome the economic and industrial challenges threatening its continuity. Poland’s interest in the A400M represents a significant opportunity for Airbus in the context of declining orders and uncertainties about production sustainability. However, the situation remains critical, requiring urgent action to safeguard this emblem of European aeronautical industry—one that embodies shared technological ambitions yet faces the realities of global markets and shifting national priorities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/polands-interest-in-airbus-a400m-revives-export-prospects-for-european-transport-aircraft	2025-01-27T00:32:08-08:00

Breaking News: US Greenlights MK-84 Bombs for Israel Despite US President Donald Trump's Foreign Military Sales Pause	On January 25, 2025, The New York Times reported that despite a temporary three-month halt on foreign military sales imposed by President Donald Trump, the U.S. government is preparing to proceed with a significant shipment of bombs to Israel. This shipment will include 1,800 MK-84 bombs, a variant of the general-purpose bomb that has been used extensively by the U.S. and allied forces for decades. According to an anonymous White House official, the 900 kg (2,000-pound) bombs are set to be delivered to Israel as part of continued U.S. military support following the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An Israeli F-35I fighter jet from the 5601 Testing Squadron, equipped with Mk-84 bombs fitted with GBU-31 JDAM kits, prior to a bomb release test. (Picture source: Wikimedia) The MK-84 is an American-made high-explosive, general-purpose bomb with a weight of around 900 kg (2,000 pounds), making it one of the largest bombs in the U.S. arsenal. This bomb is designed to deliver a massive payload of explosives, capable of devastating both hardened and soft targets. The bomb is filled with a large charge of trinitrotoluene (TNT) or an explosive equivalent and is known for its extensive blast radius and ability to penetrate deep into structures before detonating. Due to its sheer destructive power, the MK-84 is often employed against large infrastructure targets such as military installations, enemy supply lines, and heavily fortified structures. However, despite its combat effectiveness, the MK-84 is generally considered too lethal for urban combat, particularly in densely populated areas. Its blast radius and potential for collateral damage are significant concerns, especially when dealing with targets near civilian zones. U.S. military officers have expressed reservations about deploying such powerful ordnance in environments where minimizing civilian casualties is a priority. For this reason, its use in Gaza, where Hamas operates in urban settings, has sparked ongoing debates within defense circles about its appropriateness. The U.S. decision to supply Israel with the MK-84 bombs is part of a broader military support strategy that has included various munitions throughout the conflict with Hamas in Gaza. This support is crucial as Israel continues to confront a complex battlefield, where Hamas has built a vast network of tunnels and underground facilities in densely populated areas. While critics argue that the MK-84’s destructive power can lead to heavy civilian casualties, proponents stress its utility against Hamas’s fortified positions. The bombs’ ability to target hardened structures such as tunnels, weapon caches, and command centers provides the Israeli military with a critical advantage in neutralizing Hamas’s infrastructure. The MK-84 bomb is a versatile weapon that can be deployed by several different aircraft platforms, making it an asset in joint operations across various theaters of war. It is typically dropped by aircraft equipped with specialized bomb racks, and it is compatible with a wide range of combat aircraft, including the U.S. and Israeli F-15 and F-16 fighters, which are key components of the Israeli Air Force’s tactical capabilities. These aircraft are capable of delivering a wide range of ordinance, including the MK-84, with precision targeting systems, ensuring that the bombs are released with maximum effectiveness. Israel’s advanced F-35 stealth fighters are also capable of carrying and deploying the MK-84. With its advanced avionics and stealth capabilities, the F-35 can deliver this heavy ordinance with minimal risk of detection, making it particularly useful in high-stakes operations where stealth and surprise are paramount. Additionally, while the U.S. B-52 bomber, though not currently in active service with Israel, can also carry the MK-84, its use would likely be limited to larger, strategic bombing missions, as would be the case with the B-1B Lancer and B-2 Spirit bombers, which are also capable of deploying the MK-84. The MK-84 bomb shipment comes at a critical time as Israel continues its military operations in Gaza. Following the U.S. government's pause on foreign military sales, the shipment of these bombs signals a return to normalcy in defense aid. Throughout the Biden administration's tenure, the U.S. has sent a variety of munitions to Israel, including precision-guided munitions, bombs, and ammunition, to help bolster its defense against Hamas and other militant groups operating in the region. Notably, the Biden administration has faced internal and external pressures regarding the continued supply of weapons to Israel, particularly due to concerns over civilian casualties. However, U.S. officials have justified their support by emphasizing the need to ensure Israel’s right to self-defense and its ability to combat threats posed by Hamas. While the MK-84 bomb remains one of the most powerful and destructive bombs in the U.S. arsenal, its role in modern warfare is balanced by its potential for collateral damage. As the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues, the use of such heavy ordnance in urban environments will likely remain a contentious issue, but its effectiveness in striking heavily fortified targets in Gaza ensures its continued presence in Israel’s military inventory. With the resumption of bomb shipments, the U.S. is reinforcing its strategic partnership with Israel as both nations work to address the ongoing security threats in the Middle East.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-us-greenlights-mk-84-bombs-for-israel-despite-us-president-donald-trumps-military-sales-pause	2025-01-26T07:34:47-08:00

Sea mines, in general, have long been a weapon of choice in asymmetric warfare. They are particularly effective in chokepoints or high-traffic maritime areas where they can significantly hinder the movement of enemy naval forces or commercial shipping. By using a rocket artillery system to deploy these mines, Iran has found a way to enhance its capacity for maritime denial, particularly in critical corridors like the Strait of Hormuz or the Bab-el-Mandeb. Given the importance of these waterways in global energy transit, the ability to use rockets to rapidly and covertly lay sea mines could have disastrous economic and geopolitical consequences. Iran’s development of this capability is not entirely unprecedented, though it is relatively unique. Countries like Russia have also employed artillery-based systems for laying mines. Russia’s Zemledeliye system, for instance, uses rocket artillery to deploy mines in both land and sea environments. This method allows for the rapid establishment of minefields and can be employed to target both land forces and maritime vessels. Such systems have become increasingly important in modern warfare, particularly for nations and militias that lack the resources to compete with superior naval powers directly. The concept of using missile-launched sea mines is gaining traction in many parts of the world, with countries like North Korea and Ukraine also having explored similar methods to challenge more technologically advanced adversaries. Despite this, Iran's application of the Fajr-5 to lay sea mines is particularly significant due to the strategic context in which it is deployed. The ability to lay mines using MLRS systems can significantly alter the balance of power in maritime regions, particularly in the Middle East. For instance, if Iran’s MLRS capabilities were to be shared with proxy groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon or the Houthi rebels in Yemen, these groups could gain access to a highly effective method of disrupting the flow of global energy. In fact, it is precisely in these contested regions that the tactical advantage of laying mines without the need for traditional naval assets becomes most apparent. Groups that might otherwise be unable to challenge the naval might of Western powers could employ such systems to effectively cut off vital maritime routes, creating uncertainty and economic disruption on a global scale. The use of the Fajr-5 MLRS for laying sea mines underscores the broader strategic shift towards asymmetric warfare in which countries and non-state actors are increasingly relying on low-cost, high-impact tactics to undermine superior military forces. This tactic, while not entirely unique, adds to the growing trend of countries and factions leveraging missile systems in unconventional ways to achieve tactical goals. For Iran, which is already well-versed in asymmetric naval tactics, the ability to rapidly and covertly lay sea mines enhances its power projection in strategic maritime regions. The global ramifications of this new development could be far-reaching. The Strait of Hormuz, through which a significant portion of the world’s oil supply passes, could become a highly contested zone. The ability to rapidly lay sea mines in such areas could give Iran—or any actor equipped with similar technology—substantial leverage over global shipping and energy flows. In times of conflict, such minefields could cripple naval operations, halt commercial shipping, and disrupt the global economy. As tensions in the region continue to simmer, this new capability becomes a tool of naval denial, forcing adversaries to reconsider their strategies in regions where free passage has traditionally been guaranteed. Iran’s recent demonstration of using the Fajr-5 MLRS to lay sea mines represents a game-changing development in modern naval tactics. While missile-based mine-laying is not entirely new, the use of the Fajr-5 system for this purpose adds a new layer of asymmetric warfare to Iran’s already extensive military playbook. The potential for other nations or proxy groups to adopt similar strategies raises serious questions about the future of maritime security, particularly in regions vital to global trade and energy. As more nations and militant groups gain access to such technologies, the world may see an increasing number of missile-laid minefields, which could reshape the landscape of modern naval warfare.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-iran-demonstrates-fajr-5-rocket-launcher-for-sea-mine-laying-threatening-global-maritime-security	2025-01-26T02:05:03-08:00	
Exclusive: US Navy USS Lyndon B. Johnson Destroyer to Integrate Hypersonic Missiles Enhancing Modern Naval Warfare	The U.S. Navy's USS Zumwalt class destroyer is poised for a major leap in combat capabilities with the integration of hypersonic missile systems. According to a recent report from Interesting Engineer, the USS Lyndon B. Johnson, a ship within the Zumwalt-class, is set to undergo rigorous testing as the first at-sea platform equipped with the next-generation hypersonic missile system. This significant milestone underscores the Navy’s ongoing modernization efforts and its commitment to fielding cutting-edge technology. The integration of the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapon system, a key component of the U.S. military’s hypersonic capabilities, will position the Zumwalt-class as a formidable force in future naval combat.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The USS Lyndon B. Johnson Zumwalt-class destroyer undergoes significant modernization, with the two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems replaced by hypersonic missile launchers, enhancing its offensive capabilities for long-range precision strikes. (Picture source: Wikimedia) The Zumwalt class is a series of advanced guided-missile destroyers designed with versatility in mind. These ships are built to handle various missions, from precision strikes to air and missile defense. Recognized for their stealthy appearance, Zumwalt-class ships feature a reduced radar cross-section, which allows them to operate covertly and evade detection in hostile environments. The class is equipped with advanced technologies, such as an integrated power system, a highly efficient hull shape, and the capacity to deploy both conventional and sophisticated weaponry. Initially intended to be equipped with a 155mm Advanced Gun System (AGS) for shore bombardment, the Zumwalt-class ships have undergone significant modifications to suit modern naval warfare needs better. These changes have transformed the ships into highly adaptable platforms capable of housing more advanced weapon systems. Hypersonic missiles represent a transformative shift in naval warfare, and their inclusion in Zumwalt-class destroyers will significantly enhance the offensive capabilities of the fleet. Hypersonic weapons are defined as projectiles that travel at speeds greater than Mach 5—five times the speed of sound. This extreme velocity, combined with their maneuverability, makes hypersonic missiles incredibly difficult for traditional missile defense systems to intercept. As such, they offer a significant advantage over conventional missiles. In the context of naval warfare, hypersonic missiles bring several strategic benefits. First, their high speed drastically reduces the reaction time available to enemy defense systems, making it more difficult for adversaries to mount an effective countermeasure. Hypersonic missiles are also highly maneuverable during flight, enabling them to adjust their trajectories unpredictably, further complicating interception efforts. Additionally, these missiles are capable of long-range precision strikes, allowing naval forces to target critical assets from distances well beyond the reach of conventional weapons. The CPS system, for example, is designed to strike targets over 1,000 nautical miles away, which is ideal for engaging adversary targets in highly contested regions without the need for close proximity. The speed and unpredictability of hypersonic missiles also allow for surprise attacks, overwhelming enemy defenses before they can react. The transformation of the Zumwalt class destroyer to accommodate hypersonic missile systems began in 2023, marking a pivotal step in the Navy’s strategic shift. The first phase of this modernization involved removing the ship's original 155mm AGS, which had proven to be ineffective for modern operational needs. In its place, four vertical launch system (VLS) missile tubes were installed. Each VLS tube is capable of launching three hypersonic missiles, providing the Zumwalt class with the ability to carry up to 12 of these advanced munitions. This redesign required substantial modifications, including reconfiguring the ship’s bow to house the new missile tubes and integrating systems that can support hypersonic launches. Despite these changes, the ship’s rear gun mount, equipped with an auto-loading system, remains intact, preserving its multi-role combat flexibility. The inclusion of hypersonic missiles positions the Zumwalt class as a dominant offensive platform. According to Captain Lawler, the integration of the CPS weapon system makes the Zumwalt-class destroyer the 'foremost offensive surface combatant,' capable of delivering long-range precision strikes against high-value targets in future naval operations. With these enhancements, the Zumwalt class will play a crucial role in the Navy's ability to project power in maritime theaters, capable of striking strategic targets with unmatched speed and accuracy. The comparison between hypersonic and conventional missiles reveals significant advantages for the former. Conventional missiles, such as cruise or ballistic missiles, typically travel at subsonic or supersonic speeds, giving adversaries ample time to detect and intercept them. In contrast, hypersonic missiles' extreme speed makes them far more challenging to counter. Furthermore, conventional missiles tend to follow more predictable ballistic paths, making them easier to track. Hypersonic missiles, however, can alter their trajectory mid-flight, allowing them to avoid interception and penetrate even the most sophisticated missile defense systems, such as Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense or THAAD. The operational profile of the Zumwalt-class destroyer will be radically altered with the addition of hypersonic missiles. While traditional missile-equipped destroyers focus on anti-air warfare or strike missions, Zumwalt-class destroyers equipped with hypersonic weapons will be able to conduct precision strikes at far greater ranges, providing a near-guaranteed success rate against high-priority, time-sensitive targets. The ability to deliver powerful blows from such a distance offers a level of flexibility and survivability that was previously unattainable with conventional systems. With the integration of hypersonic missile systems, Zumwalt-class destroyers, especially the USS Lyndon B. Johnson, are set to become an essential part of the U.S. Navy's future combat strategy. These advanced missiles provide unprecedented speed, range, and flexibility, ensuring that Zumwalt class ships will be capable of executing rapid, precise strikes while maintaining resilience against enemy defenses. As the U.S. Navy continues to push the boundaries of technological innovation, the deployment of hypersonic missiles represents a pivotal moment in enhancing naval power projection. This transformation guarantees that the U.S. Navy will maintain its status as a dominant force in global naval warfare, ensuring operational superiority for years to come.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/exclusive-us-navy-uss-lyndon-b-johnson-destroyer-to-integrate-hypersonic-missiles-enhancing-modern-naval-warfare	2025-01-25T08:09:54-08:00

India’s Submarine Revolution: German-Indian Collaboration Brings AIP to Navy	According to information published by Reuters on January 23, 2025, the German-Indian joint venture led by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd. (MDL) has emerged as the sole contender for India's ambitious $5 billion Project-75(I) submarine program.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link German built Type 214 submarine. (Picture source: TKMS) India’s Project-75(I) is one of the most ambitious and long-awaited defense acquisition programs, aimed at revitalizing the country’s submarine fleet to counter growing threats in the Indian Ocean region. With a budget of $5 billion, the program seeks to procure six next-generation diesel-electric attack submarines equipped with cutting-edge technologies, including air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems. Following a rigorous evaluation process, the joint venture between German shipbuilder ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) and India’s Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd. (MDL) has emerged as the sole contender, after the Spanish consortium of Navantia and Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T) failed to meet critical requirements. The program was envisioned as an extension of the original Project-75, under which MDL collaborated with French company Naval Group to produce six Scorpène-class submarines. These submarines, while a significant leap forward at the time, lack AIP technology, which is now critical for modern naval operations. The objective of Project-75(I) is to develop a new class of conventional submarines that can stay submerged for extended periods, enhance stealth capabilities, and feature cutting-edge weapons and sensor systems. Despite its urgency, the project has faced delays spanning more than a decade due to procurement hurdles, technological complexities, and debates over the degree of technology transfer required under the 'Make in India' initiative. TKMS brings to the table its highly advanced Type 214 submarine, a proven platform that has been adopted by navies in Germany, Greece, South Korea, and Turkey. The Type 214 features an advanced hydrogen fuel cell-based AIP system, which enables the submarine to remain submerged for up to two weeks without surfacing. This system operates silently, significantly reducing the submarine’s acoustic signature, a critical factor in modern anti-submarine warfare. Navantia proposed a design based on its S-80 Plus submarine, which is still under development and has yet to achieve operational deployment. The S-80 Plus relies on a bio-ethanol reformer-based AIP system, which converts bio-ethanol into hydrogen for powering fuel cells. While innovative, this system has not been field-proven to the extent of TKMS's AIP technology. Moreover, Navantia’s design faced setbacks in the past, including issues with buoyancy calculations that delayed Spain’s own submarine program. These technical challenges may have undermined confidence in their ability to meet the Indian Navy’s rigorous specifications. In terms of industrial partnership, Larsen &amp; Toubro is a leading Indian defense company with significant expertise in shipbuilding and engineering. However, its collaboration with Navantia was relatively nascent compared to the established relationship between TKMS and MDL, which had successfully navigated previous submarine-building challenges under Project-75. The centerpiece of the competition was the AIP system, a transformative technology for diesel-electric submarines. Conventional submarines without AIP must surface or use a snorkel to recharge their batteries, making them vulnerable to detection. AIP systems, by contrast, allow prolonged underwater endurance and enhanced stealth. The hydrogen fuel cell system used by TKMS is regarded as one of the most mature and efficient AIP technologies available. It operates silently, generates no vibrations, and produces minimal heat, making detection by thermal and acoustic sensors difficult. Navantia’s bio-ethanol reformer-based AIP system, while innovative, introduces potential complexities in fuel management and system integration. Its unproven track record compared unfavorably to TKMS’s operationally validated system, which has seen years of deployment and performance refinement. Both contenders proposed submarines capable of carrying heavyweight torpedoes, anti-ship missiles, and land-attack cruise missiles. TKMS’s Type 214 is already compatible with a range of munitions, including the DM2A4 SeaHake torpedoes and Harpoon anti-ship missiles. The S-80 Plus, while theoretically offering similar versatility, is still undergoing integration testing for many of these systems. On the sensor front, both designs emphasized advanced sonar suites, electronic warfare capabilities, and integrated combat management systems. However, TKMS’s submarines benefit from operational feedback from multiple navies, whereas the S-80 Plus remains in developmental stages. With a rapidly aging fleet and increasing threats from China's expanding submarine force and Pakistan’s AIP-equipped Agosta-class submarines, the Indian Navy urgently requires these advanced platforms. Selecting a proven design like the Type 214 minimizes developmental risks and ensures timely delivery. If negotiations proceed as planned, the first submarine from Project-75(I) could enter service within three to five years.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/indias-submarine-revolution-german-indian-collaboration-brings-aip-to-navy	2025-01-24T07:02:18-08:00

Such mobility is crucial for ensuring that missile assets remain operational and less vulnerable during high-stakes situations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A Mid-Range Capability (MRC) Typhon missile launcher from Charlie Battery, 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment (Long Range Fires Battalion), 1st Multi-Domain Task Force, arrives in Northern Luzon, Philippines, on April 8, 2024, marking the system’s first operational deployment in the region. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The MRC Mid-Range Capability, also called Typhon missile system, is a highly versatile and powerful missile system designed for surface-to-surface operations. The system is primarily equipped with two types of advanced missiles: the SM-6 and the Tomahawk cruise missile. These missiles are key to the U.S. military’s strategy in the Indo-Pacific, providing both offensive and defensive capabilities over extended ranges. The SM-6 missile, with a range of up to 500 km, is a multi-role missile that is used to engage a variety of targets, including enemy aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. It is primarily deployed aboard U.S. Navy surface ships as part of the Aegis Combat System, but with the Typhon system, it is being adapted for land-based operations. The SM-6 is integral to U.S. missile defense, providing long-range interception against air threats and contributing to regional stability by offering an advanced defense layer. Its versatility makes it suitable for anti-air and missile defense, crucial for the protection of U.S. assets in high-threat environments. In contrast, the Tomahawk cruise missile, with a range of up to 2,500 km, is a long-range precision strike weapon designed for deep penetration into hostile territory. It is used to target high-value land targets, such as enemy command centers, missile sites, and critical infrastructure. The Tomahawk’s accuracy and ability to strike from long distances make it an ideal tool for projecting U.S. military power and engaging adversaries without the need for manned aircraft or carrier strike groups. Its long range also positions it as a critical asset in regions like the South China Sea, where the U.S. must maintain a credible deterrence against China’s growing military presence. The redeployment of the MRC Typhon missile launcher system to Luzon is part of a broader effort by the U.S. military to refine its approach to force projection in the Indo-Pacific. According to the Philippine government source, the redeployment's primary goal is to assess how quickly and efficiently the missile batteries can be moved to new positions. Such flexibility is critical in an environment where rapid repositioning can increase the survivability of military assets during a potential conflict. The move also reflects the U.S. military's commitment to ensuring that its missile systems can be quickly repositioned across the region, making them harder to target and increasing their overall effectiveness in the face of emerging threats. The Typhon missile system was first deployed in the Philippines in April 2024 during a training exercise, a move that drew strong criticism from China. The Chinese government condemned the deployment, viewing it as an escalation of U.S. military presence in the region and a direct challenge to China's growing influence, particularly in the South China Sea. In response, Beijing reiterated its concerns about the militarization of the region, accusing the U.S. of exacerbating tensions and undermining regional stability. However, the U.S. maintains that the deployment of these advanced missile systems is a necessary countermeasure to China's increasing military assertiveness, particularly its ongoing efforts to establish control over disputed territories in the South China Sea and its growing missile capabilities. The MRC Typhon missile launcher system's combination of the SM-6 and Tomahawk provides the U.S. with a potent mix of defense and offense. The SM-6 enhances the U.S. Navy’s capability to defend against aerial threats at extended ranges, while the Tomahawk provides a means to strike enemy targets far beyond the reach of most conventional systems. This combination gives the U.S. military a powerful deterrent in the region, especially in scenarios involving anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) systems, which are central to China's defense strategy. The ability to engage air and ground targets from a land-based position extends the reach of U.S. forces and complements existing naval and air assets, enabling a more flexible and layered defense posture. The U.S. military's ongoing presence in the Philippines, with the deployment of advanced systems like Typhon, is also indicative of the deepening U.S.-Philippine security cooperation. The Philippines, which has territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea, benefits from the presence of U.S. missile systems that can protect its sovereignty and ensure regional stability. The Typhon’s ability to operate from Philippine territory allows the U.S. to project power while also strengthening the defensive capabilities of its ally in the region. Furthermore, the mobility of the Typhon system ensures that U.S. forces can respond swiftly to any escalation in the region, maintaining a strong deterrent presence against potential adversaries. The redeployment of Typhon to Luzon is also a strategic measure to refine the U.S. military’s overall posture in the Indo-Pacific. The ability to quickly reposition key missile assets in the region provides the U.S. with greater flexibility and operational readiness. In the event of a crisis, this capacity for rapid relocation makes U.S. missile systems less vulnerable to preemptive strikes and ensures that they can continue to operate effectively across a vast and contested region. This increased mobility also enhances the system’s survivability, which is essential in the event of a conflict with a peer competitor like China. The redeployment of the MRC Typhon missile launcher system to Luzon enhances the U.S. military’s ability to project power, defend allies, and deter potential adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region. By combining the defensive capabilities of the SM-6 with the long-range precision strike power of the Tomahawk, the Typhon system provides a highly flexible and capable tool for responding to threats in a region marked by growing geopolitical tension. The U.S. military's focus on mobility, survivability, and strategic flexibility in its missile systems ensures that it can maintain a credible deterrent against China and other regional challengers, while strengthening its defense commitments to allies like the Philippines. As tensions in the South China Sea and surrounding areas continue to rise, the Typhon missile system is poised to play a pivotal role in the U.S. military's efforts to maintain regional stability and safeguard its interests in the Indo-Pacific.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-us-redeploys-mrc-typhon-surface-to-surface-missile-launchers-in-philippines-to-test-rapid-mobility	2025-01-23T07:47:26-08:00

Flash News: US Navy Arleigh Burke destroyer USS Spruance scores impressive missiles & UAVs downs in Red Sea Battle	According to information published by the US DoD on January 18, 2025, the USS Spruance (DDG-111), an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, emerged from a recent engagement in the Red Sea bearing thirteen new mission marks. These marks signify a successful defense against a diverse and complex array of threats, underscoring the ship's readiness and its crew's proficiency in operating naval systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link USS Spruance (DDG-111) returns to port bearing 13 mission marks after successfully intercepting ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and UAVs in a high-stakes engagement against Houthi forces in the Red Sea. (Picture source: US DoD) At the core of the USS Spruance’s defense is the Aegis Combat System, a fully integrated combat management system designed to process vast amounts of sensor data and coordinate the ship’s weapons to neutralize diverse threats. The Aegis system is centered around the AN/SPY-1D(V) radar and the ship’s command and control suite, which collectively provide rapid detection, tracking, and engagement across multiple domains. The AN/SPY-1D(V) radar is a high-power, multi-function phased-array radar that operates in the S-band frequency range. It is capable of detecting and tracking hundreds of targets simultaneously, including low-observable threats such as sea-skimming cruise missiles and high-altitude ballistic missiles. The radar’s phased-array technology eliminates the need for moving parts, allowing it to maintain constant surveillance over its area of coverage. During the engagement, this radar was responsible for detecting inbound threats at their maximum range, providing critical early-warning data. Once threats were detected, the Aegis Command and Decision Suite processed the data and classified the targets based on their threat level. The system’s real-time processing capability enables rapid assignment of weapons to targets, prioritizing engagements based on speed, proximity, and lethality. This ensures that the ship’s defenses are neither overwhelmed nor misallocated during a multi-vector attack. The interception of three anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) by the USS Spruance represents a significant technological achievement. Ballistic missiles follow a high-arcing trajectory and typically re-enter the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds, often exceeding Mach 5. These characteristics make them extremely challenging targets, requiring precise timing and advanced intercept technology. The Aegis BMD system, an upgraded component of the ship’s combat suite, provides the capability to track and intercept ballistic missiles during their midcourse or terminal phase. When the AN/SPY-1D(V) radar detected the inbound ASBMs, the Aegis system calculated their trajectory, speed, and re-entry path. This data was shared with regional and space-based sensors through the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), creating a unified threat picture. To neutralize the ASBMs, the Spruance likely launched Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) interceptors from its Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS). The SM-3 is a hit-to-kill interceptor designed specifically for ballistic missile engagements. It uses a multi-stage booster to achieve high velocity and deploys a kinetic kill vehicle (KKV) in the missile’s terminal phase. The KKV does not carry an explosive warhead; instead, it relies on sheer kinetic energy to destroy the target by colliding with it at high speed. For terminal-phase threats closer to the ship, the Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) could have been employed. The SM-6 is a dual-role missile capable of intercepting both ballistic and air-breathing threats, such as cruise missiles, at extended ranges. Its active radar seeker and advanced guidance system make it particularly effective in dealing with maneuvering re-entry vehicles (RVs). The interception of three anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) further illustrates the Spruance’s layered defensive architecture. Cruise missiles, which fly at low altitudes and often use terrain-following radar to evade detection, are designed to overwhelm shipboard defenses with speed and maneuverability. The SPY-1D(V) radar played a pivotal role in detecting these missiles despite their low-altitude flight paths and potentially stealthy designs. Upon detection, the Aegis system assigned Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) interceptors for mid-range engagements. The SM-2 employs semi-active radar homing, guided by the ship’s radar, to track and intercept the target. Its dual-thrust rocket motor provides the necessary speed and range to engage cruise missiles before they reach their terminal phase. For threats that penetrated closer to the ship, the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) likely came into play. The ESSM is designed for point defense and is capable of engaging highly maneuverable targets at short ranges. Its active radar seeker provides high accuracy, while its advanced control surfaces enable rapid course adjustments to counter evasive maneuvers. Additionally, the ship’s Mk 99 Fire Control System directed the engagement, ensuring precise guidance of each interceptor. This system uses radar illuminators to 'paint' the target, providing the SM-2 and ESSM with continuous updates on the target’s location and trajectory during flight. The successful interception of seven UAVs showcased the Spruance’s ability to counter the growing use of drones in asymmetric warfare. UAVs are often deployed in swarms to saturate defenses and are particularly challenging to detect due to their small radar cross-sections and erratic flight patterns. The ship’s Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) likely played a central role in UAV defense. The CIWS, commonly referred to as 'Phalanx,' is a 20mm Gatling gun mounted on a swiveling turret. It is radar-guided and designed for last-ditch defense against incoming threats. Operating at a rate of up to 4,500 rounds per minute, the CIWS can effectively destroy small, fast-moving targets like UAVs at ranges of 1-2 kilometers. Electronic warfare measures, such as the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), complemented kinetic defenses. SEWIP provides advanced electronic attack capabilities, allowing the ship to disrupt the command, control, and navigation systems of UAVs. By jamming communication links, SEWIP can render drones ineffective without expending munitions. The Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) on the USS Spruance provides the foundation for its multi-mission flexibility. With 96 launch cells, the ship can carry a mix of interceptors, land-attack missiles, and anti-submarine weapons, tailored to mission requirements. The VLS uses a 'hot launch' system, where missiles are ignited within the cell and expelled upward through a hatch. This system allows for rapid, sequential launches, ensuring the ship can respond to high-intensity engagements like the one in the Red Sea. The ability to switch seamlessly between different types of munitions—such as SM-2 for air defense, SM-3 for ballistic missile defense, and ESSM for point defense—gives the Spruance unmatched tactical flexibility.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/flash-news-us-navy-arleigh-burke-destroyer-uss-spruance-scores-impressive-missiles-uavs-downs-in-red-sea-battle	2025-01-23T03:50:54-08:00

Israel's Rafael upgrades its Trophy active protection system to counter kamikaze drones	During the Defence IQ International Armoured Vehicles (IAV) conference, held in Farnborough, UK, from January 21 to 23, 2025, the Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defence Systems announced an upgrade to its Trophy Active Protection System (APS) to intercept drones. According to a company representative, the enhancement addresses challenges posed by low-altitude aerial threats, including commercially available drones, kamikaze drones, and larger fixed-wing UAVs. The upgrade, requiring software adjustments and minor hardware changes, is compatible with existing systems used by operators in the United States and Europe.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By 2017, the Trophy APS had accumulated 50,000 operational hours since its introduction in 2011, showcasing its effectiveness in both low- and high-intensity combat across urban, open, and forested environments. (Picture source: Rafael Advanced Defence Systems) During testing, the upgraded Trophy system, mounted on a 30 mm turret, successfully intercepted a jet-powered fixed-wing drone classified between classes 2 and 3. The drone approached in a near-vertical dive. Rafael emphasized that these enhancements were achieved without altering the system’s core hardware. In addition to drone interception, Trophy has been updated based on operational experience, including lessons learned from conflicts in Gaza and northern Israel. These improvements address the system’s performance against short-range threats in urban environments and long-range threats such as ATGMs in open terrain. A representative of EuroTrophy—a joint venture between Rafael, GDELS, and KNDS to market Trophy in Europe—stated that the system has achieved high interception rates during conflicts. The venture is working to integrate Trophy onto platforms like the MGCS and ASCOD infantry fighting vehicles, as well as three European 8x8 armored vehicles. The representative noted that Trophy contributes to operational effectiveness by providing consistent vehicle protection, which is critical for mission continuity. They also highlighted the operational challenges commanders face when vehicle losses threaten the success of an operation. The Trophy APS, also known as 'Windbreaker,' was developed by Rafael Advanced Defence Systems in collaboration with Elta Systems to counter modern anti-armor threats such as ATGMs, RPGs, and other anti-tank weapons. Development began in the 1980s to enhance the survivability of armored vehicles in urban and open battlefields, with the system becoming operational in 2009 and achieving its first recorded interception in 2011. Variants have been developed for different vehicle weight classes, including Trophy HV for heavy vehicles, Trophy MV for medium vehicles, and Trophy LV for light vehicles. Trophy's functionality is based on the Elta EL/M-2133 fire-control radar, which uses four flat-panel antennas to provide 360-degree coverage. When detecting an incoming projectile, it calculates the approach vector, threat type, time to impact, and angle. Rotating launchers deploy Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs) in a precise pattern to neutralize threats at a safe distance. The system counters ATGMs, high-explosive anti-tank rounds, RPGs, and similar threats. It can engage multiple threats simultaneously on stationary and moving vehicles and integrates with C4I systems and remote-controlled weapons stations. Newer models feature automated reloading for consecutive engagements. By 2023, the production of the Trophy APS increased to 40 units and 500 countermeasures per month, as it has been deployed on tanks like Israeli Merkava Mark 3 and 4, the American Abrams, the German Leopard 2A7A1 and 2A8, as well as the British Challenger 3. (Picture source: Rafael Advanced Defence Systems) The Trophy APS has been operational since 2011, demonstrating success in low- and high-intensity combat across urban, open, and forested environments. It has intercepted threats like Kornet ATGMs and RPG-29s. By 2017, Trophy accumulated 50,000 operational hours, and by 2023, production reached 40 units and 500 countermeasures per month. The radar system can share data with other vehicles, enabling improved threat coordination and targeting. It can identify whether a projectile will miss its target, withholding countermeasures and sharing data for tactical use. Reports suggest it offers protection against certain top-attack missiles and is used in Israel and the U.S. However, the Trophy APS has limitations. It cannot counter kinetic energy penetrators and is vulnerable to direct top-down attacks, as demonstrated in 2023 when drones dropped grenades on protected vehicles. Its weight, approximately 500 kilograms, may impact the performance of lighter vehicles. The use of EFPs poses risks to nearby infantry, complicating operations involving dismounted soldiers. Techniques such as rapid successive missile firings, ultra-close-range RPG attacks, and supersonic projectiles have exploited system weaknesses. Conflicts in 2023 and 2024 highlighted instances where the system was overwhelmed, with video evidence showing some failures. Rafael representatives emphasized that despite its new anti-drone capability, Trophy alone cannot provide comprehensive air defense against drones. They advocate a layered defense strategy incorporating mobility, lethality, and survivability, supported by technologies like lasers, electromagnetic spectrum control, and hard- and soft-kill systems. This approach aims to address the growing challenges posed by drones, including swarms and top-attack threats, which complicate operations for maneuver forces. Production of Trophy APS began in Israel in 2007 and in the U.S. in 2012, with a combined output of 40 systems and 500 countermeasures per month by 2023. Since 2010, it has been deployed on platforms like Israeli Merkava Mark 3 and 4 tanks, Namer APCs, and U.S. M1A2 Abrams tanks. It has been tested on Stryker APCs and Bradley Fighting Vehicles. The lighter Trophy MV/VPS version was developed for medium and light vehicles, while the Trophy LV is designed for vehicles under 8 tons. It has been integrated into Germany's Leopard 2A7A1 tanks and is included in orders for the Leopard 2A8. The UK has signed contracts to evaluate it for Challenger 3 tanks. Other potential operators include Croatia, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/israels-rafael-upgrades-its-trophy-active-protection-system-to-counter-kamikaze-drones	2025-01-23T01:47:31-08:00

Royal Navy Confronts Russian Ship in Channel as UK Strengthens Undersea Security	According to information published by the UK MoD on January 22, 2025, the Royal Navy recently intercepted and tracked the Russian spy ship Yantar as it moved through the English Channel. This latest development reflects the UK’s intensified efforts to counter potential threats to undersea infrastructure, which is increasingly seen as a target of strategic importance. Yantar, known for its specialized surveillance capabilities, has been under scrutiny for its potential to interfere with critical assets such as undersea cables and pipelines.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Project 22010-class intelligence ship and a Type 23 frigate HMS Somerset. (Picture source: UK MoD) This is not the first encounter between Yantar and British forces. Late last year, the vessel was observed lingering near key infrastructure in UK waters, prompting the Royal Navy to send a submarine to surface near Yantar and issue a pointed warning. Following that incident, the vessel left UK territory for the Mediterranean. Its return this week has reignited concerns over its intentions, leading to its close monitoring by the frigate HMS Somerset as it transited the Channel. The broader context for these developments is the rising tension over the security of offshore infrastructure across Europe. Undersea cables, which carry the vast majority of the world’s internet traffic, and pipelines, essential for energy supplies, have become focal points of geopolitical vulnerability. Recent damage to the Estlink2 undersea cable between Estonia and Finland has heightened these concerns, prompting NATO to launch new measures to protect these critical assets. The UK is playing a leading role in these efforts, deploying advanced capabilities to deter and monitor threats. As part of the NATO Baltic Sentry initiative, the UK is contributing advanced P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and Rivet Joint surveillance platforms. These assets are designed to bolster reconnaissance and response capabilities in regions where the risk to undersea infrastructure is particularly acute. At the heart of Britain’s response is a new AI-driven system known as Nordic Warden. This technology, recently activated, leverages real-time data from a variety of sources to track and analyze ship movements, assessing the potential risks posed by suspicious vessels. Nordic Warden has been specifically configured to monitor Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet,' a network of tankers used to evade sanctions by transporting oil and gas to international buyers. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy’s RFA Proteus, equipped with submersible drones, has been a critical component in safeguarding undersea assets. Proteus, which previously shadowed Yantar during its activities in UK waters, remains on the front lines of undersea surveillance and inspection, ensuring that cables and pipelines remain secure. These efforts also dovetail with international sanctions targeting Russia’s economic lifelines. The UK has taken a prominent role in sanctioning vessels involved in evading restrictions, including tankers used to fund Russia’s ongoing military operations in Ukraine.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/royal-navy-confronts-russian-ship-in-channel-as-uk-strengthens-undersea-security	2025-01-23T01:01:34-08:00

This was Turkey's seventh tenure leading the task force, reflecting its continued commitment to maritime security. Taking over the command, the Pakistan Navy brings proven resources and capabilities to the mission. Among these, Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates like PNS Alamgir (F-260), often deployed for international operations, and Zulfiquar-class frigates such as PNS Aslat (F-254), are expected to play a key role. These vessels, equipped with advanced surveillance systems and versatile combat capabilities, are instrumental in supporting CTF 151’s efforts. Additionally, the Pakistan Navy deploys P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, which provide extensive reconnaissance and early threat detection, further enhancing the effectiveness of operations. Pakistan has also demonstrated its capacity for coordinated operations with other nations to secure international shipping routes. For instance, during Focused Operation TAHAFFUZ, the Pakistan Navy led joint efforts involving nine countries to protect global maritime trade. Furthermore, regular exercises with partners like the South Korean Navy highlight Pakistan's ongoing commitment to improving interoperability and strengthening professional ties within the framework of maritime security initiatives. Since its establishment in 2009, CTF 151 has been a cornerstone of the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), a coalition of 46 nations committed to safeguarding international maritime routes. In coordination with EUNAVFOR and independently deployed naval assets, CTF 151 patrols strategic zones such as the Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor, contributing directly to reducing piracy threats. Headquartered in Bahrain, the CMF represents the largest multinational naval partnership in the world, covering more than 8.3 million square kilometers of maritime space. Despite progress in recent years, piracy remains a persistent threat in the Gulf of Aden and surrounding areas. Historically, this region has been a focal point for piracy activities, particularly off the Somali coast. While international measures such as the European Union's Operation Atalanta significantly reduced incidents in the early 2010s, a resurgence has been observed since 2023. In January 2024, the Indian Navy rescued an Iranian fishing vessel with 19 Pakistani crew members that had been hijacked by Somali pirates. This resurgence is attributed to factors such as regional instability aggravated by conflicts in Yemen, reduced international naval patrols, and socio-economic challenges in Somalia that drive individuals towards piracy. To address these growing threats, international initiatives have been strengthened. Operation Atalanta, for example, had its mandate extended in December 2024 for an additional two years to secure the Gulf of Aden and parts of the Red Sea. These efforts, combined with contributions from partner nations like Pakistan, aim to maintain a secure maritime environment and prevent disruptions to vital trade routes. This change of command underscores the ongoing importance of multinational cooperation in addressing global maritime security challenges. Under the leadership of Commodore Sohail Azmie, CTF 151 will continue its efforts to suppress piracy, enhance international coordination, and protect strategic maritime routes. With its experience and capabilities, Pakistan reaffirms its role as a key contributor to combating maritime threats in this critical region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/pakistan-navy-takes-command-of-task-force-151-leading-global-counter-piracy-efforts-in-gulf-of-aden	2025-01-22T06:58:45-08:00

According to Unite, this decision is crucial for safeguarding the UK’s industrial expertise and preparing the country for the production of the future sixth-generation combat air program, known as Tempest or the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP). Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Typhoon would support industrial autonomy and preserve national expertise while remaining a proven, versatile tool for diverse missions. (Picture source: British MoD) As the British government prepares to announce its decision on the purchase of new combat aircraft for the Royal Air Force, the Unite union is urging the Ministry of Defence to prioritize Eurofighter Typhoon jets over the F-35A. This decision is deemed crucial for safeguarding national industrial expertise and preparing the UK for the production of the future sixth-generation fighter program, the Tempest, or the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP). With large-scale production of Tempest expected in the 2030s, the gradual reduction of the UK Typhoon production line threatens the industrial base, including the 6,500 BAE Systems employees currently involved in the program. A recent report by the Defence Select Committee further underscores the strategic importance of preserving jobs and expertise in the aerospace sector. The Eurofighter Typhoon, developed by a European consortium comprising EADS, Alenia Aeronautica, and BAE Systems, is a highly versatile multirole aircraft. It excels in air superiority, ground strikes, reconnaissance, and maritime attack. With a maximum speed of 2,495 km/h, exceptional agility, and 13 hardpoints for various armaments such as AMRAAM missiles, Paveway guided bombs, and Storm Shadow anti-radar missiles, it is well-suited for a broad range of missions. Its CAPTOR-M radar, combined with a planned upgrade to AESA technology, enhances detection and targeting capabilities, while its lightweight composite structure ensures operational flexibility. In contrast, the F-35A Lightning II, developed by Lockheed Martin under the Joint Strike Fighter program, emphasizes stealth and advanced technology. Its AESA AN/APG-81 radar and Distributed Aperture System (DAS) provide unmatched situational awareness, supported by advanced electronic warfare capabilities. Designed to operate in heavily defended airspaces, the F-35A can carry a range of weapons, including AMRAAM missiles, JDAM bombs, and HARM missiles, all while maintaining a low radar signature through its internal weapons bay. While it has a lower top speed (1,930 km/h compared to 2,495 km/h) and slightly less agility, the F-35A’s ability to neutralize advanced air defense systems and its integration into coalition operations make it a strategically valuable asset. In terms of costs, the Typhoon presents significant advantages for the British economy. A purchase of 24 aircraft could sustain 26,000 jobs over two years across BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Leonardo, and the broader national supply chain. By comparison, a similar order for the F-35A would create only two to three months of work for approximately 2,000 workers in the UK. While the Typhoon directly supports local industry, the F-35A benefits from economies of scale due to its large-scale production, potentially offsetting its higher initial costs. However, the infrastructure required to maintain its stealth technology adds significant long-term expenses. The choice between the two aircraft depends on the UK’s strategic priorities. The Typhoon would support industrial autonomy and preserve national expertise while remaining a proven, versatile tool for diverse missions. Meanwhile, the F-35A, with its stealth and advanced capabilities, is better suited to modern conflicts involving contested environments. A hybrid solution combining both aircraft could offer a strategic balance, addressing immediate military needs while supporting the long-term viability of the national aerospace sector. Unite emphasizes the urgency of this decision. General Secretary Sharon Graham highlighted the importance of retaining the highly skilled engineers and technicians in the aerospace sector. She called on the government to invest in Typhoons to meet military and economic needs while ensuring continuity of expertise for future programs. Rhys McCarthy, Unite’s national defense officer, warned that neglecting the domestic defense industry in an increasingly unstable world would be irresponsible. He also stressed that the UK government cannot expect to sell Typhoons abroad if it does not demonstrate confidence in the product itself. The decision between the Typhoon and the F-35A represents a critical strategic choice for the UK. Beyond military considerations, it could redefine the future of the national aerospace industry while addressing global security challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/british-aerospace-industry-at-stake-with-choice-between-typhoon-and-f-35a-fighter-jets	2025-01-22T06:11:32-08:00

South Korea develops a land-based CIWS-II 30mm system to counter future North Korean kamikaze drones	As reported by the Korea Bizwire on January 20, 2025, South Korea has begun developing a land-based adaptation of its Close-In Weapon System (CIWS-II) to address North Korean threats, including artillery, drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) manages the project, building on the naval CIWS-II equipped with a 30mm GAU-8 Gatling gun and Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar. For the land-based version, design changes include replacing the four-sided fixed AESA radar with a single-faced rotating radar to prioritize monitoring northern threats and reducing costs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The South Korean need for a land-based CIWS-II became evident after several North Korean drone incursions, including the 2022 incident when drones breached Seoul’s airspace. (Picture source: DAPA) A close-in weapon system (CIWS) is a point-defense weapon designed to detect and intercept short-range threats, such as incoming missiles and aircraft, that have penetrated outer defenses. Typically installed on naval ships, CIWS is standard on most large modern warships and has also been adapted for land-based applications. There are two main types: gun-based and missile-based. Gun-based CIWS, such as the American Phalanx, Dutch Goalkeeper, and Russian Kashtan systems, employ rotary or revolver cannons with radar and computer systems mounted on rotating turrets for automatic targeting. Missile-based CIWS, like the American RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile and Russian Pantsir system, use radar or infrared guidance to direct short-range missiles at close-range threats. The South Korean need for a land-based CIWS-II became evident after North Korean drone incursions, including the 2022 event when drones breached Seoul’s airspace. Existing ground-based systems, such as the K30 Biho, have struggled to detect and track small or low-flying threats. The new system aims to counter a range of threats, including long-range artillery, close-range ballistic missiles, short-range ballistic missiles, multiple rocket launchers, low-flying cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles. It will use AESA radar and electro-optical tracking systems for improved detection and interception. Advanced Hit Efficiency And Destruction (AHEAD) ammunition, designed to release fragments upon detonation, will increase its effectiveness against drones and artillery shells. Cost-saving measures for the land-based adaptation include using a rotating AESA radar instead of the fixed version used on naval systems. The system is designed to counter specific threats such as kamikaze drones and missile swarms. Rep. Yoo Yong-won of the People Power Party emphasized the importance of deploying the system, citing North Korea’s advancements and their risks to Seoul and nearby areas. The US-made Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) system, introduced in 2004 and deployed in Iraq by 2005, serves as a notable example of a naval close-in weapon system modified for ground-based applications. (Picture source: US DoD) The U.S. Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) system, introduced in 2004 and deployed in Iraq by 2005, offers a comparable example. Based on the Phalanx CIWS, the C-RAM uses a 20mm M61A1 Gatling gun and Ku-band radar to protect forward operating bases from rockets and mortars. It employs high-explosive incendiary tracer self-destructing (HEIT-SD) ammunition to minimize collateral damage and successfully intercepted 105 attacks during its initial deployment. The C-RAM influenced South Korea’s approach to the CIWS-II program. Expected to reach initial capability by 2027, the CIWS-II project addresses limitations in foreign systems, such as the Dutch SGE-30 Goalkeeper and U.S. Phalanx, which have faced issues related to cost, maintenance, and operational capability. Dissatisfaction with reliance on external suppliers led to the decision to develop a domestic solution. In 2021, LIG Nex1 and Hanwha Systems competed for the CIWS-II contract, presenting models with AESA radar and electro-optical systems at MADEX 2021. LIG Nex1 was chosen for its expertise in radar, fire control, and maintenance, including its work with the Goalkeeper system. The project has a budget of 895.7 billion KRW (approximately $626,990,000) and will continue through 2036. The naval CIWS-II, equipped with a 30mm GAU-8 Gatling gun capable of high rates of fire, integrates AESA radars for detection and tracking. Its configuration includes four detection radars and one tracking radar, whereas the land-based variant may use a simplified setup to reduce costs. Electro-optical targeting enhances interception of drones, supersonic missiles, and other aerial threats. Future upgrades aim to enhance the system’s effectiveness against swarming drone attacks using AHEAD ammunition. Initial deployment will occur on Chungnam-class frigates, potentially serving as test platforms. The land-based version is expected to defend urban and strategic areas, including Seoul, addressing South Korea’s security challenges. However, gun-based CIWS systems have limitations, particularly in range and effectiveness. These systems typically have a maximum range of 5,000 meters, with real-world interception often occurring closer to 500 meters, increasing the risk of fragments or damaged threats causing harm. Additionally, their kill probability is limited, as direct hits may not neutralize threats entirely, especially with kinetic-energy-only projectiles. Missile-based CIWS mitigates some of these challenges by offering extended range and improved interception capabilities. Systems like the dual-role Kashtan and Pantsir combine guns and missiles for greater tactical flexibility.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/south-korea-develops-a-land-based-ciws-ii-30mm-system-to-counter-future-north-korean-kamikaze-drones	2025-01-22T04:57:40-08:00

Soldiers from both units requested drones that would be more versatile, durable, and, importantly, expendable—capabilities that existing systems often lacked. The new drones will be tested during Operation Lethal Eagle, where the Division will field 100 custom-made sUAS units. 'We are able to print these systems at a fraction of the cost of traditional models, without sacrificing operational functionality,' said Capt. Andrew Blomquist, the 2nd Mobile Brigade Combat Team’s innovation officer. He emphasized the excitement within the Division to see these new, 3D-printed drones put to the test in the hands of soldiers during the exercise. Operation Lethal Eagle is a 21-day training exercise designed to push the limits of the Division's capabilities, particularly in large-scale, long-range air assault (L2A2) operations. The event aims to prototype and test emerging Army technologies, enhance the lethality of soldiers, and build proficiency in complex, multi-domain operations. During the exercise, soldiers will conduct a range of missions that integrate these new sUAS into tactical operations. This will provide invaluable data for refining drone usage and manufacturing at the tactical level. The training is expected to showcase the practical benefits of 3D-printed drones, such as their ease of replacement in the field and lower costs for procurement, maintenance, and training. The 3D manufacturing initiative is a reflection of the Army's broader strategy to modernize and improve its technological edge. As Col. McIntosh notes, the effort is part of an ongoing transformation that will make the Division’s drone systems more adaptable to ever-evolving mission requirements, from surveillance to electronic warfare. While the U.S. Army 101st Airborne Division’s 3D-printed drones will first be tested during Operation Lethal Eagle, they are expected to be a permanent fixture within the Division’s technological arsenal. The success of the program could serve as a blueprint for other units in the U.S. Army, offering a new model for rapid, cost-effective drone manufacturing that can be easily scaled across other operational theaters. As U.S. soldiers continue to experiment with and refine these new systems, the 101st’s venture into 3D printing is setting the stage for broader innovations in military drone development, offering a glimpse into the future of Army warfare—one where agility, speed, and innovation take center stage.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-us-army-101st-airborne-division-develops-3d-printed-small-drones-for-air-assault-operations	2025-01-22T03:24:22-08:00

(Picture source: US DoD) Marine One, the call sign for any U.S. Marine Corps aircraft carrying the President, has been in use since 1957. President Dwight D. Eisenhower first used a Bell UH-13J Sioux helicopter for short-range travel to his summer home in Pennsylvania, followed by the Sikorsky UH-34 Seahorse. The Marine Corps assumed exclusive control of Marine One operations in 1976, designating the White House South Lawn as the primary landing zone. Over the decades, the fleet, managed by Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), has included the VH-3A, VH-3D, and VH-60N models. Operating from MCAF Quantico, Virginia, and Naval Support Facility Anacostia, the fleet supports both domestic and international missions. Procedures include flying in decoy formations and employing countermeasures like AN/ALQ-144A infrared jammers and radar-guided missile defenses. The prefix 'VH' in U.S. military aircraft designations stands for 'VIP Helicopter,' identifying rotary-wing aircraft configured specifically for transporting very important persons, such as the President. The 'V' denotes its VIP transport role, and the 'H' indicates it is a helicopter. This designation is used for helicopters like the VH-3D Sea King, VH-60N White Hawk, and VH-92A Patriot, which have been assigned to serve as Marine One, the call sign for any U.S. Marine Corps aircraft carrying the President. The VH-3D Sea King, introduced in 1974, was a twin-engine helicopter derived from the Sikorsky S-61 platform, replacing the VH-3A in the Marine One fleet. It featured a fuselage length of 16.5 meters, an overall length of 21.9 meters, and a height of 5.1 meters, with a maximum takeoff weight of 9,752 kilograms. Powered by two General Electric T58-GE-400B turboshaft engines, the VH-3D could reach a maximum speed of 259 km/h (140 knots). The VH-3D was equipped with navigation systems, GPS, TCAS, crash-survivable flight data recorders, and EMP-hardened communication systems for secure and non-secure operations. The helicopter supported day/night and all-weather missions, with systems periodically upgraded to meet evolving operational needs. However, increased weight from added capabilities limited further modifications due to its aging airframe, reducing operational effectiveness. The VH-60N White Hawk, entering service in 1989, was developed as a variant of the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, incorporating features from the SH-60 Seahawk, allowing it to achieve a cruising speed of 278 km/h. (Picture source: US DoD) The VH-60N White Hawk, entering service in 1989, was developed as a variant of the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, incorporating features from the SH-60 Seahawk.

The agreement was finalized in New Delhi on January 21, 2025, in the presence of Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh and senior officials from the MoD and HVF/AVNL.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The bridge system of the BLT T-72 consists of a launching mechanism, hydraulic systems, auxiliary systems, an electronic control system, and the bridge structure itself. (Picture source: Army Recognition) India's procurement of 47 T-72 BLTs aims to improve the operational capacity of its mechanized forces by enabling the rapid deployment of bridges during both offensive and defensive operations. The T-72 BLTs are designed to support the movement of armored units across obstacles such as rivers and trenches, addressing mobility challenges and ensuring tactical flexibility. This acquisition is part of a broader initiative to modernize India's military infrastructure and maintain the operational relevance of the T-72 fleet. The T-72 BLT, also known as BLT T-72, is an armored engineering vehicle (AEV) used to deploy prefabricated steel bridges during military operations. It assists in crossing natural and artificial obstacles, enabling tanks and armored vehicles to maintain mobility during combat. The system includes a scissors-type bridge that can be deployed in two configurations: a 20-meter span with a Military Load Classification (MLC) of 60, supporting vehicles up to 60 tons, and a 22-meter span with an MLC of 70, supporting vehicles up to 70 tons. The Military Load Classification (MLC) is a standardized system used by NATO to indicate the load-bearing capacity of infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and routes, as well as the load impact of military vehicles. It is represented in whole numbers, with higher numbers corresponding to the capacity to support heavier loads. Vehicles are assigned MLC numbers based on their weight, type (wheeled or tracked), and their impact on infrastructure, while infrastructure elements are categorized according to their structural characteristics and ability to handle specific traffic conditions. This system ensures compatibility between military vehicles and the infrastructure they use, supporting the safe and efficient movement of forces. The bridge system of the BLT T-72 consists of a launching mechanism, hydraulic systems, auxiliary systems, an electronic control system, and the bridge structure itself. During transit, the bridge remains folded atop the tank and can be deployed in approximately three to five minutes using manual or automatic controls. The vehicle’s ability to deploy and recover the bridge ensures tank columns can cross obstacles and maintain efficient movement. The T-72 BLT, also known as BLT T-72, features a scissors-type bridge that can be deployed in two configurations: a 20-meter span supporting vehicles up to 60 tons, and a 22-meter span supporting vehicles up to 70 tons. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The BLTs are built on the T-72M1 tank chassis and powered by a 780-horsepower engine. Weighing 49 tons, they measure 11.36 meters in length, 4.0 meters in width, and 3.8 meters in height. The maximum road speed is 60 kilometers per hour, and the vehicle can traverse gradients of up to 25 degrees, cross trenches up to 2.4 meters wide, and ford shallow waters up to 1.8 meters deep. Armament includes a 12.7mm anti-aircraft machine gun, with provisions for attaching a KMT-6 mine plow for landmine clearance. India’s association with the T-72M1 began in 1978 with the purchase of 500 tanks from the Soviet Union, including T-72, T-72M, and T-72M1 variants. Licensed production was subsequently initiated at the Heavy Vehicles Factory (HVF) in Avadi, Tamil Nadu, where the tank was designated as the Ajeya. Over a 15-year production period, more than 1,100 units were manufactured domestically before production ceased in 1998. In the 1990s, the Indian Army launched the Combat Improved Ajeya program, also known as Project Rhino, upgrading approximately 1,500 T-72M1 tanks. This program introduced enhancements such as upgraded engines, advanced fire control systems, Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA), fire detection and suppression systems, and modern communication and navigation systems. As of 2023, the Indian Army operates a fleet of 2,418 T-72M1 tanks, with plans to replace them under the Future Ready Combat Vehicle (FRCV) program. The BLTs fall under the 'Buy (Indian-Indigenously Designed, Developed, and Manufactured)' (IDDM) procurement category, introduced in India's Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) 2016. This category prioritizes defense products that are indigenously designed, developed, and manufactured, requiring at least 50% indigenous content. The policy aligns with the 'Make in India' program, launched in 2014 to promote domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on imports across various sectors, including defense. Additionally, the 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' (Self-Reliant India) campaign, initiated in 2020, emphasizes fostering self-sufficiency by encouraging indigenous production capabilities. In the defense sector, these initiatives aim to develop a domestic defense industry, reduce dependency on foreign suppliers, stimulate economic growth through local manufacturing, and advance technological innovation within India.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/indian-army-purchases-47-new-t-72-blt-bridge-laying-tanks-to-strengthen-obstacle-crossing-capabilities	2025-01-22T01:48:29-08:00

B-1B Lancers Deployed to Guam a Strategic Reinforcement for Indo-Pacific	Four U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancer strategic bombers landed at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam on January 15, 2025, marking the start of the year's first Bomber Task Force mission. These aircraft, from the 34th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron based at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, play a pivotal role in U.S. efforts to strengthen alliances and deter threats in the Indo-Pacific region. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link the B-1 Lancer is a long-range, versatile strategic bomber that holds a central position in the U.S. Air Force's arsenal (Picture source: US Air Force) A key feature of this mission was an unprecedented trilateral flight conducted over airspace between Japan and South Korea. Two B-1Bs were escorted by two Mitsubishi F-2 fighters from Japan’s Air Self-Defense Force and two F-15K Slam Eagles from the South Korean Air Force. This operation underscores growing trilateral military cooperation, reflecting closer ties between these nations as they address security challenges in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and the Korean Peninsula. Originally developed by Rockwell (now part of Boeing), the B-1 Lancer is a long-range, versatile strategic bomber that holds a central position in the U.S. Air Force's arsenal. Its unique variable-geometry wing configuration enables the aircraft to adjust wing angles for optimal performance during various phases of flight. Powered by four General Electric F101-GE-102 turbofan engines, the B-1B can reach a top speed of 1,340 km/h and a range of 11,998 km with aerial refueling. Operated by a crew of four — a pilot, a co-pilot, and two systems operators — it is designed to execute complex, long-range missions. The B-1B is distinguished by its significant payload capacity. Its three internal weapon bays and eight external hardpoints allow it to carry up to 75,000 pounds of ordnance, including conventional bombs such as Mk 82 and Mk 84, AGM-86B, and AGM-69 cruise missiles, as well as nuclear payloads like the B-61 or B-83 bombs. This adaptability makes it a valuable asset for a wide range of high-intensity missions. To enhance survivability, the B-1B features advanced avionics and countermeasure systems. The AN/ALQ-161 electronic warfare suite enables radar jamming, while the APQ-164 multi-mode radar provides high-resolution terrain mapping, terrain-following capability, and weather detection. These systems, along with chaff and infrared decoy dispensers, ensure the bomber can penetrate contested airspace and avoid threats effectively. The B-1 B entered service in 1986 as a nuclear-capable platform and was later adapted in the 1990s for conventional bombing missions. Since then, it has played a critical role in major operations, including Desert Fox in 1998 and campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. Its ability to adapt to evolving operational requirements has solidified its importance within U.S. strategic planning. The current deployment to Guam also highlights the evolution of U.S. military presence strategies in the region. Since 2020, the Air Force has shifted from a continuous bomber presence on the island to a rotational model through Bomber Task Forces. This approach provides operational flexibility while maintaining a credible deterrent. With its strategic location just 1,600 miles from Taiwan and 1,800 miles from South Korea, Guam serves as a vital hub for projecting power in a region marked by increasing tensions. These Bomber Task Force missions extend beyond deterrence. They also serve as a proving ground for crew endurance and readiness. With flight durations often exceeding 24 hours and sometimes approaching 30, such missions test operational capabilities and demonstrate the Air Force's ability to sustain operations across diverse and distant environments. In summary, the deployment of B-1B bombers to Guam is part of a broader strategy aimed at reinforcing alliances and addressing security challenges in the Indo-Pacific. More than a demonstration of military strength, this mission reflects a measured approach to projecting power, reassuring regional partners, and deterring potential adversaries. As the Task Force mission continues, it underscores the United States' commitment to upholding stability and the international rules-based order in this strategically significant region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/b-1b-lancers-deployed-to-guam-a-strategic-reinforcement-for-indo-pacific	2025-01-22T00:10:37-08:00	
Kalashnikov and Russia to Soon Present New KUB-2-E Loitering Munition	At the upcoming IDEX 2025 defense exhibition, scheduled from February 17 to 21 in Abu Dhabi, the Kalashnikov Group will unveil its latest innovation in loitering munition technology, the KUB-2-E, a joint development by the Kalashnikov Group and the Izhevsk Unmanned Systems Research and Production Association (NPO 'IzBS'). As always, Army Recognition will be on-site to cover the event, and more details will be available in the coming weeks. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The small-class KUB-2-E system is designed to target enemy infantry, including individual soldiers, as well as unarmored military vehicles. (Picture source: Kalashnikov) This new generation of small and medium-sized loitering munitions is designed to enhance modern military capabilities, marking a significant milestone in Russian unmanned defense technology. The emergence of drones in the conflict in Ukraine has marked a major turning point in the conduct of modern military operations. From the outset of the Russian invasion in 2022, Ukraine quickly integrated reconnaissance and attack drones, such as the Turkish Bayraktar TB2, to carry out precision strikes against strategic Russian targets, including bridges, armored vehicles, and command facilities. The use of drones, including loitering munition systems, has helped overcome certain limitations related to manpower shortages or equipment while providing greater flexibility to conduct asymmetric attacks. On the other hand, Russia has also intensified the use of drones, particularly for kamikaze strikes or intelligence-gathering missions. These technologies have changed the nature of combat by making operations more fluid and responsive, but they have also redefined warfare strategies, where speed, precision, and the ability to strike from a distance have become key elements. The small-class KUB-2-E system is designed to target enemy infantry, including individual soldiers, as well as unarmored military vehicles. It is therefore ideal for precise strikes against lighter, more vulnerable targets on the battlefield. Meanwhile, the medium-class KUB-2-E broadens the scope by allowing strikes against a wider range of targets, such as enemy personnel, launch positions for unmanned aerial systems, helicopter landing zones, and both unarmored and lightly armored military vehicles. Both versions of the KUB-2-E loitering munitions are equipped with advanced electro-optical systems, allowing operators to guide the munitions with precision toward their targets, even if those targets change positions during the operation. Weighing over 10 kg, these munitions can operate in various challenging conditions, such as day and night operations, complex weather scenarios, smoke, and dust. They can also operate in wind speeds of up to 15 m/s and in temperature ranges from -40°C to +50°C. Moreover, these systems resist passive and active jamming tactics that may occur in a battlefield environment. Developed as an initiative by the Kalashnikov Group, the KUB-2-E complexes offer significant advancements in loitering munition technology, providing armed forces with the ability to conduct more flexible and effective strikes under diverse battlefield conditions. With IDEX 2025 fast approaching, the presentation of the KUB-2-E system at the event will highlight the growing importance of loitering munitions in modern warfare and their potential to redefine the dynamics of combat engagements.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/kalashnikov-and-russia-to-soon-present-new-kub-2-e-loitering-munition	2025-01-21T23:59:01-08:00	
Flash News: China Develops Secret Hypersonic Air-to-Air Missile Posing New Threat to US B-21 Stealth Bomber	China has officially confirmed the development of a highly advanced hypersonic air-to-air missile, marking a significant milestone in aerospace and defense technologies. This announcement was made public on January 19, 2025, via the 'South China Morning Post', a newspaper based in Hong Kong, after extensive testing, including extreme heat resistance trials designed to meet the stringent requirements of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). The development of this missile poses a serious challenge to existing air defense systems. It could alter the dynamics of air superiority, particularly against high-tech aircraft like the U.S. B-21 Raider stealth bomber, which is currently undergoing flight testing.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Conceptual image of a cutting-edge hypersonic air-to-air missile, revolutionizing long-range aerial combat. (Picture source: China CCTV) The confirmation of the missile's existence was made through a paper published by Chinese scientists, revealing the sophisticated testing procedures employed, including the use of arc-heated wind tunnels. These special tunnels are designed to simulate the extreme conditions encountered by hypersonic vehicles, with temperatures reaching thousands of degrees Celsius—well beyond what conventional missiles experience. The heat-resistant tests are part of China’s effort to overcome one of the primary challenges of hypersonic flight: aerodynamic heating. At speeds greater than Mach 5, hypersonic missiles encounter intense friction with the atmosphere, which can cause temperatures to soar and potentially damage the missile’s structural integrity or disrupt its internal electronics. To ensure the missile’s reliability, China has conducted extensive trials, including those in high-cost wind tunnels typically used for space missions like simulating Mars landings. Hypersonic air-to-air missiles are capable of traveling at speeds that exceed Mach 5, and as such, they present entirely new challenges and opportunities in air combat. Unlike traditional air-to-air missiles, which generally operate within a range of several hundred kilometers, hypersonic variants could strike targets as far as 1,000 km away or more, significantly extending the operational reach of platforms like China’s J-16 fighter. This increased range is not just a matter of distance, but also a matter of speed—hypersonic missiles can cover that ground much more quickly than their subsonic counterparts. With less time for an adversary to react, and an incredibly fast trajectory that evades interception, these missiles present a new type of threat for modern air forces. Conventional air-to-air missiles require complex guidance systems and long engagement times, while hypersonic missiles, due to their speed, can drastically shorten the time from launch to target impact, leaving little opportunity for escape. The introduction of this weapon has serious implications for global air combat strategies, especially for the U.S. military and its allies. The U.S. B-21 Raider new stealth bomber, with its stealth capabilities and long-range strike capabilities, represents the cutting edge of American air power, but the threat of hypersonic weapons could force a reconsideration of how such aircraft are deployed in contested airspace. The B-21 was designed with the assumption that adversaries would rely on traditional anti-air threats, such as surface-to-air missiles and fighter jets. The hypersonic missile, however, could engage even the most advanced stealth bombers at ranges far beyond the capabilities of conventional interception systems, making them vulnerable in ways previously unimagined. While China's hypersonic air-to-air missile represents a new phase in military aerospace development, it is not alone in this endeavor. Other nations have also made significant strides in hypersonic and supersonic missile technology, some of which include air-to-air capabilities. The United States, for example, is actively working on a range of hypersonic missile systems through its various programs such as the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) and the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW). These systems, while primarily intended for surface-to-air and air-to-ground applications, are indicative of the U.S.'s interest in keeping pace with China and Russia in the hypersonic race. In fact, the U.S. has been focusing efforts on deploying hypersonic missiles in various configurations, including for air-to-air engagements, albeit with a somewhat longer timeline for deployment than China. Russia, too, has demonstrated significant progress in hypersonic technology with its Kinzhal missile, which, while primarily designed for air-to-ground strikes, is expected to serve as the basis for further developments in air-to-air variants. The Kinzhal is launched from a MiG-31 fighter jet and has already been used in combat, highlighting its potential in real-world scenarios. However, the focus for both the U.S. and Russia has largely been on using hypersonic systems for long-range strike missions rather than air-to-air combat, which is a niche that China appears to be pioneering. The development of air-to-air supersonic and hypersonic missiles represents a new frontier in aerial warfare. These weapons offer far greater ranges and speeds than traditional air-to-air missiles, which are typically limited by their reliance on radar guidance and the necessity of in-flight updates from the launching platform. A hypersonic air-to-air missile, due to its sheer speed, could engage targets with little to no warning and without relying on extensive data links to ensure its accuracy. This dramatically changes the nature of air combat, as enemy aircraft—especially slower-moving tankers, bombers, and early warning platforms—will have limited options for evasion. The strategic implications of this technology are profound. Air forces must now rethink their defense strategies in the face of such advanced missile technology. Countries with significant air forces, particularly the United States, will have to develop countermeasures capable of defeating or mitigating the effects of hypersonic missiles. This could involve developing better detection systems, faster interception capabilities, and more advanced electronic warfare tactics to thwart these high-speed threats. The challenge is not only technological but also economic. Hypersonic systems, due to their complex engineering and high operating costs (such as the expense of running advanced wind tunnels), represent a significant investment. For now, only a handful of nations, including China, the U.S., and Russia, are investing heavily in this cutting-edge technology. However, as the missile race intensifies, other nations may also seek to develop their own variants, potentially changing the future balance of air superiority. In conclusion, the Chinese hypersonic air-to-air missile marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of modern warfare, setting a new standard for the speed, range, and lethality of air-launched weapons. While other nations, including the U.S. and Russia, are working on their own hypersonic and supersonic missile technologies, China’s advancements in this area could lead to a shift in the tactical and strategic dimensions of aerial combat. The development of such weapons challenges not only current defense systems but also long-held assumptions about the effectiveness of traditional air-to-air missile engagements. As the world watches this technological race unfold, the implications for future air combat are both revolutionary and uncertain.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/flash-news-china-develops-secret-hypersonic-air-to-air-missile-posing-new-threat-to-us-b-21-stealth-bomber	2025-01-21T09:13:15-08:00

What Happened to Russia’s Destroyer Lider and Its S-500 Missile Defense Plan?	Russia’s ambitious Project 23560 destroyer Lider was envisioned as a next-generation warship that could replace multiple classes of vessels in the Russian Navy. This advanced platform was designed to carry a naval version of the S-500 Prometey air defense system, positioning it as a formidable counter to the U.S. Navy’s Aegis missile defense system.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A model of the Russian Navy's Project 23560 destroyer. (Picture source: Navy Recognition) Military expert Sergey Marzhetsky highlighted that the destroyer Lider, with its full displacement of 19,000 tons, was uniquely suited to accommodate the massive S-500 interceptors, something smaller ships like the Admiral Gorshkov-class frigates could not achieve without compromising their mission capabilities. The S-500 system offered unprecedented capabilities in air and missile defense, including the ability to engage aerial targets at ranges of up to 600 kilometers and detect threats at a distance of 800 kilometers. With a maximum engagement altitude of 200 kilometers and the capacity to neutralize targets traveling at speeds up to 7 kilometers per second, the S-500 promised to counter advanced threats such as the Grumman E-2 Hawkeye, an early-warning aircraft capable of detecting cruise missiles from a distance of 258 kilometers. This system could have given the destroyer Lider a critical edge in naval warfare by extending its defensive reach far beyond that of the U.S. Navy’s Aegis system, which relies on SM-3 Block IB missiles with a range of 700 kilometers and a speed of 3 kilometers per second. The Aegis system, a cornerstone of U.S. naval defense, is an advanced, multi-layered combat system designed to detect, track, and intercept a wide array of threats, including ballistic missiles, aircraft, and surface targets. Central to its effectiveness is the AN/SPY-1 radar, a powerful, phased-array system that provides continuous 360-degree surveillance and fire control. This radar works in tandem with the Standard Missile family, particularly the SM-3 and SM-6 variants, to deliver precise and effective missile interceptions. Deployed across a fleet of over 70 ships worldwide, including U.S. Navy destroyers and cruisers, as well as allied vessels, the Aegis system is renowned for its integration capabilities, allowing ships to work as part of a larger missile defense network. Despite its promise, the Project Lider was halted due to a combination of financial, technical, and strategic challenges. Russia’s economic constraints made it difficult to allocate the significant funding required for such an advanced and massive destroyer. Technological hurdles in adapting the land-based S-500 system for naval use, particularly integrating the complex radar and launcher systems, further complicated the project. Meanwhile, the Russian Navy’s focus shifted toward smaller, more versatile ships like the Project 22350 frigates and Karakurt-class corvettes, which were more practical given budgetary limitations and immediate operational needs.

Its extended range allows deployment platforms to remain beyond the reach of many air defense systems, improving survivability during missions. China’s glide bomb development originated with the LS-6 series, introduced in 2006 by the Luoyang Optoelectro Technology Development Center. The LS-6 family includes precision-guided glide bomb kits compatible with multiple weights: 50kg, 100kg, 250kg, and 500kg. The 500kg LS-6 achieves a range of up to 60 kilometers when released from an altitude of 10,000 meters. The Tiangang bomb builds on this foundation, offering improved range capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing systems. The Tiangang's performance invites comparisons with the AGM-154 JSOW, as its design and purpose are closely aligned with this U.S. counterpart. The Tiangang, developed by Norinco Group, offers a range exceeding 80 kilometers and a CEP of less than 15 meters, targeting fixed installations such as communication hubs and military bases. By contrast, the AGM-154 JSOW, manufactured by Raytheon, achieves ranges of approximately 22 kilometers from low-altitude releases and up to 130 kilometers from high-altitude releases, utilizing a GPS/INS system with optional imaging infrared guidance. Compared to the JDAM, the Tiangang demonstrates a superior range; the standard JDAM achieves up to 28 kilometers with a CEP of 5 meters under optimal conditions. However, the JDAM-Extended Range (JDAM-ER) narrows the gap by incorporating a wing kit to extend its range to approximately 80 kilometers. The design and purpose of the Tiangang guided bomb closely resemble those of its U.S. counterpart, particularly the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon, also known as the JSOW. (Picture source: US DoD) Globally, glide bombs and modular guidance kits are increasingly valued for their ability to enhance the effectiveness of unguided munitions. Systems like the U.S. AGM-154 JSOW, Russia’s UMPK, and Pakistan’s Takbir glide bomb improve accuracy and operational range, enabling launch platforms to remain outside defended airspace. These upgrades are cost-efficient, repurposing existing bombs with advanced guidance modules and aerodynamic surfaces, making them highly effective in modern combat scenarios. The concept of glide bombs dates back to World War II, with Germany’s Fritz X and Henschel Hs 293 introducing remote-controlled munitions for precision strikes, primarily against naval targets. Early systems faced accuracy challenges and required clear visibility from the launch aircraft but marked the advent of precision-guided munitions. Advancements in guidance systems, such as GPS and inertial navigation, have since significantly improved accuracy and standoff ranges, broadening their operational applications. The primary advantage of glide bombs lies in their ability to deliver precise strikes from extended distances, keeping aircraft outside the range of air defense systems. Their modular nature allows unguided bombs to be converted into precision-guided munitions, offering a cost-effective solution for many militaries. Additionally, their small radar signatures and short flight times reduce vulnerability to interception, making them versatile for various missions. For China, the Tiangang bomb provides a practical solution to enhance precision-strike capabilities by leveraging its extensive inventory of FAB-series bombs, reducing the need for entirely new munitions. This approach increases operational flexibility and cost-efficiency. By incorporating advanced guidance systems, the Tiangang bomb significantly enhances the effectiveness of China’s aerial munitions, bolstering its ability to conduct strategic operations with precision at extended ranges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/china-continues-to-challenge-us-aerial-superiority-with-its-tiangang-guided-bomb	2025-01-21T03:53:04-08:00

The MD 530F is a light, agile helicopter designed for reconnaissance and light attack roles. Its speed and maneuverability are particularly useful in urban or mountainous combat scenarios. The Taliban’s use of these helicopters could enhance their surveillance and ground support capabilities. The ScanEagle is a small, long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Its capture gives the Taliban the potential to monitor enemy activity and plan operations with advanced situational awareness. There is also concern about the possibility of reverse-engineering this technology for use or sale to other groups. The M1151 and M1152 are variants of the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), or Humvee, known for their adaptability and durability. The M1151 is armored for troop transport, while the M1152 is designed for cargo. Thousands of these vehicles were left behind, providing the Taliban with substantial mobility and logistical support for operations. The MaxxPro MRAP is a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle designed to protect occupants from IED blasts and small-arms fire. Its advanced V-shaped hull deflects explosions, making it an invaluable asset for safe travel in hostile environments. The Taliban’s acquisition of these vehicles enhances their survivability in asymmetric warfare. Light and medium tactical vehicles such as the Ford Ranger and Navistar 7000 series were used extensively by U.S. and Afghan forces for logistical support. Their reliability and mobility enable the Taliban to efficiently transport troops, supplies, and equipment across Afghanistan’s challenging terrain. The Taliban’s possession of U.S. military equipment poses significant risks to both regional and global security. These assets have increased their operational capabilities, allowing them to solidify control over Afghanistan and project power more effectively. The advanced equipment could also be used to intimidate neighboring countries or be sold to adversarial nations, further destabilizing the region. Experts warn that some of the captured technology, including UAVs and communications equipment, may be shared with state actors like China or Russia, who could study and reverse-engineer the systems to counter U.S. military technology. There is also the concern that militant groups outside Afghanistan could gain access to this weaponry, potentially fueling terrorism worldwide. Trump’s remarks have added a new dimension to the debate about the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Critics of the Biden administration view the loss of military equipment as a blunder that undermines U.S. credibility and strengthens adversaries. Trump’s call to withhold financial aid until the equipment is returned highlights his 'America First' policy stance. The loss of $7 billion worth of U.S. military equipment to the Taliban remains a stark reminder of the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/detailed-list-of-us-military-equipment-trump-seeks-to-recover-from-afghanistan	2025-01-21T01:50:00-08:00

Donald Trump Announces an Ambitious Plan for a Fully American Iron Dome	On January 19, 2025, during the rally preceding his inauguration in Washington, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump generated interest by announcing his plan to order the construction of a fully American 'Iron Dome' once his second term begins. Inspired by the renowned Israeli missile defense system, this initiative, highlighted in the Republican Party's electoral platform, aims to create a 'force field' around the United States. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) launcher was placed and prepared to launch interceptors to counter ballistic missile threats at an undisclosed location in CENTCOM area of responsibility (Picture source: US DoD) Trump emphasized the project's national character, pledging that it would be developed and constructed within the United States. This plan raises critical questions regarding technical details, costs, and the technologies that might be incorporated. While the possibility of a system distinct from Israel's Iron Dome is not excluded, the proposal aligns with the goal of enhancing technological self-reliance and fostering innovation in the U.S. defense industry. The Israeli Iron Dome, developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with U.S. financial support, is globally recognized for its short-range missile defense capabilities. The mobile, all-weather system intercepts and neutralizes enemy projectiles, including rockets, artillery shells, and mortars. Equipped with an EL/M-2084 radar and Tamir interceptor missiles, it calculates threat trajectories in real time and engages only those likely to cause harm. With interception rates frequently exceeding 90%, the system has demonstrated its effectiveness in protecting civilian populations during multiple conflicts. However, the Israeli Iron Dome has limitations. While highly effective against short-range threats, it offers only partial protection against long-range missiles, advanced drones, or hypersonic weapons. As a result, it is often supplemented by other systems, such as David's Sling and Arrow, to provide layered defense. Trump’s proposed project aims to overcome these limitations by developing a system capable of addressing a broader range of threats, including emerging weapon technologies. This endeavor would require substantial investments to establish new production facilities and integrate advanced technologies. Additional challenges include ensuring compatibility with existing U.S. systems, such as the Patriot, THAAD, and Aegis, which form the backbone of the nation’s missile defense architecture. The future U.S. 'Iron Dome' could leverage existing defense systems to create a comprehensive, multi-layered network capable of countering diverse threats. The Patriot PAC-3 MSE (Missile Segment Enhancement) is a key component of U.S. air defense, designed to counter evolving threats like tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and low-orbit satellites. Equipped with an upgraded solid-fuel rocket motor, improved aerodynamic controls, and advanced guidance systems, this hit-to-kill missile ensures total target destruction. Operating at speeds of Mach 5, it has a range of 35 kilometers and an interception altitude of 15 kilometers. Each launcher, mounted on a mobile platform, carries up to 16 missiles, enabling rapid and effective responses to complex threats, including those employing electronic countermeasures. The THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) system is specifically designed to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles during their terminal phase, both within (endoatmospheric) and outside (exoatmospheric) the atmosphere. Highly mobile and transportable, the system uses hit-to-kill technology, neutralizing threats with kinetic energy to minimize risks associated with weapons of mass destruction. A single THAAD battery includes up to nine mobile launchers, each carrying eight missiles, an AN/TPY-2 X-band radar with a detection range of 1,000 kilometers, and command-and-control vehicles. THAAD operates seamlessly alongside systems like the Patriot and Aegis, ensuring robust protection for military forces, strategic infrastructure, and civilian populations. The Aegis combat system, at the core of Aegis-equipped destroyers, provides unparalleled air defense and ballistic missile interception capabilities. Paired with the AN/SPY-1D phased-array radar, it can detect and track multiple aerial threats over 300 kilometers. Aegis-equipped destroyers are armed with Standard Missiles (SM), including SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6, capable of intercepting threats ranging from aircraft to medium-range ballistic missiles. Incorporating the Aegis system into the proposed U.S. Iron Dome could offer a formidable shield for critical locations and infrastructure. The U.S. is also heavily investing in high-powered lasers and directed energy weapons to counter drones and missiles. These technologies could complement the system by providing cost-effective and rapid solutions for neutralizing specific threats. Advanced radars, such as the Sentinel A4, used for aerial threat detection and surveillance, could play an integral role in the proposed Iron Dome. These radars are critical for real-time detection, tracking, and engagement of threats, ensuring optimal system performance. Integrating the Iron Dome with the Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) could further enhance coordination between different defense platforms. Through real-time data sharing, this would improve interception speed and accuracy. The proposed Iron Dome could serve as a catalyst for the U.S. defense industry, promoting strategic independence and reinforcing the country’s position on the global stage. However, its success will depend on the ability to develop a system that is efficient, adaptable, and economically sustainable. This initiative could also redefine global standards in missile defense. Trump’s announcement marks a potential turning point in the evolution of U.S. defense technologies. This project represents a critical step in safeguarding the nation against adversaries such as China, Russia, and North Korea, whose advancements in ballistic and hypersonic missile technologies pose significant threats. By addressing these strategic challenges, the U.S. Iron Dome could provide a vital defensive edge while strengthening alliances with key partners who share similar security concerns.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/donald-trump-announces-an-ambitious-plan-for-a-fully-american-iron-dome	2025-01-20T00:51:26-08:00	
Analysis: How Russia’s Innovative Submarine Coating Reduces Detection Risks	The Russian Ministry of Defense initiated a significant modernization program in 2022 to upgrade the hydroacoustic coatings of its nuclear-powered submarines. This effort aims to improve the stealth capabilities of these vessels, enabling them to evade detection more effectively. The new coating reduces the acoustic signature of the submarines by suppressing noises generated by the vessels and external sonar signals.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Keel-laying ceremony of Project 677 Lada submarines Vologda and Yaroslavl. (Picture source: bmpd) The hydroacoustic coating is made up of specialized plates, each weighing up to 80 kilograms. These plates are composed of multiple pressed layers of advanced rubber materials and feature unique channels designed for acoustic performance. They are affixed to the submarine's lightweight hull using an adhesive with a classified composition. Once attached, the plates are coated with paint to ensure durability and optimal performance. Each nuclear-powered submarine requires approximately 10,000 of these plates, meticulously installed to create an effective barrier against enemy sonar detection. The stringent testing process for the new hydroacoustic coating was recently showcased on the Russian television program Voennaya Priyomka (Military Acceptance) aired on the Zvezda channel. The tests, conducted at the Sevmash shipyard—Russia’s premier submarine manufacturing facility—demonstrated the robustness of the adhesive bonding the plates to the hull. The testing procedure begins with a drill featuring a cup-shaped bit, which is lubricated with soapy water and used to bore into the rubber coating. A metal corkscrew is then inserted into the resulting hole and pulled out using a specialized device that measures the force required to dislodge it. Results show that the adhesive can withstand a force of over 4.5 kN (kilonewtons), confirming its exceptional strength. To ensure minimal impact on the coating’s acoustic properties, the hole is sealed with a fast-curing sealant, rendering it virtually undetectable. This rigorous process is applied to every tenth plate, meaning approximately 1,000 plates are tested before a submarine undergoes state trials. The upgraded hydroacoustic coating is expected to enhance the operational effectiveness of Russia’s nuclear submarine fleet. By reducing detectability, these submarines will have a greater edge in strategic missions, such as patrolling and covert operations, particularly in contested waters. In contrast, the United States has long utilized lightweight synthetic polymer tiles on its Virginia-class and Ohio-class submarines. These tiles are engineered to absorb sonar waves effectively while maintaining a reduced thickness to minimize weight and hydrodynamic drag. The U.S. approach integrates these coatings with other noise-reduction technologies, such as pump-jet propulsion systems, to create a multi-layered stealth system. However, issues with long-term adhesive durability have been reported, which may compromise performance over extended periods. China has focused its efforts on developing composite rubber and polymer coatings for its Type 093B Shang-class submarines. These coatings aim to absorb a broad range of sonar frequencies, enhancing stealth in the Indo-Pacific region. Recent reports suggest that China is transitioning to modular panels for easier maintenance, but the overall robustness and longevity of these systems appear to lag behind those of Russian and American technologies. Germany, representing NATO’s expertise in stealth coatings, employs advanced rubberized materials on its Type 212 and Type 214 diesel-electric submarines. These coatings are optimized for smaller, non-nuclear platforms and are used in conjunction with Air-Independent Propulsion systems to achieve near-silent operation. While highly effective for their intended platforms, these coatings are less scalable to the larger nuclear submarines operated by Russia and the U.S.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/analysis-how-russias-innovative-submarine-coating-reduces-detection-risks	2025-01-20T00:47:42-08:00

Sweden Deploys Mechanized Battalion in Latvia Near Russian Border in Historic First for NATO	For the first time since joining NATO, Sweden has deployed a mechanized battalion in Latvia, consisting of Strf 9040 infantry fighting vehicles and Strv 122 tanks. This deployment marks a step in Sweden's international military engagement and highlights its integration into NATO's collective defense framework. On Saturday, January 18, 2025, approximately 600 Swedish soldiers arrived in Riga, accompanied by their military equipment, as part of an operation to strengthen NATO's presence on its eastern flank, near the Russian border. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link These exercises also emphasize the capabilities of the Strf 9040 and Strv 122, equipped with advanced systems like the 40 mm Bofors cannon and the 120 mm Rheinmetall gun, respectively (Picture source: Saab) The deployment of this mechanized battalion, part of the South Scandinavian Armored Regiment, was a pivotal moment for the Swedish Army. This regiment, comprising the 71st and 72nd mechanized battalions, has a total strength of about 1,100 soldiers. For this mission, 48 Strf 9040 vehicles and 12 Strv 122 tanks were transported to the strategic Ādaži base, where units from 14 other NATO member nations are also stationed. Sweden's arsenal includes over 500 Strf 9040s and 120 Strv 122s, underscoring its substantial armored capabilities. This mission is part of NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence initiative, designed to deter any attempts to compromise the territorial integrity of member states. Regular exercises in the Baltic region enhance interoperability among allied forces and test their readiness to respond to potential crises. In Latvia, Swedish soldiers will train intensively alongside allied forces, preparing for complex scenarios and ensuring operational cohesion. These exercises also emphasize the capabilities of the Strf 9040 and Strv 122, equipped with advanced systems like the 40 mm Bofors cannon and the 120 mm Rheinmetall gun. The Strv 122, derived from the German Leopard 2A5, has been adapted to meet Sweden’s specific operational needs. In service since 1997, it features enhanced armor protection against modern threats and the ability to fire precision munitions developed domestically. Powered by a 1,500-horsepower diesel engine, it achieves a top speed of 68 km/h despite its 62-ton weight. The Strf 9040, operational since 1991, is the backbone of Sweden’s mechanized units. It combines mobility, firepower, and advanced protection, making it well-suited for escort and close-support missions. This operation signifies a shift in Sweden’s defense posture. The country’s previous European military engagements, such as its peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, primarily focused on stabilizing conflict zones. In contrast, this deployment in Latvia is a deterrence mission aimed at preventing conflict in a strategically critical yet currently peaceful region. According to Marcus Nilsson, the regiment's communications officer, this mission reflects a fundamental evolution in Sweden's defense approach. Unlike prior missions centered on restoring peace, this deployment emphasizes deterrence and protection. By establishing a credible military presence, Sweden contributes to collective security and ensures stability in a strategically significant region. Sweden's official accession to NATO in March 2024, after more than 200 years of neutrality, was a strategic decision influenced by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Since joining, Sweden has enhanced its military capabilities and increased its defense budget to meet NATO’s requirements. This deployment in Latvia underscores the growing importance of military cooperation among NATO members. NATO forces’ Baltic commander, Jette Albinus, commended the Swedish contribution, noting the professionalism and capability of its troops. While this mission begins under relatively stable conditions, NATO's future appears uncertain. The inauguration of Donald Trump, who has previously expressed skepticism about NATO's efficacy, may challenge the current balance within the alliance. His administration’s focus on increasing defense spending among NATO members could pose difficulties for some nations, although Sweden has already started boosting its military budget. In this context, operations like the one in Latvia carry significant strategic weight, demonstrating NATO’s relevance in maintaining European stability. By deploying its mechanized battalion, Sweden is not only protecting an allied nation's borders but also solidifying its role within NATO and affirming its military credibility. This first ground operation as a NATO member reflects Sweden’s commitment to addressing contemporary geopolitical challenges and its determination to play a key role in collective security efforts.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/sweden-deploys-mechanized-battalion-in-latvia-near-russian-border-in-historic-first-for-nato	2025-01-20T00:13:46-08:00	
Dutch Defense Budget 2025 Reaches 2% GDP Target as Trump May Demand 5%	The Netherlands achieved a significant milestone in 2024, reaching the NATO requirement of spending 2% of GDP on defense. This decision comes in a global context marked by rising tensions, particularly with the war in Ukraine and China's growing military presence. After several decades of military budget reductions, this increase marks a major shift, illustrating a growing awareness of global threats and the need to strengthen the Netherlands' military posture. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In 2024, for the first time in decades, the Netherlands' defense budget reached 2% of GDP, in line with NATO's requirements. (Picture source: Dutch MoD) Since the end of the Cold War, Dutch defense spending has been heavily influenced by the idea of the 'peace dividend.' In 2013, defense spending dropped to just 1% of GDP, a trend that accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis when austerity measures led to significant cuts in the military budget. However, Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and, more recently, the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, highlighted Europe's vulnerability to rising military threats. These events accelerated a realignment of priorities, progressively strengthening the Netherlands' defense capabilities to respond to new geopolitical realities. In response, the Dutch government decided to increase its military spending. In 2024, for the first time in decades, the Netherlands' defense budget reached 2% of GDP, in line with NATO's requirements. This increase is the result of adopting a more proactive defense policy aimed at modernizing the armed forces and strengthening the country's deterrence and defense capabilities. This effort is supported by the recent adoption of the Defense Financial Obligations Act, which ensures the long-term maintenance of this goal. The Netherlands' increase in defense spending aligns with a broader global trend. NATO as a whole has seen rising contributions from its members, with countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Eastern European members significantly increasing their military budgets. Notably, the United States remains by far the largest contributor to NATO, with an estimated defense budget of $28.791 trillion in 2024, representing around 66% of the Alliance's total defense spending. Globally, other major powers such as Russia and China have also increased their military expenditures. Russia's defense spending for 2025 is projected to reach $120 billion, while China's defense spending in 2024 is estimated at $231 billion. These figures illustrate the growing commitment of these nations to strengthen their military capabilities, particularly in cybersecurity, nuclear armaments, and advanced technologies. These developments highlight the growing military competition among major powers and emphasize the need for European countries, including the Netherlands, to maintain a modern and effective defense posture. In this unstable geopolitical context, the Dutch government has implemented a series of initiatives to modernize its armed forces. This includes investments in advanced military equipment, increased training for soldiers, and an increase in the number of military personnel to ensure that the Netherlands' armed forces are ready to respond to any threat. The strengthening of defense capabilities translates into investments in modern weapon systems, including missile defense, cybersecurity, and electronic warfare. These areas are seen as essential in the face of contemporary threats, such as cyberattacks and hybrid warfare. Additionally, the Netherlands is enhancing its cooperation within NATO, actively participating in joint exercises and increasing its contribution to Alliance missions. Despite achieving the 2% target, challenges remain. The Netherlands' defense budget will need to continue growing to meet future military threats. The ongoing increase in military spending, necessary to keep up with evolving threats, is likely to pose significant challenges for the national economy. In particular, balancing defense needs with other budgetary priorities such as healthcare, education, and social services will be crucial. Another challenge for the Netherlands, as for other NATO members, is the need to modernize the armed forces to address new military technologies continually. Adapting to new forms of warfare, such as cyber warfare and autonomous weaponry, will be a key area of investment for the coming years. The 2% of GDP allocated to defense is now considered not a ceiling, but a minimum. Several NATO officials, including the Secretary General of the Alliance, have emphasized that defense spending above this threshold will be necessary to make up for the accumulated gap and prepare for the future. Indeed, the pace of global threats and new geopolitical dynamics necessitate a constant reassessment of defense budgets. The Netherlands' position on this issue is clear: although the 2% target has been met, the government is ready to consider future increases to further strengthen national security and continue playing a significant role within NATO. Additionally, discussions are underway to incorporate this standard into more binding legislation, ensuring the continued increase in military spending in the years to come. The Netherlands has taken an important step by meeting the 2% defense spending target, but this increase is just the beginning. The growing global challenges, new geopolitical threats, and the need to modernize the armed forces mean that the country will need to continue investing heavily in its defense to respond to the evolving global situation effectively. In the face of these challenges, the Netherlands will continue to strengthen its military capabilities and support NATO in its collective missions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/dutch-defense-budget-2025-reaches-2-gdp-target-as-trump-may-demand-5	2025-01-20T00:01:15-08:00

The contract, valued at US$308.65 million, is set to be completed within 46 months. According to KAI, the project aims to create a homegrown amphibious assault helicopter capable of providing crucial fire support during amphibious operations. This helicopter will cover the Marine Corps’ amphibious maneuver helicopters and air assault units, offering air support during deep maneuvers and final operations. DAPA first announced the requirement for the RoKMC's attack helicopter on April 26, 2021, with an initial buy projected to range from 20 to 24 rotorcraft, at a provisional cost of approximately US$1.44 billion. The program, which began in 2022, is expected to be completed by 2031. The amphibious assault helicopters are intended to operate in high-stakes environments, including the strategically important north-western islands near the inter-Korean border. The MAH will also be designed to operate alongside the Marineon helicopters, which are already in service with the Marine Corps. Once operational, the MAH will play a pivotal role in enhancing the Marine Corps’ amphibious assault capabilities. It is expected to provide vital fire support during amphibious landings, protect Marineon transport helicopters as they conduct raids, and support ground units engaged in combat. This increased firepower and operational flexibility will be crucial to maintaining the readiness of South Korea’s amphibious forces, especially in the event of a conflict in the region. The MAH's development is a testament to South Korea’s ongoing efforts to modernize its defense infrastructure and ensure the self-reliance of its military capabilities. The integration of advanced technology into the MAH, such as avionics and armament systems, aligns with the nation's broader strategy to produce state-of-the-art military equipment that meets the specific needs of its armed forces. Brigadier General Koh Hyung-seok, head of the Helicopter Business Division at DAPA, emphasized that the MAH will enhance the Marine Corps' ability to perform both offensive and defensive operations, particularly in vulnerable regions near the border. 'The amphibious assault helicopter project is essential for strengthening our Marine Corps' air fire support capabilities,' said Brigadier General Koh. 'It will also enable us to better prepare for surprise attacks, particularly in the north-western regions, which are critical to our national defense strategy. We are confident that the remaining development process will proceed without delay, allowing us to complete the project successfully.' As the full-scale testing progresses in 2025 and beyond, the MAH is poised to become a cornerstone of South Korea’s amphibious operations, offering increased air support capabilities and enhancing the Marine Corps’ overall operational effectiveness.

Breaking News: Iran's IRGC Navy Reveals Secret Underground Naval Base Housing Dozens of Missile Assault Boats	On January 18, 2025, Iran's Revolutionary Guards unveiled an underground naval missile base at an undisclosed location in the Persian Gulf. The base, one of several underground facilities built to house vessels capable of launching long-range missiles and conducting distant warfare, was revealed by IRGC Chief Commander Hossein Salami. During ongoing war games, Salami visited the secret base and highlighted its strategic significance in enhancing Iran’s naval capabilities and deterrence in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshot from a video broadcast by IRGC-affiliated media showing the newly unveiled underground naval base in the Persian Gulf, housing several missile-equipped assault boats. (Picture source: Iranian state media video footage) This naval underground facility is part of a larger network of 'cities' specifically designed to house and deploy the IRGC (Iran Revolutionary Guard) Navy’s combat vessels. These subterranean complexes are central to Iran's naval defense strategy, allowing the IRGC to quickly mobilize its fleet of missile-equipped assault boats in the region. General Salami, in his speech at the unveiling, emphasized that the base is just one small component of a much larger system of subterranean installations. He asserted that the IRGC Navy operates numerous such bases, all designed to reinforce its operational resilience and readiness against external threats. By hiding these vessels in underground facilities, the IRGC significantly complicates efforts to locate and neutralize its fleet, providing a strategic advantage in the event of regional conflict. The underground base is specifically tailored to house fast-moving, missile-equipped boats, which are a core component of the IRGC Navy's asymmetric warfare strategy. These boats, capable of launching precision-guided missiles, allow the IRGC to challenge more technologically advanced adversaries, particularly the U.S. Navy, which operates in the region. The base also includes vessels equipped for mine-laying, further enhancing the IRGC’s ability to control key maritime chokepoints in the Strait of Hormuz and the broader Persian Gulf. The ability to lay naval mines is a critical element of Iran's strategy to deny access to critical shipping routes, complicating operations for foreign naval forces in the region. The choice to build such a base underground stems from several strategic considerations. First, it offers protection from airstrikes, which is increasingly important as satellite surveillance and precision-guided munitions become more advanced. With many foreign powers, particularly the United States, capable of targeting and destroying surface ships, housing assets in hidden underground facilities helps mitigate this risk. Furthermore, by dispersing its fleet across multiple hidden sites, the IRGC enhances the survivability of its naval forces. This network of subterranean bases ensures that if one or more facilities are attacked, others remain operational, allowing for continuity in defense operations. Another crucial reason behind this underground infrastructure is the IRGC's focus on asymmetric warfare. Unlike traditional naval forces, which rely on large surface ships, Iran uses small, fast-moving missile boats that can strike quickly and retreat before enemy forces can respond. This hit-and-run tactic is central to Iran's approach to naval defense, allowing them to challenge more powerful forces using low-cost, high-impact weapons. The underground bases also make it more difficult for enemies to predict the locations of these vessels, giving the IRGC the element of surprise. The unveiling of this base also underscores Iran’s growing emphasis on maritime defense, especially as tensions in the Persian Gulf continue to rise. The Strait of Hormuz, through which a significant portion of the world’s oil passes, is a vital geopolitical chokepoint. By deploying missile-equipped boats and mine-laying vessels, Iran can create a constant threat to any foreign navy operating in the region, potentially disrupting global oil trade. As tensions with the U.S. and its allies persist, these developments serve as a reminder of Iran's commitment to maintaining control over this strategic waterway. Looking forward, General Salami's remarks suggest that the underground base is only a fraction of the IRGC’s broader defense infrastructure. Iran is continuing to build a network of such subterranean complexes, all designed to enhance its naval deterrence capabilities. These bases, hidden from view and designed to withstand airstrikes, play a key role in Iran’s defense strategy. As the IRGC expands its network of underground facilities, it is clear that the regime intends to continue fortifying its naval power while challenging foreign naval dominance in the region. The unveiling of this underground combat vessel base marks a significant milestone in Iran's ongoing efforts to modernize and strengthen its IRGC Navy. With missile-equipped boats and mine-laying vessels strategically housed in these subterranean complexes, Iran is positioning itself to exert greater influence over the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. This move further solidifies the IRGC’s asymmetric warfare capabilities, and as the region remains on edge, global powers will be closely watching Iran's growing naval infrastructure for its broader implications on regional security and maritime stability.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-irans-irgc-navy-reveals-secret-underground-naval-base-housing-dozens-of-missile-assault-boats	2025-01-18T17:50:50-08:00	
Flash Info: US Navy MH-60R Seahawk Helicopter Shoot Down Aerial Drone in Flight for the First Time	On January 16, 2025, Admiral James Kilby, Vice Chief of Naval Operations, revealed an important milestone for U.S. Navy aviation. During his address at the Surface Navy Association’s annual symposium near Washington, D.C., Admiral Kilby confirmed that a U.S. Navy MH-60R 'Romeo' Seahawk helicopter deployed to the Red Sea had successfully shot down a drone operated by Houthi militants. This event, first reported by The War Zone, an online platform covering defense, military technology, and security-related topics, marks the first time a U.S. Navy helicopter has engaged and downed an enemy UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in flight.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The U.S. Navy MH-60R Seahawk, a multi-role maritime helicopter, played a pivotal role in the first-ever shootdown of an aerial drone in flight over the Red Sea, marking a significant milestone in counter-drone operations. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The specific type of aerial drone targeted and the exact method used by the U.S. Navy Mh-60R Seahawk naval helicopter to neutralize the UAV remain undisclosed. However, Admiral Kilby mentioned that the helicopter crew had employed 'a little bit of an unconventional system' to carry out the operation. This statement hints at the use of non-traditional or advanced technologies to deal with the increasingly common threat posed by drones in maritime and conflict zones. The MH-60R Seahawk is a versatile and multi-role maritime helicopter used extensively by the U.S. Navy. Primarily designed for anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-surface warfare (ASuW), and reconnaissance missions, the MH-60R is equipped with a suite of advanced sensors and armaments, making it well-suited for conventional and unconventional operations. Its core capabilities include detecting and tracking submarines, conducting surface strikes against maritime targets, and providing real-time intelligence and surveillance for fleet operations. The Seahawk is fitted with the state-of-the-art APS-153 radar system, a multi-mode radar capable of detecting both surface and airborne threats, which would have been crucial in identifying and tracking the Houthi drone. Additionally, the helicopter is equipped with advanced sonar and communications systems that allow for precise coordination with other naval assets. Regarding armament, the MH-60R is armed with a range of precision-guided weapons, including AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, Mk 50 torpedoes, and various machine guns.

The versatility of the MH-60R, coupled with its powerful sensors and armament, positions it as an essential tool in modern naval warfare, capable of addressing a broad range of threats from conventional naval targets to emerging asymmetrical threats like drones. In this case, it can be speculated that the U.S. Navy MH-60R Seahawk, with its advanced radar and sensor systems, likely played a key role in detecting the Houthi drone. However, downing a drone in flight, especially in a maritime environment, is far from simple. UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are often small, agile, and capable of flying at low altitudes, which makes them challenging to detect and track. Given the operational challenges in the Red Sea, including potential interference from variable weather conditions, electromagnetic noise from the sea, and the unpredictable flight patterns of drones, the engagement would have required precise coordination and possibly unconventional methods to overcome these obstacles. The success of this operation underscores the Seahawk's advanced detection and tracking capabilities, but the exact nature of how the drone was engaged remains speculative at this stage. The growing use of drones in the Red Sea region, particularly by Houthi rebels, has added another layer of complexity to maritime security operations. The Houthis have increasingly deployed drones in their ongoing conflict with Saudi-led coalition forces, targeting both military assets and civilian shipping. Drones are often used to strike critical infrastructure, including oil tankers and naval vessels, raising concerns over the safety of international shipping routes. In this context, the successful downing of a drone by a U.S. Navy Seahawk is more than just a tactical victory—it represents a significant step in the evolving counter-drone capabilities of naval forces. The Red Sea's importance as a vital global trade route means that ensuring its security is of paramount concern for international naval forces. With the proliferation of UAV technology, particularly in conflict zones, the ability to intercept and neutralize these threats is becoming an essential capability for modern naval operations. The engagement of the drone by the U.S. Navy's MH-60R Seahawk is a noteworthy achievement, signaling the increasing importance of counter-drone capabilities within naval forces. As Admiral Kilby’s comments highlight, the use of 'unconventional systems' to take out the UAV underscores the innovative approaches needed to address the growing threat of drones in maritime operations. This successful mission also reinforces the idea that the battlefield is evolving—naval forces are no longer just focused on traditional threats like surface combatants and submarines but must also contend with the growing menace of UAVs. As demonstrated in this historic operation, the U.S. Navy’s ability to adapt to these new challenges will be crucial for maintaining maritime security in the Red Sea and beyond. As drone technology continues to evolve, it is likely that naval forces will increasingly rely on both conventional and unconventional means to detect, track, and neutralize these threats. The integration of advanced sensors, electronic warfare, and other countermeasures will shape the future of naval operations in increasingly complex and contested environments.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/flash-info-us-navy-mh-60r-seahawk-helicopter-shoot-down-aerial-drone-in-flight-for-the-first-time	2025-01-18T03:10:41-08:00

Could the Canadian Roshel Senator 4x4 replace Chile’s outdated fleet of Piranha 6x6 armored vehicles?	On January 15, 2025, Infodefensa reported that the Chilean Army is considering purchasing Senator 4x4 armored vehicles from the Canadian manufacturer Roshel Inc. as part of a revised approach to the Cromo project. Initiated in 2018 by the Army Projects and Research Directorate (Dipride), the Cromo project aimed to replace Mowag Famae Piraña 6x6 vehicles, which have been in service for over 30 years and are nearing the end of their operational lifecycle.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Over 1,400 Roshel Senator 4x4 armored vehicles have been supplied to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, where they have been utilized for troop transport and medical evacuation, and Roshel recently expanded its production capabilities by opening its first U.S. facility in Shelby Township, Michigan. (Picture source: Roshel) The original plan involved acquiring 40 new 8x8 armored vehicles for the Mechanized Battalion of the 1st Buin Infantry Regiment, with a budget allocation of $111.8 million. Due to delays and complications, the tender process was declared void in April 2024, prompting an expansion of the project’s scope to include 4x4 and 6x6 platforms. The initial tender specified several requirements, including vehicles capable of carrying ten personnel, meeting NATO STANAG 4569 Level 3 standards for ballistic and mine protection, and integrating remote weapon stations for NATO-classified armaments. These vehicles were intended for use in non-war military operations, disaster response, and training in Peldehue, located north of Santiago. However, financial limitations and challenges integrating L3Harris telecommunications systems led to the rejection of all submitted bids. Following the cancellation of the tender, the Chilean Army issued a request for information (RFI) to manufacturers, expanding its interest to 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8 configurations. Companies responding to the RFI include BMC and Otokar from Turkey, Excalibur Army from the Czech Republic, Iveco from Italy, Patria Group from Finland, and General Dynamics Land Systems. The RFI outlined specifications such as STANAG 4569 Level 2/2A/2B protection, operational functionality in extreme conditions at altitudes above 4,500 meters, and temperature ranges from -20°C to 45°C. The vehicles are also expected to demonstrate versatility across various terrains. Roshel’s Senator 4x4 is among the vehicles being evaluated. This Canadian-made Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle has been used in Ukraine, with more than 1,400 units delivered since 2022. Reports from Ukraine have described the vehicle’s reliability and off-road performance under frontline conditions. Therefore, the Chilean Army is reportedly considering direct procurement of the Senator through the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC), bypassing a competitive bidding process. This method has been criticized for potentially limiting market competition and excluding alternatives, such as Colombia’s Hunter TR-12 or France’s Arquus Bastion. Chile's original plan involved acquiring 40 new 8x8 armored vehicles to replace Mowag Famae Piraña 6x6 vehicles, which have been in service for over 30 years and are nearing the end of their operational lifecycle. (Picture source: Chilean MoD) As part of the evaluation process, the Chilean Army is planning a visit to Roshel’s facilities in Canada to assess the Senator directly. This decision has raised concerns regarding the impartiality of the RFI process, as it may suggest a preference for the Senator despite the ongoing review of other vehicles. Additionally, legal constraints exist, as the Ministry of Defense has not amended the Supreme Decree that originally allocated funds specifically for 8x8 vehicles. Without such amendments, the use of these funds for 4x4 vehicles is not permitted. The Chilean Army’s interest in 4x4 platforms appears linked to priorities such as border surveillance in the Southern Macrozone and addressing irregular immigration and security issues in the Araucanía Region. However, this focus has been criticized for diverging from the original Cromo project’s aim of equipping mechanized infantry units with 8x8 or 6x6 vehicles, which are considered more aligned with global trends and offer greater versatility. Argentina and Peru, for example, have reportedly prioritized 8x8 platforms for their mechanized forces. Compared to 6x6 and 8x8 configurations, 4x4 vehicles have reduced payload capacities, less off-road mobility, and are less suited for integrating heavier weapon systems. Roshel recently expanded its production capabilities by opening its first U.S. facility on December 13, 2024, in Shelby Township, Michigan. The facility consolidates manufacturing processes, accommodates U.S. federal and government clients, and includes a service center. The plant produces the Senator Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle, which is built on the Ford F-550 chassis. This version features STANAG 4569 Level 2 certification, a V-shaped hull for blast mitigation, composite materials for reduced weight, and thermal and acoustic insulation. The MRAP is equipped with a 6.7L turbo diesel engine, an 800-kilometer range, a payload capacity of 2,000 kilograms, and space for ten occupants. It is compatible with various weapon systems, including remote-controlled weapon systems and anti-tank guided missiles. Roshel operates four facilities in Ontario, producing up to 140 vehicles per month. Over 1,400 Senator vehicles have been supplied to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, where they have been utilized for troop transport and medical evacuation. Ukrainian reports indicate the vehicle’s ability to withstand attacks, including those involving First-Person View drones. Roshel is planning to establish a factory in Germany to meet NATO and European demands and intends to localize part of its production in Ukraine. Beyond the Senator, Roshel manufactures the Captain, a light tactical armored vehicle based on the Toyota Land Cruiser 70 chassis, as well as other configurations of the Senator designed for emergency response. The company has delivered vehicles to Costa Rica, South Korea, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and continues efforts to expand its presence in Europe and the United States.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/could-the-canadian-roshel-senator-4x4-replace-chiles-outdated-fleet-of-piranha-6x6-armored-vehicles	2025-01-17T05:54:50-08:00

His government prioritized the relocation of Indonesia’s capital from Jakarta on Java to Nusantara in Borneo, diverting resources and attention away from defense-related initiatives. The renewed focus on maritime cooperation underscores Indonesia's recognition of its strategic vulnerabilities in the face of rising regional tensions. For Japan, this partnership aligns with its Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy, which emphasizes collaboration with Southeast Asian nations to maintain maritime stability. Japan’s stringent 'Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology' pose challenges for defense exports. However, these restrictions can be navigated through joint development agreements. Under this framework, Japan can engage in co-manufacturing with partner nations, enabling the transfer of advanced military technology while adhering to domestic legal constraints. The joint naval ship development signals a growing strategic partnership between Japan and Indonesia. Both nations face security challenges, including territorial disputes and the need to secure vital sea lanes for trade and energy supply. The initiative also reflects a broader trend of regional countries strengthening ties with Japan as a counterbalance to assertive maritime activities in the Indo-Pacific. For Indonesia, the partnership offers access to defense technology and training, potentially setting the stage for more collaborative projects in the future.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/japan-and-indonesia-explore-co-development-of-warship	2025-01-17T05:49:00-08:00	
Flash info: Russian S-400 System Targets a French Atlantique 2 Aircraft Over Baltic Sea	During the night of January 15-16, 2025, a French Navy Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft, operating as part of a NATO mission, was illuminated by the targeting radar of a Russian S-400 air defense system. This action, described as aggressive and contrary to international norms, was condemned on X (formerly Twitter) by French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu. The incident occurred amidst heightened tensions in the Baltic Sea, a strategically critical region where Russian and Western interests frequently clash. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The French Atlantique 2 was inspecting Swedish and Baltic waters, scanning 200 ships without detecting threats when targeted by a Russian S-400 radar (Picture source: French MoD) NATO patrols in the Baltic Sea aim to ensure maritime security and protect critical infrastructure in the region. These operations have intensified in response to recent incidents, including damage to undersea telecommunications and power cables, which European leaders attribute to potential acts of sabotage by Russia. The Baltic Sentry operation mobilizes frigates, maritime patrol aircraft like the Atlantique 2, and naval drones to effectively monitor these strategic waters. On this occasion, the French Atlantique 2 was conducting inspections near Swedish and Baltic waters, scanning around 200 ships without identifying any suspicious vessels. Based on radar capabilities and operational ranges of the S-400 system, it is likely the responsible battery was located in Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave. Kaliningrad, a Russian territory situated between Poland and Lithuania, plays a pivotal role in Russia's air defense strategy. The region has hosted S-400 batteries since their initial deployment in April 2012, aimed at bolstering the Baltic Fleet’s air defense. Additional systems were installed at the Gvardeysk military base near Kaliningrad in March 2019 to further secure this strategically sensitive area. These deployments also serve as a deterrent to NATO forces operating in the region, where tensions continue to rise. The S-400 Triumf, developed by Almaz-Antey, is a sophisticated air defense system featuring an advanced radar architecture. At its core is the 92N6 Grave Stone fire control radar, capable of detecting targets up to 400 kilometers away and at altitudes exceeding 50 kilometers. Supporting this is the 96L6 Cheese Board radar, optimized for tracking targets at both low and high altitudes, and the 91N6E Big Bird radar, which can identify threats at ranges up to 600 kilometers in some configurations. This combination enables the S-400 to detect a wide range of threats, from ballistic missiles and stealth aircraft to drones and cruise missiles. The S-400 is further distinguished by its ability to deploy a variety of missiles tailored to specific threats. The 40N6E missile, with a range of 380 kilometers, can engage targets beyond the radar horizon, including those flying at low altitudes. The 48N6DM/48N6E3 missiles with ranges of 250 kilometers and 48N6E2 with 200 kilometers are designed to intercept high-altitude threats, while the 9M96E missiles with a range of 40 kilometers and 9M96E2 with 120 kilometers are optimized for maneuverable threats and those at low altitudes. These hypersonic missiles, capable of speeds up to Mach 15, ensure rapid and precise interception. In its maximum configuration, an S-400 battery can engage up to 80 targets simultaneously and direct 160 missiles within a 360-degree radius. While the S-400’s modular design and advanced capabilities make it a formidable defense system, they come with significant logistical demands, including maintenance and highly trained personnel. These factors underscore the importance of the S-400 systems stationed in Kaliningrad within Russia's broader anti-access and area denial strategy, effectively securing the region against unauthorized aerial incursions. This incident highlights the growing geopolitical tensions between NATO and Russia, particularly against the backdrop of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The Atlantique 2, designed by Bréguet and Dassault Aviation, specializes in anti-submarine warfare and surveillance missions. With a flight endurance of 14 hours and a range of 4,300 nautical miles, it is a critical asset for NATO operations in the Baltic Sea. Equipped with state-of-the-art sensors, including a magnetic anomaly detector and a 360-degree radar, the Atlantique 2 can efficiently monitor maritime activity in strategic zones. The use of a targeting radar against the Atlantique 2 represents a provocative act, often interpreted as a warning or show of force. While the situation did not escalate further, it underscores the risks of operating in a region where NATO and Russian forces frequently interact. NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, noted that such incidents, though serious, are relatively common and not confined to European theaters. This incident underscores the need for NATO to maintain heightened vigilance against destabilizing actions in the region. In conclusion, this event reflects the delicate balance of power in the Baltic Sea, a critical theater in the broader NATO-Russia rivalry. The advanced capabilities of the S-400 system, coupled with NATO’s strategic resilience, highlight the precarious nature of this region, where each action carries potential implications for international security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-info-russian-s-400-system-targets-a-french-atlantique-2-aircraft-over-baltic-sea	2025-01-17T05:40:11-08:00	
Belgium Invests in Mine Countermeasures with New Ship Liege	According to information published by the Belgian MoD on January 16, 2025, a momentous occasion for the Belgian Navy and the city of Liege unfolded at the Giurgiu shipyard in Romania with the keel-laying ceremony for the Liege, a new mine countermeasures vessel (MCMV).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Keel-laying ceremony of the Belgian City-class rMcM Liege. (Picture source: Belgian MoD) The keel-laying, a traditional naval ceremony symbolizing the beginning of a ship’s construction, was attended by Belgian Navy officials, local dignitaries, and representatives from Liège. The Liège is being constructed as part of the Belgian-Dutch Replacement Mine Countermeasures (rMCM) program, a joint initiative to replace the aging minehunting fleets of both nations. The ship’s construction follows a phased approach, beginning with the assembly of its hull in Romania. Once this stage is completed, the vessel will be transported to Concarneau, France, where advanced systems and equipment will be installed by Naval Group, a key partner in the project. After its completion, the Liège will undergo rigorous testing, including harbor and sea trials, before being equipped with its weapon systems in Lorient, France. The Liège is one of 12 vessels being built under the rMCM program, with six designated for the Belgian Navy and six for the Royal Netherlands Navy. Scheduled for full operational deployment by 2030, these ships will incorporate innovative minehunting technologies, including a fleet of approximately 100 unmanned drones. These systems, part of a modular toolbox, will enhance the fleet’s ability to detect and neutralize mines effectively. Context Historically, mine warfare in the North Sea has been a pivotal aspect of naval strategy due to the region's strategic importance as a maritime gateway. During the World Wars, the North Sea became a critical theater for deploying naval mines to control access, protect key shipping routes, and limit the movement of enemy fleets. In World War I, the North Sea saw the implementation of extensive minefields, such as the North Sea Mine Barrage. This Allied operation aimed to deter German U-boat activity by creating a massive minefield stretching between Scotland and Norway. Over 70,000 mines were laid in deep waters, marking one of the most ambitious mining operations of the time. The barrage was a logistical feat, demonstrating the role of mines in countering undersea threats, although its actual effectiveness remains debated. During World War II, the North Sea once again became a contested space. Both the Axis and Allied forces employed mines extensively, using them to blockade ports, disrupt shipping lanes, and deny access to critical areas. Mines proved to be a relatively inexpensive yet highly effective tool for naval dominance. The German Navy used magnetic mines, a technological innovation of the era, to great effect, challenging traditional mine-sweeping techniques and forcing the Allies to develop countermeasures. The aftermath of these conflicts left thousands of mines scattered across the seabed, posing long-term risks to navigation, fishing, and infrastructure development. The effort to clear these mines was a monumental task undertaken in the post-war years, and unexploded ordnance from these periods continues to be discovered and neutralized today.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/belgium-invests-in-mine-countermeasures-with-new-ship-liege	2025-01-17T04:49:25-08:00

NATO Surveillance Mission French Aircraft Faces Russian Hostility in Baltic Sea	As reported by Le Figaro, a high-tension incident occurred on January 16, 2025, during an aerial surveillance mission over the Baltic Sea. A French Navy Atlantique 2 (ATL2) operating under NATO's framework was targeted by Russian forces while conducting a surveillance flight in response to recent undersea cable damage. The French Armed Forces General Staff confirmed this event, which an AFP journalist witnessed firsthand onboard the aircraft. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Atlantique 2 is a long-range maritime patrol aircraft optimized for anti-submarine warfare and other aeronautical missions (Picture source: Dassault Aviation) The aircraft departed Brittany earlier that day and was tasked with inspecting approximately 200 vessels operating in international waters near Sweden and the Baltic states. During the mission, the plane encountered electronic jamming and was designated by a fire-control radar, a procedure known in military terms as ' illumination.' According to Colonel Guillaume Vernet, spokesperson for the General Staff, this act signals hostility, even though it is not uncommon in this strategically sensitive region. The Atlantique 2, designed by Bréguet and Dassault Aviation, is a long-range maritime patrol aircraft optimized for anti-submarine warfare and other aeronautical missions. It is an evolution of the Breguet Atlantic, featuring advanced operational capabilities, robust endurance, and notable maneuverability. Its bilobed fuselage houses a pressurized cabin and a large weapons bay, supporting its versatility.

Its armament includes AM39 missiles, MU90 torpedoes, and laser-guided bombs, supported by a 12-member crew handling systems, intelligence, and mission execution. The professionalism of the French crew was pivotal in preventing escalation despite the heightened tensions. Colonel Vernet emphasized that Russia’s radar illumination aimed to express restrained hostility, stopping short of direct military action. An attack on a NATO aircraft would have risked triggering a severe and uncontrollable escalation with the Alliance. This incident occurs amid growing suspicions of sabotage targeting critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Over recent months, several undersea communication and power cables have been damaged. On December 25, the EstLink 2 power cable between Finland and Estonia, along with several telecommunication lines, were compromised shortly after similar events in Swedish waters. Finnish authorities suspect Russian involvement and have seized the Eagle S, a tanker under the Cook Islands flag, allegedly part of a Russian 'ghost fleet.' General Christopher Cavoli, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, described the event as 'serious,' noting that such provocations are not confined to Europe. Experts, including former military aviator Xavier Tytelman, highlighted the risks of miscalculation or immediate responses in such situations, which could inadvertently lead to significant escalation. Despite these provocations, the ATL2 completed its mission without identifying suspicious vessels. However, the incident underscores the persistent confrontations in the Baltic region, where hybrid warfare tactics and intimidation measures are prevalent. NATO continues to heighten its vigilance, reflecting the ongoing challenges to maritime security and regional stability posed by geopolitical rivalries. The Baltic Sea has long been a hotspot for tensions between Russia and NATO member states, characterized by frequent interceptions of military aircraft. Russian planes, such as Su-27 Flankers and Il-20s, often operate without flight plans or active transponders in international airspace, complicating their identification and endangering air safety. In response, NATO interceptors, including German and British Eurofighters, are routinely deployed to escort these aircraft out of the area. While these encounters are typically handled professionally, they exemplify the heightened geopolitical strains fueled by the Ukraine conflict and intensified military activities on both sides.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/nato-surveillance-mission-french-aircraft-faces-russian-hostility-in-baltic-sea	2025-01-17T00:09:01-08:00

The missile, which has been in development for several years, is part of a broader strategy to enhance Iran's ability to deter and defend against maritime threats. These new launcher units will be integrated into both the Iranian Navy and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy, providing a new layer of operational flexibility and reach for the country’s defense forces.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The new mobile launcher unit for the Abu Mahdi long-range anti-ship missile, delivered to the Iranian Navy on January 16, 2025, enhances Iran's naval strike capabilities with increased mobility and operational flexibility (Picture source: X Account Hamid) First unveiled in August 2020, the Abu Mahdi cruise missile is a domestically developed long-range anti-ship weapon with a striking range of over 1,000 kilometers. Named after the influential Iraqi commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the missile has been designed to deliver both anti-ship and land-attack capabilities, providing Iran with a versatile tool to challenge naval forces operating in its strategic waters. One of the most significant features of the Abu Mahdi missile is its long range, which at over 1,000 kilometers, is approximately three times the range of Iran's previous most capable anti-ship missiles, such as the 350 km Raad missile and the 300 km Qadir missile. This substantial increase in range allows Iran to project its power much further, complicating the ability of adversaries to operate near its coastline. The Abu Mahdi missile is equipped with cutting-edge technology, including artificial intelligence (AI)-powered guidance, which allows it to perform advanced maneuvering in-flight, avoiding radar detection through low-altitude flight patterns and unpredictable course alterations. These features make the missile particularly effective against heavily defended targets such as aircraft carriers and naval vessels equipped with advanced air defense systems. This combination of long-range capabilities and high precision makes the Abu Mahdi a formidable tool in Iran's naval arsenal. The newly delivered mobile launcher units will allow the Abu Mahdi missiles to be deployed quickly and efficiently from various locations, enhancing their operational flexibility. These launchers can fire multiple missiles at short intervals and from diverse fixed and mobile platforms, enabling Iranian forces to strike multiple targets simultaneously and with a variety of attack trajectories. The dual-mode seekers on the Abu Mahdi, which combine both active and passive radar homing systems, are designed to ensure high precision even in the face of electronic warfare attempts. The integration of mobile launchers with the missile system further complicates adversaries' attempts to neutralize Iran's capabilities. The delivery of these launcher units significantly extends Iran's naval deterrence capabilities. With the Abu Mahdi missile, Iranian forces now possess a weapon that can strike enemy ships from a distance well beyond their shores, effectively forcing foreign military assets, such as aircraft carriers, to stay at least 1,000 kilometers from Iranian waters. This ability to deny access to large swathes of the Persian Gulf and beyond significantly alters the regional naval balance of power. As Iranian defense officials have emphasized, the Abu Mahdi missile is a crucial component of Iran's strategy to defend its maritime borders and exert influence over the Strait of Hormuz, through which a substantial portion of global oil shipments pass. The missile's advanced guidance systems and ability to operate from various platforms, including coastal installations and ships, further enhance its role in Iran's defense strategy. The importance of anti-ship missile capabilities for Iran cannot be overstated, especially in the context of its current strategic environment. Iran is located in a region where maritime security is a constant concern, with the strategic Strait of Hormuz being a chokepoint for global oil transport and a focal point for international tension. In recent years, Iran's adversarial relations with Israel have intensified, with both countries accusing each other of hostile actions and interventions. Israel's growing presence and alliances in the region, particularly in the Mediterranean and around the Gulf, have heightened Iran's concerns over its maritime sovereignty and the security of its critical oil exports. In this volatile context, the Abu Mahdi missile system represents a crucial component of Iran's broader military strategy to deter any foreign military intervention, particularly by Israel and its allies. With the ability to strike naval assets at ranges previously beyond Iran's reach, these missiles bolster Tehran’s strategic posture, allowing it to challenge the naval superiority of regional adversaries, including Israel, and create a formidable defense against any attempts to restrict its maritime access. The Abu Mahdi missile, with its ability to target enemy vessels from a distance and evade advanced radar systems, ensures that Israel and other regional powers would have to stay far out of range to avoid devastating strikes. This increases the deterrence effect, complicating any military planning and making any potential naval engagement in the Persian Gulf a highly risky endeavor. The successful integration of mobile launchers into Iran's naval strategy underscores the increasing sophistication of its military assets, positioning it as a formidable maritime force in the Middle East. The delivery of these mobile launchers for the Abu Mahdi long-range anti-ship cruise missiles represents a major leap in Iran's naval defense capabilities. Iran has significantly bolstered its deterrence capabilities by enhancing its range, precision, and flexibility of its missile forces, making it better positioned to defend its territorial waters and project power in the region. With these new assets in place, Iran’s military is now more capable of challenging foreign naval forces and asserting its dominance in the strategically vital waters of the Persian Gulf.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-iran-strengthens-anti-ship-arsenal-with-new-mobile-abu-mahdi-missiles-launchers	2025-01-16T08:23:52-08:00

US Expresses Concern Over Pakistan's Development of Long-Range Ballistic Missiles	During a speech delivered on December 19 at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Jon Finer, U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor, described Pakistan’s ballistic missile program as an 'emerging threat' to the United States. He highlighted that Pakistan is developing advanced missile technologies, such as high-powered rocket engines, which could eventually enable Islamabad to strike targets well beyond its region, potentially including the U.S. territory. This statement underscores the growing strain in U.S.-Pakistan relations, already fraught with tensions exacerbated by the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and Washington's closer strategic alignment with India. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Shaheen-III long-range ballistic missile (Picture source: IISS) Pakistan’s ballistic missile arsenal, traditionally focused on regional deterrence against India, has undergone significant modernization in recent years. Among its systems, the Shaheen-III, still in development, is the longest-range missile in Pakistan’s inventory, with a range of 2,750 kilometers. Designed to target strategic areas such as India’s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, this two-stage, solid-fueled missile can carry both nuclear and conventional warheads. Its mobility, provided by a Chinese transporter-erector-launcher, enhances its strategic flexibility. Speculation suggests it may eventually be equipped with multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs) to counter missile defenses. This modernization effort is bolstered by close technical cooperation with China and past collaborations with North Korea and Iran. Despite these advancements, U.S. officials assess that Pakistan’s ability to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of targeting the U.S. homeland remains years away. However, they express concern over the broader implications of Pakistan’s efforts for regional and global stability. On December 18, a day before Finer’s speech, the U.S. State Department imposed sanctions on four Pakistani entities, including the state-owned National Development Complex, which plays a central role in missile development. Three additional entities were sanctioned for supplying critical materials for the program. These measures aim to curb the proliferation of missile technologies, although U.S. proposals for confidence-building measures, such as telemetry data sharing and test range limitations, were rejected by Islamabad. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry, in a statement issued on December 19, neither confirmed nor denied the development of long-range ballistic missiles but defended its strategic capabilities as essential for safeguarding sovereignty and maintaining peace in South Asia. The ministry also accused the U.S. of discriminatory practices undermining nonproliferation efforts and exacerbating regional military imbalances. This development signals a potential shift in Pakistan’s nuclear deterrence doctrine, historically focused on countering India. Such advancements may indicate ambitions to extend its strategic reach beyond the region, potentially complicating global nonproliferation efforts and contributing to a broader arms race. Meanwhile, India continues to develop its long-range missile systems, including the Agni-V with a range exceeding 5,200 kilometers, and is working on the Agni-VI to counter China’s capabilities. U.S. accusations regarding Pakistan’s missile program highlight a significant decline in bilateral relations once characterized by strategic cooperation. These revelations and subsequent sanctions intensify geopolitical tensions in South Asia, raising questions about Islamabad’s long-term strategic goals. As mutual distrust deepens, the prospect of a broader arms race threatens to reshape the regional and global strategic balance.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-expresses-concern-over-pakistans-development-of-long-range-ballistic-missiles	2025-01-15T06:59:41-08:00	
Russian Navy’s Grisha-Class Corvette Neutralizes Naval Drones in Pacific Fleet Exercises	According to information published by национальная служба новостей on January 14, 2025, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that the small anti-submarine warfare (ASW) ship Ust-Ilimsk, part of Project 1124 Al'batros, successfully neutralized unmanned surface and aerial drones during recent exercises. The drills took place in Avacha Bay, a key maritime zone of the Pacific Fleet.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Navy's Grisha-class corvette Ust-ilimsk. (Picture source: Russian MoD) During the exercise, the crew detected high-speed targets approaching the entrance to Avacha Bay, home to a critical base for the Pacific Fleet. Upon identification as unmanned surface vessels, the crew engaged and destroyed the targets using heavy machine guns and automatic weapons. Aerial drones were similarly intercepted at low altitudes using the ship’s AK-630 artillery system, a rapid-fire weapon designed for close-range defense against small and fast-moving threats. The Ust-Ilimsk demonstrated its versatility during the operation, employing its advanced arsenal to secure the fleet’s operational zones. The vessel, part of the Pacific Fleet, is specifically designed for anti-submarine warfare but is also well-suited for countering aerial and surface threats. Its armament includes a range of systems such as the Osa-MA air defense system, AK-630 and AK-176 artillery, torpedoes, and the RBU-6000 'Smerch-2' rocket launcher. These capabilities allow the ship to address modern challenges posed by unmanned systems, which are increasingly used in global naval operations. Drone threat The Russian Navy has encountered an unprecedented set of challenges stemming from Ukraine’s strategic and innovative use of drone technology in the ongoing conflict. Unmanned systems, particularly drones, have emerged as a key factor in naval warfare, reshaping the dynamics of power projection and maritime security. The Black Sea, long considered a strategic stronghold for Russia, has become a theater for showcasing the disruptive potential of drones. Ukraine has effectively weaponized unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and aerial drones to target Russian naval assets and infrastructure. These drones have been employed to great effect in precision strikes, surveillance, and as a psychological tool to unsettle Russian naval operations. One of the most notable incidents involved a Ukrainian sea drone destroying a Russian Mi-8 military helicopter near Crimea, underscoring the lethality and operational flexibility of unmanned platforms. Moreover, persistent drone attacks have compelled the Russian Navy to relocate many of its ships from Sevastopol in Crimea, a critical naval hub, to ports like Novorossiysk. This strategic withdrawal highlights the profound impact that drones have had on the operational calculus of one of the world’s most formidable naval forces.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/russian-navys-grisha-class-corvette-neutralizes-naval-drones-in-pacific-fleet-exercises	2025-01-15T06:44:41-08:00

Pakistani Dutch relations Since the 1960s, the Netherlands has been involved in development cooperation with Pakistan, focusing on areas such as water management, education, and governance. This collaboration laid the groundwork for broader bilateral relations, including defense. An aspect of Dutch-Pakistani defense relations is naval cooperation. In the early 1980s, the Royal Netherlands Navy introduced the Alkmaar-class minehunters, known internationally as the Tripartite-class. These vessels were a product of a collaborative effort between France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. In 2021, the Netherlands agreed to transfer two of these minehunters, HNLMS Haarlem and HNLMS Middelburg, to Pakistan. The ships were transported to Pakistan in late 2022. High-level visits have further strengthened defense ties. In October 2024, Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Chief of the Naval Staff of Pakistan, visited the Netherlands. During his visit, he met with senior Dutch military officials, including Vice Admiral René Tas, Commander of the Royal Netherlands Navy, and Vice Admiral Boudewijin Boots, Deputy Chief of Defence. Discussions focused on enhancing bilateral naval collaboration, joint exercises, and training exchange programs. Admiral Ashraf also visited the DAMEN Shipyard and a Zeven De Provinciën-class frigate. Foreign built ships The Pakistan Navy’s fleet includes several foreign-built warships, with countries like China, Turkey, the Netherlands, France, and the United States. From China, the Navy has added multi-role Tughril-class and Zulfiquar-class frigates, both equipped for a range of missions, including anti-surface and anti-submarine operations. China has also supplied Azmat-class fast attack craft, designed for coastal defense and swift engagements, and Hangor-class submarines. Turkey has provided MILGEM-class corvettes, primarily for anti-submarine and patrol operations, and collaborated on the construction of the fleet tanker PNS Moawin, used for logistical support and extended missions. The United States transferred the Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate PNS Alamgir, originally built for the U.S. Navy, to Pakistan as part of a military assistance program.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/damens-pns-yamama-empowers-pakistan-navy-to-secure-exclusive-economic-zone	2025-01-15T05:32:07-08:00

For example, monthly output of 155mm projectiles has risen from 14,400 to 40,000 units, representing a 178% increase. Other key systems, such as HIMARS and PAC-3 MSE missiles, have also seen significant production expansions to meet both current and long-term demands. European nations have equally stepped up their contributions. France and Sweden have announced plans to double their capacity for ammunition and explosive loading by 2025, while Germany and other European countries are establishing new facilities to produce up to 700,000 artillery shells annually by 2025. In Romania, a new gunpowder factory funded through a European Commission project is set to enhance the continent's supply chain further. Collaborative efforts extend beyond Europe, with initiatives like the Czech-led €1.7 billion consortium to source 500,000 artillery rounds globally by the end of 2024. The European defense industry’s Act in Support of Ammunition Production (ASAP) aims to increase annual ammunition shell production to 2 million units by 2025, covering critical components such as explosives, powders, and testing. Ukraine’s domestic defense industry has also seen remarkable growth. The country has increased its annual production of mortar and artillery ammunition from 1 million to 2.5 million rounds in just one year. International partnerships, such as those between Ukraine and companies like Northrop Grumman, Rheinmetall, and the Colt CZ Group, are further driving co-production efforts. These collaborations include the establishment of ammunition factories, maintenance centers, and production lines for critical defense components. Scaling up munitions production for Ukraine has revealed several significant challenges, underscoring the complexities of rapidly increasing defense manufacturing capabilities in response to modern conflicts. Among the most pressing issues are bureaucratic delays. Many governments and defense firms face lengthy approval processes for contracts and export licenses, creating bottlenecks in the supply chain. Additionally, fragmented policies among European Union member states complicate coordinated efforts, further delaying critical deliveries. Supply chain disruptions remain another major hurdle. The global shortage of key raw materials, such as steel, aluminum, and rare-earth elements, has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. Countries relying on imported components, including explosives and propellants, find themselves vulnerable to international trade instability, which has driven up costs and limited access to necessary resources. The absence of long-term contracts between governments and defense manufacturers further undermines efforts to scale up production. Manufacturers need multi-year agreements to justify investments in new facilities or technologies, but uncertainty surrounding the conflict's duration has made governments hesitant to commit. This short-term focus hinders the development of sustainable production capabilities.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/how-nations-are-scaling-up-munitions-production-for-ukraine	2025-01-14T04:23:11-08:00

Japan Plans to Acquire Kamikaze Drones to Strengthen Its Position in East China Sea	The Japanese military is preparing to integrate kamikaze drones into its arsenal for the first time, signaling a significant evolution in its military strategy. The Ministry of Defense announced that approximately 310 small attack drones will be introduced during the 2026 fiscal year. According to the Japanese newspaper The Sankei Shimbun on January 12, 2025, operational tests are underway with models manufactured in Israel, Australia, and Spain, with a competitive bidding process set to determine the final selection. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Kamikaze drones could strengthen the defense of the vulnerable Nansei Islands between Kyushu and Taiwan (Picture source: Arquimea) These kamikaze-type drones, equipped with explosives, are designed to destroy specific targets such as armored vehicles and small vessels. This strategic move aligns with the evolution of modern conflicts, where drones have played a central role, as evidenced by recent warfare in Ukraine. Their autonomous and destructive capabilities provide high operational efficiency at a relatively low cost, a crucial advantage in asymmetric or prolonged conflicts. Japan faces an increasingly tense regional environment and aims to bolster its defensive posture in response to potential threats from neighboring countries. China has intensified military activities in the region, particularly around contested areas in the East China Sea, while North Korea continues to advance its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. In this context, kamikaze drones could play a pivotal role in reinforcing the defense of the Nansei Islands, a strategically important archipelago extending between Kyushu and Taiwan, which remains particularly vulnerable to incursions. Integrating these drones into the infantry units of the Ground Self-Defense Forces (GSDF) will not only modernize Japan’s operational capabilities but also reduce reliance on combat and reconnaissance helicopters. These traditional assets, which are costly and require extensive maintenance, will be gradually replaced by drones, offering a more flexible and practical solution for current needs. The Japanese government has allocated 3.2 billion yen in the 2025 fiscal budget to fund this acquisition. This initiative aligns with the objectives outlined in three key security documents adopted in December 2022, which emphasize the development of defense capabilities relying on unmanned systems. The Ministry of Defense plans to invest approximately 1 trillion yen over five years, starting in 2023, to expedite the deployment of drones and other advanced technologies. These unmanned systems also address Japan’s demographic challenges. Declining birth rates and early retirements within the Self-Defense Forces have reduced available personnel. By automating dangerous missions, drones minimize risks to human lives and help mitigate workforce shortages. Kamikaze drones also present economic advantages. Their acquisition costs are lower than traditional weaponry, and their deployment does not require extensive operator training. This pragmatic approach optimizes military expenditures while enhancing operational effectiveness. The modernization effort extends beyond the GSDF. The Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces are also advancing their respective drone programs. These include advanced reconnaissance drones, larger offensive drones transportable by vehicles, and logistics drones capable of operating in isolated or contested areas. These systems diversify Japan’s military capabilities, enabling quicker and more effective responses to emerging threats. Japan’s acquisition of kamikaze drones carries significant geopolitical weight. By modernizing its military capabilities, Tokyo sends a clear message to both regional partners and rivals: it is committed to defending its interests and taking a more proactive role in maintaining security in the Asia-Pacific region. This approach aims to deter potential aggression while supporting allies, particularly the United States, in ensuring regional stability. However, this decision may also be perceived as a military buildup, potentially drawing criticism from neighboring countries, particularly China. Such perceptions could lead to increased regional tensions and further accelerate military development programs among Japan’s neighbors, contributing to an arms race in the region. The introduction of kamikaze drones into Japan’s arsenal marks a significant step in the transformation of the Self-Defense Forces. These unmanned systems, both efficient and cost-effective, provide Japan with tools to address contemporary security challenges while optimizing its human and material resources. This initiative reflects a comprehensive strategy to modernize military capabilities while adapting to demographic and budgetary constraints. As regional tensions continue to escalate, these drones offer Japan a means to strengthen its defense and contribute actively to the security of the Asia-Pacific. How this move will impact the balance of power in the region and provoke responses from other nations remains to be seen.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/japan-plans-to-acquire-kamikaze-drones-to-strengthen-its-position-in-east-china-sea	2025-01-14T03:25:40-08:00	
Slovakia Reconsiders Military Modernization Plans and Considers Swedish CV90120-T Light Tanks	Slovakia is revisiting its military modernization strategy, with Defence Minister Robert Kaliňák confirming that the country is considering alternatives to the initially proposed Leopard 2A8 main battle tanks. The consideration of CV90120-T light tanks or fire support vehicles comes in response to the high costs associated with acquiring fully-equipped main battle tanks. This shift in focus reflects both budgetary constraints and operational objectives linked to NATO commitments.

Flash Info: Denmark Plans Major Arctic Defense Boost with New Vessels Patrols and F-35 Fighter Jets in Greenland	On January 10, 2025, Denmark unveiled a comprehensive plan to significantly boost its military presence in Greenland, a strategically critical Arctic territory that has become the center of geopolitical attention due to growing interest from the United States. According to Danish TV channels DR and TV2, this expansion is primarily motivated by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's continued focus on Greenland, underscoring its importance for U.S. security interests in the Arctic region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Kangerlussuaq Airport in Greenland: A Strategic Hub for Military Operations and Future F-35 Deployments. (Picture source: Wikimedia) In response to U.S. ambitions, Denmark has proposed the purchase of two new Arctic inspection vessels to replace its aging fleet of four vessels currently operating in the region. These vessels are crucial for monitoring Greenland’s vast maritime borders, which span more than 2.1 million square kilometers, an area four times the size of France. The new ships will be better equipped to handle the demanding Arctic conditions, enhancing Denmark’s surveillance capabilities in a region that is increasingly becoming a hotspot for geopolitical rivalries. Alongside the new vessels, Denmark also plans to increase its dog sled patrols from the current 12, reinforcing its surveillance network across Greenland's rugged and ice-covered terrain. Dog sled patrols, although limited in reach, offer unmatched access to remote areas that are difficult to navigate with conventional vehicles. By expanding these patrols, Denmark aims to strengthen its monitoring and response capabilities in some of the most challenging environments on Earth. A key element of Denmark's military modernization involves the proposed upgrade of Kangerlussuaq Airport, a former U.S. military base in western Greenland. The plan includes making the airport capable of accommodating advanced F-35 fighter jets, a move that would significantly enhance Denmark’s air surveillance and rapid-response capabilities in the Arctic. Kangerlussuaq's strategic location near Greenland’s western coast, along the shortest route from North America to Europe, has long made it an attractive site for military operations. With the upgrades, Denmark would be able to deploy state-of-the-art aircraft for air patrols, surveillance, and deterrent operations, further bolstering its defense capabilities in the region. As part of its overall strategy to strengthen surveillance and intelligence in the Arctic, Denmark has committed $400 million to improve its long-range drone capabilities. These drones will be deployed to cover the vast, remote expanses of Greenland, providing critical real-time intelligence on military movements, environmental changes, and potential threats. This investment will help Denmark maintain a strategic edge in an increasingly contested region, especially as the Arctic's rapidly changing climate opens new shipping routes and access to natural resources. The ability to track and monitor these developments is essential to safeguarding Denmark's interests in the area. This strategic military buildup comes in response to President-elect Donald Trump’s repeated remarks about Greenland's geopolitical importance. Trump has long expressed interest in Greenland, even suggesting in 2019 that the United States should purchase the island from Denmark. While this proposal was firmly rejected by both Denmark and Greenland’s leadership, Trump has continued to view Greenland as a critical asset to U.S. security. His recent statements in early January 2025 reaffirmed his belief that controlling Greenland is essential for U.S. national security. While not explicitly advocating for the island's purchase this time, Trump’s rhetoric signals an ongoing effort to assert U.S. influence in the Arctic, a region that is increasingly pivotal due to resource exploration, military competition, and climate change. Denmark, which holds responsibility for Greenland’s defense and security, has historically maintained limited military capabilities on the island. The existing forces include aging inspection vessels, a Challenger surveillance plane, and dog sled patrols, all tasked with monitoring a vast and inhospitable territory. These resources, though functional in the past, have proven insufficient to address the growing security concerns in the Arctic. The Danish government has acknowledged this limitation and, under increasing pressure, has begun to modernize its defense infrastructure to ensure Greenland’s protection in the face of rising external threats. Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, is strategically located at the heart of Arctic geopolitics, a region where nations like Russia, Canada, and the United States are vying for influence. Denmark’s military investments reflect a concerted effort to secure Greenland’s sovereignty while preserving its semi-autonomous status. The island’s vast resources and strategic location make it a highly contested area, and as the U.S. seeks to bolster its military presence in the Arctic, Denmark faces the challenge of balancing its sovereignty over Greenland with maintaining strong defense ties to NATO, particularly with the U.S. In conclusion, Denmark's plan to invest in modernizing its military infrastructure in Greenland marks a crucial step in ensuring the island’s defense amidst growing geopolitical tensions. The proposed acquisitions of new Arctic inspection vessels, the expansion of dog sled patrols, and the upgrade of Kangerlussuaq Airport to accommodate F-35 jets demonstrate Denmark’s commitment to strengthening its Arctic defense. These measures not only respond to Donald Trump’s renewed interest in Greenland but also acknowledge the changing dynamics in the Arctic, ensuring Denmark remains a key player in the region's security as global powers vie for control over its resources and strategic assets.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-info-denmark-plans-major-arctic-defense-boost-with-new-vessels-patrols-and-f-35-fighter-jets-in-greenland	2025-01-14T02:39:35-08:00

Recently, the 3rd Combat Helicopter Regiment (3e RHC) conducted an initial experiment integrating an FPV drone aboard a Gazelle helicopter. The drone was remotely piloted from the helicopter, marking a significant step toward effective collaboration between manned and unmanned platforms. The experiment pursued two key objectives: enhancing reconnaissance and combat support capabilities while testing the concept of 'air-launched devices' (ELA). This concept involves deploying drones for kinetic or non-kinetic missions at distances of 20 to 50 kilometers from the host helicopter. These drones could eventually operate in synergy with future Guépard helicopters, developed under the HIL program, which will gradually replace the Gazelle fleet. The FPV drones tested stand out for their agility and their ability to provide real-time video feeds to the operator through a virtual reality (VR) headset. Although specific details about the drones used have not been disclosed, images show an operator aboard the Gazelle using typical commercial drone control equipment adapted for military applications. Tactical uses include urban reconnaissance, target identification, guiding precision strikes, as well as electronic jamming or laser designation for artillery. Another crucial aspect is the compatibility of these drones with existing artillery systems, such as the Nexter CAESAR self-propelled howitzer. Drones could enhance intelligence loops by offering target acquisition and destruction capabilities at long range, thereby shortening the time between detection and action. In parallel, in January 2025, the French Army presented the DT-46 drone, a versatile platform designed for reconnaissance and tactical support missions. This convertible drone, weighing less than 30 kilograms, can take off vertically with its four rotors before transitioning to horizontal flight, covering distances of up to 100 kilometers with an endurance of five hours. Its ability to be assembled in 15 minutes and operated by a small team of four highlights its adaptability. Equipped with a retractable electro-optical turret, it is designed to meet the demands of modern combat environments. General David Cruzille, commander of the French Army Light Aviation (ALAT), highlighted that this initiative aligns with a combined employment doctrine for helicopters and drones, conceived 15 years ago but only now feasible due to technological advancements. This approach aims to reduce risks for crews while enhancing operational capabilities in complex and hostile environments. However, General Pierre Schill, Chief of Defense Staff, emphasized the continued importance of manned platforms. According to him, manned helicopters remain essential, particularly in scenarios involving disrupted communications or operations requiring rapid and adaptive human decision-making. These experiments represent the beginning of a broader transformation. With the goal of full 'drone enablement' by 2040, the French Army aims to develop innovative solutions that will redefine aerial operations in Europe and beyond. The integration of drones with manned platforms promises to improve mission effectiveness while reducing costs and risks to personnel. The test involving Gazelle helicopters and FPV drones is a critical step toward this future. It demonstrates the potential of drones as tactical force multipliers while laying the groundwork for an operational doctrine suited to contemporary challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/france-relies-on-fpv-drones-to-redefine-role-of-its-gazelle-combat-helicopters	2025-01-14T02:22:34-08:00	
Will three new ships deployed by Sweden prevent attacks on underwater infrastructure?	According to information published by Associated Press on January 12, 2025, Sweden will contribute up to three warships to a NATO-led initiative aimed at enhancing the alliance's presence in the Baltic Sea. The move is part of an effort to guard against potential sabotage of vital underwater infrastructure, the Swedish government announce.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Swedish Navy submarine rescue ship HSwMS Belos. (Picture source: Finnish MoD) In addition to the warships, Sweden’s military will deploy an ASC 890 surveillance aircraft to enhance situational awareness in the region. The Swedish Coast Guard will also play a significant role, with four ships dedicated to monitoring the Baltic Sea and an additional seven vessels on standby for rapid response. This marks Sweden's first operational contribution to NATO’s defense and deterrence efforts as a member of the alliance. The country formally joined NATO in March, becoming its 32nd member. Sweden's accession followed that of neighboring Finland and was spurred by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which significantly altered the security landscape in Northern Europe. The decision to strengthen NATO's presence in the Baltic comes amid a series of incidents in the region, raising concerns about possible Russian activities. The Baltic Sea, a crucial economic and strategic corridor, is crisscrossed by undersea cables and pipelines that connect Nordic, Baltic, and Central European nations. These infrastructures facilitate trade, enhance energy security, and, in some cases, reduce reliance on Russian energy resources. Sweden’s participation in this NATO operation comes at a pivotal moment for the alliance, which has been focusing on fortifying its eastern flank in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. The Baltic Sea has become a focal point for these efforts, given its strategic location and the vulnerabilities of its underwater infrastructure. Comments Monitoring undersea cables in the Baltic Sea is particularly challenging due to the region's unique characteristics and the nature of the threats involved. The Baltic is one of the busiest maritime zones globally, with over 2,000 ships navigating its waters daily, including commercial cargo vessels, oil tankers, and fishing trawlers. This high density of maritime activity creates significant obstacles for identifying vessels that might pose a deliberate or accidental risk to undersea cables. The sheer volume of traffic makes it difficult to discern routine activities from those potentially harmful. The technological limitations in the detection and surveillance of undersea infrastructure further compound the problem. Current systems struggle to provide real-time monitoring of extensive cable networks, which often span hundreds or thousands of kilometers. The deep-sea environment adds complexity, with cables often lying on the seabed in remote areas that are difficult to access and monitor. Damage to cables can be caused by natural phenomena, such as seabed shifts or underwater currents, but deliberate sabotage, such as anchor dragging or the use of specialized underwater drones, is increasingly suspected. The covert nature of these activities makes attribution particularly difficult, leaving authorities reliant on indirect evidence or post-incident investigations. Jurisdictional and legal challenges also play a major role. Undersea cables frequently traverse international waters, where no single nation has the authority to enforce protective measures. This limits the ability of individual countries to act decisively against potential threats. Even within territorial waters, enforcement can be difficult due to overlapping national interests and the need for coordination between multiple stakeholders. Moreover, laws governing undersea infrastructure security are often outdated or insufficiently comprehensive, leaving gaps in enforcement and response capabilities. Adding to these challenges, the Baltic Sea itself poses unique geographical difficulties. Its relatively shallow depths, brackish water, and numerous islands create a complex maritime environment that can obscure monitoring efforts.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/will-three-new-ships-deployed-by-sweden-prevent-attacks-on-underwater-infrastructure	2025-01-14T01:58:02-08:00
