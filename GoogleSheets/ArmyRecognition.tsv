In recent years, North Korea has steadily advanced its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capabilities, transitioning from early liquid-fuel systems to cutting-edge solid-fuel technology. This evolution, marked by successive tests and incremental improvements, underscores a shift in North Korea’s nuclear and strategic missile posture. The Hwasong-19 launch on October 31, 2024, is part of this trend, showcasing Pyongyang's enhanced missile range, readiness, and operational flexibility, which align with its stated goals of countering perceived U.S. and allied threats. Historically, North Korea’s earlier liquid-fuel ICBMs, such as the Hwasong-15 and Hwasong-17, demonstrated its long-range strike potential. However, these systems were slower to deploy and required extensive preparation time, making them susceptible to detection and preemptive strikes. The recent development of solid-fuel ICBMs like the Hwasong-18, tested multiple times in 2023, and now the Hwasong-19, signals a notable leap in North Korea’s missile capabilities. Solid-fuel missiles are faster to launch, more mobile, and easier to conceal, allowing North Korea greater operational agility. These advancements enable a 'launch-on-demand' capability that significantly reduces the time needed for ICBM launch preparation, thus enhancing North Korea's strategic deterrence​. The progression from the Hwasong-18 to the Hwasong-19 reflects North Korea's rapid technological strides in missile systems. The Hwasong-18, first tested in early 2023, demonstrated an estimated range of 15,000 km, enough to cover the entire continental United States if launched on a standard trajectory. The Hwasong-19, reportedly an evolution of the Hwasong-18, may incorporate similar or extended range capabilities, placing nearly all North America within reach depending on its payload configuration. Such improvements suggest a potential for multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). This technology would enable a single missile to strike various targets, further complicating missile defense efforts in the region​. Regionally, North Korea’s advancements have amplified security concerns among neighboring countries and the United States. Both South Korea and Japan have bolstered their missile defense systems and conducted joint exercises with the U.S. in response to North Korea’s increasingly sophisticated ICBMs. This recent test also follows increased cooperation between North Korea and Russia, signaling potential technological or strategic exchanges that could accelerate further advancements in North Korean missile technology. These developments underscore an evolving nuclear landscape in East Asia, where North Korea's shift to highly survivable, road-mobile, solid-fuel ICBMs enhances its deterrence posture and increases the risks and complexities of regional security dynamics. With each successful test, North Korea inches closer to a fully operational, flexible, and deployable ICBM force capable of presenting a continuous strategic threat to U.S. territories and allies across the Pacific. As North Korea advances its missile program, the Hwasong-19 test underscores a shift in its nuclear posture, marked by an increased readiness to deploy advanced missile systems in a more flexible and survivable form, raising the stakes in the ongoing geopolitical dynamics in East Asia.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/north-korea-test-fires-most-powerful-icbm-missile-hwasong-19-capable-of-reaching-us-territory	2024-11-01T03:26:20-07:00

South Korea Warns of Looming North Korean Nuclear Test Before US Election	On October 30, 2024, South Korea’s Ministry of Defense informed lawmakers that North Korea appears ready for a seventh nuclear test and an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch, potentially timed with the U.S. presidential election on November 5. Intelligence obtained during a confidential briefing indicates that North Korea has completed preparations for a nuclear test at its Punggye-ri site, with specific equipment and launch units in place, likely for an ICBM launch designed to demonstrate atmospheric reentry capabilities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The ICBM, possibly a Hwasong-18 or similar, would test the durability of reentry technology, crucial for ensuring the warhead survives extreme heat and friction en route to its target (Picture source: KCNA) The session, conducted by representatives of South Korean military intelligence, also revealed signs of North Korean troops mobilized in Russia. Some units are reported to have joined the frontlines in the Kursk region, where Russian forces face Ukrainian counteroffensives. This deployment, observers note, underscores the strengthened strategic alliance between Pyongyang and Moscow amidst the ongoing Ukraine conflict, a factor North Korea appears to be leveraging to intensify its military activities. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been ramping up displays of power in recent months, accelerating missile tests and revealing a secret military-grade uranium production facility in September. According to South Korean intelligence, North Korea has deployed a mobile launcher, likely a 12-axle model recently shown in state media, for an ICBM launch potentially reaching U.S. territory. This move aligns with warnings from South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol that Pyongyang may orchestrate significant military provocations around U.S. elections to pressure Washington and its allies. The ICBM, possibly a Hwasong-18 or similar, would test the durability of reentry technology, crucial for ensuring the warhead survives extreme heat and friction en route to its target. While previous North Korean ICBM tests were conducted at steep angles to minimize distance and avoid neighboring territories, analysts suggest that a more standard trajectory would represent a major advancement in North Korea’s missile program. Such a test would confirm North Korea’s capability to target distant locations, including the U.S. mainland. The escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula since 2022, particularly following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has allowed North Korea to advance its nuclear and missile programs under reduced international scrutiny. In this context, recent reports from South Korean authorities leave little doubt regarding Kim Jong Un’s intentions to continue developing weapons of mass destruction while strengthening alliances with powers outside the Western sphere, such as Russia. For decades, North Korea has pursued nuclear capabilities to bolster its deterrence against perceived threats. Relying on asymmetric armament strategies to offset the limitations of its conventional forces, Pyongyang has made significant progress in nuclear warhead miniaturization and ICBM development, such as the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 models. These capabilities position North Korea as a nuclear power capable of targeting the U.S., thereby increasing geopolitical pressure on the United States and its allies. As North Korea strategically positions itself, the U.S. and its regional allies continue to closely monitor these preparations to anticipate any potential threat. The possibility of a nuclear test and an ICBM launch around the U.S. election period introduces an air of uncertainty, underscoring the importance of maintaining international vigilance.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-warns-of-looming-north-korean-nuclear-test-before-us-election	2024-10-30T03:23:55-07:00	
US future Liberty Lifter seaplane to revolutionize sea logistics with 22,000 kg cargo capacity	On October 29, 2024, Aurora Flight Sciences, a subsidiary of Boeing, released a new video demonstrating the Liberty Lifter seaplane concept, part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program.

The video presents the aircraft as a potential solution for fast, heavy-lift transport from the sea without needing airstrips or ports, with applications that could include logistics, search and rescue, and disaster response.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link As part of Phase 1, Aurora Flight Sciences is designing a demonstrator aircraft with a 65-meter wingspan, capable of carrying up to 22,680 kg of cargo, as well as operating both in standard flight at altitudes up to 3,000 m, and in ground effect close to the ocean’s surface. (Picture source: Aurora Flight Sciences) The Liberty Lifter program was launched by DARPA to develop a low-cost, heavy-lift seaplane capable of operating in ground effect close to the ocean’s surface, improving flight efficiency and range. Aurora Flight Sciences has partnered with Gibbs &amp; Cox, a naval architecture and marine engineering company, along with other collaborators, to design the aircraft. The seaplane can take off and land in open sea conditions, even in moderate to rough sea states, and could represent a significant advancement in sea-based transport systems. As part of Phase 1, Aurora Flight Sciences is designing a demonstrator aircraft with a 65-meter wingspan, capable of carrying up to 50,000 pounds (22,680 kilograms) of cargo. The aircraft is designed to operate both in standard flight at altitudes up to 10,000 feet (3,000 meters), and in ground effect close to the ocean’s surface. The technologies tested on this X-plane are expected to be applicable to future aircraft with cargo capacities comparable to that of the C-17, which can carry up to 180,000 pounds (81,647 kilograms). The development team is utilizing low-cost manufacturing techniques from the shipbuilding industry to ensure affordability. The Liberty Lifter is being designed to take off and land in sea conditions up to Sea State 4 and operate in ground effect up to Sea State 5. Tow tank testing has been completed at the Stevens Institute of Technology and Virginia Tech to validate hydrodynamic models and seakeeping performance, while propeller performance characterization has been conducted in preparation for wind tunnel tests scheduled for early 2025. A cockpit simulation lab is also under construction for testing pilot interaction with advanced control systems for flying in ground effect over high sea states. The project is now in Phase 1B, which includes ongoing design refinement and testing, leading up to a preliminary design review. The next phase, Phase 2, will involve further development and a critical design review, with Phase 3 planned for 2026. Phase 3 includes manufacturing the demonstrator aircraft, followed by flight testing, which is projected to start in 2028. The Liberty Lifter project was initiated by DARPA in mid-2022 to explore the potential of a seaplane that uses ground effect to transport large loads while operating independently of runways. Unlike earlier ekranoplan designs, the Liberty Lifter is expected to perform in moderate to rough sea conditions and fly at altitudes up to 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). In February 2023, DARPA awarded contracts to two companies for competing designs. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems partnered with Maritime Applied Physics Corporation, while Aurora Flight Sciences teamed with Leidos subsidiary Gibbs &amp; Cox. Aurora's design features a monohull with a high-wing configuration and relies on eight turbine engines, a concept similar to Boeing's earlier Pelican proposal. Initial contracts awarded in 2023 provided funding for the development of both teams' designs, with Aurora receiving around $5.6 million. DARPA exercised further funding options in mid-2023, providing Aurora with an additional $19.5 million to continue its design work. The final designs for Phase 1 were expected by mid-2024, and in May 2024, DARPA selected Aurora's design to move forward with an $8.3 million contract modification. The demonstrator aircraft, scaled to the size of a C-130 Hercules, is expected to have a wingspan of 213 feet and be capable of lifting 50,000 pounds of cargo. If successful, this design will be scaled up to match the cargo capacity of a C-17, carrying 180,000 pounds (81,647 kilograms). The Liberty Lifter is designed to operate less than 100 feet (30 meters) above sea level in ground effect, enabling efficient long-distance travel with a range of 6,500 nautical miles (12,000 kilometers). It is also designed to meet the U.S. Department of Defense's heavy-lift requirements, capable of carrying a load equivalent to two U.S. Marine Corps Amphibious Combat Vehicles or six 20-foot (6-meter) storage containers. Aurora's design, selected over that of General Atomics, is now moving toward the next phase of development, with a flying prototype expected by 2027 or early 2028.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-future-liberty-lifter-seaplane-to-revolutionize-sea-logistics-with-22-000-kg-cargo-capacity	2024-10-30T03:21:55-07:00

The Trophy Active Protection System enhances defense against anti-tank threats. The Trophy Active Protection System (APS), developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, is a vehicle-mounted defense system designed to protect against various anti-tank threats, including rockets and guided missiles. Operational in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since 2011, it uses multiple radar panels to detect incoming projectiles and neutralizes them by firing countermeasures, intercepting the threat before it reaches the vehicle. This system has been integrated into key Israeli platforms, such as the Merkava tank and Namer APC, and has attracted significant interest from other countries, including the U.S., which has equipped the M1 Abrams with Trophy, and Germany, which has fitted it to the Leopard 2. Despite successful interception, passive armor remains necessary, as fragments of neutralized projectiles may still impact the tank. Each launcher provides more than 180 degrees of coverage, ensuring 360-degree protection. The system operates autonomously, with the tank commander controlling only whether it is active or not. The Trophy's combat-proven capabilities have demonstrated a high interception rate, especially during operations involving the Israeli Defense Forces. It has also been successfully tested by European armies. In addition to protection, the system provides situational awareness through its Fire Source Location (FSL) capability, allowing vehicles to locate and respond to enemy fire effectively. As of 2023, the system has been fielded on more than 1,000 vehicles worldwide, underscoring its role as a critical component in modern armored warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/germany-equips-leopard-2a7a1-tank-with-trophy-aps-to-enhance-protection-against-missiles	2024-10-30T03:09:57-07:00

Military doctors conducted emergency procedures and life-support drills. Piracy Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and surrounding waters has seen fluctuating trends in 2024, marked by a resurgence of high-severity incidents. Despite a global decrease in piracy rates, piracy remains persistent in this region, largely due to geopolitical instability and economic incentives for Somali pirate groups. Notably, Somali pirates have recently resumed hijackings, employing fishing vessels as 'mother ships' to launch skiff-based attacks on passing merchant ships, especially those less protected by armed security or defensive measures. Pirate tactics in the Gulf of Aden often include kidnapping crews for ransom, with recent months witnessing heightened violence against captured individuals. While many attacks are thwarted by security teams and vessel hardening measures, pirates continue to exploit vessels lacking rigorous defenses. Reports highlight cases where pirates intercept vessels using false distress calls or approach vessels under the guise of local fishermen, increasing the risk of misunderstandings and violence. The ongoing regional conflict, particularly involving Houthi attacks and Iranian-backed groups, has also destabilized the Gulf of Aden, further threatening commercial shipping. The recent uptick in anti-ship missile and drone attacks, some targeting vessels linked to Western interests, underscores the rising regional complexity. Consequently, international naval task forces such as the U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian and the European Union’s Operation Aspides have expanded their protective scope to secure critical shipping routes in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/chinese-navy-conducts-advanced-anti-piracy-drills-in-gulf-of-aden	2024-10-30T02:54:08-07:00

Batch II submarines, however, increase this to a surfaced displacement of 3,600 tons and a length of 89.4 meters. Batch II also introduces lithium-ion batteries in place of the lead-acid batteries used in Batch I, offering a substantial boost to submerged endurance and faster recharge times. Both batches utilize an Air-Independent Propulsion (AIP) system, but the addition of lithium-ion technology in Batch II triples the submarine's submerged endurance. Weapon systems are another area of upgrade. Batch I includes six vertical launch system (VLS) cells for launching SLBMs and eight 533mm torpedo tubes. Batch II expands this to ten VLS cells, enabling a broader range of attack strategies and increased firepower. These additional VLS cells make Batch II more versatile in supporting offensive operations and strategic deterrence, with SLBMs like the Hyunmoo-IV-4.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/south-korea-begins-construction-on-advanced-jangbogo-iii-batch-ii-submarine-for-2031-navy-delivery	2024-10-30T01:39:30-07:00	
Possible Appearance of Israeli RA-01 Drone Over Lebanon After Intelligence Leak	On October 28, 2024, a low-resolution video, posted on the social network X by @Shabahe_Persia, shows a mysterious drone flying over Lebanon. The footage has since sparked speculation about the possible appearance of the RA-01, an Israeli stealth drone recently disclosed through classified American documents leaked online. This drone is reportedly designed for long-range surveillance and attack missions, suited to the region’s security challenges. While the context and authenticity of the video remain unconfirmed, it offers a potential glimpse of advanced technology that may be deployed by the Israeli military.

The drone has a design reminiscent of the American RQ-180, featuring a smooth fuselage and a large, wing-shaped structure. However, its flight in daylight at low altitude, atypical for a stealth craft, raises questions about its nature, particularly due to the increased visibility it could generate for ground observers. The daylight operation could also suggest a demonstration intent, contrasting with the usual objectives of stealth technology. Visual details of the observed drone differ from the RQ-180, particularly in the shape of its wings and fuselage, which could imply a new design or even digital manipulation of the footage. However, in-depth analyses are needed to assess the video’s authenticity, especially by examining shadows and lighting that appear consistent. The difficulty of replicating these effects in natural conditions raises the possibility of alteration, although there is no conclusive evidence to affirm that the video is fabricated. The emergence of this footage echoes recent reports from the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) documents that reveal the existence of Israeli stealth drones with reconnaissance and attack capabilities. According to these documents, which U.S. authorities have not disputed, Israel possesses a fleet of stealth drones capable of long-range operations, potentially for missions in Iran. Although technical specifications and capabilities of this model, supposedly named RA-01, have not been confirmed, its deployment at Ramon Airbase in the Negev Desert is suggested in the documents. This location reportedly includes specific facilities to house unique aircraft, potentially intended for stealth drones. Satellite images reveal fenced areas at the base with semi-circular hangars and access routes to the runways, developed over the last decade. The construction of these facilities could be associated with infrastructure needs to house and deploy strategic platforms like the RA-01. While Israel has a longstanding tradition in stealth technology development, this drone would represent a significant asset in its surveillance and discreet strike capabilities, especially given its geopolitical stance toward Iran. Observers suggest that the RA-01 may also have been involved in recent operations, including strikes on Iranian infrastructure. However, the lack of tangible evidence and the opacity surrounding the aircraft leave room for the possibility of a disinformation strategy, potentially amplified by the leaked classified documents that may contain strategic exaggerations. In the context of heightened surveillance and operations in contested airspaces, the RA-01 could play a pivotal role in enabling Israel to conduct discreet intelligence-gathering and targeted strikes. Its stealth and extended range would provide Israel with new tactical options for high-value strategic missions. In a region marked by enduring tensions, possession of such a drone would offer Israel significant operational flexibility, allowing it to monitor sensitive areas and prepare potential strikes without immediate risk of detection.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/possible-appearance-of-israeli-ra-01-drone-over-lebanon-after-intelligence-leak	2024-10-30T01:18:22-07:00

Inside Israel’s Precision Strikes and Hezbollah’s Missile Arsenal in Lebanon Conflict	The US Congress has published a document on the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah in October 25, 2024, which escalated after Hamas-led attacks on Israel in October 2023. Key aspects of this conflict highlight the advanced military material and capabilities at play, with significant losses on both sides. Israel has focused its efforts on undermining Hezbollah’s military infrastructure, while Hezbollah’s material resources, including advanced missiles and drones, underscore the group's resilient military stance despite substantial setbacks.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link IDF soldiers discovered a cache of weapons, including grenade launchers, shoulder-fired missiles, RPGs, combat vests, Kornet missiles, and other arms, inside a mosque located within a civilian neighborhood in southern Lebanon. (Picture source: Israel Defense Forces) Israel’s campaign has demonstrated formidable air power, relying heavily on precision-guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and advanced electronic warfare capabilities. The Israeli Air Force, with its fleet of F-35 Lightning II stealth fighters, has executed deep-penetration missions into Lebanese and Syrian territories, targeting Hezbollah's command centers and high-ranking leadership. Israel’s networked command and control systems facilitate coordinated strikes that are highly precise and capable of minimizing collateral damage, thus reinforcing its tactical upper hand. These air operations are supplemented by ground forces equipped with guided missiles and precision artillery, making Israeli forces exceptionally lethal in limited cross-border incursions. Israel's electronic warfare units have also disrupted Hezbollah's communications and tracking capabilities, a critical part of their strategy to undermine the group's command structure. Coupled with sophisticated intelligence operations, Israel’s ability to penetrate Hezbollah's defenses has been effective, targeting major figures within the organization, including the group's long-standing leader, Hassan Nasrallah. This intelligence-driven approach not only weakened Hezbollah’s operational structure but also underscored Israel’s mastery in cyber and signals intelligence, allowing it to predict and intercept Hezbollah’s strategic moves. Despite these losses, Hezbollah retains significant military material and resources, sourced primarily through its longstanding alliance with Iran. Precision-guided missiles, drones, and anti-tank weapons form the backbone of Hezbollah’s arsenal, enabling it to mount a sustained resistance and keep up the pressure on Israeli targets. Iran’s advanced weaponry, including Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar missiles, provides Hezbollah with extended reach, posing a direct threat to Israel's population centers.

Pentagon Faces Shortage of Air-Defense Missiles Amid Rising Demand	The United States is experiencing a reduction in its stockpile of air-defense missiles, raising concerns about the Pentagon's readiness to respond to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Europe, as well as potential conflicts in the Pacific. These concerns, highlighted in a recent The Wall Street Journal article on October 29, 2024, focus on interceptors that are essential for countering missile and drone threats in the region. Demand for these munitions has surged as U.S. allies, notably Israel, confront escalating attacks orchestrated by Iran and affiliated militias. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An SM-3 Block 1B interceptor is launched from the USS Lake Erie during an MDA test (Picture source: US DoD) Since Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, the United States has deployed over 100 Standard Missiles—interceptors typically launched from ships, crucial for countering Iranian threats and Houthi attacks on Western ships in the Red Sea. This rapid consumption, further accelerated by recent Israeli strikes against Iran, has heightened concerns about the U.S.'s ability to meet growing demands for these munitions, particularly should a conflict arise in the Pacific. The term Standard Missile in this context refers to a series of air-defense missiles developed by RTX (formerly Raytheon Technologies) for the U.S. Navy, including models such as the Standard Missile-2 (SM-2), Standard Missile-3 (SM-3), and Standard Missile-6 (SM-6). These ship-launched missiles are critical for countering a variety of threats, from ballistic missiles to cruise missiles and aircraft, and are integrated into naval defense systems to protect U.S. forces and allies like Israel. The SM-2 primarily serves medium-range anti-aircraft defense, while the SM-3 and SM-6 add extended capabilities for intercepting ballistic and cruise missiles. The SM-2 is designed for medium-range air defense, capable of intercepting aircraft and cruise missiles within a range of approximately 170 kilometers at speeds of up to Mach 3. The SM-3, with greater range, is intended to neutralize ballistic missiles during their exo-atmospheric phase with a kinetic warhead, reaching targets up to 500 kilometers away. The SM-6 combines both anti-aircraft and anti-missile functions with a range of around 240 kilometers, excelling at intercepting low-altitude cruise missiles and high-speed aerial threats with multi-mode guidance. Pentagon officials, while keeping stockpile data classified to prevent strategic leverage by Iran and its allies, have acknowledged heightened pressure on resources. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh indicated that the Department of Defense is adjusting its posture to protect U.S. forces and support Israel, while maintaining focus on readiness and stockpiles. The high rate of interceptor use by the Pentagon raises challenges for responding to unexpected demands in both the Middle East and Europe. Additional concerns involve the responsiveness of the defense industry, which is often constrained by the need to expand production lines, facilities, and qualified personnel. Elias Yousif, Deputy Director of the Conventional Defense Program at the Stimson Center, noted that the U.S. has not developed a defense industrial base suited to prolonged attritional conflict, which complicates the current situation. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro has advocated for increased production of Standard Missiles, though he acknowledged the challenges associated with producing such sophisticated munitions. The Pentagon is exploring alternative solutions, including soliciting new companies to help boost production of air-defense missiles. Despite recent stockpile increases, the launch rate observed in recent months has exceeded production capacity, according to defense analysts and officials. RTX, the manufacturer of Standard Missiles, produces a few hundred annually, though these munitions are also supplied to over 14 U.S. allies, limiting availability for the Pentagon. RTX spokesperson Chris Johnson stated that the company closely collaborates with the Department of Defense to meet production needs. Since the onset of the Hamas-Israel conflict last year, U.S. ships have launched over $1.8 billion in interceptors to protect Israel and ships passing through the Red Sea from Iranian threats. On average, two interceptors are launched per incoming missile to ensure accuracy, resulting in high costs to counter less sophisticated targets, such as Houthi drones. A congressional official noted that while costly, these munitions take months to replace. Last month, the U.S. deployed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to Israel, allowing the use of other types of interceptors in addition to Standard Missiles. The Pentagon also repositioned Patriot missile defense systems in the region, though their availability remains limited due to commitments in Ukraine. While the Pentagon aims to maintain current Standard Missile production levels, it may reduce production of older variants to fund newer models. The pace of interceptor use in the Middle East, however, could jeopardize U.S. readiness for a Pacific conflict. Retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery emphasized that the current use of Standard Missiles risks compromising the Navy’s preparedness for Pacific operations, underscoring the strategic impact of prolonged Middle Eastern engagements.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/pentagon-faces-shortage-of-air-defense-missiles-amid-rising-demand	2024-10-29T07:07:52-07:00	
France's Navy enters Taiwan Strait Following US and Canadian Warships	According to information published by Yahoo on October 29, 2024, following the United States and Canada, France has now sent a warship through the Taiwan Strait amid heightened cross-strait tensions. This move by France comes shortly after China’s recent military exercises in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French Navy's Floreal class frigate during exercise with Japanese Mogami-class frigate JS Noshiro. (Picture source: JMSDF) On October 20, the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Higgins and the Royal Canadian Navy’s Halifax-class frigate HMCS Vancouver passed through the strait. According to The Mirror Media, the French Navy’s Floréal-class frigate Prairial (F731) sailed through the strait, moving from south to north. This transit aligns with the vessel’s recent regional activity, following its goodwill visit to Cebu from October 22 to 25. French military presence within the first island chain is quite frequent. Earlier this year, between April and May, the French Navy’s frigate Vendémiaire (F734) and Bretagne (D655) also conducted visits to the Philippines. Recent typhoon activity, including Typhoon Typhoon Saola and Typhoon Kanun, likely influenced Prairial’s timing to ensure safe and controlled navigation. France’s approach differs from the United States, as the French Navy typically refrains from issuing overt political statements during such transits. While the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) often dispatches ships to shadow foreign vessels in the region, it generally refrains from public commentary unless prompted by any perceived provocations. French Navy France’s stance on Taiwan and China is centered on maintaining freedom of navigation and supporting a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific, emphasizing non-confrontational yet assertive actions. As the only EU country with territories in the Indo-Pacific, France considers itself an Indo-Pacific power with obligations to uphold international laws in areas like the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. This commitment is driven by concerns over China's aggressive actions, such as military drills and territorial claims that disregard international rulings. In practice, the French Navy has regularly conducted freedom of navigation operations, sending vessels like the destroyer Lorraine to the South China Sea and the frigate Prairial through the Taiwan Strait. These moves are positioned as stabilizing efforts rather than provocations. French lawmakers have openly criticized China's actions, noting that Beijing's moves threaten not only regional stability but also global trade security, reinforcing France's resolve to maintain peace and security in the strait through strategic partnerships and multilateral dialogues​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/frances-navy-enters-taiwan-strait-following-us-and-canadian-warships	2024-10-29T06:51:08-07:00

Germany to Develop Next-Gen Taurus Neo Cruise Missile after Ukraine War Lessons	On October 27, 2024, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced an ambitious project to develop an advanced version of the Taurus cruise missile. This project, which involves acquiring 600 units of the new model called the Taurus Neo, comes as Ukraine increasingly calls on Berlin to provide long-range weapons to counter Russian attacks on its territory. The decision to develop the Taurus Neo marks a significant step in modernizing Germany's military capabilities and strengthening its strategic position in a tense geopolitical context. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link MBDA Taurus EX Air-Launched Cruise Missile (Picture source: Army Recognition) The Taurus Neo project aims to enhance the capabilities of the existing Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile. According to parliamentary sources, the planned developments will include increased range, improved accuracy, and enhanced explosive power. The project's total cost is estimated at approximately €2.1 billion for acquiring 600 missiles, with initial deliveries expected from 2029. To launch the development, an initial funding of €350 million is required starting in 2025, while most of the budget will be allocated after 2029. The technical improvements of the Taurus Neo are expected to include a range exceeding 500 km, enabling it to reach more distant targets with greater accuracy. The guidance system will be modernized, integrating advanced inertial navigation and GPS correction technologies to improve precision on hard-to-reach targets. The missile is also expected to be equipped with a more powerful warhead, designed to penetrate heavily reinforced structures, such as bunkers or underground shelters. Additionally, the Taurus Neo may incorporate technologies to bypass missile defense systems, thus enhancing its ability to evade radars and penetrate enemy air defenses. The decision to launch the Taurus Neo project comes in a context where the war in Ukraine has heightened security concerns in Europe. Since the beginning of the conflict, Russia has intensified its use of cruise missiles to target strategic and civilian infrastructure, underscoring Ukraine's need for similar retaliatory capabilities. In response, the United Kingdom and France have already provided Kyiv with long-range cruise missiles, such as the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG, which Ukrainian forces have adapted for use on Soviet-made aircraft. These missiles, equipped with sophisticated guidance systems combining GPS, inertial navigation, and infrared imaging (IIR), are mainly used to strike heavily defended targets like ammunition depots, command centers, and logistical hubs behind Russian lines. The Taurus KEPD 350, with its 500 km range and enhanced penetration capabilities, would offer Ukraine additional capabilities to target critical infrastructure and strategic points in Russia, particularly in Crimea. Unlike the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG missiles, the Taurus is equipped with a dual-stage warhead specifically designed to destroy heavily fortified and deeply buried targets. Currently, the German armed forces have about 600 Taurus KEPD 350 missiles, primarily used from Tornado fighters. Although the missile has also been tested on the Eurofighter EF2000, it is not yet used as a standard launch platform for the Taurus. The upcoming retirement of the Tornado raises questions about the launch platform for the Taurus Neo. The Eurofighter appears to be the most likely option, while integration on the F-35A, recently ordered by Germany, seems unlikely without a complete redesign of the missile to fit the internal bay of the American stealth fighter. In the longer term, Germany could consider integrating the Taurus Neo within the framework of the SCAF (Future Combat Air System) program, a next-generation fighter project developed in collaboration with France, Spain, and Belgium. The SCAF is expected to play a central role in modernizing European air capabilities in the coming decades. The development of the Taurus Neo could have considerable implications for European defense. As a long-range precision weapon, this missile could strengthen Germany's deterrence capabilities while offering additional strategic options for the continent's collective defense. The modernization of the German armed forces is part of a broader effort to respond to new security threats exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and rising tensions with Russia. However, funding for the Taurus Neo project remains a major challenge for the German government. The 2025 budget will need to include the €350 million necessary to launch the development, and expenses in subsequent years could be affected by current budget constraints. Nonetheless, the support expressed by the government coalition suggests a favorable outcome for the project, despite potential debates in Parliament on the appropriateness of prioritizing such expenditures in a challenging economic context. The announcement of the Taurus Neo project comes just two days after the signing of a historic defense agreement between Germany and the United Kingdom aimed at rapidly developing new, more advanced long-range strike weapons than the Storm Shadow. This agreement was followed by the announcement of the UK's membership in the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA), an initiative led by France and involving Germany, Poland, and Italy. ELSA aims to develop a missile with a range between 1,000 and 2,000 km by the 2030s. Although the integration of the Taurus Neo into these programs remains uncertain, the growing interest in long-range strike weapons in Europe reflects an increasing awareness of the need to strengthen deterrence and defense capabilities in the face of emerging threats. The Taurus Neo project could therefore fit into a broader dynamic aimed at bolstering collective security on the European continent while positioning Germany as a key player in the development of new defense technologies. The development of advanced cruise missiles, such as the Taurus KEPD 350, represents a critical strategic asset for Western armed forces, particularly in the context of modern conflicts where precision and long-range strike capabilities are crucial. For Ukraine, the use of missiles provided by its allies, such as the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG, has demonstrated the effectiveness of these weapons in striking deep behind enemy lines at strategic targets. These missiles allow for the neutralization of critical military infrastructure, such as ammunition depots, command centers, and logistical nodes, thereby disrupting adversary operations and weakening their support capabilities for frontline forces. The Taurus, with its extended 500 km range and reinforced penetration capability, would offer Ukraine increased ability to target strategic sites in Crimea or Russia, expanding the range and impact of Ukrainian operations.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/germany-to-develop-next-gen-taurus-neo-cruise-missile-after-ukraine-war-lessons	2024-10-29T04:15:55-07:00

Key improvements to the T-72B3M include an upgraded fire control system, a 1,130 hp V-92S2F engine, and advanced sighting equipment. However, the inclusion of the Arena-M APS marks a particularly notable enhancement, aimed at safeguarding the tank and its crew against an array of anti-tank threats. The Arena-M is a Russian-designed active protection system created to intercept and destroy incoming projectiles, such as anti-tank missiles and rockets, before they reach the tank. The system uses a radar array to detect and track incoming threats within a certain radius around the vehicle. Once a threat is detected, Arena-M calculates its trajectory, allowing the system to deploy countermeasures that neutralize the projectile at a safe distance. The APS is specifically designed to handle threats from multiple directions, enhancing protection against high-speed projectiles fired from modern anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) or rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). This added layer of defense significantly reduces the likelihood of armor penetration, thus improving the survivability of the T-72B3M on the battlefield. Russia’s choice to integrate the Arena-M system into the T-72B3M rather than reserving it exclusively for newer tanks like the T-90M and T-14 Armata underscores the continued relevance of the T-72 in modern warfare. With over 25,000 units produced since its inception in the 1970s, the T-72 has seen widespread deployment across various theaters and remains in service with numerous militaries worldwide.

The addition of the Arena-M APS, with its ability to repel contemporary anti-tank weaponry, ensures that the T-72B3M remains relevant in scenarios that demand both maneuverability and resilience. Russia’s decision to install the Arena-M system on its main battle tanks reflects a growing trend within the global military community toward equipping armored vehicles with active protection systems. As anti-tank weapon technology advances, the need for countermeasures has become increasingly critical. Arena-M’s effectiveness and the expanded protection it provides offer a glimpse into future armored warfare, where active defenses could be as crucial as the armor itself. While the current configuration of the T-72B3M with the Arena-M APS offers substantial protection, experts speculate that future variants could incorporate additional features, including modular reactive armor and more advanced electronic warfare countermeasures. Such enhancements would further augment the tank’s ability to operate in contested environments where electronic and cyber warfare elements are increasingly prevalent.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/russia-equips-t-72b3m-tanks-with-advanced-arena-m-active-protection-system	2024-10-29T02:49:48-07:00	
Algeria reveals acquisition of Russian Iskander-E ballistic missile system	As reported by ORCA Military on October 28, 2024, the Russian Iskander-E short-range ballistic missile system has been seen for the first time in Algeria, ahead of the military parade commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Algerian Revolution. This sighting confirms Algeria’s acquisition of the Iskander after years of speculation and marks the first time this missile system has appeared in the arsenal of an Arab country.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Algeria received four regiments of the Iskander-E between 2014 and 2017, comprising around 50 vehicles and 48 missiles per regiment, including 12 launchers, 12 transporter-loaders, 11 command vehicles, and various support vehicles. (Picture source: FChillali) The Iskander system, developed by Russia, has a range of up to 500 kilometers and can reach speeds of up to Mach 6. It is designed to strike targets such as command centers, air defense systems, and critical infrastructure. The system's mobile design and rapid-launch capability make it difficult to detect or intercept. The Iskander-E variant, in service with Algeria since 2018, is capable of carrying various types of non-nuclear warheads, including high-explosive fragmentation and penetrating warheads. This acquisition enhances Algeria's missile capabilities, adding significant range and versatility to its existing military equipment. Algeria's acquisition of the Iskander system is part of broader efforts to modernize its military forces, especially amid increasing tensions with Morocco. Diplomatic relations between Algeria and Morocco have been strained since Algeria cut ties in 2021, citing Morocco’s support for separatist movements in Kabylie and its backing of Western Sahara claims. Morocco, meanwhile, has received international backing for its autonomy plan for Western Sahara, further intensifying the rivalry. Both countries have engaged in an arms race, boosting their military capabilities while maintaining a tense but non-violent standoff. The militarization on both sides continues, although a full-scale conflict remains unlikely. In this context, the Iskander system plays a significant role in Algeria's military planning, particularly due to its capacity to target strategic locations in Morocco. The system’s longer range, compared to Morocco’s M142 HIMARS system, allows it to reach targets such as command centers and air defenses. Morocco's HIMARS system, which has a range of up to 300 kilometers using ATACMS missiles, is designed for rapid fire support and precision strikes on fortified positions and troop concentrations. While the HIMARS offers greater battlefield mobility, the Iskander system’s longer range and hypersonic capabilities provide Algeria with a broader set of strategic options. Algeria's defense budget has grown significantly in recent years, reaching $18.3 billion in 2023, largely due to increased revenues from gas exports following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This funding has supported the procurement of military equipment, primarily from Russia and China, including the Iskander system. The growing military rivalry with Morocco has also been reflected in Algerian domestic politics, where anti-Moroccan rhetoric is frequently used in election campaigns to gain popular support. Despite occasional calls for dialogue, tensions between Algeria and Morocco remain high, and the ongoing arms buildup indicates that a resolution is unlikely in the near future. The Iskander system’s appearance in the upcoming military parade further signals Algeria’s intent to maintain and demonstrate its military capabilities in response to regional security concerns. As both countries continue to acquire advanced military technology, the potential for future conflict, while not imminent, remains a significant issue.

A complete SAMP/T battery is estimated at around $500 million, compared to roughly $1 billion for a Patriot battery. In return for this investment, Belgium aims to secure 'fair return' industrial compensations, which could also extend to other ongoing programs in the land domain. MBDA, with its experience in missile system development and a key role in Europe's defense architecture, is well-positioned to meet Belgium's needs. The company has already demonstrated its commitment to addressing European missile defense challenges through projects like TWISTER, a multi-role interceptor initiative designed to counter threats ranging from maneuvering ballistic missiles to hypersonic gliders. Supported by the European Defense Fund, this project aligns with efforts to strengthen Europe's strategic autonomy and address current capability gaps. Belgium is also preparing to finalize an agreement with France for FN Herstal to supply small-caliber ammunition to the French armed forces, in collaboration with a French-based industrial partner. Additionally, FN Herstal will begin producing its ultra-light Evolys machine gun for the French Land Army next year, with deliveries scheduled for late 2025. Regarding the Camo program, Belgium's counterpart to France's Scorpion program, the first Griffon vehicles are expected in 2025, followed by the Jaguar in 2026 and Caesar in 2027. In the naval sector, an agreement is being prepared between the Belgian and French Ministries of Defense on the specifications of mine-hunting vessels, jointly designed with Paris and The Hague, and produced by Naval Group. Belgium's decision to engage with MBDA comes amid heightened security concerns in Europe, prompting national military capability enhancements and increased collaboration among EU member states. By opting for the SAMP/T, Brussels joins a group of European countries already using the system, including France and Italy, which will facilitate system integration and resource sharing across the continent. Since January 2016, Belgium has shown a growing interest in acquiring ballistic missile defense capabilities, a priority highlighted by Defense Minister Steven Vandeput. This objective is part of the 2030 strategic plan to modernize the Belgian armed forces and contribute to NATO's Ballistic Missile Defense initiative, launched in 2010. In February 2016, Vandeput discussed with the defense committee the opportunity to equip the Land Component with a BMD system, considering two options: a radar system costing 50 million euros or a full missile battery, dubbed 'full Monty,' costing 600 million euros. At the time, potential systems included the American Patriot, Eurosam's SAMP/T, and Lockheed Martin's MEADS. Currently, Belgium mainly relies on the Mistral short-range air defense system, used to protect airbases and other sensitive sites. This infrared-guided missile system is designed to counter low-altitude threats such as helicopters and slow-moving aircraft. In addition, the Belgian armed forces employ anti-aircraft guns, though these aging systems no longer meet modern air defense standards against threats like ballistic missiles or drones. The lack of medium- or long-range surface-to-air defense systems underscores Belgium's interest in acquiring MBDA's SAMP/T to modernize and strengthen its air defense capabilities.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-belgium-set-to-choose-mbdas-samp-t-over-u-s-patriot-for-its-air-defense	2024-10-28T06:36:03-07:00

Northrop Grumman Announces Massive Expansion in B-21 Raider Stealth Bomber Production to Counter China	On October 24, 2024, Northrop Grumman announced that the U.S. Air Force is currently evaluating the possibility of expanding its fleet of B-21 Raider bombers to strengthen its capabilities in response to challenges posed by China. This initiative is part of a broader review of the Air Force's force structure, which could also impact the Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter program.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider Stealth Bomber was unveiled to the public at a ceremony Dec. 2, 2022 in Palmdale, California (Picture source: US DoD) The B-21 Raider Bomber provides the U.S. Armed Forces with a crucial capability for long-range stealth bombing, allowing it to penetrate advanced enemy air defenses and deliver both conventional and nuclear payloads. Its advanced design improves strategic deterrence and enables the U.S. to project power globally, meeting modern operational requirements in contested environments. With rising threats from peer adversaries such as Russia and China, a larger B-21 fleet would enhance the Air Force's ability to respond quickly and effectively across multiple regions, addressing the need for versatile and survivable strike capabilities. Expanding the B-21 fleet is considered a cost-effective way to enhance U.S. defense posture, particularly as older bombers like the B-1 and B-2 near retirement. Acquiring more B-21s would not only modernize the bomber force but also provide a dual benefit by supporting both conventional missions and nuclear deterrence. As a platform already in production, scaling up B-21 procurement could swiftly improve U.S. military readiness without the delays associated with developing new systems like the NGAD fighter. Russia and China are developing their own long-range stealth bombers to rival the U.S. B-21. Russia is working on the PAK DA, a stealth bomber designed to replace its older fleet, featuring advanced radar-evading capabilities and long-range strike potential. Meanwhile, China is developing the H-20 stealth bomber, which aims to extend China's strategic reach and conduct missions deep into enemy territory. Both aircraft are intended to challenge U.S. air superiority and enhance their respective nations' strike capabilities. The B-21 Raider stands out due to its cutting-edge stealth technology, advanced materials, and digital design, which enhance its ability to evade radar detection more effectively than older bombers. Its modular architecture allows for future upgrades, making it adaptable to changing threats. Moreover, the B-21 is built with versatility in mind, supporting both conventional and nuclear missions, giving the U.S. a significant advantage in strategic deterrence and long-range precision strike capabilities. The B-21 Raider could be deployed in a strategic strike mission aimed at neutralizing heavily defended adversary military installations, such as missile launch sites or command centers deep within enemy territory. With its advanced stealth capabilities, the B-21 could penetrate sophisticated air defenses undetected, deliver precise strikes with conventional or nuclear munitions, and exit the area safely. For example, in a crisis scenario with an adversary possessing advanced anti-aircraft systems, the B-21 could be used to destroy radars or surface-to-air missile batteries, paving the way for other air forces to conduct offensive operations. In addition to its strategic strike capabilities, the B-21 Raider is designed to perform a wide range of conventional missions, such as supporting military operations in conflict zones, conducting air interdiction, and carrying out precision strikes on mobile targets. For instance, during an air campaign against an enemy force, the B-21 could be used to attack defensive positions, ammunition depots, or military convoys, thereby disrupting the adversary's logistical and operational capabilities. Its stealth allows it to penetrate deep into enemy territory and operate in contested environments, reducing the risk for pilots while maximizing the effectiveness of its strikes. Additionally, the B-21's flexibility enables it to be quickly reconfigured to accommodate various types of conventional missions, adapting its weaponry and sensors to specific field requirements. Warden revealed during an earnings call on October 24, 2024, that the Air Force is conducting a comprehensive review of its force structure, including the B-21 fleet. This review is part of a congressionally mandated effort to reassess the service's future capabilities and requirements. It also coincides with the Air Force's efforts to complete the NGAD program's requirements analysis, following a pause ordered by Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall earlier this year. The NGAD program, aimed at developing a sixth-generation fighter to replace the F-22 Raptor, was paused before a decision was made between two competing designs. Kendall cited concerns over the program's cost, with initial estimates suggesting that each aircraft could cost several hundred million dollars. He has since indicated a preference for reducing the per-unit cost to a range closer to that of the F-35 fighter, between $80 million and $100 million. The cost difference, if achieved, could translate into savings of tens of billions of dollars across a planned fleet of 200 to 250 NGAD fighters. While the official stance of the Air Force has maintained that a fleet of 100 B-21 Raiders would meet current operational needs, there are growing voices within the defense community advocating for a larger fleet. The B-21 is designed to replace the aging B-2 Spirit and B-1 Lancer bombers, providing the U.S. military with a long-range stealth bomber capable of penetrating advanced air defenses. The platform is a cornerstone of the Air Force's future strategic deterrence and conventional strike capabilities. Northrop Grumman, the B-21's prime contractor, has stated that it is ready to increase production if the Air Force decides to expand the fleet. According to Warden, the decision on fleet size will likely become clearer in the coming months as the force structure review progresses. She emphasized that the performance and cost targets achieved during the B-21's initial production phase could influence the Air Force's decision. The cost of the B-21 has been a central issue in these discussions. The bomber's original unit cost was contractually set at $550 million in 2010, equivalent to approximately $780 million today. Despite this, Kendall informed Congress in April that B-21 production costs had remained below projections during low-rate initial production. However, the cost ceiling is expected to rise as production ramps up in later batches. Several senior officials and defense analysts have argued for increasing the B-21 fleet beyond the initial 100 units. Retired Colonel Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, has been outspoken about the need to increase the Air Force's bomber capacity to address emerging threats. He points out that the current bomber force is too small to meet the demands of a rapidly changing strategic environment, especially in deterring and potentially responding to simultaneous threats from peer adversaries like Russia and China. Gunzinger believes that the B-21 is particularly well-positioned to strengthen both conventional and nuclear deterrence due to its stealth capabilities, long range, and substantial payload capacity. He asserts that acquiring more B-21s at an accelerated pace would be the most cost-effective approach to strengthening the United States' power projection capabilities and operating in contested environments. Expanding the bomber fleet would provide a dual benefit by bolstering both conventional defense and strategic deterrence. Air Force General Anthony J. Cotton, head of U.S. Strategic Command, has also expressed support for increasing the number of B-21 bombers, emphasizing their importance in maintaining a credible deterrent posture. His views are echoed by other analysts, such as Christopher Bowie, who have suggested that 100 aircraft may not be sufficient for the U.S. to achieve its strategic goals, given that even the most advanced bomber can only be in one place at a time. One of the central questions in the ongoing review is whether potential savings from reducing the NGAD program could be redirected to fund additional B-21 bombers. The Air Force is attempting to balance the competing demands of modernizing its aging fleet while adhering to budget constraints. However, some experts, including Gunzinger, caution against viewing the NGAD and B-21 programs as interchangeable. This pause has opened the door for the B-21 to play a more significant role in the Air Force's future force structure. Northrop Grumman's willingness to increase production adds to the service's strategic flexibility as it navigates the challenges of modernizing its fleet under fiscal constraints. Warden indicated that the Air Force is expected to award a second low-rate initial production (LRIP) contract for the B-21 before the end of the year. The first LRIP contract was awarded following the bomber's first flight last year, although specifics regarding the number of aircraft covered under the agreement have not been disclosed. The outcome of the current force structure review and ongoing budget negotiations will likely influence future production rates and fleet size decisions. As the Air Force continues to assess its options, the B-21 remains a key element in the broader strategy to enhance U.S. airpower capabilities. Whether the service will ultimately expand its fleet of stealth bombers will depend on a variety of factors, including cost considerations, technological developments, and the evolving threat landscape. In the meantime, Northrop Grumman is positioning itself to respond quickly to increased demand, offering the U.S. government flexibility in shaping the future of its bomber force. The reconsideration of the B-21 fleet size underscores the dynamic nature of the U.S. Air Force's modernization strategy, driven by both strategic needs and budgetary realities. With the ongoing review of the NGAD program and discussions about expanding the bomber fleet, the Air Force is at a critical juncture. The decisions made in the coming months will shape the future of American airpower and its ability to deter adversaries and project power worldwide.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/northrop-grumman-announces-massive-expansion-in-b-21-raider-stealth-bomber-production-to-counter-china	2024-10-28T05:56:13-07:00

Taiwan Unveils Torpedo Launch Tube of Huilong Unmanned Underwater Vehicle	According to information published by TaiwanPlus on October 26, 2024, Taiwan revealed the torpedo launch tube of its domestically developed 'Huilong' unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan reveals its 'Huilong' unmanned underwater vehicle, equipped with dual torpedo launch tubes and surveillance capabilities. (Picture source: TaiwanPlus) Earlier, images of the propeller at the vehicle’s rear were also released. However, Taiwan's Defense Minister recently clarified over a lunch with the media that the Huilong platform is primarily intended for testing purposes, specifically for sonar and underwater mine systems, and does not feature an active propulsion system. Consequently, during sea trials, it is towed by support vessels rather than operating independently. The 'Huilong' project is a joint effort between Taiwan’s National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology and Lung Teh Shipbuilding. The development officially commenced in 2020 under the 'Huilong Project,' aiming to establish a versatile, unmanned underwater test platform. According to reports, the vehicle displaces nearly 100 tons and has dimensions measuring approximately 30 meters in length, 3.6 meters in width, and 6 meters in height, including its command tower casing. This UUV resembles a compact submarine and is equipped with dual torpedo tubes. Notably, it is also reportedly designed to deploy small unmanned vehicles, potentially enhancing its capabilities in surveillance, target acquisition, and strike operations against enemy assets. One of the Huilong UUV’s primary roles could be to extend Taiwan’s underwater monitoring capabilities. Equipped with sophisticated sonar, the UUV can detect and track adversary submarines and other vessels operating in the waters around Taiwan. This would be particularly advantageous in tracking potential incursions by Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) submarines, enabling early detection and providing intelligence on the movements of hostile forces. Given the importance of information superiority in modern conflicts, the Huilong’s ability to conduct real-time, covert reconnaissance could significantly enhance Taiwan’s situational awareness. Taiwan’s fleet of submarines is relatively small and would be vulnerable in the event of a conflict. However, integrating UUVs like the Huilong could serve as a force multiplier. Deployed alongside or in support of manned submarines, these UUVs could take on high-risk reconnaissance or even offensive roles, allowing manned vessels to operate with less exposure to detection or attack. In any conflict scenario with a larger naval power like China, Taiwan’s strategy would likely rely on asymmetric tactics. UUVs offer a cost-effective means to deploy a range of weapons or carry out sabotage missions against high-value enemy assets, like aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwan-unveils-torpedo-launch-tube-of-huilong-unmanned-underwater-vehicle	2024-10-28T04:51:34-07:00

Thermite is used primarily to destroy equipment, fortifications, or infrastructure due to its ability to generate extremely high temperatures, melt metal, and start fires. The first publicized reports of thermite being used in Ukraine emerged in 2014, during the initial stages of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, when Russian-backed separatists were accused of using incendiary munitions, including thermite-based weapons, to target Ukrainian military positions. Recently, there have been renewed reports of thermite weapons being used in the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, particularly in the context of intense battles in eastern Ukraine. These reports suggest that both sides may be employing incendiary munitions, including thermite-based weapons, to destroy military equipment, fortifications, and infrastructure. In late 2022 and throughout 2023, videos and eyewitness accounts surfaced showing the use of incendiary shells, which may contain thermite, in areas like Bakhmut and Mariupol, where fierce urban fighting took place. Sky Dragon uses commercially available multi-rotor drones, such as quadcopters or octocopters, to carry bundles of thermite grenades and drop them over enemy positions. Thermite, a pyrotechnic composition of metal powder and metal oxides, burns at extremely high temperatures when ignited, making it ideal for destroying military equipment, bunkers, and fortifications. The drones deliver these thermite devices in a precise and targeted manner, allowing Ukrainian forces to strike deep within Russian-controlled zones, including fortified positions concealed under tree canopies and within dug-in trenches. The Sky Dragon system operates through a combination of advanced drone technology and destructive incendiary devices. It uses multi-rotor drones, such as quadcopters or octocopters, which are capable of carrying heavy payloads and modified for military use. These drones fly over Russian positions, allowing for the precise delivery of their incendiary payloads. The core of the system consists of bundled thermite grenades strapped together with metal bands. These grenades are equipped with a Nonel instantaneous fuse system, commonly used in demolition, ensuring that all grenades ignite simultaneously once they reach the target. This synchronization maximizes the thermite's destructive power. To protect the drone from the extreme heat generated by the thermite, a heat shield is employed along with a tow line that holds the grenades at a safe distance during flight. Once released, the grenades ignite mid-air, raining down molten thermite on the target, making it nearly impossible for enemy infantry or equipment to withstand the intense heat, which can exceed 2,000°C. Sky Dragon is proving to be highly effective against entrenched Russian positions, especially in forested areas. Traditional artillery and mortar systems struggle to penetrate tree lines where Russian forces are often dug in. However, drones can navigate these complex environments, hovering over specific positions and deploying incendiary grenades with pinpoint accuracy. When ignited, thermite creates temperatures exceeding 2,000°C (3,600°F), capable of burning through metal and concrete, making it particularly useful for destroying ammunition depots, bunkers, armored vehicles, and other critical military infrastructure.

(Picture source X account Chuck Pfarrer ) Additionally, the drones are difficult to detect and intercept due to their small size and low altitude. This makes them ideal tools for engaging targets in areas where Russian air defense systems are concentrated, as drones can maneuver around obstacles and deliver their payloads without risking large aircraft or manned vehicles. The introduction of Sky Dragon highlights Ukraine's ability to adapt to the realities of modern warfare, leveraging low-cost commercial drones in innovative ways to inflict significant damage on Russian forces. The use of incendiary devices like thermite further underscores Ukraine's intent to target key Russian positions where traditional weapons might fail or struggle to reach. As the conflict drags on, the emergence of these new tactics could force Russian troops to adapt their defensive strategies, potentially making their positions more vulnerable to other forms of attack. Sky Dragon adds yet another dimension to the drone warfare that has come to define much of the conflict, where both sides increasingly rely on unmanned systems to deliver destructive payloads with minimal risk to personnel. Sky Dragon represents a significant development in Ukraine's drone warfare capabilities, offering a cost-effective and highly destructive solution to the challenge of entrenched Russian forces. As the war continues, innovations like Sky Dragon will likely play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics on the battlefield, demonstrating how modern technology and creative problem-solving can shift the balance of power in asymmetrical warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-discover-ukraines-sky-dragon-devastating-drone-deployed-incendiary-thermite-weapon-against-russia	2024-10-28T03:41:16-07:00

Indonesia Navy Expels Chinese Coast Guard Ship from North Natuna Sea	According to information published by the Indonesian government on October 25, 2024, Indonesia’s Maritime Security Agency, Bakamla RI, successfully detected and expelled a Chinese Coast Guard vessel, CCG 5402, from the North Natuna Sea. This vessel had been interfering with seismic survey activities led by PT Pertamina East Natuna, a state-owned oil and gas company, which was conducting 3D seismic data processing using the survey vessel MV Geo Coral.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Indonesian Coast Guard Tanjung Datu-class patrol vessel KN Tanjung Datu, the Chinese Coast Guard OPV 5402 and the Indonesian Navy Kapitan Patimura-class corvette. (Picture source: Indonesian government) The incident unfolded when Bakamla RI’s Command and Control Center (Puskodal) received intelligence that CCG 5402 was obstructing MV Geo Coral’s survey, which was being escorted by three chase vessels—UB Anugerah Bersama 17, AHT PSB Roller, and TB Teluk Bajau Victory. These activities were taking place within the operational area of PT Pertamina East Natuna, which is situated on Indonesia's continental shelf in the North Natuna Sea. Following this alert, Bakamla dispatched the Indonesian State Vessel (KN) Tanjung Datu-301 to the location. Upon arrival, KN Tanjung Datu-301 detected the Chinese vessel CCG 5402 at 5:30 a.m. WIB, positioned at a 125° bearing and approximately 7.3 nautical miles away. Despite efforts to establish communication via radio, CCG 5402 asserted that the area fell under Chinese jurisdiction, a claim that Indonesia firmly disputes. Shortly after, at around 5:38 a.m., Bakamla RI received reinforcement from the Indonesian Navy’s (TNI AL) patrol vessel KRI Sutedi Senaputera 378 and a maritime patrol aircraft. Together, these Indonesian patrol forces shadowed the Chinese vessel, ultimately succeeding in expelling CCG 5402 from Indonesia’s jurisdictional waters in the North Natuna Sea. China’s Foreign Ministry responded to the situation in a routine press conference on Thursday, stating that Chinese coast guard vessels were patrolling 'waters under China’s jurisdiction' according to both international and domestic laws. The ministry expressed its willingness to negotiate with Indonesia to resolve maritime issues between the two countries. Although Indonesia is not involved in sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea, China’s 'Nine-Dash Line' claim overlaps with Indonesia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around the Natuna Islands. Chinese coast guard vessels have entered Indonesia’s Natuna Sea in recent years. However, it is noteworthy that these two recent incidents occurred within a week of Prabowo taking office. China has consistently expressed interest in collaborating with Indonesia to develop the North Natuna Sea, so these actions may be a way to test the new administration’s stance on potential cooperation. The Chinese coast guard entered Indonesia’s EEZ in the Natuna Sea immediately after Prabowo’s inauguration and his meeting with China’s Vice President Han Zheng, which could be seen as an unwelcome 'gift' for Prabowo.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/indonesia-navy-expels-chinese-coast-guard-ship-from-north-natuna-sea	2024-10-28T03:33:22-07:00

The two-year extension will see Raytheon continue to provide operations and maintenance support for the Sea-based X-band Radar and 13 Army-Navy Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control Model 2 (AN/TPY-2) radar systems. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Raytheon secures a $900 million contract extension with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency to support and sustain advanced radar systems. (Picture source: Dvids) The Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX-1) remains a cornerstone of the U.S. ballistic missile defense strategy due to its unprecedented ability to detect and assess threats from vast distances, making it a powerful mobile asset for tracking and intercepting missile threats. Positioned on a self-propelled, semi-submersible oil platform, this radar provides coverage that can be quickly adapted to varying geopolitical hotspots across the Pacific, a region where missile threats from countries like North Korea, China, and Russia are a growing concern​. The SBX-1’s high-precision X-band radar, encased within a massive radome, has approximately 45,000 transmit/receive modules, allowing it to detect and discriminate between missiles, decoys, and debris. It can track objects as small as a baseball from up to 2,500 miles away, feeding critical data back to ground-based interceptors for midcourse corrections. This data transmission occurs through the In-Flight Interceptor Communications System Data Terminal onboard, which enables real-time adjustments for interceptors and heightens the radar’s utility in ballistic missile defense​. Operational since 2006, SBX-1 has been deployed extensively in the Pacific, often supporting defense readiness against North Korean missile tests and other emergent threats. However, recent deployments have highlighted both its strengths and limitations. While it offers exceptional tracking precision, its relatively narrow field of view poses challenges when responding to complex scenarios involving multiple missiles or advanced countermeasures such as decoys. In response, the SBX-1 has undergone upgrades and maintenance in Hawaii, addressing structural issues from its extensive 662-day deployment and enhancing its ability to support intercepts under higher demand from the U.S. Space Command and Space Force​.

These advantages remain critical as missile defense analysts underscore the necessity of monitoring emerging hypersonic threats, which can travel at extreme speeds and low altitudes, evading traditional missile defense systems​. Looking ahead, discussions around the SBX's future are ongoing, with considerations about whether additional units or complementary systems are required. Space-based sensors are also under evaluation as potential support for a more diversified missile defense network.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/raytheon-awarded-contract-to-maintain-us-navy-sea-based-x-band-radar	2024-10-28T02:52:00-07:00	
US Army’s Future XM30 Combat Vehicle to Redefine IFV with a 50mm Cannon and AI Technologies	According to Nicholas Drummond on October 27, 2024, the US Army’s future XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle is set to redefine the infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) category when it enters service in 2027, replacing the aging M2 Bradley. The US Army has awarded General Dynamics and Rheinmetall $800 million each to develop prototypes for this vehicle as part of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program. The total value of the program is estimated at $45 billion, with the Army planning to purchase approximately 3,800 units. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The XM30 program is a continuation of the US Army’s efforts to replace the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, which has been in service since the 1980s. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The XM30 is expected to bring significant changes to the infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) category, featuring a 50x228 mm cannon in a remote-controlled turret, twin Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs), an AI-enabled fire control system, and a hybrid drivetrain. The XM30 will have a crew of two (a driver and a commander) and will carry six infantry personnel. The vehicle’s size and capacity have been designed to maintain a balance between firepower and mobility while preventing it from becoming too large or heavy, as seen with some past IFV designs. It will be designed to work alongside future versions of the M1 Abrams and is expected to include protection against Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Digital engineering has been central to the development of the XM30. In the early phases of the program, five contractors were given approximately $60 million each to create digital designs based on draft requirements from the Army. Through this process that facilitated its design, development, and potential future upgrades, the US Army refined the vehicle's requirements and ensured they were achievable, avoiding issues that led to the cancellation of earlier programs. For instance, by using 3D models and simulations early in the design phase, the Army ensures that all requirements and subsystems, including sensors and fire control mechanisms, are aligned before physical prototypes are constructed. This approach minimizes development costs and helps contractors and the Army quickly address any design issues that arise during the process. The modular design of the XM30 supports future technological updates, enabling the integration of new systems with minimal changes to the vehicle's core architecture. Equipped with a hybrid-electric drivetrain and a variety of weapon systems, including a 50mm cannon and anti-tank guided missiles, the XM30 is configured to meet current operational requirements while maintaining flexibility for future needs. The vehicle's reduced crew size and its capacity to transport infantry are aimed at improving operational efficiency without increasing size or complexity. The XM30 program is a continuation of the US Army’s efforts to replace the M2 Bradley, which has been in service since the 1980s. Despite several earlier attempts, including the Ground Combat Vehicle and Future Combat System programs, previous initiatives were not successful, often due to issues with aligning requirements, funding, technology, and schedule. Colonel Jeffery Jurand, the project manager for the XM30, has emphasized that the current program is aligned in these areas, supported by the use of digital engineering. This approach allows for the design and testing of the vehicle through digital models, avoiding some of the challenges faced by earlier programs. Both General Dynamics and Rheinmetall were selected to move forward in the competition, with the Army currently in phase three of a five-phase schedule. These contractors will deliver prototypes by late 2026, with the Army conducting critical design reviews by the first half of fiscal year 2025. The final selection of a single vendor for production will take place around the first quarter of fiscal year 2028, after testing and evaluation of the prototypes. The program is also supported by the 'digital trinity' approach, which includes models-based systems engineering, digital engineering, and development, security, and operations (DevSecOps). This digital approach has allowed for improved traceability and communication between contractors and the Army, with errors being identified and addressed earlier in the design process. The open architecture of the XM30 design has been highlighted as a way to accommodate future upgrades and reduce costs. The XM30 is one of six pathfinder programs identified by the Army to demonstrate the benefits of digital engineering. The Army's use of digital engineering for this project is intended to improve design efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure the vehicle's modularity and adaptability for future needs. The program has drawn confidence from senior Army leaders, who have expressed support for its goals and its potential to provide long-term benefits, including cost savings through its open architecture.

This observation highlights the growing capabilities of China, raising important strategic concerns, particularly in the United States. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The recent increase in DF-26 production is viewed as a response to perceived shifts in U.S. military presence and alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly around Taiwan and the South China Sea (Picture source: Chinese MoD) The DF-26 is an intermediate-range ballistic missile from the Dong Feng family, developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). With a range of 4,000 km, it is the first Chinese missile capable of striking conventional targets, such as U.S. bases in Guam. This solid-fuel, two-stage missile is 14 meters long and weighs 20 tons, capable of carrying a payload between 1,200 and 1,800 kg, including nuclear warheads and various conventional warheads. It is deployed on a mobile Taian HTF5680 launcher, allowing for rapid and discreet deployment. The DF-26’s modular design enables the warheads to be swapped based on mission requirements, with options for both land strikes and moving naval targets, supported by a terminal guidance system. Since its unveiling in 2015, production of the DF-26 has accelerated, with over 250 units produced by 2024. The brigades of the People’s Liberation Army equipped with these missiles benefit from their mobility and precision strike capabilities, targeting a range of assets including military installations and medium-sized ships. Its operational flexibility and extended range make it a key component of China’s anti-access and area denial strategy, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Between 2023 and 2024, satellite images and industry reports indicate that the Beijing-Xinghang facility produced at least 72 new launchers, enough to equip two additional missile brigades. These units would join the seven existing brigades of the People’s Liberation Army, bringing the total number of DF-26 launchers to around 250. However, some experts, notably from the Federation of American Scientists, suggest that China may be inflating the actual number of launchers, potentially creating confusion about the true extent of its capabilities. The DF-26, part of the Dong Feng missile family ('East Wind'), offers enhanced strategic capabilities compared to earlier versions such as the DF-21. Its extended range, combined with improved accuracy through satellite-assisted inertial guidance, makes it a serious threat to high-value targets like military bases, airports, and naval facilities. The potential integration of terminal guidance could also enable the DF-26 to fulfill anti-ship roles, posing a threat to U.S. carrier strike groups operating in the Pacific. The recent increase in DF-26 production is viewed as a response to perceived shifts in U.S. military presence and alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly around Taiwan and the South China Sea. The expansion of China’s missile arsenal could also signal an intention to challenge U.S. access to its strategic bases, which play a crucial role in supporting regional alliances with Japan, South Korea, and other partners. Growing tensions in the region, combined with the DF-26's dual-use (nuclear and conventional) nature, raise concerns about the risk of unintended escalation in a crisis, particularly if a conventional strike is misinterpreted as a nuclear attack. As China strengthens its strategic forces, it continues to expand its nuclear capabilities. U.S. estimates suggest that by 2030, China's nuclear arsenal could exceed 1,000 warheads, primarily in the form of intercontinental missiles. In parallel, efforts are underway to increase the number of long-range missile launchers, including the DF-31 and DF-41, which are capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/satellite-images-reveal-rise-of-chinese-forces-with-59-new-df-26-missile-launchers	2024-10-28T02:23:01-07:00

(Picture source: X Account French Aid to Ukraine) The Su-24 is a Soviet-era, twin-engine, variable-sweep wing bomber aircraft designed for all-weather, low-level penetration strikes. Developed by Sukhoi in the late 1960s and introduced into service in the early 1970s, the Su-24 was intended to provide the Soviet Air Force with a deep strike platform capable of carrying a wide array of conventional and nuclear weapons. It became the backbone of the Soviet Union's tactical bomber fleet, comparable to the U.S. F-111, and saw significant upgrades over the years. Widely exported to allied nations, the Su-24 has remained in service in several countries, including Russia and Ukraine, with modernization efforts extending its operational lifespan and capabilities, even in the post-Soviet era. The adaptation of Ukraine’s Su-24s to deploy the SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missile is a notable achievement, as it allows the Ukrainian Air Force to strike enemy targets with high precision at extended ranges. The Su-24, originally a Soviet-designed, all-weather attack aircraft built for deep penetration missions, has been extensively modified by Ukrainian engineers to fire these advanced Western missiles. The modifications involved updating the avionics, fire control systems, and communication interfaces between the missile and the aircraft, ensuring full compatibility with the SCALP-EG’s guidance and targeting systems. This successful integration marks the first time a non-NATO platform has been adapted to use this sophisticated missile, a testament to Ukraine’s ingenuity in modernizing its Soviet-era fleet with Western technology. The Su-24’s variable-sweep wing design and its ability to operate at low altitudes make it an ideal platform for launching SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles, enabling Ukraine to carry out precision strikes on critical Russian military infrastructure while minimizing the risk of detection. The SCALP-EG, also known as Storm Shadow in the UK, was delivered to Ukraine in mid-2023 as part of a broader package of military aid from France and the United Kingdom. These missiles were provided in response to Ukraine’s urgent requests for advanced weaponry capable of countering Russian long-range artillery and missile attacks. The delivery was a turning point, as it allowed Ukraine to bridge the gap in its long-range strike capabilities, giving it the tools to target Russian positions far beyond the front lines. The SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow is a long-range, air-launched cruise missile designed for precision strikes, offering key advantages in range, accuracy, and stealth. Its extended range, exceeding 250 kilometers (and up to 560 kilometers in some variants), allows Ukrainian forces to hit deep targets within Russian-occupied territories without entering contested airspace. The missile is equipped with a 450 kg BROACH (Bomb Royal Ordnance Augmented Charge) warhead, a two-stage system that first penetrates hardened structures and then detonates inside, maximizing destruction against fortified targets such as bunkers, command centers, and ammunition depots. Guided by a combination of GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain-following radar, the SCALP-EG ensures precise targeting, especially in the final phase of its flight, where it uses infrared sensors to compare the target with pre-loaded images. This ensures high accuracy even in heavily defended areas. Additionally, the missile's low radar cross-section gives it a stealthy profile, making it difficult to detect and intercept by enemy air defenses, which enhances its ability to penetrate contested airspace. Together, these features—long range, significant destructive power, and pinpoint accuracy—make the SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow an effective tool for disrupting enemy operations, particularly by degrading logistical and command structures. This offers Ukraine a crucial strategic advantage in the ongoing conflict. The ability to launch SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles from Su-24 aircraft gives Ukraine a new level of operational flexibility. Prior to this development, Ukraine’s ability to strike at long-range was limited, but the integration of these missiles now allows the Ukrainian Air Force to conduct deep strikes into Russian-held territory without exposing its aircraft to significant risk. With a range of over 250 kilometers, the SCALP-EG can reach critical Russian military installations, ammunition depots, and logistical hubs far behind the front lines. This allows Ukraine to disrupt supply lines, command centers, and infrastructure that are essential for sustaining Russian operations. The Su-24’s ability to deliver these strikes at low altitude, combined with the missile’s stealth characteristics, greatly increases the likelihood of successful missions. Recent reports indicate that Ukrainian forces have already employed the SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow in several operations, targeting Russian logistics centers and ammunition depots with precision. The strikes not only degrade Russia’s operational capabilities but also force Russian forces to divert resources to defend rear-area positions that were previously out of Ukraine’s reach. The integration of SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles into Ukraine’s Su-24 aircraft marks a significant evolution in the nation’s military capabilities. This adaptation has transformed the Su-24 into a formidable long-range strike platform capable of hitting critical Russian targets with precision and stealth. As the conflict continues, Ukraine’s ability to carry out deep strikes against key Russian military assets will be crucial in shaping the course of the war. With Western support and Ukraine’s innovative approach to integrating advanced technologies into its existing fleet, the Su-24 armed with SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles represents a powerful tool in Ukraine’s fight to reclaim its territory and push back Russian forces. This new capability may well prove to be a game-changer as Ukraine continues to defend its sovereignty.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/ukraines-su-24-bomber-now-armed-with-western-scalp-eg-storm-shadow-missiles	2024-10-28T02:13:19-07:00

US Navy Eyes Patriot Missiles to Counter China’s Hypersonic Threats in Pacific	According to information published by The Economic Times on October 25, 2024, the U.S. Navy is advancing plans to deploy Patriot interceptor missiles on its warships, Amid rising security concerns over China’s potential use of advanced hypersonic weapons in the Indo-Pacific. This move is intended to counter the growing threat of Chinese missile technology, specifically anti-ship ballistic missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles capable of evading traditional defense systems, according to two senior defense officials.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of US Navy warships. (Picture source: Generated by AI) Patriot missiles, particularly the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) variant, are already employed by the U.S. Army for land-based air defense. These interceptors, manufactured by Lockheed Martin, offer agility and the capability to target highly maneuverable threats, positioning them as a potential solution to counter hypersonic advancements anticipated in Chinese arsenals. Integrating these interceptors into naval defense systems signals a notable shift in U.S. military strategy as tensions in the Indo-Pacific persist and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) rapidly modernizes its capabilities. The addition of the PAC-3 interceptors to the Navy's arsenal is seen as essential to expanding the layered defense system on U.S. vessels. Demand for PAC-3 MSE interceptors has soared, driven by a heightened interest from foreign governments and the U.S. Army’s ambition to more than double production in the coming years. Lockheed Martin, the PAC-3’s manufacturer, is exploring avenues to increase production, including plans for a new production line for missile seekers in Florida. This facility would supplement Boeing’s existing manufacturing of seekers, and production for PAC-3 could eventually include Japan, a key U.S. ally in the Indo-Pacific region. The PAC-3's compact size, agility, and advanced 'hit-to-kill' technology—which allows the interceptor to destroy threats by direct impact rather than proximity detonation—make it well-suited for combating high-speed ballistic and hypersonic missiles. These interceptors would enhance existing capabilities aboard U.S. ships to target and neutralize fast-moving threats. The U.S. Navy has already conducted preliminary virtual tests of PAC-3 interceptors aboard a 'virtual Aegis ship,' using the Mk. 70 vertical launcher system, which is foundational for naval missile launches. However, the interceptors have yet to be physically deployed on a vessel, and additional testing is required to synchronize PAC-3 systems with the Navy's SPY-1 radar, a key component of the Aegis missile defense system. The PAC-3 interceptors have demonstrated significant capabilities in recent conflicts, successfully intercepting high-speed threats such as Russia’s Khinzal missiles in Ukraine. The missile’s success has spurred interest in incorporating it into the Navy’s defenses, adding a cost-effective layer against the sophisticated hypersonic and ballistic missiles developed by China. China’s missile capabilities, particularly the DF-21D 'carrier killer' and the DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile, are a central security concern for U.S. forces in the Pacific. The DF-27, which can cover a range of up to 5,000 miles, features an aerodynamic warhead that can maneuver, complicating defense strategies. This missile could pose a direct threat to U.S. naval forces and moving targets alike. While the Navy’s existing SM-6 missiles can reach targets in space, the PAC-3, though limited in range, offers greater agility due to rockets positioned near its nose, enabling it to respond effectively to high-speed threats in lower altitudes. The introduction of PAC-3 MSE interceptors could supplement these existing capabilities, enhancing the layered defense necessary to address the evolving threat environment in the Indo-Pacific.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-eyes-patriot-missiles-to-counter-chinas-hypersonic-threats-in-pacific	2024-10-25T05:18:04-07:00

US Military Base in Syria’s Koniko Gas Field reportedly Hit by Missile Attack	According to information published by the Times of India on October 24, 2024, the U.S. military base stationed in the Koniko gas field, located in Syria's Deir ez-Zor province, came under missile attack.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of a US military base in Syria's Koniko gas field. (Picture source: Generated by AI) In response to the missile attack, American forces deployed artillery strikes targeting villages along the eastern bank of the Euphrates River. These villages—Hatlah Tahtani, Marrat, Khsham, and Hawijah—fall under the jurisdiction of the Syrian government. The retaliatory strikes reportedly aimed to secure the area and dissuade further assaults on the U.S.-controlled facility. The Koniko gas field is a strategically significant site for U.S. forces operating in Syria. It has been a focal point of tension, given its proximity to areas held by the Syrian government and the region’s value in terms of energy resources. Control of such sites has been a point of contention in Syria, where U.S. and Syrian government forces, as well as other factions, maintain a presence amid the country’s ongoing conflict. The current military presence in Iraq and Syria reflects a complex, evolving strategy involving the United States, Iraq, Iran-backed militias, and other regional forces, primarily focused on countering the remnants of ISIS and addressing broader regional security concerns. In Iraq and Syria, the U.S. military and coalition allies rely on an array of armored and tactical vehicles, artillery systems, and defensive structures to support counter-terrorism and regional security efforts. Vehicles like MRAPs and M-ATVs form the backbone of protected ground transport, with their reinforced hulls designed to withstand roadside bombs and attacks from militant groups, a frequent risk in the operational landscape. M-ATVs, in particular, offer enhanced off-road capabilities, allowing forces to traverse Syria's rugged terrain where ISIS remnants sometimes establish hideouts​. Supporting logistics and tactical coordination, larger bases like Al Asad and Erbil house surveillance and defense infrastructure critical for both operations and base security. These include Patriot missile batteries and C-RAM systems, which intercept missile or rocket attacks often launched by Iran-backed militias. These defensive assets are essential, especially following recent escalations in militia activities in the region​. Artillery such as the M777 howitzer provides long-range fire support, crucial in both pre-emptive and reactive operations against ISIS positions. The M777’s range enables strikes from secure locations, effectively disrupting hostile forces without exposing ground personnel to direct combat. Additionally, the U.S. utilizes drones, including MQ-9 Reapers, for surveillance and strike operations, which are integral to both intelligence gathering and precision targeting, especially in Syria where ISIS cells may remain embedded​. Helicopters, like Black Hawks, offer rapid mobility for personnel and critical medical evacuation capabilities across Iraq and Syria. They also provide air cover during ground operations and facilitate quick logistical support for remote outposts, thus maintaining operational continuity and safeguarding personnel. This coordinated use of vehicles, heavy weaponry, and defensive measures forms a robust infrastructure aimed at countering ISIS and maintaining regional stability amidst complex security dynamics​.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-military-base-in-syrias-koniko-gas-field-reportedly-hit-by-missile-attack	2024-10-25T04:16:03-07:00	
Iran to produce Su-30 and Su-35 fighter jets following Russia's agreement	According to the Telegram account Mezuzah on October 25, 2024, reports emerged indicating that Iran had received a license from Russia to domestically produce Su-30 and Su-35 fighter jets. According to these reports, the Iranian Air Force intends to manufacture between 48 and 72 Su-35 fighter jets, while the number of Su-30 jets to be produced has not yet been specified. This information likely stems from agreements made during the BRICS summit held in Kazan, Russia, from October 22 to 24, 2024.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Iranian Air Force intends to manufacture between 48 and 72 Su-35 fighter jets, while the number of Su-30 jets to be produced has not yet been specified. (Picture source: Russian social media) The Su-35 and Su-30 are classified as fourth-generation, multirole supersonic fighter jets. The Su-35 features a radar system capable of detecting targets over long distances and is equipped with various air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. The Su-30 is a two-seater model designed to conduct a range of missions, including air superiority tasks and strikes on ground and naval targets. The Su-30 also includes in-flight refueling capabilities, along with modern navigation and control systems. Earlier reports, such as Tasnim in November 2023, confirmed Iran’s acquisition of Russian aircraft, including Mil Mi-28 attack helicopters, Su-35 fighter jets, and Yak-130 training jets. According to Sardar Seyed Mehdi Farhi, Deputy Minister of Defense and Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, these acquisitions are part of ongoing efforts to enhance Iran’s military aviation capabilities, particularly focusing on helicopter upgrades and improvements to night flying and avionics systems. Farhi also mentioned the work of Iran’s Helicopter Support and Renovation Company (Panha) over the past three decades. This development aligns with discussions held in January 2023 between Igor Levitin, a special assistant to the Russian president, and Iran’s First Vice President, Mohammed Mokhbar. During this meeting, Levitin expressed Russia’s readiness to pursue joint helicopter production with Iran. Amir Mojtaba Rouhani, CEO of Panha, had previously noted Iran’s regional leadership in helicopter maintenance services. In June 2023, Iranian Air Force Commander Amir Hamid Vahedi, in an interview about the Su-35, stated, 'We need the said Sukhoi jet, but we don’t know when it will arrive.' Vahedi referred to the construction of underground air bases, such as 'Oryol 44,' designed to protect the country’s fighter jets from potential attacks, including bunker-buster munitions. He indicated that these bases are strategically located to ensure operational safety and readiness. Vahedi also highlighted the modernization of Iran’s fleet of F-4 and F-14 aircraft, focusing on radar upgrades and extending the range of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. Iran’s Air Force currently operates a diverse fleet of fighter jets, including American-made F-14 Tomcats and F-4 Phantoms, as well as Russian-made MiG-29 and Su-24 aircraft. The fleet also includes domestically produced jets like the HESA Saeqeh and Kowsar. The recent acquisitions of Mil Mi-28 helicopters, Su-35 fighter jets, and Yak-130 trainers represent further steps in diversifying Iran’s air capabilities. The first two Yak-130 aircraft were delivered on September 11, 2023, and stationed at Shahid Babaei Air Base in Isfahan, central Iran. These jets are intended to facilitate the training of Iranian pilots in operating advanced Russian-made fighter jets, including the Su-35. In recent years, Iran has been working toward acquiring Su-35 fighter jets from Russia. Although there have been multiple reports about anticipated deliveries, Iranian officials have denied these claims. In April 2024, Tehran refuted reports that 12 Su-35 jets would be delivered imminently, which had been circulated in Iranian media and later retracted by the country’s Student News Network (SNN). Similar expectations were reported earlier in January 2023, indicating that the jets would arrive by March, yet the deliveries were postponed. Despite these delays, confidence in the eventual delivery of Su-35 fighter jets remains strong, bolstered by Iran’s successful procurement of Yak-130 trainers and Mil Mi-28 helicopters in November 2023. The Su-35’s specifications include enhanced avionics and radar systems designed for both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. The aircraft has a maximum speed of Mach 2.25 and an operational range of 3,600 kilometers, featuring an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar that allows for tracking multiple targets. As part of these efforts, the Yak-130 trainer has been integrated into the fleet alongside the planned acquisition of Su-35 fighter jets. These additions represent a significant step in Iran’s strategy to upgrade its air capabilities amid ongoing scrutiny and increasing attention to its defense partnerships with Russia. The United States has expressed concerns over the expanding cooperation between the two countries, particularly within the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Iran, however, has denied supplying weapons to Russia for use in the conflict. Regardless of these accusations, the growing defense cooperation between Russia and Iran is shaping regional military dynamics.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/iran-to-produce-su-30-and-su-35-fighter-jets-following-russias-agreement	2024-10-25T03:36:30-07:00

South Korea reveals supersonic air-to-surface missile to strengthen fighter jets exports	On October 24, 2024, at the Sacheon Air Show, the South Korean Agency for Defense Development (ADD) unveiled a supersonic air-to-surface missile for the first time. This unveiling comes amidst concerns over delays in weapons integration, which have affected the export competitiveness of domestic fighter jets such as the FA-50 and the KF-21. However, the new missile offers promising export potential and may help strengthen the position of Korean defense exports in international markets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By adding a simple rocket booster, the missile could even be adapted for use from ships or ground-based missile launch trucks, similar to Taiwan’s Hsiung Feng III supersonic missile, thus replacing older subsonic anti-ship missiles. (Picture source: YouTube/슈퍼소닉TV) The supersonic air-to-surface missile is designed to be mounted on aircraft and can strike key ground targets with precision from long range. Similar to missiles like the Cheonryong developed by LIG Nex1 and Germany’s Taurus, this missile performs the same fundamental task. However, unlike subsonic air-to-surface missiles that fly at speeds of 700–1,100 km/h, the newly unveiled missile reaches supersonic speeds of Mach 2.5, or around 3,000 km/h, making it much harder to detect and intercept. With a range of 300 km, the missile can hit its target in just about five minutes after launch, significantly reducing the reaction time for enemy defenses. The missile is also expected to incorporate stealth technology, making it less detectable by enemy radar. One of the key features enabling such high speeds is the ducted ramjet engine. This innovative propulsion system combines the advantages of jet and rocket engines, using atmospheric oxygen instead of carrying an onboard oxidizer. This design not only simplifies the structure but also allows for longer burn times and faster speeds compared to traditional jet engines. Another notable characteristic of this missile is its modular design, which enables it to perform multiple functions. By simply swapping modules, the missile can be configured to engage either ground targets or enemy ships. The missile’s seeker, equipped with both radar and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) systems, further enhances its ability to accurately strike targets in various weather conditions and amidst electronic countermeasures. Although the missile displayed at the air show was a test model rather than a final product, it represents a significant step forward. Weapons intended for aircraft integration typically require extensive software development and flight testing, which incurs substantial costs. To address this, ADD has been using test models for preliminary drop and flight tests. Flight tests of this new missile are scheduled to begin in 2025, with the FA-50 light combat aircraft serving as the test platform. (Picture source: 23.BLT) According to the data released by ADD, the missile has been under development since 2022, with full completion expected by 2026. Flight tests are scheduled to begin in 2025, with the FA-50 light combat aircraft serving as the test platform. Key defense contractors such as Hanwha Aerospace and Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) are participating in the missile's development. Once integrated with the FA-50, the supersonic air-to-surface missile will offer an unparalleled capability within its class, significantly boosting the export competitiveness of both the FA-50 and the KF-21 fighter jet. In contrast, rival jets like the F-16V and JAS-39E Gripen currently only operate subsonic air-to-surface missiles. While France’s Rafale can carry supersonic air-to-surface missiles, these are equipped with nuclear warheads, making them unsuitable for export. As a result, the supersonic missile will be an exclusive asset for the FA-50 and KF-21. Countries that have already purchased the FA-50, such as Poland, are expected to express interest in this missile as well. For instance, the South Korean Air Force (ROKAF) first deployed the FA-50 in 2014, assigning 20 units to an Air Force wing. ROKAF ordered a total of 60 FA-50s, and in 2014, the aircraft successfully conducted a test firing of an AGM-65 Maverick missile. Indonesia signed a contract in 2011 for 16 T-50i aircraft, a variant of the FA-50 with light attack capabilities, followed by additional orders in 2021. Given its multi-purpose capabilities and potential for cost-effective production, the supersonic air-to-surface missile is anticipated to contribute to the export competitiveness of both the FA-50 and the KF-21 fighter jets. (Picture source: Twitter/KalisGo) Iraq also signed a contract for 24 FA-50IQ variants in 2013, receiving the first batch in 2017, though operational challenges delayed their deployment until 2022. The Philippine Air Force procured 12 FA-50PH units in 2014, and since 2017, these aircraft have been used in various combat operations, including airstrikes against terrorist positions. Additional orders are being considered as part of the PAF's Flight Plan 2028. Several other countries have purchased or shown interest in the FA-50. Thailand ordered a total of 12 T-50TH units, with deliveries starting in 2018. Poland is acquiring 48 FA-50 aircraft to replace its aging MiG-29 and Su-22 fleets, with deliveries beginning in 2023. Malaysia finalized a contract for 18 FA-50 Block 20 aircraft in 2023, with the possibility of future orders. Other nations expressing interest or considering the FA-50 include Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Botswana, Brunei, Colombia, Croatia, Egypt, Pakistan, Peru, Senegal, Spain, Slovakia, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and Vietnam. Some of these countries have explored options for joint production, while others are considering the FA-50 for advanced tactical and training purposes. Given its multi-purpose capabilities and potential for cost-effective production, the supersonic air-to-surface missile is anticipated to contribute not only to the enhancement of military power but also to the growth of defense exports. By adding a simple rocket booster, the missile could even be adapted for use from ships or ground-based missile launch trucks, similar to Taiwan’s Hsiung Feng III supersonic missile, thus replacing older subsonic anti-ship missiles. Therefore, this new supersonic air-to-surface missile is poised to play a key role in both augmenting South Korea’s military strength and expanding its defense exports, marking a significant upgrade of the FA-50's capacities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/south-korea-reveals-supersonic-air-to-surface-missile-to-strengthen-fighter-jets-exports	2024-10-25T01:34:31-07:00

US Marines Integrate Moving Stock Aiming System to Enhance Rifle Accuracy Against Drones	The U.S. Marines are exploring an automated targeting system for standard infantry rifles, aimed at improving every soldier’s capacity to defend against the rising threat of drones on the battlefield. The ZeroMark Fire Control System (FCS) innovation incorporates an automatic adjustment mechanism to fine-tune the aiming point, optimizing precision against unmanned aerial threats. Currently undergoing tests with the 3rd Marine Division in Hawaii, this equipment marks a significant advancement for accurately targeting moving threats, which are often challenging to counter through traditional methods. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Marine fires a ZeroMark Fire Control System attached to an M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle during a live-fire demonstration on Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Oct. 23, 2024 (Picture source: US DoD) Developed by New York-based startup ZeroMark, founded in 2022, the ZeroMark FCS has received investment from prominent backers, including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Ground Up Ventures, and benefits from $7 million in funding for research and development. The system relies on sophisticated machine vision technology, with electro-optical cameras and LiDAR sensors to detect and track targets in real time. The system’s distinct feature lies in its motorized buttstock, which adjusts the rifle’s angle to optimize shooting accuracy, allowing the shooter to target drones more effectively. Unlike existing assisted-aiming systems like the SMASH 2000 series from Israeli firm Smart Shooter, ZeroMark’s FCS uses advanced vision algorithms to steer the weapon’s barrel, even making slight angular adjustments to maximize shot alignment. ZeroMark’s technology, described as a 'fire control system,' includes a small computer and motorized stock. CEO Joel Anderson explains that this motorized stock creates a virtual pivot between the shoulder and rifle, allowing small degree adjustments to refine shot trajectory and compensate for both drone and shooter movement, as well as variations caused by noise or torque. Installation on any rifle takes just 30 seconds, potentially making drone defense a manageable task for the average soldier. Anderson states that the system 'makes hitting a small drone at 200 yards as easy as hitting an 18-meter-diameter circle,' making such skills accessible to a broader range of soldiers. A former U.S. Navy member and the first security director of MongoDB, Anderson says he drew inspiration for ZeroMark after driving a Tesla with autopilot and wondering why similar technology wasn’t available to soldiers. Seeing a growing need for anti-drone solutions, he presented the prototype to a16z partners, who encouraged him to launch the startup in 2022. ZeroMark’s development is focused solely on countering offensive drones. While acknowledging that the concept of a weapon 'that never misses' may be controversial, Anderson clarifies that the company avoids marketing its systems to law enforcement, stating: 'I don’t believe the world is ready for that, nor am I. I don’t want to see AI-enabled weapons in police hands.' To mitigate potential misuse, the company has incorporated remote management, license-based activation, and fleet management features to ensure responsible use. FCS units are already in use by private security firms to protect assets like boats against potential drone threats related to piracy. ZeroMark is in talks to send its devices to Ukraine and is engaging in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense for testing and evaluation that could lead to larger orders. Beyond self-targeting capabilities, Anderson envisions ZeroMark software being applied in other contexts, such as cameras capable of identifying drone types, origin, or payload. In the long term, he envisions integrating the system into head-up displays or auditory interfaces to deliver real-time critical information to soldiers. Anderson sums up his vision: 'Large systems like aircraft carriers don’t win wars. They help project power but don’t capture Husseins, don’t kill Bin Ladens, don’t bring hostages home; soldiers do... and I want them to be as untouchable as an F-22 in the sky.'	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-marines-integrate-moving-stock-aiming-system-to-enhance-rifle-accuracy-against-drones	2024-10-25T00:50:07-07:00

Exclusive: Hezbollah Launches Qader-2 Missiles from Underground Silos Targeting Israel	According to a video published on X (formerly Twitter) on October 23, 2024, Hezbollah combatants launched Iranian-made Qader-2 surface-to-surface cruise missiles from underground silos, targeting Israeli territory. This marked a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict, showcasing Hezbollah's growing missile capabilities and its increasing reliance on advanced military technology.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Hezbollah fighters launch a Qader-2 missile from a concealed underground silo to target Israeli territory. (Picture source: Social Network) The current situation between Hezbollah and Israel has intensified, with Hezbollah significantly increasing its missile attacks on Israeli territory. In recent weeks, the militant group has launched a series of missile barrages, targeting key Israeli cities and military installations. These attacks have escalated in both frequency and intensity, with Hezbollah deploying more advanced missiles such as the Qader-2 and Nasr 1. The use of underground launch sites has made these strikes harder to detect and intercept, challenging Israel’s air defense systems. The Qader-2, an upgraded version of Iran's Qader-1 missile, was specifically engineered for precision strikes and enhanced destructive capability. It boasts a maximum range of approximately 300 kilometers, surpassing the 200-kilometer range of its predecessor, making it more versatile in targeting deeper Israeli territory. The missile's pinpoint accuracy, reportedly within five meters, gives Hezbollah a tactical advantage in hitting strategic and critical infrastructure targets with high precision. According to the Iranian Press Agency, Hezbollah launched these missiles in response to air strikes on Lebanese territory in recent days. The Qader-2 missiles were part of a broader missile barrage that included Nasr 1 missiles, aimed at the outskirts of Tel Aviv. Iran has been a critical supporter of Hezbollah, providing the group with financial, military, and logistical backing for decades. This support includes the supply of advanced weaponry, such as the Qader and other ballistic missiles, which significantly enhance Hezbollah’s military capabilities. Iran's Revolutionary Guard plays a pivotal role in training Hezbollah fighters and aiding in the development of their missile programs, including the construction of underground launch sites. This relationship allows Hezbollah to maintain a robust arsenal and operational infrastructure, enabling it to challenge Israeli forces and carry out sophisticated attacks. Iran’s support of Hezbollah is part of its broader strategy to exert influence in the region and confront Israel indirectly through proxy forces. What makes this attack particularly concerning is the method of deployment. The Qader-2 missiles were fired from underground silos, demonstrating Hezbollah's increasing reliance on concealed and hardened launch sites. This tactic complicates efforts to detect and intercept such missiles, making it more difficult for Israel's missile defense systems to neutralize before launch. The use of underground missile sites underscores Hezbollah's capability to strike while minimizing exposure to counterstrikes. The Qader-2 missile represents a significant leap in Hezbollah's military technology, enhanced to meet the group’s specific operational needs. With an increased range, accuracy, and destructive power, these missiles enable Hezbollah to carry out more precise attacks on Israeli territory, including heavily fortified areas. This latest round of missile strikes marks a new chapter in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, intensifying regional tensions as both sides continue to escalate their military actions. As Hezbollah deploys more advanced weaponry like the Qader-2 from underground silos, the threat to Israeli cities and infrastructure grows, raising the stakes in the ongoing confrontation. The key threat to Israel from Hezbollah's missile attacks lies in the advanced technology and tactics the group employs. Missiles like the Qader-2, with an extended range of up to 300 kilometers and precision targeting within five meters, can strike deep into Israeli territory, including densely populated cities and critical infrastructure. Hezbollah's use of underground silos for launching these missiles makes detection and pre-emptive strikes difficult, reducing Israel's ability to neutralize threats before launch. Despite Israel's sophisticated air defense systems, such as Iron Dome and David’s Sling, the sheer volume of missile barrages combined with Hezbollah's ability to conceal launch sites strains these defenses, increasing the likelihood of successful strikes and further complicating Israel’s military response.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-hezbollah-launches-qader-2-missiles-from-underground-silos-targeting-israel	2024-10-24T02:18:21-07:00

US confirms 3000 North Korean soldiers moved to Russia for military training	On October 23, 2024, during a press conference, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby confirmed the deployment of these 3,000 North Korean soldiers to eastern Russia. According to reports, these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wonsan region in North Korea to Vladivostok, a major port in eastern Russia. They were then transferred to various military training centers in eastern Russia, where they are currently undergoing intensive training. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The final destination of these North Korean soldiers remains uncertain, but the likelihood of them joining Russian forces on the Ukrainian front is considered highly probable and concerning (Picture source: KNCA) The final destination of these North Korean soldiers remains uncertain, but the likelihood of them joining Russian forces on the Ukrainian front is considered highly probable and concerning. Fears of these troops engaging in combat alongside Russian forces have heightened concerns about further escalation in the war in Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin echoed this concern, stating that this development would be a 'serious step' after North Korea had already supplied arms to Russia. The exact nature of the North Korean soldiers' mission, who are currently in training, remains unclear. This situation arises as Russia seeks to bolster its military capabilities in a conflict that has become protracted. Since the Russian invasion in February 2022, the war has escalated, causing significant casualties on both sides, while remaining largely focused on the eastern front of Ukraine. The potential arrival of North Korean soldiers could mark a significant shift in this war of attrition. The U.S. government is closely monitoring the situation and has briefed Ukrainian authorities as well as international partners. Kirby added that should these North Korean soldiers enter combat, they would become 'legitimate targets' for the Ukrainian forces. The deployment of North Korean soldiers to Russia is seen by many observers as a sign of weakness on the part of the Kremlin. The decision to turn to Pyongyang, a largely isolated state on the international stage, reflects the difficult position in which Moscow finds itself after more than two years of conflict. Relying on North Korean human resources further highlights Russia’s growing dependence on marginal alliances, even as its losses on the battlefield continue to mount. The South Korean government, for its part, has expressed concern about the potential military technology Russia might offer North Korea in exchange for this military support. Some experts suggest that Moscow could provide advanced military technologies to Pyongyang, particularly in the areas of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, which would significantly enhance the threat posed by North Korea to the Korean Peninsula and East Asia. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service has also indicated that this deployment could involve up to 10,000 North Korean soldiers by the end of the year. Despite denials from both Moscow and Pyongyang regarding troop deployments or arms transfers, the international community, especially NATO, views this growing military alliance between Russia and North Korea as a major concern. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has been invited to Brussels to share intelligence on these developments with NATO.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-confirms-3000-north-korean-soldiers-moved-to-russia-for-military-training	2024-10-24T01:10:49-07:00

A helicopter was also utilized in the exercise to deliver materials onto the ship, showcasing the vessel’s air replenishment capability.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link China Type 093A comprehensive supply ship Kekexilihu. (Picture source: Chinese MoD) The Type 903A supply ships are integral to the PLA Navy’s logistics, designed to support naval operations through extensive replenishment functions. The Kekexilihu is equipped to deliver a wide array of supplies, including fuel and essential materials, while also facilitating helicopter operations. Replenishment operations Replenishment at sea (RAS) plays a crucial role in modern naval warfare by enabling fleets to remain operational far from their home bases for extended periods. This capability extends the endurance of naval forces by allowing them to resupply with fuel, ammunition, food, and other essential stores without returning to port, thus maintaining their presence in the operational area and maximizing combat effectiveness. During major naval campaigns like World War II, RAS allowed fleets, such as the U.S. Navy’s Task Force 58, to remain engaged in continuous operations, including long-range strikes against Japan, by refueling and resupplying at sea. The ability to conduct underway replenishments meant that fleets could avoid the lengthy transit times to distant bases, which would otherwise limit their operational tempo. By the end of the war, the U.S. had refined RAS to include not just fuel but also ordnance, enabling sustained high-tempo operations over vast distances​. In more recent conflicts, such as the Falklands War, the critical nature of RAS was highlighted when the British Navy operated 7,000 miles from home. The success of this operation relied heavily on the Navy’s ability to sustain its fleet through effective resupply at sea. Similarly, today’s complex naval missions—ranging from humanitarian aid to high-intensity conflict—depend on the logistical support provided by RAS to maintain forward-deployed naval forces​. Moreover, replenishment operations are not without risks. Ships involved in RAS are highly vulnerable, as their ability to maneuver is limited while they are connected for resupply. This vulnerability underscores the importance of coordination, precision, and technology, as modern RAS systems increasingly emphasize safety and reliability​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/china-supply-ship-kekexilihu-conducts-helicopter-replenishment-during-maritime-drill-in-yellow-sea	2024-10-24T00:50:54-07:00	
Leave SCAF for GCAP: Germany’s Growing Alliance with UK in Combat Drone Technology	The strategic relationship between Germany and the United Kingdom has taken on new following the announcement of the Trinity House Agreement on October 23, 2024. This defense agreement focuses on joint development efforts, particularly creating a combat drone. The collaboration between the two countries could signal a shift in Germany's defense alignment, as it also encompasses areas related to both the SCAF (Système de Combat Aérien du Futur) and GCAP (Global Combat Air Programme) projects. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Unlike SCAF, which focuses on intra-European collaboration, GCAP seeks to form a broader transcontinental alliance (Picture source: Leonardo ) In November 2023, rumors surfaced suggesting that Germany might abandon the SCAF program in favor of joining GCAP. Despite official denials, the Trinity House Agreement seems to bolster these claims by intensifying defense ties between Germany and the UK, including joint land-based weapons projects and drone development. The SCAF Project, also known as FCAS (Future Combat Air System), is a large-scale European initiative involving France, Germany, and Spain. It aims to develop a next-generation air combat system, expected to be operational around 2040. This program is based on a 'system of systems' approach, including three main components: the Next Generation Fighter (NGF), unmanned systems called Remote Carriers (RC), and a digital infrastructure known as the Combat Cloud. The NGF, led by Dassault Aviation, will serve as the central platform for advanced combat missions, assisted by RC drones that provide specific support capabilities. The Combat Cloud will enable integrated communication between all system elements, optimizing data management and decision-making, even in contested environments. The objective is to strengthen European technological sovereignty and ensure autonomous defense capabilities for future threats. The GCAP Project, launched in 2022, is a competing initiative led by the UK, Italy, and Japan. The goal is to develop a sixth-generation fighter that can operate alongside unmanned systems, combat drones, and advanced intelligent weapons. Unlike SCAF, which focuses on intra-European collaboration, GCAP seeks to form a broader transcontinental alliance. The project aims to replace the UK and Italian Eurofighter Typhoons and Japan's Mitsubishi F-2 by 2035. It benefits from industrial expertise provided by partners such as BAE Systems, Leonardo, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries​. While both programs aim to develop next-generation air combat capabilities, they differ in structure and ambition. SCAF focuses on enhancing European interoperability between existing platforms like the Rafale and Eurofighter, while GCAP involves broader cooperation with a focus on transnational alliances beyond Europe. However, delays in the SCAF program could lead to Germany reorienting part of its efforts toward projects that address its more immediate needs. The Trinity House Agreement, presented by the UK Ministry of Defense as a significant step for European security, underscores the growing importance of cooperation between the two largest European defense investors. In addition to enhanced joint exercises, the agreement includes provisions to protect critical underwater infrastructure and marks the first-ever temporary deployment of German P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft in Scotland, bolstering the UK's surveillance capabilities.

The agreement also emphasizes the rapid development of new, more precise long-range weapons systems. Although the German Defense Ministry has been vague on this point, these projects could fall under the European Long-range Strike Approach (ELSA) program, which the UK recently joined. The Trinity House Agreement also touches on air defense cooperation, with plans to integrate British and German systems to better protect European airspace from long-range missile threats. Despite the UK's current limitations in this domain, as noted in a recent report, this cooperation could enhance collective security in Europe. One of the most notable aspects of this agreement is the commitment to developing autonomous aerial drones that can operate in coordination with fighter aircraft. Although Germany had initially planned to collaborate with France on the Maritime Airborne Warfare System (MAWS) project, Berlin's decision to purchase P-8A Poseidon aircraft from Boeing ended that initiative. The agreement with the UK could signal a shift toward solutions more tailored to the specific needs of both nations. The German Ministry of Defense clarified that these drones will be developed in close cooperation with allies, particularly France, as part of SCAF's third pillar, which Germany oversees. This pillar focuses on drones and connected effectors. During the ILA Air Show in Berlin in June 2024, Airbus Defence &amp; Space unveiled a collaborative drone concept, or 'loyal wingman,' designed to accompany fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon. Although the technical details of this project remain undisclosed, it appears to align with the goals of the Trinity House Agreement. Finally, supporting Ukraine remains a central objective for both countries. This agreement reaffirms their commitment to providing Ukraine with the military capabilities to resist Russian aggression. Concrete initiatives include integrating modern missile systems into the Sea King helicopters donated by Germany and closer collaboration between the UK and German defense industries to support Ukraine's war effort.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/leave-scaf-for-gcap-germanys-growing-alliance-with-uk-in-combat-drone-technology	2024-10-24T00:27:21-07:00

Poland introduces SA-35MM counter-drone air defense system using programmable ammunition	At the inaugural International Armament Congress, held from October 21 to 25, 2024, in Kraków, Poland, defense company Pit-Radwar presented a new 35mm self-propelled artillery system equipped with programmable ammunition. Designed to integrate into the evolving air defense architecture of the Polish Armed Forces, this system aims to enhance very short-range air defense (VSHORAD) capabilities against modern aerial threats, including drones, aircraft, and cruise missiles.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The SA-35MM achieves a 97% hit probability using programmable ABM ammunition, with just seven projectiles releasing over 50 subprojectiles each. (Picture source: Pit-Radwar) The newly unveiled system, named the SA-35MM, combines the AM-35mm automatic cannon with a programmable munition system. It features an independent optoelectronic target-tracking system called ZGS-35, a hybrid fire control system with the TUGA radar, and optoelectronic sensors. Mounted on a third-generation Jelcz 6x6 platform, the system is developed to engage a wide spectrum of air targets performing maneuvers in course, speed, and altitude within the fire zone, enabling effective short-term anti-aircraft defense of stationary strategic assets, troop concentrations, and mobile units. The SA-35MM is particularly effective against low-cost, small, and very small targets, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (including kamikaze drones). The system is compatible with Polish air defense systems and is capable of autonomous target engagement, offering a high level of automation and remote control capabilities. Its design allows for fast mission readiness and deployment without manual alignment. The AM-35mm automatic cannon has a rate of fire of 550 rounds per minute and features a two-sided, chained ammunition feeding system with a magazine capacity of 2 x 100 rounds. It can immediately switch between two types of ammunition, typically sub-caliber FAPDS-T (Frangible Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot with Tracer) and programmable Air Burst Munition (ABM), allowing it to effectively combat various airborne and ground threats. The cannon is reduced in size and weight by utilizing carbon fiber technology, and it can operate autonomously via its own remote-control console or integrated with a combat management system. The ZGS-35 optoelectronic tracking system includes an infrared thermal imaging camera, a daylight camera, a high-repetition laser rangefinder, a video tracker, and a short-range interrogator. These components enable accuracy in dynamic object tracking, allowing the system to perform combat operations in various weather conditions, both day and night. The tracking head has an operational range in elevation from -10° to 85° and can perform continuous 360° rotation in azimuth. It provides range readout limits from a minimum of 200 meters to a maximum of 30,000 meters, with a ranging rate of 30 Hz. The SA-35MM combines the AM-35mm automatic cannon with a programmable munition system and a third-generation Jelcz 6x6 platform. (Picture source: Pit-Radwar) The TUGA radar, part of the hybrid fire control system, operates on continuous wave modulation by frequency (FMCW) with an active electronically scanned array (AESA) antenna in the X-band. This radar technology uses low transmitted signal power, making it difficult to detect by enemy reconnaissance devices, thus increasing operational security. Despite its low power and compact size, the TUGA radar has a detection range from 50 meters to 50 kilometers and can detect small drones at distances up to 5 kilometers. The development of this artillery system is a collaborative effort involving Pit-Radwar, the Military University of Technology, and the defense company Mesko. The project is co-financed by Poland's National Centre for Research and Development (NCBiR), as part of Competition no. 12/2022 for projects in development works for state defense and security. The Tactical and Technical Assumptions have been approved by the AU Chief, with the objective to deliver nine prototypes after qualification tests, integrated with the OSU-35K naval gun system. The implementation period spans from December 20, 2022, to June 20, 2025. During the congress, Pit-Radwar conducted demonstrations showcasing the system's capabilities. One test involved targeting a small unmanned aerial vehicle located 1,000 meters away, with an angular size of 0.5x2.0 milliradians. The AG-35 cannon achieved a dispersion of no more than 0.5 milliradians, closely matching the dimensions of the drone, demonstrating the system's precision. Field test results indicated that achieving a 99% probability of hitting the target with at least one projectile required firing 24 rounds of typical TP-T/FAPDS-T ammunition. In contrast, using programmable ABM ammunition, firing only seven projectiles achieved a probability of hitting at the level of 97%, with each projectile releasing over 50 subprojectiles. This represents a significant reduction in ammunition consumption while maintaining a high probability of target destruction. The objective is to deliver nine prototypes after qualification tests, integrated with the OSU-35K naval gun system, before June 20, 2025. (Picture source: Pit-Radwar) Pit-Radwar proposed integrating the 35mm cannon into self-propelled artillery systems mounted on the AS-35 wheeled chassis. Two configurations for very short-range air defense (VSHORAD) batteries were suggested. The first, an artillery battery, would consist of four self-propelled SA-35 guns, a WG-35 fire control vehicle, a command vehicle, and a preliminary detection radar such as the Soła or Bystra systems. The second, a rocket-artillery battery, would include self-propelled Poprad missile systems enhanced with anti-drone technologies and a K-band tracking radar, in addition to the artillery components. The SA-35MM system operates autonomously, equipped with its own fire control system based on the ZGS-35 optoelectronic tracking and aiming head. The integrated optoelectronic tracking head ensures accuracy in dynamic object tracking through its sensors, which include thermal imaging and daylight cameras, a laser rangefinder, and a video tracker. The system also features a communication and data transmission subsystem, enabling radio and cable communication with the battery command and control system and the WG-35 fire control vehicle, allowing for remote control from a portable terminal. The drive subsystems of the gun and the optoelectronic tracking head are designed with advanced drive units and dedicated electronic controllers, providing high dynamics and precision of movement. An inertial navigation subsystem, including GPS, ensures accurate positioning and continuous measurement of azimuth angle, inclination, and tilt. The system also includes a non-kinetic UAV neutralization system and emphasizes cost-efficiency by reducing logistics and personnel requirements, thereby lowering life-cycle costs. Public and expert reactions at the congress reflected interest in the potential implementation of the system. The presentation of this new 35mm air defense system underscored its significant advantage in reducing ammunition consumption while maintaining effectiveness, especially when compared to 23mm caliber systems. This efficiency is largely attributed to the use of programmable ammunition in the 35mm system, enhancing precision and operational capability. Observers expressed hope that the program would be carried out consistently, with some anticipating the first batteries to be operational by 2026. Others highlighted the necessity for mass production to ensure the security of key facilities and troops, especially given the increasing use of drones in modern conflicts, such as in Ukraine, Gaza, or Lebanon.

British army Intel Reports Russia's Escalation in Use of One-Way Attack Drones Against Ukraine	According to a report published by the British Ministry of Defense (MoD) Intelligence Service on September 23, 2024, Russia launched over 1,300 One-Way Attack Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (OWA-UAVs) into Ukraine during September alone. This marks the highest number of such drone strikes in a single month since the beginning of the conflict, signaling a significant escalation in the use of these unmanned aerial systems. The British MoD warns that, based on the current rate of operations, it is almost certain that Russia will surpass this figure in October 2024, reflecting a growing trend of intensified aerial assaults against Ukrainian targets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Debris of a Russian Shahed-136 (Geran-2) drone scattered across a Ukrainian field. (Picture source: Russian Social Network) While it remains unclear whether Russia can sustain this aggressive rate of OWA-UAV (One-Way Attack Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles ) strikes throughout the year, intelligence reports suggest that Moscow is likely expanding its capacity to produce these drones domestically. Previously reliant on Iranian-supplied UAVs, Russia is believed to be increasing its production capabilities to maintain and even amplify its ability to carry out large-scale attacks on Ukraine. This shift in supply lines is seen as part of a broader strategy to mitigate the risks of sanctions and supply chain disruptions, giving Moscow a more resilient capability to sustain its drone warfare efforts. OWA-UAVs, often colloquially referred to as 'kamikaze drones,' are primarily employed to strike critical Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly energy facilities. These drones, due to their low cost and ability to penetrate deep into Ukrainian territory, have proven effective in disrupting energy supplies and damaging critical civilian infrastructure, particularly ahead of the harsh winter months. This has put enormous pressure on Ukraine's air defense systems, which are tasked with countering both conventional missile strikes and these swarming UAVs. In the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, several Russian One-Way Attack (OWA) drones, or loitering munitions, have been deployed, each with specific technical features. The Shahed-136 (Russian designation: Geran-2), developed by Iran, is one of the most frequently used OWA drones. It is known for its delta-wing design, giving it a distinctive appearance. The Shahed-136 is powered by a small engine, typically the MD-550, and has a range of about 2,500 kilometers. It carries a warhead of approximately 40-50 kilograms and is designed to strike static targets such as infrastructure and supply depots. While its speed is relatively low (about 185 km/h), its main strength lies in the ability to be deployed in large numbers, making it difficult for defense systems to intercept all of them​. The Shahed-131 (Russian designation: Geran-1) is a smaller version of the Shahed-136 and shares much of the same design, though with a smaller payload and range. It has a range of about 900 kilometers and carries a warhead weighing around 10-15 kilograms. It also features a delta-wing design and is primarily used for shorter-range attacks on military targets​. Russia’s domestically produced Lancet drone, developed by ZALA Aero, features more advanced targeting capabilities compared to the Shahed drones. The Lancet is equipped with electro-optical systems for greater precision and can carry a payload of up to 3 kilograms, depending on the model. It has a range of up to 40 kilometers and a speed of about 110 km/h. It is designed for tactical strikes on specific targets such as artillery, vehicles, and air defense systems. The Lancet’s modular design allows it to be used for both surveillance and attack missions​. Each of these drones plays a crucial role in Russia’s strategy in Ukraine, especially in targeting rear positions and forcing Ukraine to expend significant resources on air defense. Despite their widespread use, many of these drones have been intercepted by Ukrainian defense systems, but their low cost and mass deployment make them a persistent threat​. The increased tempo of drone attacks is likely aimed at exhausting Ukrainian air defense resources, compelling Ukraine to divert attention from other threats, such as ballistic and cruise missile strikes. In addition, these drone assaults are part of Russia's broader strategy to weaken Ukraine’s economic resilience, particularly by targeting its energy grid. The surge in drone attacks is raising significant concerns in Kyiv and among Ukraine's Western allies. Ukrainian officials have warned that the continuous targeting of energy infrastructure could lead to widespread blackouts, severely impacting both civilian life and military operations. As winter approaches, such attacks on power stations, substations, and other critical utilities could lead to further humanitarian challenges, especially in regions already hard-hit by the war.

UK’s first E-7 Wedgetail early warning aircraft receives VIII Squadron livery and NATO markings	On October 17, 2024, the Royal Air Force (RAF) marked a significant event as its first E-7 AEW&amp;C (Airborne Early Warning and Control) aircraft, built by Boeing UK, rolled out from Southend Airport. This is the first time the E-7 has been painted in RAF livery. The aircraft, designated WT001, carries the markings of VIII Squadron, which is set to operate the Wedgetail. The squadron’s badge, a sheathed Arabian dagger known as a Jambiya, reflects its long association with Arabia, a symbol approved by King George VI in 1943 to signify their role.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The VIII squadron’s badge, a sheathed Arabian dagger known as a Jambiya, reflects its long association with Arabia, a symbol approved by King George VI in 1943 to signify their role. (Picture source: British MoD) In addition to RAF roundels and markings, the aircraft bears the emblem of NATO’s Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control Force (NAEW&amp;CF), linking the UK’s Wedgetail with NATO’s airborne surveillance mission. The E-7 has been selected by NATO as its next command and control aircraft, and the RAF’s Wedgetails will contribute to NATO’s Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control Force. After departing Southend Airport, the Wedgetail returned to STS Aviation Services in Birmingham for additional modifications and is scheduled to undergo further testing and evaluation before entering full service in 2025. This aircraft will serve as the most advanced AEW&amp;C platform for the RAF, providing the UK with expanded airborne surveillance capabilities to improve situational awareness. Wing Commander McDonnell, Officer Commanding VIII Squadron, noted the significance of the UK’s first painted Wedgetail, highlighting that it represents a step toward achieving operational capability. The RAF’s Wedgetail fleet will operate under No. 8 Squadron and be stationed at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, alongside the nine Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Both the Wedgetail and Poseidon are based on the Boeing 737-700 increased gross weight (IGW) airframe, known for its reliability and reduced maintenance requirements. The 737 series benefits from a global supplier base and support network, which supports the long-term operation of these fleets. RAF Lossiemouth has undergone infrastructure upgrades to accommodate the Wedgetail, including a maintenance facility built by McLaughlin &amp; Harvey. This facility supports both the Wedgetail and Poseidon fleets, and at its peak employed over 175 people, with involvement from five Scottish subcontractors. The facility was officially opened in September 2024 and is expected to support the AEW&amp;C fleet for at least 20 years. The first British Wedgetail successfully completed its maiden flight on September 20, 2024. The remaining aircraft are expected to be delivered by 2026. (Picture source: Boeing) The UK’s decision to acquire the E-7 began in October 2018, when the British government entered discussions with Boeing to replace its aging E-3D Sentry fleet. These discussions also involved potential cooperation with Australia, which already operated the Wedgetail. The decision to proceed without a competitive tender process led to some criticism, including concerns over favoritism toward Boeing. Saab, a competitor, expressed opposition, stating it could offer its Erieye system on an Airbus A330 MRTT platform. Despite this, in March 2019, the UK finalized a $1.98 billion deal (approximately $2.33 billion in 2023) to purchase five Wedgetail AEW1 aircraft. In December 2020, reports indicated that the UK might reduce its Wedgetail order from five to three aircraft. This reduction was confirmed in the 2021 Integrated Defence Review, raising concerns that only one aircraft might be available for operational tasking at a time. However, in February 2023, Air Chief Marshal Michael Wigston suggested the order might eventually increase to five aircraft depending on future requirements. Initially, Marshall Aerospace was selected to carry out airframe modifications, but the company withdrew in May 2020. Boeing then contracted STS Aviation Group’s UK branch to complete the modifications in Birmingham, where more than 100 specialists are converting two commercial airliners, with the remaining aircraft being newly built. Each conversion takes around 24 months, and the first British Wedgetail successfully completed its maiden flight on September 20, 2024. The remaining aircraft are expected to be delivered by 2026. Sharing key characteristics with the Boeing 737-700ER, the E-7 has undergone several modifications to fulfill its AEW&amp;C role, including the addition of ventral fins to balance the radar’s weight and countermeasures mounted on the nose, wingtips, and tail. (Picture source: British MoD) The E-7 Wedgetail shares key characteristics with the Boeing 737-700ER and is intended to provide the UK with AEW&amp;C capabilities beyond those offered by ground-based systems and fighter aircraft sensors. The Wedgetail is already in service with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), the South Korean Air Force, and the Turkish Air Force, and has also been selected by the United States Air Force and NATO to replace aging fleets. The E-7 has undergone several modifications to fulfill its AEW&amp;C role, including the addition of ventral fins to balance the radar’s weight and countermeasures mounted on the nose, wingtips, and tail. It is also equipped with in-flight refueling capabilities, enabling longer mission durations. The aircraft’s cabin includes eight operator consoles, though the Australian fleet uses up to ten. The UK variant is expected to follow a similar configuration to support efficient mission management. The E-7’s primary feature is its Northrop Grumman Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) radar, housed in a distinctive dorsal fin atop the Boeing 737 Next Generation airframe. This radar provides 360-degree coverage and allows for simultaneous tracking of airborne and maritime targets. It can operate in all weather conditions, with a maximum range exceeding 600 kilometers in look-up mode. The radar also features an ELINT (Electronic Intelligence) capability with a range of over 850 kilometers at 9,000 meters, as well as integrated Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) capabilities extending up to 300 nautical miles (555.6 km).

F-35B Begins Historic Sea Trials on Japan's JS Kaga in Pacific	According to information published by the US DoD on October 21, 2024, a US F-35B Lightning II aircraft has initiated sea trials aboard the Japanese multi-functional destroyer JS Kaga (DDH-184) in the Eastern Pacific.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japanese Izumo-class aircraft carrier JS Kaga. (Picture source: US DoD) The aircraft, a short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) variant from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Two Three (VX-23), landed on the Kaga’s flight deck on October 20, off the coast of southern California. This milestone represents the first time an F-35B has operated from the Japanese vessel. The trials are part of ongoing efforts to test the integration of the F-35B with Japan's Izumo-class ships, which have undergone extensive modifications to support fixed-wing aircraft operations. Among the key changes made to the JS Kaga are a heat-resistant coating on the flight deck, designed to withstand the extreme temperatures from the F-35B’s vectored thrust engines, the installation of specialized lighting systems to support nighttime operations, and a reshaped bow for improved aircraft maneuverability on deck. The trials are scheduled to last for approximately three weeks, during which the test team will assess the performance of the F-35B under various operational conditions. The deployment of the Kaga began in early September from its homeport in Kure, Japan. Technical data The JS Kaga is a Japanese helicopter carrier with a displacement of 19,500 long tons when empty and up to 27,000 long tons at full load. It has a length of 248 meters, a beam of 38 meters, and a draft of 7.5 meters. Propulsion is provided by a combined gas and gas (COGAG) system, using two shafts driven by four GE/IHI LM2500IEC gas turbines, allowing the ship to exceed speeds of 30 knots. The vessel is equipped with advanced sensor and processing systems, including the OYQ-12 combat direction system, FCS-3 fire control system, OPS-50 AESA radar, OPS-28 surface-search radar, and OQQ-23 bow sonar. Its electronic warfare capabilities are bolstered by the NOLQ-3D-1 electronic warfare suite, Mark 36 SRBOC decoy launchers, an anti-torpedo mobile decoy system, and a floating acoustic jammer (FAJ). For defense, the Kaga is armed with two Phalanx Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWS) and two SeaRAM CIWS. The ship can carry up to seven anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, two search and rescue (SAR) helicopters, and a maximum of 28 aircraft overall.

Australia strengthens Air and Missile Defense with US Agreement	According to information published by the Australian DoD on October 22, 2024, the Albanese Government will bolster Australia’s air and missile defence under a $7 billion agreement with the United States to acquire long-range missiles. This deal will see the Australian Navy equipped with advanced Standard Missile 2 Block IIIC (SM-2 IIIC) and Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Standard Missile‑6. (Picture source: Raytheon) The SM-2 Block IIIC, with its active radar homing technology, offers improved target acquisition and engagement capabilities compared to its predecessors. This missile will likely replace Australia's older SM-2 Block IIIB stock, providing enhanced anti-air warfare (AAW) against advanced aerial threats such as anti-ship missiles and aircraft. The missile can operate without the ship’s continuous radar illumination, giving RAN vessels greater flexibility in multi-target environments. The SM-2 IIIC's extended range of around 167 km (90 nmi) ensures robust protection over a wider area, making it well-suited for fleet and self-defense​. The SM-6, however, takes these capabilities a step further. It is a versatile missile that combines long-range air defense with anti-ship and potentially ballistic missile defense. The SM-6 leverages its ability to connect with external sensors, such as those on F-35 fighters, enabling over-the-horizon targeting. This feature dramatically extends the reach of Australia’s Hobart-class destroyers and future Hunter-class frigates, allowing them to engage threats from farther distances, well beyond their own sensor ranges​. The addition of SM-6 could also provide Australia with a theater-level air defense system, capable of engaging threats like cruise missiles and intermediate-range ballistic missiles​. Technical comments These missiles, part of Australia's Defense Strategy Update and Force Structure Plan, are key to achieving its 'forward defense' doctrine, which aims to deter threats at greater distances from Australia's shores. A primary strategic goal for Australia is to maintain regional stability and protect vital sea lanes, particularly as maritime traffic through the Indo-Pacific underpins much of its trade and energy imports. With growing concerns about China's military expansion, especially in the South China Sea and near Australia’s northern approaches, the ability to counter advanced threats—such as aircraft, cruise missiles, and potentially ballistic missiles—has become critical.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/australia-strengthens-air-and-missile-defense-with-us-agreement	2024-10-22T02:09:36-07:00

India quietly launches fourth nuclear missile submarine amid rising maritime focus	According to information published by Hindustan Times on October 22, 2024, India has launched its fourth nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), codenamed S4*.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of the Arihant-class submarine S4*. (Picture source: Generated by AI) The launch, which occurred on October 16 at the Ship Building Centre (SBC) in Visakhapatnam, was conducted quietly amidst ongoing diplomatic tensions with Canada. The event came just a day after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the Very Low Frequency Naval Station in Telangana, aimed at enhancing command and communications with the Navy's strategic assets. The S4* SSBN is an advanced model in India's Arihant-class submarines, with nearly 75% indigenous content. Equipped with K-4 nuclear ballistic missiles, the submarine significantly enhances India’s strike capability, boasting a range of 3,500 kilometers. This places it well above the earlier INS Arihant, which carries shorter-range K-15 missiles. The S4* is the last of the current class, following the earlier vessels INS Arihant, INS Arighat, and the soon-to-be-commissioned INS Aridhaman. India’s focus on strengthening its SSBN fleet underscores its strategic shift towards undersea nuclear deterrence. Given the vulnerability of surface assets like aircraft carriers to long-range missile systems, particularly those fielded by China’s PLA Navy, nuclear-powered submarines provide a critical edge. The Cabinet Committee on Security recently cleared plans to develop two more nuclear attack submarines. India’s investment in both nuclear and conventional submarine capabilities is poised to play a pivotal role in securing its interests in the Indian Ocean Region. The commissioning of the sixth Kalvari-class diesel-electric submarine, INS Vagsheer, later this year, further underscores this trend. Technical data The Arihant and Arighaat displace around 6,000 tons (5,900 long tons; 6,600 short tons) when surfaced, while the S4 and S4* displace approximately 7,000 tons (6,900 long tons; 7,700 short tons). These submarines also differ in length, with the Arihant and Arighaat measuring 111 meters (364 feet) long, and the S4 stretching to 130 meters (430 feet). All vessels share a beam of 11 meters (36 feet) and a draft of 15 meters (49 feet). Their propulsion system is powered by a single CLWR-B1 pressurized water reactor, delivering 83 MW to a single shaft. This system allows the submarines to reach speeds of 12–15 knots (22–28 km/h) while surfaced, and up to 24 knots (44 km/h) when submerged. The submarines have an unlimited range, restricted only by the need to replenish food supplies, and can dive to a test depth of 450 meters (1,480 feet). Each vessel typically operates with a complement of 95 personnel.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/india-quietly-launches-fourth-nuclear-missile-submarine-amid-rising-maritime-focus	2024-10-22T00:47:14-07:00	
South Korea’s KF-21 and Lockheed Martin’s F-16 shortlisted for Philippines fighter jet contract	The defense market in the Philippines is intensifying as two major competitors, South Korea's KF-21 and the American F-16 from Lockheed Martin, have been shortlisted for the Philippine government’s multirole fighter (MRF) aircraft procurement project. According to an article from The Korea Economic Daily published on October 18, 2024, the KF-21 is considered a strong contender for meeting the Philippines' needs. With an estimated budget of 400 billion Philippine pesos ($6.95 billion), this project aims to address the growing threat China poses in the South China Sea. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Only the KF-21 Boramae from Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and Lockheed Martin's F-16 were shortlisted, setting up a two-way competition (Picture source: KAI/US DOD) The Philippine Air Force launched this project in August, seeking to acquire around 40 multirole fighter jets. In the first phase, a budget of 61.2 billion pesos ($1.1 billion) has been allocated to purchase 10 combat aircraft. Initially, several aircraft were considered, including the Swedish Gripen, the French Rafale, and the European Eurofighter Typhoon. However, only the KF-21 Boramae from Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and Lockheed Martin's F-16 were shortlisted, setting up a two-way competition. The KF-21, South Korea’s first domestically developed fighter, offers advanced technology. This 4.5-generation fighter features partial stealth capabilities, a maximum payload of 7,700 kilograms, and 10 hardpoints for air-to-air missiles and other weapons. With a top speed of 2,200 km/h and a range of 2,900 kilometers, it is equipped with advanced electronic warfare systems such as the AESA radar and is powered by a GE Aerospace F414 engine. The unit cost of the KF-21 is estimated at $71.5 million, around $36.5 million less than its European competitors like the Typhoon or Rafale. The KF-21 Boramae is a 4.5-generation multirole fighter developed by South Korea to replace older models such as the F-4 Phantom II and KF-5E/F in the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF). The project began in the early 2000s and involved several feasibility studies, with international collaboration from Indonesia. The aim of the KF-21 project is to bolster South Korea’s domestic fighter production capabilities and reduce reliance on foreign military technology suppliers. The KF-21 includes several planned variants, such as Block I, Block II, and Block III, along with potential derivatives like the KF-21N (carrier-based version), KF-21EA (electronic warfare variant), and KF-21SA (export version). Block I focuses on air-to-air capabilities, while Block II aims to enhance air-to-ground missions and sensor systems. Block III (KF-21EX) is expected to incorporate more advanced stealth features and integration with unmanned systems. The design of the KF-21 emphasizes reducing its radar cross-section (RCS) and includes provisions for future upgrades, such as full stealth capabilities. The Block I version, scheduled for production between 2024 and 2028, is configured primarily for air-to-air combat with limited air-to-ground capabilities. It features semi-embedded weapons and advanced radar and sensor systems. Forty units are planned for delivery to the ROKAF, with an additional 50 for the Indonesian Air Force. The KF-21’s design includes a delta-wing configuration with canards for improved agility and maneuverability. It also provides for an internal weapons bay in later versions and uses composite materials to reduce weight and optimize performance. Key features include a glass cockpit with a large-area display (LAD) and advanced avionics, such as sensor fusion technology, which integrates data from multiple onboard and external sensors. The aircraft employs a digital Fly-By-Wire (FBW) control system, nonlinear dynamic model inversion control, and safety features such as automatic terrain following and ground collision avoidance systems. It also uses radar-absorbing materials (RAM) and radar-absorbing structures (RAS) to minimize radar visibility. KAI plans to add air-to-ground capabilities by 2028, with mass production of upgraded versions expected to follow (Picture source: KAI) In terms of performance, the KF-21 is powered by the F414-GE-400 engine, providing a thrust-to-weight ratio comparable to the Eurofighter Typhoon. The aircraft is designed for maneuverability, featuring low wing loading and advanced flight control systems to support agility and high-angle-of-attack capabilities. It has a maximum speed of Mach 1.8 and a combat radius of approximately 1,800 kilometers, depending on mission profile and loadout. The KF-21 is equipped with an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, enabling the simultaneous tracking and engagement of multiple targets. This is complemented by an infrared search and track (IRST) system and electro-optical targeting pods (EOTGP) for extended-range aircraft detection and targeting. The avionics suite includes an integrated electronic warfare system with radar warning receivers (RWR), electronic countermeasures (ECM), and countermeasure dispensing systems (CMDS), offering data fusion capabilities to enhance situational awareness and targeting. The KF-21 can carry a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons, including the AIM-9X Sidewinder, AIM-120 AMRAAM, MBDA Meteor, and IRIS-T missiles. It is equipped with 10 external hardpoints, with plans for an internal weapons bay in future versions. Ground-attack capabilities include guided bombs, anti-ship missiles, and various domestically developed munitions, such as the Cheonryong air-launched cruise missile (ALCM). Additionally, the KF-21 is armed with an M61A2 Vulcan cannon for short-range engagements. The F-16’s multirole capabilities make it adaptable to a variety of missions beyond air-to-air combat, including ground-attack roles (Picture source: US DoD) On the other hand, the F-16 has proven its capabilities on the battlefield. Since its debut in 1978, over 4,500 units have been sold to 25 countries, making it one of the most widely sold fighter jets in the world. However, as a fourth-generation fighter, the F-16 lacks the stealth and advanced electronic warfare systems featured in the KF-21. Its price is estimated at $43 million per unit, making it a less expensive option compared to the South Korean fighter. The F-16 Fighting Falcon is known for its versatile air-to-air combat capabilities, combining advanced avionics, radar systems, and a range of precision-guided missiles. One of its notable features is the AN/APG-66(V2) radar, which allows it to track multiple targets simultaneously while providing improved detection range and precision. The F-16 can carry various air-to-air missiles, including the AIM-120 AMRAAM for beyond-visual-range engagements and the AIM-9X Sidewinder for close-range dogfights. With its off-boresight capability, the AIM-9X can lock onto targets from extreme angles, making it highly effective in close combat. This combination of radar-guided and infrared-guided weapons enables the F-16 to dominate both long-range and short-range engagements. The F-16 compensates for its older design with better maneuverability and integrated electronic warfare systems like the Pylon Integrated Dispensing System (PIDS), which deploys countermeasures against radar-guided threats. Its agility, combined with helmet-mounted cueing systems that allow pilots to target enemies by looking at them, gives the F-16 an advantage in close combat. Moreover, the F-16’s multirole capabilities make it adaptable to a variety of missions beyond air-to-air combat, including ground-attack roles. In air-to-air confrontations, its ability to engage multiple targets at different ranges and its integrated defensive measures provide a balanced approach to modern aerial warfare. While the Philippines have shown interest in acquiring the F-16, other factors may influence their decision. The country aims to eventually acquire the F-35, regarded as the most advanced fighter jet in operation. The Philippines may choose the F-16 as a stepping stone toward future F-35 procurement. However, the U.S. government strictly controls the sale of the F-35, and some nations, including the United Arab Emirates and Turkey, have had their requests denied. Korea Aerospace Industries is also leveraging its previous success in military aircraft exports. In 2014, KAI delivered 12 FA-50s to the Philippines and has since provided logistical and military support, including maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services. Similar models have also been sold to countries such as Poland and Malaysia. KAI hopes to build on this success by offering similar services, including system and weapon upgrades for the KF-21, should the Philippines choose to purchase it. Currently, the KF-21 is limited to air-to-air combat. KAI plans to add air-to-ground capabilities by 2028, with mass production of upgraded versions expected to follow. If KAI secures the contract to supply 10 aircraft to the Philippines, it would mark the first export of the KF-21, a significant milestone for South Korea’s defense industry, which aims to become the third-largest arms exporter within the next five years. The KF-21 Boramae is a joint project between South Korea and Indonesia, aimed at developing a next-generation supersonic fighter with homegrown technology for key components. A prototype was unveiled in April 2021, and mass production is expected to begin by the end of this year, with the first delivery to the South Korean Air Force scheduled for the second half of 2026.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/south-koreas-kf-21-and-lockheed-martins-f-16-shortlisted-for-philippines-fighter-jet-contract	2024-10-22T00:24:05-07:00	
Focus | Russia’s war in Ukraine triggers Sweden’s biggest defense investment since Cold War	On October 15, 2024, the Swedish government introduced its defense strategy for 2025–2030. The plan allocates 170 billion SEK (€14.9 billion) for military defense and 35.7 billion SEK (€3.1 billion) for civil defense, aiming to raise defense spending to 2.6% of GDP by 2028. It also includes a gradual increase in conscription, targeting 10,000 conscripts annually by 2030 and up to 12,000 by 2035​.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By 2035, the wartime organization of the Swedish Armed Forces is projected to require approximately 130,000 personnel. (Picture source: Sweden MoD) Sweden’s transition from military neutrality to full NATO membership has evolved over recent years, particularly in response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. This shift in policy represents a significant change from Sweden’s traditional stance, which had prioritized neutrality during the Cold War. Sweden began enhancing its defense posture in 2015 and further increased support to Ukraine after the invasion. As part of its integration into NATO, Sweden has aligned its national defense strategy with collective defense obligations. This transition has involved increasing military readiness, modernizing key systems, and preparing to support NATO operations. The new plan reflects Sweden’s commitment to NATO’s collective security framework. This article examines the details of Sweden's 2025–2030 defense budget, which includes significant investment in military upgrades, expansion of personnel, and improvements across various defense sectors. The strategy aims to strengthen Sweden’s military capabilities and civil defense infrastructure. Since Russia’s invasion, Sweden has provided approximately €4.2 billion of military aid to Ukraine across 17 packages, including systems like Stridsvagn 122 tanks, CV90 IFVs, and Archer self-propelled howitzers. (Picture source: 45oabr) Since Russia’s invasion, Sweden has provided substantial military aid to Ukraine, totaling 48 billion SEK (approximately €4.206.600.000) across 17 packages, including systems like Stridsvagn 122 tanks, CV90 IFVs, and Archer self-propelled howitzers. This experience underscores the importance of maintaining stockpiles and rapidly replenishing donated equipment, which explains why the new defense strategy highlights the need for logistical support in prolonged conflicts. The Swedish government has committed 75 billion SEK (€6.572.812.500) over three years (2024–2026) for military assistance to Ukraine, covering financial donations, soldier training, and procurement through the Defense Materiel Administration. Sweden’s participation in capability coalitions (focusing on drones, maritime security, and demining) further demonstrates its dedication to supporting Ukraine's defense. For Swedish authorities, the conflict also highlights the critical role of civilian defense, emphasizing societal resilience and cyber defense. To protect critical infrastructure, the new defense strategy includes the creation of a national cybersecurity center to counter Russian cyberattacks. Another lesson from Ukraine is the importance of technological adaptability in warfare. Rapid integration of new technologies and modifications to existing systems are seen as crucial. The Ukraine conflict also revealed the high resource consumption associated with intense warfare, particularly in terms of ammunition and other vital supplies. Consequently, Sweden plans to collaborate with the defense industry and government to enhance readiness for innovation, ensuring stockpiles of key materials and systems with long delivery times. Additionally, the strategy recognizes the significance of layered air defense and long-range strike capabilities. The strategy emphasizes improving intelligence, particularly in reconnaissance and surveillance, with the Swedish Air Force set to receive new reconnaissance aircraft. The value of unmanned aerial systems in Ukraine has prompted Sweden to plan for their expanded use in operations to enhance situational awareness and mobility. For instance, this has led BAE Systems Hägglunds and UAV manufacturer Airolit to join forces in integrating autonomous drone surveillance capabilities into the CV90 combat vehicle. The Swedish government also plans to increase the number of conscripts trained for junior leadership roles to strengthen the chain of command and address potential leadership shortages as Sweden expands its defense capacity. (Picture source: Swedish MoD) One of the most critical aspects of Sweden’s defense strategy is the significant expansion of conscription and personnel within the Swedish Armed Forces. By 2035, the wartime organization is projected to require approximately 130,000 personnel. To achieve this, the annual intake of conscripts will gradually increase, with targets of 10,000 conscripts by 2030 and 12,000 between 2032 and 2035. This expansion highlights the government's view that conscription is essential to maintaining the Swedish Armed Forces at a level sufficient for national defense and meeting NATO commitments under Article 3. The government also plans to increase the number of conscripts trained for junior leadership roles to strengthen the chain of command and address potential leadership shortages as Sweden expands its defense capacity. Additionally, a fourth testing center will be established to manage the increased recruitment and testing of conscripts. In line with Sweden's integration into NATO, conscripts may participate in the alliance's collective defense efforts. In an Article 5 scenario, Swedish conscripts could be deployed internationally to support NATO operations. This represents a shift in Sweden’s defense approach, with conscripts expected to contribute to collective defense beyond national borders. The Swedish defense strategy further emphasizes improving the unit turnover system, ensuring operational units remain ready through refresher training exercises. The Total Defense Conscription and Testing Agency will play a key role in reaching the increased conscription targets and preparing the forces for both peacetime and wartime scenarios. Efforts to retain personnel and address current shortages are also part of the strategy. These include increasing the number of professional officers and group leaders, expanding officer training programs, and boosting civilian staffing to free military personnel for tasks requiring specific expertise. By addressing these challenges, Sweden aims to build a defense force capable of fulfilling both national and NATO obligations in the future. Priorities for the Swedish Army include modernizing the CV90 infantry fighting vehicle, acquiring additional combat vehicles and tanks such as the STRV 122 and STRV 123A, and upgrading artillery and air defense systems by 2030.

North Korea Develops Drones Equipped with Reverse-Engineered American Hellfire Missiles	North Korea is intensifying its efforts in military drone development by equipping its unmanned systems with reverse-engineered copies of American Hellfire missiles. This information, shared by Brigadier General Patrick Costello during the 2024 United States Army Association conference, has raised significant concerns in the U.S., particularly regarding the growing threats in the Indo-Pacific region. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft over the Nevada Test and Training Range and fires an Air-to-Ground Missile-114 Hellfire missile on August 30, 2023 (Picture source: US DoD) According to General Costello, North Korea's newly revealed drones not only resemble U.S. models like the MQ-9 Reaper and the RQ-4 Global Hawk, but they are also equipped with missiles modeled after the AGM-114 Hellfire, a guided air-to-surface missile used on U.S. drones. Costello noted that Pyongyang has focused on developing drones that weigh approximately 600 kilograms or less, fitting into the categories of small to medium-sized drones with multirole capabilities. These statements follow North Korea's display of two drones in July 2023, which garnered attention due to their striking resemblance to U.S. models. While the exact capabilities of these drones and their missiles remain unclear, the U.S. military now believes they were developed with some knowledge of American technologies. Videos released by North Korean state media showed one of the drones firing missiles closely resembling the Hellfire, further drawing comparisons in the West. This development comes as the U.S. military braces for the growing threat posed by drones, a phenomenon that has intensified in recent conflicts, particularly in Ukraine. General Costello emphasized that the technological transfers and relationships observed in ongoing conflicts, particularly between North Korea and Russia, warrant close monitoring. Russia, which is engaged in the war in Ukraine, could benefit from North Korea’s new capabilities to bolster its military arsenal. General David Stewart, Director of the Joint Counter-UAS Office, also noted that drone threats have now become an integral part of modern military environments, regardless of the conflict zone. In response, the U.S. Department of Defense has requested a budget of $2.4 billion for unmanned aerial systems in the 2025 fiscal year. Various branches of the U.S. military are also seeking additional funding to develop counter-drone technologies, with an unfunded request for $741 million in this fiscal year alone.

Companies like Anduril, led by Palmer Luckey, have signed multibillion-dollar contracts with U.S. Special Operations Command to provide counter-drone technologies. Recently, the Pentagon awarded the company another $250 million contract for 500 reusable drones and associated jamming technologies. North Korea’s advances in military drones, combined with its progress in missile reverse-engineering, present significant challenges for the U.S. and its allies. Although these North Korean drones are less sophisticated than their American counterparts, they still pose a serious threat in conflict scenarios, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. As the U.S. continues to strengthen its drone defense capabilities, it is becoming evident that mastery of this technology by nations like North Korea could redefine the nature of modern conflicts. U.S. intelligence services recently confirmed the extent of North Korean reverse-engineering during the October 2024 U.S. Army Association conference. At the event, **Business Insider** revealed that North Korea had modeled its Saetbyol-4 and Saetbyol-9 drones after the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-4 Global Hawk. These North Korean drones were first observed during a July 2023 military parade, where one was filmed launching missiles similar to the Hellfire. While it remains unclear how Pyongyang acquired these technologies, U.S. officials suspect espionage or the recovery of parts from conflict zones. This situation is especially concerning as North Korea could potentially share these weapons with Russia, aiding Moscow’s war efforts in Ukraine. Recent reports also suggest that North Korean arms were used in the October 7, 2024, attacks by Hamas, further amplifying concerns that these American drone copies could fall into hostile hands. In addition to drone development, North Korea successfully tested a solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) on January 14, 2024, equipped with a hypersonic warhead. This advancement in ballistic missiles represents a major strategic threat to the U.S., as these missiles are capable of reaching targets such as Guam and are more difficult to intercept due to their rapid launch capability and hypersonic speed. These military advancements are occurring amidst increasing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea has recently taken political steps, such as calling for a constitutional amendment to challenge the status of South Korea as a separate state. Although North Korea asserts it is not seeking war, it also indicates it will not avoid one if necessary. These developments suggest that Pyongyang’s growing military capabilities could further destabilize an already fragile regional situation.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/north-korea-develops-drones-equipped-with-reverse-engineered-american-hellfire-missiles	2024-10-21T06:52:23-07:00
