This unique combination of capabilities gives the V-BAT a versatility that sets it apart from other drones, making it suitable for a wide range of missions, from ISR to precision strikes, without the need for traditional runways or landing zones. Its compact size and ability to carry payloads such as high-definition cameras, radar systems, and precision targeting equipment further enhance its mission flexibility. In contrast to traditional drones, which often struggle with endurance or the need for vast operational spaces, the V-BAT excels in long-endurance, long-duration flights. While most VTOL drones are limited by their battery life and operational time, the V-BAT can remain airborne for up to 12 hours, providing extended operational coverage without frequent recharging or refueling. Its hybrid propulsion system makes this extended endurance possible, which allows it to transition from vertical takeoff to efficient fixed-wing flight once airborne, significantly increasing its range and mission duration. This feature is especially important in contested environments like Ukraine, where long-range, persistent surveillance is essential for real-time intelligence gathering and operational planning. Another key differentiator of the V-BAT is its resilience to electronic warfare (EW). In modern conflicts, electronic warfare has become an increasingly vital tool for adversaries, with systems designed to disrupt communications, degrade GPS signals, and jam drones. Russia has employed sophisticated EW tactics in the ongoing war, seeking to neutralize Ukrainian drone capabilities. The V-BAT, however, is engineered to operate autonomously in GPS-denied environments and continue its mission even in the face of signal jamming or spoofing. This capability is crucial for Ukrainian forces, as it allows them to maintain persistent ISR operations without being vulnerable to EW threats. The V-BAT’s ability to function effectively in such conditions enhances its survivability and ensures that it remains an indispensable asset in any modern conflict. In the broader context of the war in Ukraine, where drones have already proven to be pivotal in intelligence, surveillance, and targeted strikes, the V-BAT's unique attributes offer Ukrainian forces a significant edge. Drones have been instrumental for Ukraine in neutralizing Russian supply lines, destroying military hardware, and pinpointing targets for artillery strikes. However, the challenge of EW remains a persistent threat. The V-BAT’s demonstrated ability to maintain functionality despite GPS and communications disruption could allow Ukrainian forces to operate with greater freedom and efficacy in these contested environments. As electronic warfare becomes an increasingly central aspect of modern military strategy, the importance of drones like the V-BAT cannot be underestimated. These drones provide tactical intelligence, precision targeting, and the autonomy to operate independently without reliance on vulnerable communication and navigation systems. In a conflict like the one in Ukraine, where technological supremacy can often determine the course of a battle, having autonomous systems that can endure in electronic warfare environments represents a significant advantage. The successful mission of the V-BAT drone in Ukraine is more than just a technical achievement—it signals a shift toward a more autonomous, resilient, and adaptable battlefield. As militaries around the world continue to face new and evolving threats, drones like the V-BAT are poised to become the backbone of modern warfare, reshaping how intelligence is gathered, how targets are identified, and how strikes are executed. With its combination of endurance, versatility, and resistance to electronic disruptions, the V-BAT offers a glimpse into the future of drone warfare, where the ability to operate in complex and contested environments could prove decisive in future conflicts. Shield AI’s V-BAT drone has demonstrated that resilience, autonomy, and endurance are the critical traits of the next generation of military drones. As the war in Ukraine has shown, drones are now at the forefront of modern warfare, and the V-BAT’s unique capabilities provide Ukrainian forces with a powerful tool for countering Russian electronic warfare and maintaining operational superiority. In the evolving landscape of global defense technology, the V-BAT sets a new standard for what is possible in unmanned aerial systems, marking a pivotal moment in integrating drones into modern military strategy.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-us-shield-ai-v-bat-vtol-aerial-drone-demonstrates-resilience-against-electronic-warfare-in-ukraine	2025-01-12T05:06:00-08:00

Each of these missiles plays a crucial role in Iran’s military strategy, acting as both a deterrent and an offensive tool in its arsenal The Emad missile is a long-range liquid-fueled missile developed by Iran’s Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO). It is known for its advanced precision guidance system, which allows it to strike targets with remarkable accuracy—within a few hundred meters. With a range of approximately 1,700 kilometers, the Emad is capable of targeting strategic locations throughout the Middle East, including U.S. military bases and allied nations. This missile is capable of carrying both conventional and potentially nuclear payloads, though Iran insists its missile program remains focused on conventional defense. The Emad's high maneuverability and sophisticated guidance make it a formidable weapon, enhancing Iran's ability to launch precise strikes and complicating interception by missile defense systems. The Qadr is an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) that extends Iran's strike capabilities to targets beyond its immediate borders. With a range of 1,800 to 2,000 kilometers, the Qadr missile is capable of striking regional targets, including military bases and key infrastructure across the Middle East. An evolution of the earlier Shahab-3, the Qadr offers enhanced accuracy, payload capacity, and range. This missile can be equipped with both conventional warheads—such as high-explosive or chemical payloads—and potentially nuclear warheads. Its liquid-fuel propulsion provides flexibility in payload capacity but requires more preparation time compared to solid-fueled missiles. Despite this, the Qadr's advanced guidance and control systems make it a highly reliable and potent weapon for long-range precision strikes. The Qiam is a short-to-medium range ballistic missile that distinguishes itself with its solid-fuel propulsion system and advanced inertial navigation. With a range of 800 to 1,000 kilometers, the Qiam is designed for precise, rapid strikes against regional targets. Unlike the Emad and Qadr, the Qiam missile’s compact design and solid fuel enable faster preparation and launch, providing operational flexibility. It is capable of carrying both conventional and potentially nuclear warheads, and its high accuracy—with a reported targeting error of less than 500 meters—makes it ideal for hitting critical infrastructure such as air defense systems and command centers. The Qiam’s mobility and quick-launch capability make it particularly effective in asymmetric warfare scenarios, where speed and unpredictability are crucial. The decision to house these advanced missile systems in an underground facility underscores the importance of ensuring the survivability of Iran’s strategic assets. The facility provides protection from potential airstrikes, which have long been a threat to Iran's missile and nuclear infrastructure, particularly from Israel and the United States. By storing missiles underground, Iran secures its missile capabilities, ensuring they remain operational even in the event of a large-scale conflict. The subterranean base also complicates any preemptive strike attempts, as the full scope of Iran’s missile network remains difficult to assess. Moreover, the underground facility enhances the strategic depth of Iran’s missile deterrence. In an era of advanced surveillance technologies, such as satellites and reconnaissance drones, underground storage ensures that Iran's missile assets remain hidden and protected. This, in turn, increases the survivability of its missiles, making them harder to detect and neutralize. The unveiling of this underground missile facility signals a growing sophistication in Iran’s missile capabilities and its commitment to a self-sufficient defense posture. These missiles—Emad, Qadr, and Qiam—represent key components of Iran’s broader strategy to project power and deter foreign intervention in the Middle East. With a combination of long-range, precision-guided systems and advanced propulsion technologies, Iran’s missile arsenal significantly strengthens its ability to strike critical targets across the region. For regional neighbors and global powers, particularly the U.S. and Israel, this development presents a renewed challenge to existing defense strategies. Iran’s growing missile capabilities, along with the protective measures taken to safeguard them, contribute to an increasingly complex security landscape. As tensions persist in the region, this new underground facility serves as both a message of strength and a reminder of the evolving balance of power in the Middle East. The underground missile facility housing Iran's Emad, Qadr, and Qiam systems is a key development in the country’s missile program. With their increased range, accuracy, and survivability, these missile systems contribute to Iran’s deterrence capabilities and bolster its position in the regional security environment. This development will undoubtedly have significant implications for the security dynamics of the Middle East, influencing defense policies and shaping the strategies of both regional and global powers.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-iran-unveils-underground-missile-facility-housing-advanced-ballistic-systems	2025-01-11T06:16:16-08:00

(Picture source: Wikimedia) This move comes as Iran continues to bolster its defense posture amid escalating tensions with Israel and ongoing concerns about its nuclear program. Rahimzadeh emphasized that both army and IRGC (Islamic Revolution Guards Corps) air defense units have been deployed near critical sites such as Natanz, enhancing their ability to detect and neutralize aerial threats. The air defense systems in place reportedly include new and advanced technologies, reflecting the country's determination to safeguard its sensitive nuclear infrastructure. The Natanz facility, a cornerstone of Iran's uranium enrichment program, has long been a focal point of international contention due to concerns over its potential role in the development of nuclear weapons. Iran's air defense upgrades signal its increasing focus on protecting such facilities and its broader preparedness for aerial challenges amid the complex security landscape. Rahimzadeh also stated that the air defense measures are part of a wider national strategy, with upcoming exercises planned to strengthen the country’s air defense capabilities. These drills will be conducted under the command of the integrated air defense network, an initiative designed to consolidate and enhance the effectiveness of Iran’s military and defensive resources. On January 8, 2025, the Defense Mirror website reported that Iran had ramped up its defense posture by conducting large-scale military exercises to protect its nuclear sites. These exercises come amid growing concerns over Israel's military stance and its potential for action against Iran’s nuclear facilities. Israel, which has consistently voiced its opposition to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, is said to be preparing for a military strike, fearing that Iran’s nuclear program could eventually lead to the development of nuclear weapons. The perceived threat from Iran’s nuclear program has been compounded by its ongoing support for Houthi rebels in Yemen, whose missile and drone attacks on Israel have heightened security concerns in Tel Aviv. These attacks have been attributed to Iranian assistance to the Houthi group, further fueling Israel’s fears of an expanding nuclear threat. In this context, Israeli defense officials are reportedly considering military action against Iran's nuclear infrastructure, with a sense of urgency mounting ahead of the upcoming change in the U.S. presidency. In October 2024, Israel conducted airstrikes against Iranian missile-production sites around Tehran. These strikes targeted key facilities, including the Parchin military complex, the Khojir military base, the Shahrud missile site, and a factory in the Shamsabad Industrial Zone. These attacks were seen as part of Israel's broader strategy to disrupt Iran's missile development and its nuclear capabilities. The airstrikes are believed to have been a direct response to what Israel perceives as a growing threat from Iran’s expanding missile and nuclear programs. The threat of an Israeli military response has been compounded by uncertainties surrounding the new U.S. administration, as President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office in January 2025. Israeli officials fear that Trump may prioritize diplomatic engagement with Iran over military action, which has created a sense of urgency in Tel Aviv to neutralize what it views as an existential threat before the transition of power. Iran's nuclear program has been a point of contention for over two decades, with the country maintaining that its nuclear activities are intended solely for peaceful purposes, such as energy production. However, the international community, particularly Israel and Western powers, has expressed concerns that Iran's nuclear ambitions could ultimately result in the development of nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has monitored Iran’s nuclear activities, issuing reports that have raised questions about Tehran’s compliance with international agreements. Despite the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), designed to limit Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, tensions have remained high, especially following the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement in 2018. Since then, Iran has resumed some of its nuclear enrichment activities, increasing uranium enrichment levels beyond the limits set by the JCPOA. These developments have sparked renewed concern from the international community, with the United Nations and the European Union calling for greater transparency and accountability in Iran’s nuclear program. In the face of these growing concerns, Iran has invested heavily in its defense systems, particularly air defense, to protect its nuclear facilities from external threats. This includes the deployment of advanced missile defense systems around sensitive sites like Natanz. By enhancing its military capabilities, Iran seeks to send a clear message about its resolve to maintain its nuclear sovereignty, despite the international pressure to curtail its nuclear program. The strategic considerations of regional powers like Israel and global players like the United States further complicate the situation surrounding Iran’s nuclear program. The potential for military confrontation remains high, with Israel reportedly preparing for the possibility of an attack on Iran's nuclear sites. The trajectory of this crisis will largely depend on the actions of key stakeholders, including the new U.S. administration under President Trump, Israel’s military strategy, and Iran’s willingness to engage in further diplomacy or continue its nuclear activities. As Iran continues to strengthen its defenses and conduct military exercises to safeguard its nuclear infrastructure, the risk of an escalation in the region remains significant. The potential for a military confrontation, especially between Israel and Iran, could have far-reaching implications not only for the Middle East but for global security as a whole. With the situation continuing to evolve, the international community must closely monitor developments in Iran's nuclear program and its military posture, while also considering diplomatic efforts to prevent further escalation.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-iran-deploys-new-air-defense-systems-to-protect-nuclear-facility-amid-threat-of-israeli-airstrikes	2025-01-10T09:09:30-08:00	
US Defense Secretary Announces Continued US Military Presence in Syria to Combat Terrorist Group ISIS	On January 8, 2025, according to information released by the Associated Press (AP), U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed that U.S. troops will remain in Syria as part of ongoing efforts to prevent the Islamic State (ISIS) from reconstituting itself.

This troop level represents a significant increase, with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) reporting a surge of about 1,100 troops compared to previous estimates. This increase reflects the evolving security challenges faced by U.S. forces in Syria, particularly as ISIS remnants continue to pose a threat. Despite suffering major territorial defeats in recent years, ISIS remains active in insurgent operations, and military officials continue to express concerns about the group’s potential to regroup and escalate its activities in the region. Secretary Austin’s statement reflects the Biden administration's commitment to supporting regional partners and ensuring that ISIS does not regain its former strength. The decision to maintain this increased troop presence is driven by the ongoing instability in Syria's northeast, where ISIS continues to exploit a fractured political and military landscape. The group, while no longer holding large swaths of territory, remains capable of conducting attacks and insurgent operations, making it essential for U.S. forces to maintain a presence to disrupt these efforts and provide security for local populations. Secretary Austin's remarks highlight the importance of the mission, which not only targets ISIS but also works in concert with local forces and international partners to bring stability to the region. The Pentagon has also reassured the public that U.S. military operations in Syria will continue despite potential fiscal challenges. On December 19, 2024, U.S. Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder issued a statement confirming that even if a partial government shutdown were to occur, military missions abroad, including those in Syria, would remain unaffected. This reflects the Pentagon’s priority to maintain critical security operations in the region, particularly in light of the persistent threats posed by ISIS and other terrorist organizations. The operational readiness of U.S. forces in Syria is vital, as instability in the region could have far-reaching implications for U.S. interests in the Middle East. As part of CJTF-OIR, U.S. forces continue to collaborate with local Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces, as well as international coalition partners, to ensure that ISIS is defeated and that regional stability is supported. The ongoing U.S. commitment to the mission demonstrates the broader strategic importance of the region to U.S. national security. In addition to the personnel deployed in Syria, the U.S. military maintains a robust presence of advanced combat equipment to support its mission. According to images released by the U.S. DoD in December 2024, U.S. soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division are stationed in Syria, equipped with a variety of combat vehicles to aid in operations. These include Bradley M2A3 Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs) and M-ATV MRAPs (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles), which are critical for both offensive and defensive operations in the region's challenging terrain. The Bradley M2A3 IFVs, known for their firepower and mobility, are highly effective in urban combat scenarios, providing essential support to local partner forces on the ground. These vehicles are designed to engage enemy forces in complex environments, offering enhanced capabilities for infantry support and protection. On the other hand, the M-ATV MRAPs are specially designed to withstand the threat of roadside bombs and ambushes, a constant danger in areas where insurgent tactics, such as mines and IEDs, remain prevalent. These armored vehicles ensure the safety of U.S. personnel and enable the forces to carry out their missions with greater security and effectiveness. The presence of such advanced military equipment highlights the ongoing need for a well-equipped and highly capable force in Syria. The U.S. Army’s deployment is part of a broader strategy to apply sustained pressure on ISIS while providing support to local forces and ensuring the safety of local populations affected by the prolonged conflict. These military assets underscore the U.S. commitment to ensuring that its forces can operate in some of the most dangerous and unstable regions in the world. As the situation in Syria remains fluid, U.S. military officials continue to monitor developments closely. U.S. Secretary Austin’s announcement indicates the long-term nature of the U.S. mission in Syria, emphasizing that the United States and its allies are determined to ensure ISIS does not rebuild its caliphate. The U.S. military presence in Syria is expected to evolve in response to the changing security environment, but the overarching goal of countering ISIS and supporting regional partners remains unchanged. The strategic importance of Syria in the fight against terrorism means that U.S. forces are likely to maintain a significant footprint in the region for the foreseeable future. This presence is essential for combating ISIS and navigating the broader geopolitical challenges that continue to shape U.S. defense priorities in the Middle East. In the coming months, U.S. forces in Syria will face ongoing challenges, both in combating terrorist cells and navigating the complex political landscape of Syria and its neighbors. However, the core mission of ensuring that ISIS is permanently defeated remains a central priority for the U.S. military. This commitment, alongside efforts to maintain regional stability and support local populations, reflects the broader U.S. strategy to protect national security interests and contribute to international peacekeeping and counterterrorism efforts in a region that continues to bear the scars of decades of conflict.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-defense-secretary-announces-continued-us-military-presence-in-syria-to-combat-terrorist-group-isis	2025-01-10T08:22:04-08:00	
Syria Blocks Russian Evacuation Ship Sparta II at Strategic Tartus Port	According to information published by UAWire on January 10, 2025, Russia’s evacuation of military assets from Syria has hit a critical roadblock, as the cargo ship Sparta II has been denied access to the port of Tartus by the country’s new authorities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian cargo ship Sparta II remains stranded off the Syrian coast as new authorities deny port access, stalling Moscow's evacuation of military assets from Tartus. (Picture source: OBL) This development follows a regime change in Syria that saw the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, casting uncertainty over Russia’s future in the region. The ship, which arrived off the Syrian coast on January 5 after departing Russia’s Kaliningrad region in December, remains adrift as negotiations falter. The Tartus port, home to Russia’s only naval base outside its borders, is a linchpin in Moscow’s regional strategy. However, the vessel’s controversial history, including prior sanction-listed activities such as transporting military equipment from Crimea to Syria, has likely contributed to the denial. This impasse has effectively stalled Russian evacuation efforts, forcing reliance on alternative routes, such as air operations through Khmeimim airbase, to withdraw personnel and smaller assets. Satellite imagery has revealed an extensive buildup of Russian military equipment at Tartus, including dismantled air defense radar systems and over 100 trucks staged for removal. Despite this readiness, no ships are currently docked at the port to load these assets, leaving significant resources stranded. The lack of maritime access underscores the severity of the challenge facing Moscow as it attempts to recalibrate its presence in Syria. The broader geopolitical context further complicates the situation. Russia’s withdrawal of its fleet from Tartus in December followed the rapid advance of Syrian rebels toward Damascus, signaling a major shift in the country’s power dynamics. The overthrow of Assad’s regime has prompted Moscow to engage in negotiations with the new authorities to secure its remaining footholds in Syria, particularly the Tartus naval base and Khmeimim airbase. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has confirmed these talks, highlighting the strategic importance of these installations to Russia’s influence in the region. Meanwhile, international attention on the situation has intensified. A U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft has been deployed to monitor the Sparta II and broader developments in the Mediterranean, reflecting heightened interest in the implications of Russia’s repositioning. The vessel’s continued delay adds to the uncertainty, amplifying concerns over Russia’s ability to protect and extract its military assets under shifting regional dynamics.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/syria-blocks-russian-evacuation-ship-sparta-ii-at-strategic-tartus-port	2025-01-10T07:55:15-08:00	
Analysis: Croatia Enhances Air Power Capabilities with French Rafale Fighter Jets Replacing Soviet-made MiG-21	In December 2024, Croatia’s air defense capabilities took a monumental leap forward with the arrival of eight French Dassault Rafale fighter jets at the 'Colonel Marko Živković' barracks in Pleso, marking the largest and most significant strategic project in the history of the Croatian Air Force. This milestone is part of Croatia’s ongoing effort to modernize its military assets and align more closely with NATO standards, positioning the country as a stronger, more capable member of the alliance.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Croatia’s Air Force strengthens its capabilities with the acquisition of French Dassault Rafale jets, marking a new era of modernization and NATO integration. (Picture source: Croatia MoD) The Rafale program follows the signing of a major defense contract in 2022, when Croatia finalized an agreement with France to purchase a fleet of 12 Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft. The deal, valued at approximately €999 million, was a crucial step in Croatia’s broader military modernization strategy. The contract also includes comprehensive training programs for Croatian pilots and maintenance personnel, as well as logistical and technical support to ensure the aircraft's long-term operational readiness. This agreement was a part of Croatia’s effort to replace its aging fleet of MiG-21 fighter jets, which had been in service since the early 1990s. Croatia’s decision to purchase the Rafale jets was driven by the need for a more modern, capable fighter to meet the growing security challenges in Europe. After considering a variety of options, including the Swedish Gripen and American F-16, the Croatian government selected the Rafale due to its multirole capabilities, advanced avionics, and proven combat performance. The French government, in turn, supported Croatia's acquisition of the Rafale, reinforcing the strategic partnership between the two nations within NATO. The purchase is seen as a significant step in enhancing Croatia’s air defense capabilities and aligning its military forces with NATO’s evolving standards. The Rafale’s advanced radar and electronic warfare systems, coupled with its versatility in both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat, offer Croatia enhanced capabilities that are vital in contemporary security environments. The first batch of Rafale aircraft arrived in Croatia in April 2024, with the full fleet expected to be operational by 2025. This modernization is not just a leap in terms of technology, but also in strategic importance. By equipping its air force with one of the most advanced fighter jets in the world, Croatia is enhancing both its defensive and offensive capabilities. The Rafale is equipped with state-of-the-art radar and electronic warfare systems, giving it a technological edge that far surpasses the MiG-21s, which have long been outclassed in terms of performance. The Rafale program signifies the replacement of the aging MiG-21 fleet, which has served as the backbone of the Croatian Air Force for decades, notably during the Croatian War of Independence (1991-1995). The MiG-21s were instrumental in the formation of Croatia's air force, as the nation had no official air combat capability at the beginning of the conflict. Over time, a fleet of MiG-21s was acquired, playing a pivotal role in reconnaissance, air superiority, and close air support missions. Despite challenges with limited resources and spare parts, these aircraft were critical in the country's struggle for independence. Croatia replaces its MiG-21, in service since the 1990s, with French Rafale fighter jets to enhance air defense capabilities. (Picture source Wikimedia) By the time Croatia joined NATO in 2009, the MiG-21s had undergone several upgrades, including improved avionics, to meet the alliance’s interoperability standards. However, as the MiG-21 fleet aged and its operational limitations became more apparent, it became clear that the aircraft could no longer provide the level of performance needed to support Croatia’s growing defense requirements. Consequently, the Croatian government set in motion a process to replace the MiG-21s with modern, advanced fighter jets capable of performing a wide range of missions in line with NATO expectations. The MiG-21 was designed in the 1950s and has remained in service with various countries well beyond its intended lifespan. While it served as a reliable platform during the Croatian War of Independence, its capabilities have become increasingly outdated in the context of modern aerial warfare. The MiG-21 is limited in terms of payload capacity, radar and avionics sophistication, and operational range. Additionally, its single-engine design and older airframe technology provide reduced survivability compared to modern fighter jets.The Rafale, on the other hand, represents a significant leap in air combat capabilities. With a maximum speed of Mach 1.8, a range of 3,700 km, and a ceiling of 15,240 meters, the Rafale can operate in a variety of roles, including air superiority, ground attack, reconnaissance, and nuclear deterrence. Its advanced radar system, the Thales RBE2 AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, provides superior tracking, targeting, and situational awareness, far exceeding the radar systems available on the MiG-21. The Rafale is also equipped with electronic warfare capabilities and can carry a much wider array of modern, precision-guided weapons, including air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground munitions, and a range of bombs. One of the key advantages of the Rafale over the MiG-21 is its multirole flexibility. The MiG-21 was primarily designed as a lightweight interceptor and was only adapted for ground attack missions later in its service life. In contrast, the Rafale was built from the ground up as a multirole platform, capable of seamlessly transitioning between different combat missions without compromising performance.

Greek frigate Hydra quietly deploys to Red Sea with upgraded anti-drone system amid Meko modernization debate	According to information published by Christian Mazanitis on January 10, 2025, the Greek frigate HYDRA has quietly set sail for the Red Sea, embarking on its fourth mission in the region to join Operation ASPIDES.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Hellenic Navy's Hydra-class frigate Hydra in April 2024. (Picture source: European Union) This European Union-led mission aims to protect maritime trade routes from terrorist threats, particularly those posed by Yemen's Houthi rebels. Unlike its previous deployments, the HYDRA’s departure from the Salamis Naval Base was marked by an unusual lack of ceremony, with no formal send-off by the Chief of the Hellenic Navy General Staff, Vice Admiral Dimitrios-Eleftherios Katarras, or any public announcement from the Navy’s press office. The deployment comes nearly a year after the frigate’s last mission in the Red Sea, but with a key upgrade: the installation of an advanced anti-drone system, KENTAVROS. This domestically developed system builds on lessons learned from the frigate’s earlier encounters with Houthi drone attacks, including a close call with a kamikaze drone during its first mission. The KENTAVROS system, first installed on the frigate PSARA and later on SPETSAI, now equips the HYDRA for a more robust response to emerging aerial threats. Despite its operational importance, the HYDRA’s deployment highlights the urgent need for modernization of Greece's four MEKO-class frigates. Commissioned in 1992, the HYDRA is now 33 years old, operating with outdated electronics from the 1980s. Successive delays in modernization efforts have left the frigates struggling to match contemporary naval threats. Initially, the cost of upgrading the MEKO-class ships was projected at €1 billion, including new weapons systems under a U.S. Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) proposal four years ago. That proposal faced backlash and was shelved in favor of acquiring FDI Belharra frigates, which were celebrated as a game-changer for the Hellenic Navy. However, escalating costs and emerging security demands have forced a reconsideration of the MEKO upgrade program. The latest reports suggest a scaled-down modernization plan with a 60% cost reduction, capping expenses at €100 million per ship, or €400 million for the entire fleet. This 'surface-level' modernization will focus on installing the KENTAVROS anti-drone system across all four frigates, alongside upgraded radar systems for improved threat detection. While these upgrades aim to extend the ships' operational life by 10 to 12 years, they fall short of comprehensive overhauls. The MEKO-class frigates are expected to assume secondary roles behind the newly acquired FDI Belharra ships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/greek-frigate-hydra-quietly-deploys-to-red-sea-with-upgraded-anti-drone-system-amid-meko-modernization-debate	2025-01-10T01:01:37-08:00

Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Initial doubts in August 2024 about Pyongyang's reported production of 250 launchers in the Rodong Sinmun have been alleviated by recent indications of significant progress in their deployment (Picture source: KCNA) Kang Dae-sik, a member of South Korea’s National Defense Committee, revealed that the intelligence agency is closely monitoring the situation in coordination with Washington. During a press briefing, Colonel Lee Sung-jun, spokesperson for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed that North Korea’s military activities are under careful observation. While there were initial doubts in August 2024 about the production of the 250 launchers reported by Pyongyang in its Rodong Sinmun newspaper, recent months appear to show substantial progress in their deployment. The Hwasong-11D, a short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), is central to North Korea's tactical arsenal. Officially introduced in the early 2020s and operational since 2023, the missile is designed for precision strikes on high-value targets. Featuring advanced guidance systems, potentially integrating inertial and radar technologies, it is optimized for accuracy and maneuverability. The missile measures approximately 7.5 meters in length, weighs 3,000 kilograms, and has an estimated range of 300 to 400 kilometers. It is equipped to carry conventional or nuclear payloads of 500 to 700 kilograms. Deployed via TEL vehicles on a 6x6 chassis, the system ensures rapid mobility and flexible deployment, enhancing its operational effectiveness.

This high altitude capability provides the KIZILELMA with an advantageous position for both surveillance and strike operations, making it a formidable asset in controlling air superiority. The KIZILELMA is equipped with cutting-edge autonomous flight capabilities, allowing it to operate without the need for direct human intervention in hostile environments. Its ability to perform automated takeoff, flight, and landing adds to its versatility and reduces the risk to personnel. Furthermore, its advanced sensors, including electro-optical/infrared cameras and radar systems, enable it to perform precise targeting, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, even in adverse weather conditions. The introduction of the KIZILELMA UCAV is significant not only for its technological innovations but also for the geopolitical implications it carries. As Turkey seeks to deepen its defense ties with countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia, the KIZILELMA provides a powerful tool for enhancing military capabilities across the region. The UCAV is expected to play a pivotal role in deterrence and defense strategies, especially in areas facing security challenges from extremist groups or foreign interventions. The KIZILELMA is part of a broader trend in modern warfare, where unmanned systems are taking on increasingly prominent roles. As traditional fighter jets become more expensive to operate and maintain, drones like the KIZILELMA offer an attractive alternative for nations seeking to modernize their military fleets without the prohibitive costs of manned aircraft. Furthermore, the use of UCAVs reduces the risk to human lives, especially in high-risk operations, while maintaining a high level of combat effectiveness. With its impressive specifications, such as its 1.5-ton payload, 8.5-ton maximum take-off weight, 0.9 Mach maximum speed, and 500 nautical mile (926 km) combat radius, the KIZILELMA is poised to become a game-changer for countries seeking to modernize their air forces. Its advanced autonomous flight capabilities, combined with a substantial 4+ hour endurance and operational altitude of 25,000 feet (7,620 meters), make it an incredibly versatile and lethal weapon system. As Turkey’s defense exports continue to grow, the KIZILELMA is likely to play a central role in reshaping the defense capabilities of the Ummah and beyond, enhancing regional security and solidifying Turkey’s position as a key player in the global defense market.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/tuerkiyes-kizilelma-ucav-with-supersonic-speed-and-1-5-ton-payload-enters-serial-production	2025-01-09T02:17:44-08:00	
US Congress Warns of Rising Costs and Challenges in US Navy's 2025 Shipbuilding Plan	According to information published by the US Gov on January 6, 2025, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released its analysis of the U.S. Navy’s ambitious 2025 Shipbuilding Plan, highlighting significant increases in costs and challenges in execution. The plan envisions a modernized fleet to address evolving maritime threats, but the financial and logistical demands underscore the scale of the undertaking.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Virginia-class submarine USS Texas at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. (Picture source: US DoD) The Navy aims to expand its current fleet of 295 battle force ships to 390 by 2054, while also integrating 134 unmanned surface and undersea vessels. However, the fleet is expected to shrink in the near term, dropping to 283 ships by 2027 due to planned retirements before rebounding in subsequent years. This strategy aligns with the Navy’s Distributed Maritime Operations concept, which emphasizes spreading offensive and defensive capabilities across a larger number of platforms. The costs of implementing the 2025 plan are projected to average $40.1 billion annually, adjusted for inflation, over the next three decades. This represents a 46 percent increase compared to the Navy’s recent funding levels. The CBO’s projections are significantly higher than the Navy’s estimates, reflecting differing assumptions about labor, materials, and inflation trends in shipbuilding. For example, the CBO estimates the cost of Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines and Ford-class aircraft carriers will be billions more than the Navy projects. Challenges within the shipbuilding industrial base compound the difficulties of meeting the Navy’s goals. Shipyard production rates have slowed dramatically, with construction times for destroyers and submarines extending to nearly a decade. Labor shortages and an aging supplier base further complicate efforts, particularly as shipyards face increasing demands for complex vessels like nuclear-powered submarines. To address these issues, the Navy has committed $10 billion to improve the submarine industrial base, including investments in workforce development and infrastructure. The plan also emphasizes the construction of six Ford-class carriers to replace aging Nimitz-class vessels, a continued investment in attack submarines, and the development of next-generation destroyers and smaller combatants. However, delays in new ship classes and cost overruns could impact the Navy’s ability to meet its long-term objectives. For example, the introduction of the next-generation attack submarine has been postponed to 2040, while production rates for the Virginia-class submarines have not yet met planned targets. While the Navy’s focus on unmanned systems signals a strategic pivot toward future warfare, these platforms remain largely in the development phase, with unclear costs and capabilities. The integration of unmanned vessels into the fleet will be critical to achieving the Navy’s vision of a hybrid force, but questions remain about the technological readiness and operational role of these systems. The CBO’s analysis serves as a sobering reminder of the challenges inherent in such an ambitious plan. The envisioned fleet reflects the Navy’s response to growing geopolitical threats, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, but the realization of this vision will require careful navigation of fiscal constraints, industrial limitations, and strategic priorities. As Congress reviews the 2025 Shipbuilding Plan, the balance between ambition and feasibility will be a focal point. The decisions made in the coming years will shape the future of the U.S. Navy.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/us-congress-warns-of-rising-costs-and-challenges-in-us-navys-2025-shipbuilding-plan	2025-01-09T01:58:31-08:00	
UAE could transfer up to 30 Mirage 2000-9E fighter jets to Morocco with France’s consent	On January 8, 2025, LeDesk reported that discussions are progressing on a possible transfer of 30 Mirage 2000-9E fighter jets from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Morocco, contingent upon France’s agreement. According to Emirati sources, Abu Dhabi could cede half of its Mirage 2000-9E fleet to the Royal Moroccan Air Force (RMAF) once the UAE begins receiving deliveries of Rafale F4 jets from Paris, scheduled for 2027.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Emirati sources state that the cession of 30 Mirage 2000-9E aircraft was not confirmed in April but could be endorsed soon, as the UAE’s decision depends partly on the timeline for its new fighter acquisitions. (Picture source: Army Recognition) This prospect was initially deemed unlikely four years ago, but it has gained momentum following the visit of Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita to France in April 2024, along with reports mentioning King Mohammed VI’s private stay in Abu Dhabi. A three-year suspension initially delayed the Mirage sale, mostly because the original 1998 contract stipulates that any transfer of these aircraft requires French consent for re-export. The potential transfer of Emirati Mirage 2000-9 aircraft to Morocco gained additional attention when the French government reportedly explored the option of buying back some UAE Mirages to provide them to Ukraine. This requirement complicated the transaction, but the UAE’s preference leaned toward selling part of its fleet, with 30 Mirage 2000-9s intended for Morocco and a portion for Egypt. While an agreement in principle appears to exist, no official statements have confirmed the final steps, delivery schedule, or upgrade packages. Emirati sources state that the cession of 30 Mirage 2000-9E aircraft was not confirmed in April of the previous year but could be endorsed soon, as the UAE’s decision depends partly on the timeline for its new fighter acquisitions. Abu Dhabi signed a significant contract with France in December 2021 for 80 Rafale F4 jets and 12 military helicopters, valued at about $18 billion, marking the largest international order for Rafale fighters since their introduction in 2004. With the UAE set to retire some Mirage 2000-9s in favor of the Rafale F4, several countries, including Iraq, Greece, Egypt, and Morocco, have been mentioned in discussions about receiving secondhand Mirage 2000s. On the Moroccan side, the RMAF currently operates around two-dozen upgraded Mirage F-1MF2000 aircraft, about two-dozen F-5s, and approximately two-dozen F-16C/D Block 52+ fighters. Morocco has also ordered an additional 25 F-16C/D Block 72 jets for delivery between late 2025 and 2027 and has been mentioned as potentially becoming the first Arab and African country to acquire the F-35 Lightning II from the United States. As reported on January 8, 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense may finalize a deal for 32 F-35 fighters for Morocco, with an estimated cost exceeding $17 billion over 45 years, including procurement and maintenance. If concluded, this acquisition would introduce fifth-generation capabilities to the RMAF, which analysts believe is motivated by Morocco’s rivalry with Algeria, especially concerning Western Sahara. Algeria has reportedly signed a contract for 14 Russian Su-57 fighters, complementing Su-30MKA and Su-35 jets in its inventory. This purchase is part of a broader effort in Algiers to maintain what it perceives as a necessary regional balance. Diplomatic friction persists between Morocco and Algeria, particularly following the 2021 severing of ties and ongoing disagreements over Western Sahara and the Polisario Front. Originally designed to offer an upgrade over the Mirage 2000-5, the 2000-9 includes a digital autopilot, advanced electronic warfare systems, and a cockpit arrangement similar in some respects to that of the Rafale. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Meanwhile, the presence of Emirati Mirage 2000-9s in different theaters has drawn scrutiny from various governments. On July 24, 2024, at least seven Emirati Mirage 2000-9DAD/EAD fighter-bombers were deployed to a People’s Liberation Army Air Force base in Xinjiang province, China, for the Falcon Shield 2024 exercise. Supported by C-17A Globemaster III transports and an A330 MRTT tanker, the UAE contingent cooperated with Chinese forces for the second consecutive edition of these drills. Analysts in the United States expressed concern that Beijing could gain insights into Western aviation technology through such interactions. UAE-China defense cooperation has already produced tensions, with the suspension in 2021 of negotiations to sell 50 F-35 Lightning II fighters to Abu Dhabi, reportedly due to disagreements over technical requirements, cost issues, and concerns about Chinese involvement in UAE military affairs. The UAE Air Force, which also operates over 70 F-16 Block 60 fighters of American origin, has thus diversified its fleet with Western and Chinese systems, including Hongdu L-15 trainers and Wing Loong drones. The Mirage 2000-9 is based on Dassault’s Mirage 2000 design, featuring an advanced modular avionics architecture, a single Snecma M53-P2 turbofan engine, and a delta-wing configuration. Its technical enhancements include the RDY-2 or RBY-2 radar, integration of MICA air-to-air missiles, and capacity for precision-guided munitions such as the Shehan (or Shehab) laser-designation pod, guided bombs, and the Black Shaheen cruise missile, which is the export version of the SCALP-EG. Originally designed to offer an upgrade over the Mirage 2000-5, the 2000-9 includes a digital autopilot, advanced electronic warfare systems, and a cockpit arrangement similar in some respects to that of the Rafale. Historical records indicate that 62 Mirage 2000-9s were ordered new or upgraded from older Mirage 2000 airframes in the UAE’s previous contracts. Enhanced maintenance and modernization work have been carried out since 2019, through deals signed by Dassault Aviation, Thales, and MBDA, extending the service life of these aircraft into the 2030s. The Mirage 2000-9 possesses a maximum speed of 920 knots, a wingspan of 9.1 meters, a height of 5.2 meters, a length of 14.4 meters, a maximum payload of 6,300 kilograms, and a maximum takeoff weight of 17,000 kilograms. The aircraft is powered by a single Snecma M53-P2 turbofan delivering 9,990 kgf with afterburner. Its RDY-2 radar allows both air-to-air and air-to-surface operations, with maximum detection ranges cited at more than 140 kilometers. The model’s armament options include MICA EM and IR missiles, up to 2,000-liter drop tanks, the Black Shaheen cruise missile, laser-guided bombs such as the BGL-1000, and other guided weapons, often linked to Thales or MBDA systems for targeting and electronic warfare. Maintenance and upgrade programs have involved not only Dassault but also engine manufacturer Snecma (now Safran) and electronics firms such as Thales, Smiths, Elettronica, and others. Powered by a single Snecma M53-P2 turbofan delivering 9,990 kgf with afterburner, the Mirage 2000-9 possesses a maximum speed of 1,700 km/h, a maximum payload of 6,300 kilograms, and a maximum takeoff weight of 17,000 kilograms. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The Dassault Mirage 2000 itself was developed in the 1970s to replace older Mirage III fighters in French service. The single-engine, delta-wing Mirage 2000 first flew in March 1978, eventually evolving into multiple variants, including the Mirage 2000C, the nuclear-oriented Mirage 2000N, and the Mirage 2000D specialized in conventional strikes. The 2000-5 introduced enhancements for multirole operations, while the 2000-9 for the UAE included more sophisticated avionics, radar upgrades, and an expanded suite of weapons. Dassault’s official literature also highlighted the aircraft’s modular avionics design, improved digital flight controls, high maneuverability, and multiple weapons integrations. Over 600 Mirage 2000s of all variants were produced, entering service in countries such as France, the UAE, India, Greece, Taiwan, Egypt, Peru, Qatar, and Brazil. Some have been retired in favor of newer platforms like the Rafale or F-16, but others remain in active service with regular upgrades. The Dassault Mirage 2000’s historical backdrop includes extensive use by the French Air Force in NATO missions and various operations. The type served in the Gulf War, the Bosnian conflict, and over Kosovo. It was also deployed in Afghanistan, with the Mirage 2000D variant performing precision strikes in conjunction with Allied forces. France continues to operate the Mirage 2000-5 and Mirage 2000D, though it has gradually introduced the Rafale to replace older models. In 2011, French Mirage 2000s participated in operations over Libya. More recently, France committed aircraft to combat the Islamic State group, though some have been replaced by newer Rafales. Discussions arose in 2024 regarding Mirage 2000s and the possibility of sending them to Ukraine, but no official confirmation came from France’s Ministry of Defense despite inquiries. In other nations, including India, the Mirage 2000 saw notable use in the 1999 Kargil conflict and ongoing modernization. India’s fleet is designated the Vajra and has undergone an upgrade to near-2000-5 levels, with new radars, weapons, and electronic warfare suites. Other operators such as Greece, Taiwan, Qatar, Egypt, and Peru either still deploy the Mirage 2000 or have done so in recent decades, occasionally pursuing local upgrades or additional weapon integrations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/uae-could-transfer-up-to-30-mirage-2000-9e-fighter-jets-to-morocco-with-frances-consent	2025-01-09T01:49:23-08:00	
Exclusive: US Lockheed Martin's X-59 Achieves Key Afterburner Test Milestone in Quiet Supersonic Aviation Revolution	According to a video published by Lockheed Martin on December 29, 2024, the company's groundbreaking X-59 aircraft has successfully conducted afterburner tests, marking a significant milestone in the quest for quiet supersonic aviation. These tests demonstrate the X-59's capability to operate at supersonic speeds while maintaining a relatively low sonic boom, a key goal of the Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST) program. Lockheed Martin, in collaboration with NASA, is developing the X-59 as part of an effort to break through the barriers that currently prevent commercial supersonic flight over land due to noise concerns.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Lockheed Martin X-59 aircraft undergoes afterburner testing, marking a pivotal moment in its development as part of the Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST) program. (Picture source Lockheed Martin) The afterburner test phase is a crucial component of the X-59's broader performance evaluation, as it assesses the aircraft's ability to accelerate to supersonic speeds with minimal environmental impact. The afterburner itself is a key technology used in supersonic and hypersonic aircraft, adding fuel to the exhaust stream after combustion to generate additional thrust, often resulting in higher speeds. The X-59’s design, however, incorporates advanced modifications to its afterburner system aimed at minimizing the loud sonic boom typically associated with supersonic flight. This test is a critical step toward Lockheed Martin’s and NASA’s goal of achieving a breakthrough in supersonic travel that could lead to a future where commercial airlines are capable of flying faster than the speed of sound without producing the disruptive sonic booms that have historically been a deterrent for passengers and communities on the ground. The X-59, as part of the QueSST program, has been designed with a sleek, long fuselage and a unique tail configuration that allow it to cut through the air more efficiently, reducing shockwaves that normally result in the loud 'boom' heard when conventional supersonic aircraft break the sound barrier. As part of the ongoing testing process, the X-59 has been undergoing a series of engine runs, structural tests, and evaluations of its aerodynamics and acoustic emissions. The aircraft's design features, including its elongated nose and specialized engine nacelles, are specifically optimized to reduce the intensity of the sonic boom to a mere 'sonic thump' that would be barely noticeable to people on the ground. Lockheed Martin’s video provides a glimpse into the rigorous testing process that has been conducted, including capturing the afterburner ignition and the aircraft’s ability to maintain supersonic speeds while producing significantly lower noise levels. The successful completion of the afterburner tests is seen as a major leap forward for the X-59 program, bringing the aircraft closer to its next phase of testing, which will involve flight tests at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center. There, engineers and researchers will conduct supersonic flight tests over a series of designated test sites, collecting data on the aircraft's acoustic emissions and evaluating the community’s reaction to the reduced sonic boom. If these tests prove successful, the X-59 could pave the way for commercial supersonic flights over land in the near future. The development of the X-59 is particularly timely as the global aviation industry has been exploring ways to reduce travel times and improve efficiency in air travel, with supersonic transport offering the potential for significantly faster journeys. The aircraft’s success could ultimately lead to a new generation of supersonic jets capable of operating within the confines of modern noise regulations, potentially revolutionizing air travel. Lockheed Martin has expressed its commitment to continuing the testing phase in close collaboration with NASA, with the ultimate goal of certifying the X-59 for commercial use. Should the project succeed, it could open the door for future supersonic transport aircraft that are quieter, more efficient, and capable of dramatically shortening flight times on long-haul routes. Beyond its commercial prospects, the X-59's innovative design and advanced technologies also hold significant potential for military applications. The aircraft's ability to fly at supersonic speeds while minimizing the sonic boom could be a game-changer for military operations, especially in reconnaissance, strike missions, and rapid response scenarios. Traditional supersonic military aircraft, such as the Concorde-based supersonic bombers or fighter jets, generate substantial noise when breaking the sound barrier, often alerting adversaries to their presence. The X-59's reduced sonic signature would enable military forces to conduct high-speed operations without the usual warning signs, offering enhanced stealth and surprise. Furthermore, its ability to maintain supersonic speeds over long distances without compromising operational efficiency could make it an ideal platform for rapid strategic deployment, long-range reconnaissance, or even covert strikes. These capabilities, combined with its potential to reduce flight time across vast areas, could transform modern military operations, providing forces with a significant edge in both conventional and asymmetric warfare environments. This latest development highlights the increasing strides being made in the field of supersonic aviation, as aerospace companies work toward creating faster, quieter, and more sustainable aircraft to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving aviation market. With the afterburner tests now completed, the X-59 is one step closer to changing the way the world travels by air, while also expanding its potential for military operations on a global scale.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/exclusive-us-lockheed-martins-x-59-achieves-key-afterburner-test-milestone-in-quiet-supersonic-aviation-revolution	2025-01-09T01:39:51-08:00

Analysis: Why Donald Trump wants Greenland for US missile defense and rare earth supplies	On January 8, 2025, the BBC reported that Donald Trump reaffirmed his intention for the United States to acquire Greenland, emphasizing its importance for national security and economic interests. Trump did not rule out using military or economic measures to pursue this objective, highlighting Greenland's strategic significance for Arctic defense and resource extraction. Greenland’s leadership, supported by Denmark, strongly rejected the proposal, reiterating that the territory is not for sale and emphasizing the principle of self-determination.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The M1A2 SEP V3 Abrams tank integrates advanced systems that require rare earth elements for components like electronics, sensors, and communication systems, though the specific rare earths involved are not publicly detailed. (Picture source: US DoD) Donald Trump's renewed interest in acquiring Greenland is driven by its strategic military significance and abundant natural resources. Greenland's location in the Arctic is pivotal for national security, hosting the Pituffik Space Base, a crucial element of the U.S. missile early warning system. Additionally, the island's vast reserves of minerals, including rare earth elements, present substantial economic opportunities. Trump views acquiring Greenland as essential for countering geopolitical rivals like Russia and China, who are increasing their presence in the Arctic region. The United States has shown interest in Greenland since 1867, when Secretary of State William H. Seward explored purchasing both Greenland and Iceland, though Congress opposed the idea. After World War II, in 1946, the U.S. offered Denmark $100 million in gold bars for Greenland, citing military necessity, but Denmark declined. During the Cold War, the U.S. established the Thule Air Base in Greenland, underscoring the island's strategic importance. Trump's recent proposals echo these historical attempts, emphasizing both security and economic factors. Reactions to Trump's proposal have been predominantly negative. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen dismissed the idea as unrealistic, stating that Greenland is not for sale. Greenland's Prime Minister Múte Egede reiterated that the island is not on the market, emphasizing Greenland's autonomy and the importance of self-determination. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also rejected the notion, stressing the need to respect allies' sovereignty. These responses reflect a consensus that Greenland's future should be determined by its inhabitants, rather than external actors. The discussion surrounding Greenland is tied to the importance of critical raw materials (CRMs), including rare earth elements. These materials are essential for manufacturing technologies such as smartphones, electric vehicles, and renewable energy systems, as well as defense systems. CRMs are categorized by their economic value and their unique properties, which are often irreplaceable in high-tech applications, coupled with their limited availability and the complexities associated with their extraction and processing. For instance, the European Union identified 34 such materials in its latest 2024 Critical Raw Materials Act. More importantly, such materials are vital for the production of most modern military vehicles, which require specific CRMs for structural, electronic, and propulsion components. Greenland's location in the Arctic is pivotal for national security, hosting the Pituffik Space Base, a crucial element of the U.S. missile early warning system. (Picture source: US DoD) For example, critical raw materials (CRMs) are essential to producing tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, such as the Swedish-made CV90. Infantry fighting vehicles heavily rely on aluminum for structural components and graphite for electronic systems, ensuring functionality under diverse operational conditions. Beryllium is used in connectors and onboard electronics due to its lightweight and conductive properties. Titanium and iron/steel are employed for armor and propulsion systems, with the latter providing durability and structural strength. Copper supports communication systems, while tungsten enhances precision-guided mechanisms and armament effectiveness. Fighter aircraft, like the American F-16 and F-35, require a broad array of CRMs due to their high-performance demands. Aluminum and graphite are key for airframes, including the body, wings, and tail, due to their lightweight and strength. Titanium is widely used in propulsion systems, including turbines and nozzles, for its heat resistance and strength. Copper is applied in electro-optical and control systems, while nickel is used in airframes and propulsion systems for heat resistance. Rare earth elements such as neodymium and dysprosium enable advanced avionics and control systems. Borates and gallium are crucial for radar, sensors, and electronic warfare systems, highlighting the reliance on materials with specific electromagnetic properties. Warships depend on a narrower but critical set of materials. Aluminum is used for decks, superstructures, and propulsion shafts, while titanium and iron/steel form the hulls and structural reinforcements for their corrosion resistance and strength. Copper supports propulsion systems and onboard electrical components. Lithium and silver are utilized in battery technologies for submarines and torpedoes, enabling energy storage and propulsion. Nickel and cobalt are integral to electronic systems, navigation radars, and sonar, providing reliability in marine environments. These materials collectively ensure the vessels' operational effectiveness in various naval scenarios. China leads the global production of rare earth elements, accounting for 69% of output in 2023, with a mine production of approximately 240,000 metric tons. The United States produced 43,000 metric tons (12.3% of global production), followed by Myanmar (38,000 metric tons), Australia (18,000 metric tons), Thailand, India, and Russia in smaller quantities. China also dominates refining and processing capabilities, which are critical for transforming raw materials into usable components for high-tech and defense industries. In December 2023, China imposed an export ban on rare earth extraction and separation technologies, citing national security concerns. The ban aimed to preserve China's technological edge and limit other nations' ability to achieve independence in this sector. Additional measures in 2024 included production and export quotas aimed at preserving domestic supplies for priority industries. China has declared rare earth resources state-owned and has used export restrictions in trade negotiations and geopolitical disputes, solidifying its influence over global supply chains. The U.S. defense industry heavily relies on Chinese rare earth materials, which constitute approximately 80% of the supply used in defense systems. The embargo affects the production of technologies such as F-35 fighter jets, which require rare earth magnets, creating risks of supply chain disruptions, delays in manufacturing, and increased costs. To address this, the U.S. is exploring alternative sources and increasing domestic investment in rare earth production to reduce dependency and strengthen supply chain resilience. Donald Trump's latest announcements on Greenland, while seemingly extreme, may therefore seem logical from a purely strategic point of view.

Exclusive: Ukrainian F-16 Fighter Jet Pilot Sets Historic Record by Destroying Six Missiles in a Single Mission	According to a report published on January 7, 2025, by the Air Force Command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, a Ukrainian pilot flying an F-16 Fighting Falcon has achieved a remarkable feat by destroying six enemy cruise missiles in a single combat mission. This historic achievement occurred during a massive missile and drone attack in December 2024, marking a milestone in the F-16’s capability to engage and eliminate high-speed missile threats.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Archive image: A Ukrainian pilot in front of an F-16 Fighting Falcon donated by Ukraine's international allies. (Picture source: Social Network) The Ukrainian pilot successfully intercepted and destroyed four cruise missiles using the F-16’s air-to-air missiles (AAMs) and then proceeded to eliminate two more missiles using the M61 Vulcan cannon. The F-16’s radar systems, including the AN/APG-68 radar, proved crucial in tracking the fast-moving missile targets, even those equipped with electronic countermeasures (REBs). This made the mission not only historically significant but also a testament to the high skill of the Ukrainian pilot and the versatile nature of the F-16 as a missile defense platform. While the Ukrainian F-16 pilot’s success is unprecedented, other F-16 pilots have also engaged in missile interception missions in previous combat scenarios, offering valuable insight into the aircraft’s ability to neutralize aerial threats. During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, F-16s were used to intercept and destroy Iraqi Scud missiles, though their success in directly destroying these missiles was limited. F-16s were primarily tasked with striking missile launchers and air defense systems, but they also worked in tandem with Patriot missile defense systems to counter ballistic missile threats. The AIM-7 Sparrow missiles and radar systems on the F-16 allowed for some interception capabilities against the low-flying Scud missiles. This mission highlighted the F-16’s adaptability in missile defense operations, even in high-risk scenarios. Similarly, during Operation Allied Force in 1999, F-16s were integral in the broader NATO missile defense strategy, which involved targeting and neutralizing Serbian missile launchers and air defense sites. While the F-16 was not directly involved in intercepting incoming missiles, it provided essential offensive strikes against missile launch sites that posed significant threats to NATO aircraft. F-16 pilots contributed to air superiority by eliminating missile systems and supporting the overall missile defense efforts. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) has extensive experience in missile defense operations, including using the F-16 to engage airborne missile threats. During the Second Lebanon War in 2006, Israeli F-16s were involved in countering Katyusha rockets and other short-range missiles fired by Hezbollah. Though the F-16 did not directly intercept these rockets with its cannon or air-to-air missiles, it played a critical role in eliminating missile launch sites and providing surveillance, which allowed other defense systems like the Iron Dome to neutralize the threats. The F-16’s precision strikes and close air support proved to be vital in controlling the airspace and eliminating missile launch points. In Turkey, during the Syrian Civil War, Turkey’s F-16s were actively used in countering ballistic missile threats from Syria. While Patriot missile systems served as the primary missile defense, F-16s were tasked with surveillance and offensive strikes against missile launchers and ground-based missile systems. These missions further demonstrated the F-16’s versatility in dealing with missile threats, often working in conjunction with other air defense systems to provide comprehensive protection. The M61 Vulcan cannon mounted on the F-16 is a 6-barrel, 20mm rotary cannon capable of firing at 6,000 rounds per minute. While it is commonly used in close-range dogfights and against aerial targets like enemy aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), its application against missiles is extremely rare and highly challenging. The cannon’s high rate of fire and short-range effectiveness make it a difficult tool to use against fast-moving missiles, which often require precise tracking and engagement at very close distances—typically under 500 meters. In the case of the Ukrainian pilot’s mission, the M61 Vulcan was used against two incoming cruise missiles, which required the pilot to close the distance and engage the target with great precision. While the primary method of missile interception in the F-16 is through air-to-air missiles (AAMs) like the AIM-120 AMRAAM, the cannon proved useful in situations where close-range engagement was necessary, especially in scenarios where the aircraft's missiles had already been expended or the threat was in the final stages of approach. The historic achievement by the Ukrainian F-16 pilot in destroying six missiles in one mission is a significant moment in the evolution of missile defense using F-16s. The aircraft’s radar systems, air-to-air missiles, and M61 Vulcan cannon allow for a range of interception options against high-speed aerial threats, from cruise missiles to ballistic projectiles. The experiences of other F-16 pilots in past combat situations, including the U.S., Israel, and Turkey, further highlight the fighter's versatility in missile defense roles, whether in directly destroying missiles or supporting broader air defense strategies. The success of the Ukrainian F-16 pilot underscores the growing capabilities of the F-16 Fighting Falcon in modern warfare, particularly in high-intensity conflicts where missile threats are increasingly sophisticated. With continued training, technology upgrades, and combat experience, the F-16 is proving to be a formidable weapon in the global fight against missile proliferation and aerial threats.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/exclusive-ukrainian-f-16-fighter-jet-pilot-sets-historic-record-by-destroying-six-missiles-in-a-single-mission	2025-01-08T03:11:10-08:00	
Development of Combat UAVs in Japan Through Strategic Partnership with Boeing	Boeing Japan, a subsidiary of the American aerospace multinational Boeing, secured a contract on December 10, 2024, with Japan's Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics Agency (ATLA) to conduct research and simulation testing on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) designed to operate alongside manned aircraft. This initiative aligns with Japan's strategy to develop advanced technologies aimed at enhancing its military capabilities in autonomous systems and collaborative combat. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The XQ-58A Valkyrie is an unmanned combat aerial vehicle designed by Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions for the U.S. Air Force's unmanned combat air vehicle program (Picture source: US DoD) Signed on October 18, 2024, for an amount of 155,177,000 JPY, approximately 1 million USD, this contract represents a significant step in Japan’s efforts to integrate UAVs into its military operations. ATLA explained that Boeing Japan was uniquely positioned to carry out this project due to its exclusive access to the required simulation software, along with the necessary technical resources and expertise. Japan's interest in combat UAVs is not a recent development. As early as December 2022, the Ministry of Defense (JMOD) announced plans to develop 'combat support UAVs' capable of collaborating with manned aircraft. These efforts are also part of the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), a joint initiative between Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom to develop a next-generation fighter aircraft. In December 2023, JMOD also signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to conduct research on artificial intelligence for UAVs to ensure seamless integration with Japan's future fighter jets. The concept of collaborative UAVs, often referred to as 'loyal wingman' or 'collaborative combat aircraft' (CCA), aims to create autonomous drones capable of supporting manned aircraft in a range of missions, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic warfare, and combat operations. One prominent example is Boeing Australia's MQ-28 Ghost Bat, a multi-role UAV developed for the Royal Australian Air Force. Designed as a 'force multiplier,' the Ghost Bat features advanced artificial intelligence and a modular nose section that can be customized to meet specific operational requirements. In July 2024, it was announced that Australia’s Ghost Bats would prioritize ISR capabilities over weapon systems, partially due to Boeing's unsuccessful bid for an autonomous combat jet program in the United States. Nevertheless, the Ghost Bat remains a viable candidate for Japan’s combat support UAV program, given its adaptability and role in multi-domain missions. Japan is also pursuing additional UAV development independently. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is working on two collaborative UAV concepts: one focused on tactical combat and another aimed at supporting manned aircraft operations. Both are being designed to integrate with the GCAP next-generation fighter, underscoring Japan’s commitment to incorporating cutting-edge technologies into its defense systems. In parallel with Boeing Japan's research, ATLA continues to explore other initiatives to advance autonomous capabilities. This month, the agency issued public bids for the development of stealth UAVs for aerial refueling and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) designed for explosive handling and mine countermeasures. The outcomes of Boeing Japan's simulation tests will play a crucial role in shaping ATLA and JMOD’s decisions on selecting UAVs that best align with Japan's defense requirements. These efforts reflect the country’s focus on modernizing its military through international partnerships and autonomous technological advancements. This contract between Boeing Japan and ATLA highlights a pivotal moment in Japan’s development of autonomous military capabilities. As the country invests in collaborative technologies for its future aircraft, partnerships with nations like the United States emphasize the importance of a strategic approach to addressing evolving defense challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/development-of-combat-uavs-in-japan-through-strategic-partnership-with-boeing	2025-01-08T02:30:36-08:00	
Lithuania Strengthens Its Drone Capabilities with New UAV Acquisitions from United States	Lithuania continues its commitment to enhancing its defense capabilities with recent acquisitions from the United States, including advanced manpack radios and small uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV). These agreements, signed by the Defence Materiel Agency (DMA) under the Ministry of National Defence, represent an investment in modernizing the Lithuanian Armed Forces. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Illustration photo issued by the Lithuanian Ministry of Defense. (Picture source: Lithuanian MoD) One of the key acquisitions involves a set of L3Harris manpack radios, valued at approximately 25 million dollars. These advanced communication systems will be integrated into Lithuania’s Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV) and Vilkas Infantry Fighting Vehicles, providing enhanced communication capabilities for troops in the field. L3Harris radios are considered among the most advanced in their category, ensuring that the Lithuanian forces will have reliable and efficient communication technology. In addition to the radios, Lithuania secured a contract for the acquisition of a small UAS from the U.S. manufacturer AeroVironment Inc., a leader in uncrewed aerial systems. Worth 7.8 million dollars, this deal focuses on vertical take-off drones designed for fire control and adjustment tasks. These systems will be integrated with the Switchblade 600 combat drones, also acquired from the U.S. government. The UAS is scheduled for delivery by the end of 2025, with plans for future supplementation to further strengthen Lithuania's drone capabilities. AeroVironment offers several UAS (uncrewed aerial systems) models that could match the description given in the release, particularly vertical take-off drones for fire control and adjustment tasks. Here are some of the AeroVironment UAS models that could potentially be part of this acquisition. The Wasp AE is a tactical medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) drone designed to offer surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and it is capable of vertical takeoff using a launch ramp. Although it is larger than smaller UAS, it could be suitable for fire control tasks due to its surveillance capabilities and endurance. The Puma 3 AE is a small drone designed for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. It is capable of vertical takeoff and landing and is used for tactical missions, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. This model could be a good candidate for fire control and adjustment tasks, although it is lighter and designed for shorter missions.

This model is particularly useful for hard-to-access areas, which could make it an interesting option for fire control support missions. Lithuania’s growing acquisitions from the United States reflect its strengthening defense posture in the Baltic region. With a mid-term procurement plan valued at 1.3 billion dollars, the country has become the largest purchaser of U.S. weaponry among the Baltic states, accounting for approximately 20% of its military acquisitions. Among the systems acquired are Javelin anti-tank missiles, JLTV vehicles, Black Hawk helicopters, HINARS, AMRAAM for medium-range NASAMS, and Switchblade drones, all contributing to the modernization of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. These acquisitions are part of Lithuania's broader defense strategy to improve its operational capabilities and strengthen regional security in an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/lithuania-strengthens-its-drone-capabilities-with-new-uav-acquisitions-from-united-states	2025-01-08T02:29:24-08:00	
Morocco could soon become the first Arab nation to acquire US-made F-35 stealth fighter jets	According to Identité Juive on November 22, 2024, Morocco is reportedly progressing toward becoming the first Arab and African country to acquire F-35 stealth fighter jets from the United States. The U.S. Department of Defense is expected to finalize an agreement for the delivery of 32 F-35 Lightning IIs, at an estimated cost exceeding $17 billion over 45 years, covering both procurement and maintenance. If confirmed, this acquisition would expand the Royal Moroccan Air Force’s inventory, which is currently centered on fourth-generation F-16 aircraft.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In a hypothetical aerial engagement between Algeria's Su-57 and Morocco's F-35 fighter jets, the Su-57's agility could provide an advantage in close-range combat, while the F-35's stealth and sensor capabilities may allow it to detect and engage the Su-57 at a greater distance before being detected. (Picture source: US DoD) To date, Arab African nations show mixed outcomes regarding the acquisition of F-35 fighter jets. Türkiye ordered 30 F-35As, with plans for up to 100, but purchases were halted in 2020 due to U.S. sanctions over Türkiye’s procurement of the Russian S-400 missile system. Four jets were delivered but remain withheld at Luke Air Force Base, and the U.S. stated in February 2024 that Türkiye could be readmitted to the F-35 program if it resolves the S-400 issue. The United Arab Emirates signed a deal in January 2021 for 50 F-35s as part of a $23 billion arms package, but in December 2021, the UAE unilaterally suspended the agreement, citing technical requirements, sovereign operational restrictions, and cost concerns. A senior UAE official indicated in September 2024 that discussions with the U.S. over the F-35 are not expected to resume. Qatar expressed interest in the F-35 in 2020, but U.S. policy to maintain Israel's qualitative military edge has prevented progress. Saudi Arabia has shown interest in the F-35 since 2012 but has not advanced toward an agreement, with obstacles including U.S. concerns about regional stability, human rights issues, and Israel’s military edge, leading to the potential acquisition of 100 Turkish KAAN fighters. Regarding Morocco, negotiations for the deal reportedly took place between 2020 and 2022, with Morocco seeking Israel’s assistance to facilitate discussions with U.S. authorities. A meeting in November 2021 between Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Moroccan Defense Minister Abdellatif Loudiyi is cited as instrumental in advancing these negotiations. Rising tensions with Algeria—particularly regarding the Western Sahara conflict and Algeria’s support for the Polisario Front—are considered major factors driving Morocco’s interest in these aircraft. Algeria’s acquisition of Russian Su-57 stealth fighters has also reportedly influenced Morocco's decision. Algeria is reported to have signed a contract for the acquisition of 14 Su-57 fighter jets from Russia as part of a broader military agreement that includes Su-34 and Su-35 aircraft. The Su-57, designated as a fifth-generation stealth fighter, incorporates features such as reduced radar cross-section, advanced avionics, and enhanced maneuverability. This reported procurement would add to Algeria's existing fleet of Su-30MKA and Su-35 aircraft, reflecting its effort to modernize its air force. If the agreement is implemented, Algeria could become the first country outside Russia to receive the Su-57. This acquisition aligns with Algeria’s strategy to maintain a regional military balance with Morocco amid ongoing tensions over Western Sahara. Algeria’s potential acquisition of the Su-57 is considered a significant factor influencing Morocco’s decision to modernize its forces with a comparable or superior fifth-generation stealth fighter, such as the F-35. (Picture source: Russian social media) Since Morocco annexed the region in 1975, Algeria has supported the Polisario Front, which advocates for Western Sahara’s independence, by providing political backing and hosting Sahrawi refugees. Algeria frames this support as consistent with its regional policies and anti-colonial stance. Morocco claims Western Sahara as part of its territory and has proposed limited autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. Diplomatic relations between the two countries worsened in August 2021, when Algeria severed ties with Morocco, citing what it called 'hostile actions' related to the conflict. Morocco’s interest in the F-35 is therefore part of a broader effort to strengthen its defense capabilities in collaboration with Western allies, including the United States and Israel. This effort also includes acquisitions such as AH-64E Apache helicopters, M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks, Bradley armored vehicles, and MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones. The F-35 was prominently featured at the 7th Marrakech Air Show, held from October 30 to November 2, 2024, under the High Patronage of King Mohammed VI and with the support of the Royal Moroccan Air Force. The event showcased over 300 exhibitors and hosted 100 international delegations. Morocco also displayed its first Boeing AH-64E Apache helicopter at the event, part of an order for 24 units currently in production. In a hypothetical aerial engagement between Algeria's Su-57 and Morocco's F-35 fighter jets, several factors would determine the outcome. The Su-57 is a fifth-generation stealth aircraft designed by Russia, capable of achieving speeds over Mach 2 and equipped with thrust-vectoring engines for enhanced maneuverability. The F-35, developed by the United States, prioritizes stealth and advanced avionics, with a low radar cross-section and integrated sensor fusion for improved situational awareness. The Su-57's agility could provide an advantage in close-range combat, while the F-35's stealth and sensor capabilities may allow it to detect and engage the Su-57 at a greater distance before being detected. This balance suggests that the F-35 could hold an advantage in beyond-visual-range scenarios, depending on the operational context and pilot expertise. The potential acquisition of Su-57 fighter jets by Algeria and F-35 aircraft by Morocco could shift the military balance in North Africa. Algeria's interest in the Su-57 appears aimed at countering Morocco's existing fleet of F-16s and its potential procurement of F-35s, raising the likelihood of a regional arms race. This development might prompt neighboring countries, such as Spain, to reassess their defense strategies, including the possible acquisition of F-35s to maintain strategic balance. The introduction of these advanced aircraft could impact the military equilibrium, increase tensions, and influence diplomatic relations within the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/morocco-could-soon-become-the-first-arab-nation-to-acquire-us-made-f-35-stealth-fighter-jets	2025-01-08T02:05:30-08:00	
Rafale Fighter Jets and Barracuda Submarines Propel French Arms Sales in 2024	After a year marked by a decline in orders in 2023, France’s defense industrial and technological base (BITD) achieved significant growth in 2024, with exports reaching €18 billion. This performance underscores the strategic importance of arms exports for the French economy and national sovereignty, while also highlighting the inherent volatility of the sector. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link These results were driven by key platforms, including Rafale fighter jets, with significant contracts signed with Indonesia and Serbia, as well as Black Sword Barracuda submarines, four of which were ordered by the Netherlands (Picture source: Naval Group) In 2023, orders amounted to €8.2 billion, a modest figure compared to the €27 billion recorded in 2022. Although this decline was disappointing, the Ministry of the Armed Forces emphasized that annual fluctuations are largely influenced by the signing of major contracts. Notably, the global context remained favorable, with military expenditures reaching a record $2.443 trillion, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). In 2024, the French defense industry rebounded strongly, with exports exceeding €18 billion. During a speech delivered at the Invalides courtyard on January 7, Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu described 2024 as the 'second-best year in our history,' surpassing the €14 billion achieved in 2016. These results were driven by key platforms, including Rafale fighter jets, with significant contracts signed with Indonesia and Serbia, as well as Black Sword Barracuda submarines, four of which were ordered by the Netherlands. Despite these achievements, the minister emphasized the need to sustain efforts, pointing to promising prospects for 2025. Among them, he confirmed the sale of 14 Caracal helicopters to Iraq, though this figure raises questions. In September, Baghdad had announced a contract for 12 H225M Caracals, suggesting a potential additional order, though no further details have been provided. Looking ahead, Lecornu outlined priorities that include surface ships, particularly defense and intervention frigates, submarines, radars, artillery systems, helicopters, and Rafale jets. He also highlighted the strategic importance of the next-generation SAMP/T medium-range ground-based air defense system, designed to counter increasing ballistic threats, particularly from Iran and Russia. The minister reiterated that arms exports are critical for the BITD. Beyond supporting the trade balance and generating employment across France, they ensure national sovereignty by sustaining an industrial model developed in the 1960s. The results achieved in 2024 reflect the resilience and adaptability of the French defense industry. However, maintaining this momentum requires continued vigilance, particularly in a global context of evolving military expenditures and strategic challenges. With major opportunities already emerging, 2025 has the potential to further consolidate France’s position as a global leader in arms exports.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/rafale-fighter-jets-and-barracuda-submarines-propel-french-arms-sales-in-2024	2025-01-08T01:53:54-08:00

This move also represents the country’s efforts to strengthen its defense autonomy and its complex geopolitical position, balancing its relations with both Eastern and Western powers. Türkiye's acquisition of the S-400 system, finalized in 2017 after a failed attempt to obtain the U.S. Patriot system, has long been a point of friction in its relations with the United States and NATO. The $2.5 billion deal was partly motivated by Turkey’s desire for technology transfer and local production capabilities, which were not included in the U.S. Patriot offer. In contrast, the Russian offer allowed Turkey to access both the system and the possibility of locally producing similar technologies. Despite international opposition, including Türkiye's exclusion from the F-35 program and subsequent sanctions, the acquisition of the S-400 is seen by Ankara as essential to strengthening national defense. Türkiye's deployment of four S-400 batteries in strategic locations, including the southern border with Syria, is designed to protect critical infrastructure and strengthen air defense against regional aerial threats. As Türkiye continues to integrate the S-400 into its defense framework, it also signals a broader shift in its relations with NATO. The visit of NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to TUSAŞ, the Turkish aerospace company responsible for the development of the KAAN fighter jet, underscores the growing cooperation between Türkiye and the alliance. The integration of advanced defense technologies, such as the S-400, strengthens Turkey's position within NATO while contributing to the alliance's collective defense capabilities. Looking ahead, the S-400 system is expected to become a key element of Türkiye's air defense strategy, providing the country with a robust capability to counter a wide range of aerial threats. Its range of up to 400 kilometers makes it an indispensable tool for defending the geographically complex region Turkey occupies. The ongoing development of Turkey's multi-layered defense network, which includes the S-400, the SIPER system, and other technologies, will enhance its deterrence capabilities and solidify its defense posture in the face of evolving threats. Defense Minister Hulusi Akar summed up Türkiye's position by stating: 'Türkiye will continue investing in advanced technologies and protecting its national security, regardless of external pressures.' This commitment to strengthening its defense infrastructure through the integration of systems like the S-400 reinforces Türkiye's position as a key player in the international defense landscape. The integration of the S-400 into Türkiye's air defense network is not just a technical achievement but a strategic step toward enhancing national security.

While these upgrades represent a technological improvement, some concerns have been raised regarding the weight of the new tanks and their effectiveness in preventing a potential Chinese amphibious landing. Troops arrived in armored personnel carriers, supported by Apache and S-70 helicopters providing reconnaissance and covering fire. Army Captain Chuang Yuan-cheng, of the 542nd Armored Brigade, explained that current capabilities allow a communication officer to coordinate aerial attacks from the ground. This ensures synchronization between ground and airborne firepower, reflecting efforts to enhance the interoperability of Taiwan's forces. The drills will continue on Wednesday with a demonstration of the Patriot III missile defense system, designed to counter Chinese ballistic missile threats. They will conclude on Thursday with anti-submarine exercises near Kaohsiung, Taiwan's largest port. This strategically important area is considered a potential target for Chinese forces seeking to establish a supply foothold in the event of a conflict. Held annually ahead of the Lunar New Year, these exercises aim to reassure the Taiwanese public about the military's defensive capabilities while also supporting recruitment efforts. Concurrently, Taiwan is pursuing an ambitious military modernization program, including pending U.S. arms orders worth approximately $20 billion, upgrades to its F-16 fighter jets, and the development of domestically-produced submarines. Additionally, mandatory military service has recently been extended to one year to bolster troop numbers. However, a legislative proposal from the main opposition party, the Kuomintang, in cooperation with the Taiwan People's Party, threatens to reduce the defense budget by 28%. By altering the distribution of funds between the central and local governments, this measure could undermine Taiwan's ability to sustain its defense efforts. National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu has warned that such reductions might also weaken the willingness of allies like the United States, Japan, and the Philippines to assist Taiwan in the event of a conflict with China. Currently, Taiwan allocates approximately 2.4% of its GDP—around $20 billion—annually to defense spending. This investment regularly draws criticism from Beijing, which views U.S. arms sales to Taiwan as provocative. Although China has issued repeated warnings, calling these sales a 'dangerous game,' its responses have so far been limited to targeted economic sanctions on involved companies and frequent military displays near Taiwan. Despite this pressure, most Taiwanese continue to support the current state of de facto independence. In conclusion, these military drills take place in a context of rising internal and external tensions. While Taiwan strengthens its defensive capabilities to counter potential threats from China, uncertainties surrounding defense funding raise questions about the sustainability of its military posture in the long term.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/taiwan-conducts-military-drills-amid-concerns-over-defense-budget-cuts	2025-01-07T06:12:57-08:00

Taiwan's Communication Cable Damaged: Chinese Vessel Suspected in Sabotage	According to information published by Renminbao on January 6, 2025, a submarine communication cable off the northeastern coast of Taiwan was damaged last week, with suspicions pointing to a Chinese vessel dragging its anchor. The incident has sparked heightened concerns over potential gray-zone tactics employed by Beijing.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan investigates damage to a key submarine communication cable, with suspicions pointing to a Chinese-linked cargo vessel, highlighting growing concerns over gray-zone tactics. (Picture source: Taiwanese Coast Guard) In the early hours of January 3, damage was reported to a four-core international submarine cable near Taiwan's northeastern waters, off Keelung. Taiwan's Coast Guard identified a Cameroon-flagged cargo ship, Shunxing 39, as a possible culprit. The vessel had been navigating irregularly in the area and reportedly dragged its anchor at the exact location of the cable damage. Despite its foreign flag, the ship is registered to a Hong Kong-based company, Jie Yang Trading Co., whose sole listed owner is Guo Wenjie. The vessel, which attempted to leave the area due to poor sea conditions, is now en route to Busan, South Korea. Taiwan has sought South Korean assistance in investigating the ship and its activities. Chunghwa Telecom, the operator of the damaged cable, activated emergency backup systems to reroute communication traffic, successfully restoring service for affected customers in a short time. While no severe disruptions occurred, the incident underscores Taiwan’s vulnerability in safeguarding its communication infrastructure. The Taiwan Coast Guard dispatched vessels to investigate, requesting the Shunxing 39 to return to the site for inspection. However, adverse weather conditions hindered further actions, and the vessel proceeded toward its original destination in Busan. Taiwanese officials view the incident as part of a worrying global trend of submarine cable sabotage. A senior national security officer highlighted that many involved ships are often in poor condition and engaged in non-commercial activities, drawing comparisons to Russia's shadow fleet implicated in similar cases. Beijing has not officially responded to the incident, but Taiwanese lawmakers believe it is part of an escalating gray-zone strategy—using unconventional means to undermine Taiwan's security without direct conflict. Legislators have called for reinforced measures, including stricter cable protection zones, faster interception protocols, and the ability to detain suspected vessels. This is not the first time Taiwan’s submarine cables have been damaged. Over the past five years, cables connecting Taiwan’s main island to the Matsu Islands have been reportedly damaged nearly 30 times by Chinese vessels. Globally, submarine cables have become a focus of geopolitical tensions. In November 2024, Finland and Germany reported damage to the C-Lion1 cable, with a Chinese cargo ship, Yi Peng 3, flagged as a suspect. Similarly, the Newnew Polar Bear, a Chinese vessel, was linked to the October 2023 damage of a natural gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia. Russian vessels have also been implicated in incidents, such as the Eagle S, suspected of damaging the Estlink 2 cable between Finland and Estonia last month.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/taiwans-communication-cable-damaged-chinese-vessel-suspected-in-sabotage	2025-01-07T03:24:56-08:00

Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link These munitions, designed for use with the ZU-23 and Schilka systems, will incorporate proximity fuse technology, enabling them to detonate near enemy drones (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) On January 2, 2025, the Indian Ministry of Defense issued a Request for Information (RFI) inviting local companies, both public and private, to submit proposals for the production of 23-mm anti-drone ammunition. These munitions, designed for use with the ZU-23 and Schilka systems, will incorporate proximity fuse technology, enabling them to detonate near enemy drones. This advancement seeks to address the limitations of existing munitions, which require a direct hit to neutralize targets. The ZU-23-2 is a Soviet-designed towed anti-aircraft gun adopted by India in the 1960s to bolster its close-range air defense. This system features two 23-mm automatic cannons mounted on a mobile platform, providing a combined rate of fire of approximately 2,000 rounds per minute. It uses 23 x 152 mm ammunition, including high-explosive incendiary tracer (HEI-T) and armor-piercing incendiary tracer (API-T) rounds. Primarily, the ZU-23-2 is deployed against low-flying aircraft and helicopters, as well as light ground targets. The ZSU-23-4 'Shilka' is a self-propelled anti-aircraft system introduced into the Indian arsenal in the 1970s. Mounted on a tracked chassis, it is armed with four 23-mm AZP-23 'Amur' automatic cannons, delivering a total firing rate of 3,400 rounds per minute. The Shilka is equipped with the RPK-2 'Tobol' radar, which provides aerial target detection and tracking capabilities over a range of up to 20 km. Carrying approximately 2,000 rounds of 23 x 152 mm ammunition, similar to the ZU-23-2, the Shilka is intended to protect mechanized units against low-altitude air threats. While the exact number of these systems in service with the Indian Army remains undisclosed, both platforms have been operational for several decades and have undergone modernization to address contemporary challenges. The development of specialized anti-drone munitions is set against the backdrop of global conflicts, such as those in Ukraine and the Caucasus, where drones have been extensively used for reconnaissance and targeted strikes. These aerial systems pose unique battlefield threats, including the potential to drop explosives on troops, tanks, or artillery positions. Currently, both the ZU-23 and Schilka systems, despite their high firing rates and armor-piercing ammunition, struggle to effectively engage drones due to their manual operation and low probability of direct hits. The introduction of proximity fuse technology is expected to significantly improve the effectiveness of these weapons, enhancing the Army's close-range air defense capabilities. Additional measures are already in place along the India-Pakistan border. The Border Security Force (BSF) employs laser-guided jammers to neutralize drones carrying narcotics from Pakistan. In 2024, nearly 290 small drones were intercepted in Punjab, with some disabled mid-flight. However, these systems, designed for non-military drones, are insufficient against more sophisticated aerial threats. In addition to this initiative, India has adopted other anti-drone solutions, including rifle-mounted systems and broader defense measures such as the Indrajaal counter-drone shield. Designed to protect areas of up to 2,000 square kilometers, Indrajaal demonstrates India's proactive approach to evolving warfare technologies.

Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The ASCALON gun was in action during recent tests. (Picture source: KNDS) The MGCS project, initially launched in 2017, was delayed after reaching the SADS Part 1 study phase. However, it was revived in April 2024 through a protocol agreement signed by French Minister of Armed Forces, Sébastien Lecornu, and his German counterpart, Boris Pistorius. This agreement allowed the focus to shift back to military needs, prioritizing operational requirements over industrial demands, drawing inspiration from the successful collaboration of the Future Combat Air System (SCAF) between France, Germany, and Spain. As part of the MGCS initiative, KNDS is developing a 'family of systems' that includes next-generation tanks, drones, robots, and other components, all interconnected via a combat cloud. The project is organized into eight main capability pillars: platform, turrets and guns, secondary armament, communication and command systems, simulation, sensors, drone defense, and logistics. Additionally, the creation of a joint project company involving KNDS France, Thales, KNDS Deutschland, and Rheinmetall was planned, but it has faced delays, with the Bundestag yet to approve the next phase of the project. A major point of contention in the MGCS project is the choice of main armament for the future combat vehicle. Rheinmetall has proposed its 130mm gun, while KNDS France has advocated for its ASCALON system, which uses telescoped ammunition stored in an autoloading turret and capable of being 'programmed beyond the line of sight.' The primary advantage of the ASCALON lies in its minimal barrel wear and flexibility in terms of ammunition selection. At the 2024 EuroSatory exhibition, KNDS France demonstrated the versatility of the ASCALON, with the system capable of being equipped with 120mm to 140mm guns, with caliber changes completed in under an hour. The company emphasized that this innovative concept offers significant growth potential, enabling performance levels that current technologies cannot match. The next phase of testing will involve firing the ASCALON gun integrated into a combat vehicle turret, scheduled for later this year. This test will evaluate the system’s capabilities and its potential integration into the MGCS. In the meantime, KNDS France has launched a media campaign to highlight ASCALON’s performance. Recent images shared on social media showcased the system’s ability to quickly change calibers and its precision with newly developed armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds, such as the 120mm 'Shard.' These rounds successfully pierced two reinforced concrete slabs, several meters apart, with remarkable accuracy. François Groshanny, director of the 'Future Combat Vehicle' program at KNDS France, recently outlined the four key features of the ASCALON system. These include unprecedented muzzle and target power, the ability to change caliber in under 30 minutes, a compact design using a 'super shot' architecture, and the system's integration into a turret with minimal internal footprint, thus allowing for more personnel to be housed in the chassis. As the MGCS project continues to evolve, the ASCALON gun is expected to play a key role in shaping the future of armored combat systems, with its advanced features and flexible design offering a significant advantage on the battlefield.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/knds-france-tests-ascalon-gun-for-next-generation-of-main-battle-tanks	2025-01-07T01:05:35-08:00

These warships offer advanced capabilities for anti-submarine warfare, escort missions, and maritime security, serving as a versatile, cost-effective complement to the Navy’s larger destroyers. The Constellation-class program, awarded to Fincantieri Marinette Marine in Wisconsin, was intended to showcase the ability of American shipyards to produce world-class naval vessels while strengthening the domestic industrial base. While Trump praised the program’s early success, he expressed frustration over subsequent design changes introduced after his administration. He described how modifications, such as widening the hull, negatively impacted the frigates’ speed and efficiency. The criticism reflects broader concerns about inefficiencies in the defense procurement system. Design changes, often made late in the process, disrupt construction timelines and inflate budgets. Trump’s remarks point to the need for discipline in adhering to original plans to ensure that programs like the Constellation-class can be delivered on time and within budget. In the interview, Trump drew comparisons between modern shipbuilding and the wartime production capabilities of the United States during World War II. Highlighting the Bath Iron Works shipyard in Maine, which produced destroyers every 17 days during the war, Trump criticized the current pace of construction, where shipyards now average just 1.5 ships per year. He called for a return to efficiency. Trump also pointed to the lack of adequate shipyard infrastructure as a major obstacle to fleet expansion. He described the closures of critical facilities under the current administration as detrimental to the Navy’s readiness, emphasizing the need for new docks, graving docks, and expanded production lines to support programs like the Constellation-class. Investments in infrastructure are essential not only to meet immediate production goals but also to position the U.S. shipbuilding industry for long-term success. Trump suggested that outsourcing shipbuilding contracts to foreign builders could be a temporary measure to bridge the gap while domestic capabilities are restored. The Navy’s push for a 330-ship fleet has gained renewed urgency as rival powers like China continue to expand their maritime capabilities. Trump highlighted the Constellation-class as a vital component of this effort, offering a scalable and versatile platform that can be deployed across multiple mission sets. As aging ships are retired and new threats emerge, the timely delivery of these frigates is critical to maintaining the Navy’s operational readiness.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/president-elected-trump-pushes-for-us-navy-efficiency-highlights-constellation-frigate-delays	2025-01-07T01:00:38-08:00	
Analysis: North Korea’s Hypersonic Missile Test Escalates Regional and Global Security Threats	On Monday, January 6, 2025, North Korea conducted a test launch of an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) tipped with a hypersonic warhead, a move that has sharply elevated security concerns in the region and beyond. The missile, reportedly traveling 1,500 kilometers at a velocity of Mach 12—12 times the speed of sound—represents a significant escalation in Pyongyang’s missile technology. The test, personally supervised by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was described by state media as a pivotal step in bolstering the country’s defensive capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link North Korea test-fires a hypersonic missile on January 6, 2025, escalating regional and global security threats (Picture source: North Korea press agency) According to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the hypersonic missile is designed to 'reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region that can affect the security of our state.' The South Korean military, which detected the launch, confirmed the missile’s trajectory from the Pyongyang area and noted it flew approximately 1,100 kilometers before landing in the East Sea (Sea of Japan). This marked North Korea’s first missile test of 2025 and underscored its intent to continue advancing its weapons programs despite international sanctions and diplomatic efforts. The test’s strategic implications are profound, particularly due to the hypersonic technology employed. Hypersonic missiles travel at speeds exceeding Mach 5, but their defining feature is their ability to maneuver unpredictably during flight. This combination of speed and agility makes them exceptionally difficult to detect, track, and intercept using existing missile defense systems. North Korea’s reported success in achieving a speed of Mach 12 amplifies these challenges, as regional defense systems, such as the U.S.-deployed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in South Korea or Japan’s Aegis-equipped destroyers, would have little time to respond. The missile’s range of 1,500 kilometers also underscores its potential to strike critical U.S. military installations in the Pacific, including those in Guam. These bases serve as key hubs for U.S. operations in the Indo-Pacific, providing logistical and strategic support to regional allies. A credible hypersonic missile capability targeting these installations fundamentally shifts the balance of power in the region, directly challenging U.S. military supremacy and deterrence. For South Korea, the proximity to North Korea amplifies the threat. Hypersonic missiles reduce detection and response times to such an extent that key South Korean cities, military installations, and infrastructure are left highly vulnerable. South Korea’s current political instability further complicates the situation. Following a failed attempt to impose martial law, President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached, leaving the nation’s leadership in disarray. This internal crisis has weakened South Korea’s ability to respond cohesively to North Korea’s provocations, exposing significant gaps in its national security. The test also sends a strong message to the United States, which is in a transitional political phase as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office on January 20, 2025.

This controversial move led to his arrest, leaving interim governance to Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok. Blinken commended South Korea’s democratic resilience while reaffirming the United States' commitment to supporting its ally during this challenging period. The exact nature of the missile remains unclear, but analysts speculate it could be a hypersonic missile, an advanced version of those tested in January and April 2024. If this hypothesis is correct, the launch would signal an effort to bolster North Korea’s military capabilities while delivering a strategic message to the international community. North Korea has significantly expanded its ballistic missile capabilities in recent years, developing an arsenal ranging from short-range missiles like the KN-23 and KN-25 to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) such as the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. In 2024, North Korea intensified its missile activities, including the launch of the advanced Hwasong-19 ICBM and the deployment of Hwasong-11D launchers near the southern border, each armed with short-range missiles. These actions align with a strategy aimed at reinforcing nuclear deterrence and asserting its presence on the global stage. The timing of this launch raises questions about its political motives. Some analysts suggest it might be an attempt to draw the attention of President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to take office in two weeks, and potentially restart stalled nuclear disarmament talks. However, Pyongyang appears cautious about resuming negotiations despite Trump’s interest in re-engaging. Geopolitically, reports suggest Russia might be providing satellite technologies to North Korea in exchange for military support in Ukraine. This potential cooperation has heightened international concerns, with Blinken emphasizing the importance of strengthened collaboration between Seoul and Tokyo to address threats from Pyongyang and China’s growing regional influence. In response to the launch, South Korea fired missiles into the sea as a show of deterrence. This underscores Seoul's resolve to counter any provocations, despite its domestic political challenges. Meanwhile, South Korean and U.S. forces remain on high alert, prepared to respond decisively to further escalations. As 2025 begins with renewed tensions, this event highlights the enduring security challenges on the Korean Peninsula. The region faces critical months ahead, both militarily and diplomatically.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/north-korea-launches-its-first-missile-of-2025-during-antony-blinkens-visit-to-seoul	2025-01-06T07:32:26-08:00

Iran to Enter Russian Su-35 Fighter Jets into Service by 2025 Strengthening Air Power	Based on a report from the Iran Observer X account on January 4, 2025, Iran is preparing to integrate Russia's cutting-edge Su-35 fighter jets into its air force by 2025. The Sukhoi Su-35, a multirole 4.5-generation fighter, will bolster Iran's aging fleet, significantly enhancing its aerial capabilities. This move follows a growing military partnership between Iran and Russia, especially in light of their close cooperation during the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Su-35 fighter jet will enter service with the Iranian Air Force by 2025, enhancing Iran's air power amid growing military cooperation with Russia. (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) The Russian Su-35 fighter jets deal, which has been in the works for several years, is a key milestone in the evolving defense relations between Iran and Russia. The announcement of this delivery follows earlier reports that Russia would supply these advanced fighter jets to Iran in exchange for Tehran's support in the form of military supplies, notably drones. Satellite imagery has confirmed the construction of special shelters at Iran's 3rd Tactical Air Base near Hamadan, designed to accommodate the Su-35s.While Iranian officials have not confirmed the exact number of Su-35s to be delivered, various reports suggest the first batch could consist of around 24 aircraft. The jets are expected to be in service by 2025, with the potential for further acquisitions in the future. This acquisition marks a substantial upgrade for the Iranian Air Force, which has long struggled with outdated fighter jets. The Su-35, often referred to as the 'Flanker-E,' is one of Russia's most advanced fighter jets. It is a multirole, twin-engine, air superiority aircraft capable of engaging in both aerial combat and ground attack missions. The Su-35 is equipped with a powerful Irbis-E radar, advanced avionics, and the ability to carry a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. This gives it a significant edge over many of Iran's current aircraft, such as the aging F-4 Phantom and MiG-29 fighters. The Su-35's thrust vectoring engines allow for superior maneuverability in combat, while its long-range radar and ability to engage multiple targets at once make it a formidable opponent. Its advanced electronic warfare capabilities and data fusion systems will also enhance Iran's overall air defense network. Currently, the Iranian Air Force operates a mixed fleet of mostly older jets, many of which date back to the 1970s and 1980s. The F-14A Tomcat, acquired before the 1979 revolution, is still a core component of Iran's air force, though it has suffered from technical issues and limited operational readiness. In addition to the F-14s, Iran flies F-4 Phantom IIs, MiG-29s, and Soviet-era Sukhoi and MiG aircraft, all of which are nearing the end of their operational life. Iran's reliance on these older aircraft has made air superiority a challenge, especially in the face of modern, western-supplied aircraft in neighboring countries. The arrival of the Su-35s will provide a much-needed boost to Iran’s air capabilities and help it assert greater control over its airspace. The delivery of Su-35s to Iran is part of a broader shift in military cooperation between the two countries. Iran has been supplying Russia with advanced drones for use in the Ukraine conflict, and in return, Russia has provided Iran with significant military technology. The Su-35 deal is a further sign of the growing strategic alignment between Tehran and Moscow, driven in part by their mutual interests in countering Western influence in the Middle East and the broader region. This partnership comes at a time when Russia is increasingly isolated on the global stage due to its actions in Ukraine, and Iran, too, has faced extensive sanctions. Both nations are turning to each other for defense supplies, with Russia also providing Iran with sophisticated air defense systems like the S-400 and the Tor-M2. Integrating Su-35s into the Iranian Air Force marks a new phase in the country's military modernization. While the acquisition will undoubtedly enhance Iran’s combat capabilities, experts note that the number of Su-35s may still be insufficient to fully rival regional adversaries' air power. However, the strategic value of the jets, combined with Iran’s increasing drone capabilities, suggests that Tehran will be better equipped to deter potential threats and assert its regional ambitions. As Iran continues to strengthen its air capabilities, the implications for regional security will be profound, with neighboring countries likely reassessing their defense postures in light of these developments. The deeper military ties between Iran and Russia may also lead to further arms deals, creating a new dynamic in the Middle East's volatile security environment.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/iran-to-enter-russian-su-35-fighter-jets-into-service-by-2025-strengthening-air-power	2025-01-05T07:57:46-08:00	
BREAKING NEWS: France to Deliver First Mirage 2000-5F Fighter Jets to Ukraine by March 2025	The first batch of Mirage 2000-5F fighter jets, donated by France to Ukraine, is expected to arrive by the end of February or the beginning of March 2025. Defense analyst Xavier Tytelman reported this information on his X account on January 5, 2025. The arrival of these advanced French combat aircraft represents a major enhancement of Ukraine's air combat capabilities, further strengthening its defense as it faces Russian air superiority.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Mirage 2000-5F is a French multirole fighter with advanced radar and weapon systems. France is delivering up to 12 of these aircraft to Ukraine to enhance its air capabilities in the ongoing conflict with Russia. (Picture source: Wikimedia) French President Emmanuel Macron officially announced the donation of the French-made Mirage 2000-5F fighter jets in the summer of 2024 as part of a broader package of military aid to bolster Ukraine's defense against Russia's ongoing invasion. France has committed to delivering up to 12 Mirage 2000-5F aircraft to Ukraine, with the first units expected to arrive by the end of February or the beginning of March 2025. This move follows a growing trend of Western nations providing advanced air assets to Ukraine, including fighter jets from other NATO allies. According to Tytelman, Ukrainian crews and maintenance technicians have completed an extensive training program in preparation for operating the Mirage 2000-5F. This training, which began in mid-2024, was essential to ensuring that Ukrainian personnel are fully equipped to operate, maintain, and repair the French fighter jets. Simultaneously, the deployment of the necessary maintenance infrastructure for the Mirage 2000-5F has already begun, ensuring that the new fighters will be sustained effectively in Ukraine’s current operational environment. The Mirage 2000-5F starkly contrasts the Soviet-era fighter aircraft currently in service with Ukraine, such as the MiG-29 and Su-27. In terms of advanced capabilities, the Mirage 2000-5F is equipped with the Thales RDI (Radar Doppler à Impulsion) radar, a multi-mode radar system that is far more advanced than the Soviet-era radars found in MiG-29s and Su-27s. This radar offers superior long-range detection capabilities and can track multiple targets simultaneously, providing a crucial advantage in modern aerial combat against Russian aircraft, drones, and cruise missiles. In terms of weapon systems, the Mirage 2000-5F is capable of carrying a wider range of modern Western air-to-air missiles, including the MBDA Mica missile, which offers advanced radar and infrared guidance systems. This gives the Mirage 2000-5F a distinct edge in beyond-visual-range combat, a capability that Soviet-era aircraft like the MiG-29 and Su-27 are less equipped to handle. Another significant advantage the Mirage 2000-5F offers over its Soviet-made counterparts is enhanced situational awareness. With a modern digital cockpit and advanced avionics, Mirage 2000-5F pilots are able to process more information in real time, making faster, better-informed decisions during high-pressure combat situations. This enhanced situational awareness will be invaluable for Ukrainian pilots as they engage in fast-moving, high-stakes battles in Ukraine’s contested airspace, where countering Russian fighter jets and air defense systems is critical. The Mirage 2000-5F is also known for its exceptional agility and performance. Lighter and more maneuverable than the heavier MiG-29 and Su-27, the Mirage 2000-5F offers Ukrainian pilots greater precision and flexibility in close combat situations. This advantage will prove vital as they face Russia's fast-moving fighter jets and complex air defense systems. Additionally, the Mirage 2000-5F has an extended operational range, allowing it to conduct deeper strikes into Russian-held territory or provide extended air cover for Ukrainian ground forces, making it more effective in various operational contexts than the MiG-29 and Su-27, which have more limited ranges. The introduction of the Mirage 2000-5F into Ukraine’s air force is not only a boost to its aerial combat capability but also a significant shift in the balance of air power in the region. With its advanced radar, missile systems, and overall performance, the Mirage 2000-5F will give Ukraine a strategic tool to challenge Russia’s aerial dominance in the ongoing conflict. While Ukraine has already received various Western-supplied aircraft, including French-designed Mirages will further complement existing systems and improve interoperability with NATO forces, whose equipment and tactics Ukraine is increasingly adopting. The final delivery of the Mirage 2000-5F is expected to mark another step in the growing military cooperation between France and Ukraine, cementing France's role as a key supporter of Ukraine in its fight for sovereignty. As additional Western support is expected to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities throughout 2025, the arrival of these advanced fighter jets represents a key milestone in Ukraine's efforts to strengthen its military infrastructure in the face of Russia's ongoing invasion.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/breaking-news-france-to-deliver-first-mirage-2000-5f-fighter-jets-to-ukraine-by-march-2025	2025-01-05T07:31:09-08:00	
Exclusive report: Israeli Special Forces Unveil Secret Operation Many Ways Targeting Iranian Missile Factory in Syria	On January 2, 2025, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) revealed an extraordinary operation in Syria on September 8, 2024, through a video publication showcasing the historic mission. The operation, dubbed 'Operation Many Ways,' involved a daring and highly secretive assault aimed at dismantling an Iranian-funded underground missile production facility located in the Masyaf region, Syria.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshot from IDF video showing Israeli Special Forces from the Shaldag Unit infiltrating the Iranian missile development site in Syria during 'Operation Many Ways. (Picture source: Israeli Defense Forces) The video, released by the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces), provided exclusive footage and insights into the complexity and success of this high-stakes operation. The target, known as 'Deep Layer,' was a key site in the development and production of precision-guided munitions used by Iranian-backed forces and supplied to Hezbollah in Lebanon. The operation was conducted by an elite Israeli special forces unit, the Shaldag Unit, in coordination with the Israeli Air Force (IAF) and the Israeli Navy. The Shaldag Unit is part of Israel’s air force and specializes in special operations, including counter-terrorism, intelligence gathering, and sabotage missions behind enemy lines. Their role in this mission was vital, as the operation required highly skilled soldiers capable of conducting high-risk covert operations. With intelligence confirming that the Syrian regime, still under Bashar al-Assad's control at the time, had allowed Iranian forces to use this facility, the IDF decided to take decisive action. The mission aimed to eliminate one of Iran’s flagship projects for arming Hezbollah and other regional adversaries. The operation, which has now been disclosed to the public, was a joint effort by multiple Israeli military branches, including the elite Shaldag Unit of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), as well as the IAF and Israeli Navy. With intelligence confirming that the Syrian regime, still under Bashar al-Assad's control at the time, had allowed Iranian forces to use this facility, the IDF decided to take decisive action. The mission aimed to eliminate one of Iran’s flagship projects for arming Hezbollah and other regional adversaries. The Israeli commandos, numbering approximately 120 soldiers, included a substantial contingent from the Shaldag Unit, an elite air force special operations unit, as well as members from Unit 669, an expert combat search-and-rescue force. The mission’s objective was to destroy the 'Deep Layer' facility, a subterranean complex that had been a critical hub for Iran’s missile production activities in Syria. In the evening hours of September 8, 2024, Israeli forces initiated their covert operation. The target site was located more than 200 kilometers from the Israeli border, deep within Syrian territory and around 45 kilometers from the Syrian coast. The team, comprising 100 Shaldag soldiers and 20 Unit 669 operators, embarked on the mission aboard four large transport helicopters. The operation’s execution was as complex as it was daring. The transport helicopters, along with two additional helicopters providing close air support, made their way across the Mediterranean Sea, skirting Lebanon’s coastline before crossing into Syria. To provide maximum support, the IDF mobilized 21 fighter jets, five drones, and 14 reconnaissance aircraft. The latter, along with additional Israeli aircraft kept in reserve, provided surveillance, air cover, and immediate response capabilities in case the operation encountered unexpected resistance. As the helicopters approached the Syrian coastline, the IDF forces maintained a low altitude flight to avoid detection by Syrian radar and anti-aircraft defenses. The 18-minute flight from the Lebanese coast to the target area was executed under complete secrecy, with additional bombing operations carried out by the IAF and the Israeli Navy to create distractions and mask the movements of the special forces. Upon reaching the facility, the commandos swiftly infiltrated the underground complex and planted explosives to neutralize the target. The mission was executed with precision, and the explosives were detonated in a massive blast that was felt by some soldiers like a 'mini-earthquake.' The entire operation lasted approximately two and a half hours, and it was reported that at least 30 Syrian soldiers guarding the facility were killed during the attack. Remarkably, the operation resulted in no casualties on the Israeli side. None of the Shaldag Special Forces or Unit 669 personnel were injured during the mission, despite the dangerous and high-risk environment they were operating in. The precision of the assault, coupled with the overwhelming air and ground support provided by the Israeli military, ensured that the special forces completed their task without facing significant resistance. The Israeli military confirmed that, following the operation, the 'Deep Layer' facility was rendered non-operational and that Iran had completely withdrawn from Syria after the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. The site, once a critical asset in Iran's efforts to supply advanced weaponry to Hezbollah, was no longer in use, marking a significant strategic victory for Israel in its ongoing efforts to counter Iranian influence in the region. 'Operation Many Ways' represents a major achievement for the Israeli military, underscoring the effectiveness of Israel's Special Forces and its ability to carry out highly sophisticated operations deep behind enemy lines. With the destruction of the 'Deep Layer' missile production facility, the IDF dealt a significant blow to Iran's efforts to arm its regional proxies, particularly Hezbollah. The success of the operation also serves as a testament to the tight coordination between Israeli military units, the IAF, and the Israeli Navy, ensuring that Israel’s national security interests are safeguarded in an increasingly volatile region. As the situation in Syria continues to evolve, the consequences of this operation reverberate across the Middle East, sending a clear message to Iran and its allies about Israel's determination and capability to act swiftly and decisively against any threats to its security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-report-israeli-special-forces-unveil-operation-many-ways-targeting-iranian-missile-factory-in-syria	2025-01-05T03:51:40-08:00

Leaked Document Unveils Russia’s Plans for Targeting Key Sites in Japan and South Korea	Recently leaked Russian military documents have unveiled detailed plans for potential attacks on Japan and South Korea, targeting strategic civilian infrastructure, including nuclear power plants. These files, dated from 2013-2014 and obtained by the Financial Times through Western sources, highlight Moscow’s concerns about the vulnerability of its eastern flank in the event of a conflict with NATO and its Asian allies. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The cache of 29 secret documents reveals how Russia, wary of a coordinated attack by U.S. forces stationed in Japan and South Korea, identified a list of 160 priority targets. These include military facilities such as airbases and naval installations, as well as critical civilian infrastructure like tunnels, bridges, energy complexes, and industrial sites. The documents reflect Moscow’s strategic apprehension over the perceived threat posed by Asia-Pacific allies of the West. In the event of a conflict in Europe, Russia anticipates a 'horizontal escalation,' extending hostilities to Asia to counter or neutralize adversaries potentially supporting a Western offensive. The plans highlight the use of the Kh-101 cruise missile as a key weapon among the scenarios described. This system, designed for precision strikes, was proposed to neutralize key installations in Japan and South Korea. One scenario includes a simulated attack on a Japanese radar base at Okushiritou, featuring detailed assessments of target structures and expected damage. Of the 160 identified targets, 82 are military, such as command centers and radar installations. The remaining targets include critical civilian infrastructure, such as Japan’s Kanmon tunnel and nuclear energy complexes. In South Korea, strategic bridges and major industrial sites, including the Pohang steelworks, were also designated as priorities. The meticulous planning is evident in the precise calculations for damaging heavily fortified facilities in South Korea. These details underscore the depth of Russian preparations for a potential conflict in the region. This revelation emerges at a time when Asia plays a significant role in President Vladimir Putin’s broader strategy. Russia has recently deepened its ties with North Korea, deploying 12,000 North Korean troops to assist its operations in Ukraine and offering economic and military support to Pyongyang. This dynamic underscores Moscow’s view of an intrinsic link between European and Asian theaters of conflict. Experts argue that the plans confirm the interconnected nature of conflicts in Europe and Asia. William Alberque, a former NATO arms control official, emphasized that these documents illustrate the impossibility of Asia remaining unaffected by a European conflict and vice versa. Despite Russia’s confidence in the Kh-101 missiles, their performance during the Ukraine conflict has revealed limitations. Experts note the missiles' lack of stealth against layered air defenses and insufficient accuracy for precision strikes, which is a significant drawback for low-yield munitions reliant on pinpoint targeting. For Japan, these plans present a unique challenge, as the Russian threat is often perceived as secondary by the general public, despite consistent monitoring by the Japanese military. A rapid escalation originating in Europe would leave Tokyo with limited warning time, complicating its defense strategy. The strained relationship between Russia and Japan, further exacerbated by unresolved territorial disputes over the Kuril Islands, adds complexity. While then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida expressed commitment to negotiations on the matter, Russian statements have signaled an uncompromising stance. In South Korea, the documents highlight the vulnerability of critical civilian and industrial infrastructure, such as refineries and chemical plants in Busan, underlining the strategic importance of these targets in a conflict scenario. In addition to attack plans, the documents include reports on Russian bomber flights intended to test the air defenses of the region. One report details a February 2014 mission during the annexation of Crimea, where Tu-95 bombers conducted flights near South Korea and Japan, documenting responses from local air forces. Similar maneuvers, such as Tu-142 flights in 2024, reflect Moscow’s continued efforts to assess and potentially exploit regional vulnerabilities. While these plans from 2013-2014 appear strategically plausible, their feasibility is questionable. The Kh-101 missiles, central to the scenarios, have demonstrated technical limitations, and the evolving geopolitical landscape presents further challenges. There is no public information confirming the modernization of these plans, although Russia's actions, including military flights near Japan, indicate sustained interest in the Asia-Pacific region. In conclusion, the leaked documents offer a rare glimpse into the depth of Russian military planning for potential conflicts in Asia. They highlight Moscow’s concerns over the vulnerability of its eastern borders and the interconnected nature of global conflict theaters. While some capabilities may have been overstated, the revelations underscore the complexity of contemporary geopolitical dynamics and the challenges faced by Japan and South Korea in ensuring their security against multifaceted threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/leaked-document-unveils-russias-plans-for-targeting-key-sites-in-japan-and-south-korea	2025-01-02T05:26:52-08:00

President Prabowo’s administration marks a renewed opportunity to revisit these discussions. Indonesia’s increasing concern over China’s assertive activities in the South China Sea, despite its strong economic ties with Beijing, adds urgency to Jakarta’s interest in diversifying its defense partnerships. Japan’s defense export policies, governed by the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology, currently limit the export of finished military assets to non-combat applications such as surveillance and minesweeping. Consequently, Japan is pursuing joint development arrangements as a more feasible pathway to transfer advanced defense technology to Indonesia. This approach aligns with Japan’s revised National Security Strategy of 2022, which promotes defense exports through public-private collaboration to enhance ties with like-minded nations and strengthen its defense industrial base. The potential joint development of frigates could enhance strategic cooperation between Japan and Indonesia, particularly in maritime security. This collaboration would be a pivotal step in countering security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region, including China’s maritime expansion. Indonesia’s partnership with Japan in frigate development mirrors Tokyo’s ongoing efforts to secure defense cooperation with other allies. For instance, Japan has proposed a joint frigate development project to Australia based on the Mogami-class design.

Focus: US-based GA-ASI Develops Gambit New Unmanned Aircraft to Support F-35 & Next-Gen Fighter Operations	The future of air power lies in the seamless integration of manned and unmanned systems, where autonomous unmanned aircraft serve as force multipliers, complementing and augmenting the capabilities of advanced human-crewed fighters. At the forefront of this transformation is General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI) with its Gambit advanced unmanned aircraft series, designed to work alongside the most advanced manned aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II and the Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link American Company GA-ASI develops the Gambit Autonomous unmanned aircraft to enhance F-35 and Next-Gen fighter operations through collaborative missions. (Picture source: GA-ASI) The central goal of the Gambit family of unmanned aircraft is to pair large numbers of autonomous systems with potent human-piloted fighters, ensuring that future air forces can dominate the battlespace with a combination of magazine depth, sustained situational awareness, and adaptability—all while minimizing risks to human pilots. In the high-stakes, dynamic environment of modern warfare, a pilot in an advanced fighter like the F-35 is faced with increasingly complex missions that demand more than just raw firepower and agility. These pilots need the ability to operate in a more collaborative, multi-dimensional combat environment—where autonomous unmanned aircraft serve as teammates, carrying out critical tasks that increase the overall operational effectiveness of the air force. Here’s how the Gambit series helps fulfill these roles: Magazine Depth and Force Augmentation: One of the most challenging aspects of modern air combat is ensuring that a combat force can sustain offensive and defensive operations. The concept of magazine depth refers to the ability to maintain a continuous supply of munitions and operational capability during prolonged engagements. The Gambit platforms play a pivotal role here by providing unmanned magazine depth—aircraft that can carry additional weapons, sensors, and combat payloads without placing a strain on human pilots. These unmanned systems can provide critical support to human-crewed fighters, including arming, resupply, and additional combat options that extend the reach and lethality of the entire air package. Situational Awareness and Surveillance: The modern battlefield is more congested and contested than ever before. Pilots in F-35s or NGAD systems require constant, real-time intelligence to make critical decisions. The Gambit platforms, particularly models like the Gambit 1, are built for persistent surveillance. By flying in coordinated swarms, these autonomous aircraft can surveil vast stretches of airspace, detect threats, and relay intelligence back to human pilots and other systems in the air and on the ground. The Gambit’s ability to sense, process, and share data autonomously allows human operators to make quicker, more informed decisions while staying one step ahead of adversaries. GA-ASI’s Gambit Series: Four advanced unmanned aircraft variants—Gambit 1 for surveillance, Gambit 2 for combat, Gambit 3 for training, and Gambit 4 for stealth and endurance—designed to collaborate with F-35 and Next-Gen fighters. (Picture source GA-ASI) Evasion and Detection Mitigation: One of the most potent advantages of unmanned systems like the Gambit is their ability to evade detection and operate in high-threat environments without risking human lives. Gambit aircraft, such as the Gambit 4, are designed with advanced low-observable technologies, ensuring that they can operate in contested airspaces, gathering critical information or striking high-value targets, while remaining undetected. By flying in close formation with manned aircraft or operating autonomously, these drones can reduce human pilots' exposure to enemy radar or missile systems, essentially acting as decoys or providing countermeasures. Autonomous Action and Collaboration: The Gambit series is not just about surveillance or force augmentation; these systems can take autonomous action when required. For instance, the Gambit 2 model can engage adversary aircraft in air-to-air combat, acting independently or in concert with other unmanned systems. These aircraft are equipped with AI-driven systems that enable them to make real-time decisions, from evading incoming threats to engaging in offensive actions. When integrated with manned systems, they provide actionable intelligence and can execute predefined combat missions while operating collaboratively and synchronously with human pilots. This autonomy reduces the cognitive load on human pilots, allowing them to focus on the most critical aspects of the mission while knowing that their unmanned teammates are handling key tasks. Whether it's intercepting enemy aircraft, neutralizing surface-to-air threats, or carrying out intelligence collection, Gambit platforms act as an autonomous extension of the pilot’s capabilities, ready to execute orders or respond to changing combat conditions without direct human input. Fulfilling the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) Concept: The Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) concept that GA-ASI and the U.S. Air Force are pushing toward envisions a highly collaborative and scalable force architecture, where human-piloted fighters, such as the F-35 Lightning II, are complemented by large numbers of autonomous unmanned aircraft—like the Gambit series. These unmanned aircraft are designed to work seamlessly with human pilots, forming a collaborative network that dynamically adapts to evolving battlefield conditions. By allowing unmanned aircraft to take on some of the most hazardous and mundane tasks, human pilots are freed up to focus on higher-value operations, knowing their 'teammates' are performing complementary functions. A key advantage of the Gambit series is its cost-effectiveness, allowing the deployment of large numbers of unmanned systems without the prohibitive costs typically associated with fighter jets. This scalability is crucial as future air forces will need to overcome the economic and logistical challenges of maintaining a high number of advanced aircraft, especially given the increasing complexity and expense of cutting-edge fighters like the F-35 and NGAD systems. The Gambit 4 is a combat reconnaissance variant featuring a tail-less design and swept wings. It is optimized for long-endurance, specialized missions, incorporating low-observable technologies and advanced systems to evade enemy detection. (Picture source GA-ASI) By leveraging shared components across the different Gambit models, GA-ASI is able to streamline production and reduce costs, making it feasible to field large numbers of autonomous aircraft that can augment the capabilities of human pilots at a fraction of the cost of a manned fighter. This approach also allows air forces to field a diverse mix of capabilities, ranging from ISR platforms to combat drones, all tailored to specific mission sets, and all operating in concert with human crews. The Gambit family includes a series of variants, each optimized for specific roles in this integrated, collaborative air combat environment. These variants range from Gambit 1, designed primarily for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, to Gambit 2, which is configured for combat and offensive actions. The Gambit 3 is a platform primarily aimed at training, simulating both unmanned and manned systems in realistic air combat scenarios. Finally, the Gambit 4 is the most advanced model, integrating cutting-edge stealth and hybrid-electric propulsion for long-endurance missions and specialized low-observable capabilities. Each model in the Gambit series works in harmony with the others, providing a comprehensive, scalable solution for modern air forces. The Gambit series represents the strategic shift that is already underway in air combat—moving away from the reliance on a few high-end fighters and toward a distributed, collaborative force where both manned and unmanned systems operate in synergy. By pairing human-crewed fighters with autonomous unmanned aircraft, the future air force will achieve new levels of operational flexibility, speed, and effectiveness. This transformation is essential as potential adversaries, like China and Russia, continue to develop advanced air defense systems and aerial platforms. The Gambit series’ ability to operate autonomously in contested environments, while providing human pilots with the necessary support to achieve air dominance, ensures that the U.S. and its allies can maintain an edge in the rapidly changing landscape of aerial warfare. The Gambit series is not just about technology—it’s about rethinking air combat in a way that maximizes the combined power of human decision-making and autonomous systems. With its focus on collaboration, cost-effectiveness, and mission adaptability, the Gambit is poised to be a cornerstone of the future air force, where human pilots work alongside large numbers of unmanned systems to maintain supremacy in the skies.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-us-based-ga-asi-develops-gambit-new-unmanned-aircraft-to-support-f-35-next-gen-fighter-operations	2024-12-31T06:49:28-08:00

The J-50 is larger, with a longer wingspan and greater emphasis on long-range missions, evident in its 2,200-kilometer combat radius compared to the F-35’s approximate 1,200-kilometer combat radius. The J-50's twin-engine configuration offers greater thrust and operational redundancy compared to the F-35’s single-engine design, potentially giving the J-50 an edge in survivability during engine failure scenarios. However, the F-35’s Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine is widely regarded as one of the most advanced turbofan engines globally, offering superior fuel efficiency and thrust-to-weight ratio. Technologically, the F-35 outpaces the J-50 in sensor fusion and network-centric warfare capabilities, allowing it to act as an airborne command center by sharing real-time data with other platforms. The F-35 also features the Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) and advanced radar systems, such as the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, providing unmatched situational awareness and precision targeting. In contrast, while the J-50 is equipped with advanced avionics and a robust payload of long-range missiles like the PL-15 and PL-17, it may lack the level of integration and data-sharing capabilities that define the F-35. Additionally, the F-35 benefits from a mature production and logistics ecosystem, allowing for mass production and sustained operational support among allied nations, which China’s J-50 has yet to achieve. Despite these differences, the J-50’s superior range and heavy payload capacity make it better suited for extended operations in vast and contested regions like the Indo-Pacific, where aerial dominance and long-range strike capabilities are critical. However, the F-35’s advanced systems and proven track record in joint operations position it as a more technologically integrated and reliable platform in modern air combat. The J-50 also invites comparisons to the recently revealed B-21 Raider, the U.S.'s next-generation stealth bomber. While the J-50 is primarily designed for air-to-air combat and tactical strikes, the B-21 is a strategic bomber specializing in deep-strike missions (DSM) over heavily contested airspace. The B-21’s intercontinental range far exceeds the J-50’s 2,200-kilometer combat radius, allowing it to deliver payloads anywhere in the world without relying on forward bases. However, the J-50’s focus on agility and speed makes it more suitable for dynamic combat roles, complementing China’s growing inventory of advanced unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) like the CH-7 (Cai Hong-7). The unveiling of the J-50 demonstrates China’s commitment to expanding its regional influence and challenging U.S. air dominance in the Indo-Pacific.
