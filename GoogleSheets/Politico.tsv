Donald Trump Jr. heads to Greenland as his father eyes the Danish territory	Donald Trump, Jr. is traveling to Greenland amid his father’s renewed interest in the U.S. gaining control over the Danish territory. The younger Trump reportedly has no plans to meet with any officials in Greenland during his visit Tuesday but the president-elect nonetheless linked the trip to his larger ambitions in a social media post. 'Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation,' Trump said Monday on Truth Social. 'We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!' ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/a-trump-to-visit-greenland-00196762	2025-01-06T17:01:50-08:00	
Trump expected to meet with GOP senators on reconciliation Wednesday	Senate Republicans are expected to meet with incoming President Donald Trump on Wednesday, according to two people familiar with the plans who were granted anonymity to discuss private matters. Republicans are expected to use the meeting to talk with Trump about the party’s reconciliation strategy, as they look for clarity about if he wants to fold a massive energy, tax and border package into one bill or split it into two. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) is expected to host the meeting, according to one of the people familiar. Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters earlier Monday that Senate Republicans would soon be meeting with Trump 'and talk about what he’d like to have done.' 'We’re all heading in exactly the same direction where we want to get to,' Barrasso t...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/senate-gop-wants-meeting-with-trump-00196754	2025-01-06T15:47:56-08:00	
First step on reconciliation in limbo amid GOP infighting	Republicans are looking to take the first step to jumpstart the budget reconciliation bill: Writing the instructions that will govern the terms of the package. But they’re stuck in limbo amid an ongoing debate about whether to go with a one- or two-bill strategy. House and Senate Republican leaders have been struggling to decide if they’ll pass one package on the border, taxes and energy, or whether to do two bills that splits off taxes. To start the reconciliation process, Budget Committees in both chambers have to write instructions that would both detail how many bills they plan to pass and direct relevant committees to develop language. It’s the first formal step in the budget reconciliation process, which would allow Republicans to pass priorities without help from Democrats. But Sena...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/awaiting-reconciliation-instructions-00196719	2025-01-06T13:17:16-08:00	
Dems to the GOP on budget reconciliation: 'Good luck'	As House Republicans publicly grapple over how to advance President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda, House Democrats are looking across the aisle with some schadenfreude. Just four years ago, Democrats were hotly debating how to enact President Joe Biden’s ambitious legislative agenda as they faced similar problems — a tiny legislative majority and the gauntlet of the Senate parliamentarian. Democrats ultimately ended up splitting the agenda into two separate bills, pandemic aid legislation and a massive social spending package, and the legislative wrangling consumed much of the first two years of Biden’s presidency. Hill Republicans are debating whether to try to pass one budget reconciliation bill with all of their border, energy and tax priorities, or to split it into two packages.

Bondi, Rollins, Zeldin set for confirmation hearings next week	Senators could have a high-stakes double header on Jan. 14, with potential back-to-back hearings for Donald Trump's picks for Defense secretary and attorney general, two of the president-elect's most critical Cabinet nominees. The Senate Armed Services Committee previously announced it would host Pete Hegseth that day, Trump's Pentagon pick whose nomination has been dogged by allegations of misconduct. And incoming Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley confirmed Monday he hopes to schedule attorney general pick Pam Bondi the same day. That day — next Tuesday — will likely be the first possible day most Senate panel can hold hearings. The Senate is expected to vote tomorrow on a resolution setting up its committees, which typically have a one-week notice requirement for hearings.

GOP leaders plan votes on first bill to address illegal immigration	Congressional Republicans are moving quickly to take steps to address illegal immigration, bringing up a bill this week that would require the detention of undocumented migrants charged with theft or burglary. The legislation, named the Laken Riley Act after a nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented immigrant, would also grant power to attorneys general to sue the federal government if they can show their states are being harmed through failure to enforce national immigration policies.

GOP memo: Congress likely can't slash certain infrastructure law programs for tax cuts	Lawmakers likely can't count on yanking back some portions of 2021 infrastructure law spending to pay for tax cuts or other GOP priorities like border security as part of a forthcoming reconciliation bill, according to an analysis by the House Transportation Committee’s GOP staff. The memo, obtained by POLITICO, makes clear that scaling back the law's $184 billion in advanced appropriations designated as emergency spending for DOT-administered programs would not translate into direct savings and can't be used to offset direct spending because of the way the budget is scored. Though just a fraction of the law's total $1.2 trillion in spending, it represents a blow to the GOP's quest to yank back what they see as wasteful spending in the law. In addition, the House Republican Conference is e...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/infrastructure-law-spending-00196675	2025-01-06T11:36:49-08:00	
Trump fights Jan. 6 civil lawsuits on 4th anniversary of riot	A lawyer for Donald Trump argued Monday that the Supreme Court ruling last summer granting him criminal immunity for some official acts also bolsters his case to escape liability in civil suits filed against him related to the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. As proceedings to certify Trump’s 2024 victory were getting underway at the Capitol Monday, Trump’s attorneys and lawyers for Democratic lawmakers suing him squared off at a virtual hearing to address the status of one of eight lawsuits the president-elect faces alleging that his actions and statements fueled the violence that broke out four years ago. Attorney Jonathan Shaw told U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta th...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/donald-trump-jan-6-lawsuits-00196671	2025-01-06T11:28:41-08:00	
Trump promises to undo Biden lame-duck drilling ban	President-elect Donald Trump on Monday vowed to quickly reverse President Joe Biden’s lame-duck push to ban oil and gas drilling along most of the U.S. coast. Trump said in a radio interview that he plans to undo Biden’s policy 'immediately' after he takes office later this month, although doing so would likely require help from Congress. The incoming president slammed Biden’s offshore drilling ban Monday in an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt. Biden announced earlier Monday — two weeks before Inauguration Day — that he was banning new offshore oil and gas drilling along most of the U.S. coastline. 'It's ridiculous. I'll unban it immediat...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/donald-trump-drilling-ban-00196667	2025-01-06T11:14:11-08:00	
Congress certifies Trump's presidential victory without melodrama	Congress formally certified President-elect Donald Trump’s victory with no drama on Monday. The sedate proceedings cemented Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, who also presided over the certification. Democratic leaders had stressed the importance of a peaceful transfer of power leading up to Monday, even as Trump and his allies attempt to whitewash the events of the insurrection at the Capitol four years ago. With the memory of rioters in the building still fresh in the minds of many lawmakers and a heavy security presence ringing the Capitol, no Democrats objected to the counting of electoral votes Monday. 'There was a proud but bipartisan tradition of using Jan. 6 to make technical objections within the byzantine electoral college system.

‘Stay tuned’: GOP leaders struggle over how to advance Trump’s legislative agenda	Top Republicans on Capitol Hill are still jockeying over how to advance Donald Trump’s vast legislative agenda, as the incoming president’s comments have given little clarity about how GOP leaders should proceed. Trump said on Monday that he prefers one large package — which would cover the border, energy and tax reforms — but is open to two bills. It’s stoking divisions between Senate and House GOP leaders, as Speaker Mike Johnson publicly pushes one bill, while Senate Majority Leader John Thune favors separating tax priorities from immigration and energy. The speaker told House Republicans Saturday that Trump wants 'one big beautiful bill.' But Senate Republicans quietly pushed back on that assertion all weekend, arguing they were still negotiating the best strategy.

Fed’s top bank cop to step down, averting potential clash with Trump	The Federal Reserve’s top regulatory official, Michael Barr, announced Monday that he will step down in the coming weeks, clearing the way for President-elect Donald Trump to reshape federal banking regulation. Barr, who has served as the Fed’s vice chair for supervision since 2022, said he would resign from that role by Feb. 28 or earlier if his successor is confirmed. He said he will continue to serve as a member of the Federal Reserve Board. His resignation will avert what could have been a major legal fight if Trump had sought to fire or demote him. Barr had been discussing his options with outside legal counsel. Barr’s term as vice chair for supervision had been set to run until 2026. But some Republicans and Trump allies had floated a legally controversial plan to try to remove or de...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/feds-top-bank-cop-will-step-down-00196640	2025-01-06T08:46:48-08:00	
Schumer to push for anti-terror funds in budget negotiations	NEW YORK — Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer will push for $615 million in anti-terror funds as part of the March budget negotiations with incoming President Donald Trump’s administration, Schumer’s team told POLITICO on Monday. The federal dollars from the Urban Area Security Initiative, or UASI, account — which is administered by FEMA — are necessary to protect New York City and Long Island, especially in light of the recent attacks in New Orleans and Las Vegas, Schumer said. 'This amount will help New York City and the region tap federal dollars that help prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism,' the New York senator said in a statement. 'Any effort to cut this anti-terror program, especially right now, cannot stand.'

Trump denies that he will pare back universal tariffs	President-elect Donald Trump denied Monday that he is considering paring back his plan for universal tariffs on imports, after the Washington Post reported his team is considering raising tariffs only on 'critical' imports related to national defense, energy and other key sectors. 'The story in the Washington Post, quoting so-called anonymous sources, which don't exist, incorrectly states that my tariff policy will be pared back,' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. 'That is wrong. The Washington Post knows it's wrong. It's just another example of Fake News.'

All quiet at the Capitol — except for the massive security operation	Rings of metal fencing and a powerful snowstorm have conspired to keep the area around the Capitol virtually lifeless Monday morning — with the exception of a massive security presence as Congress meets to finalize the results of the 2024 election. Secret Service, Capitol Police, Justice Department agencies and officers from cities across the country jammed every corridor of the building, vastly outnumbering the handful of reporters and lawmakers who arrived at the Capitol early. Vice President Kamala Harris made clear she’ll preside over a relatively uneventful count of electoral votes that will confirm Donald Trump’s victory. And Trump himself made only a passing reference to the certification on his Truth Social feed before posting a picture of the crowd at his rally four years ago, whi...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/january-6-election-certification-00196577	2025-01-06T07:16:12-08:00	
Trump says he's still open to two-bill track on GOP legislative priorities	President-elect Donald Trump publicly said that he’s open to a two-bill approach to budget reconciliation, slightly walking back his Sunday night endorsement of tackling the border, energy and taxes in one mammoth package. 'While I favor one bill, I also want to get everything passed. And you know, there are some people that don't necessarily agree with it,' Trump said in an interview with conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt Monday morning. Congressional Republicans have been debating for weeks whether to do one package, which they could pass on party lines using the budget reconciliation process, or break off tax cut proposals into a separate bill.

Former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio asks Trump for Jan. 6 pardon	The most notorious of all Jan. 6 defendants — former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio — has formally asked President-elect Donald Trump to pardon him for his seditious conspiracy conviction related to the attack on the Capitol. Tarrio was convicted by a jury of helping orchestrate the attack on the Capitol, even though he was banished from the city by prosecutors that day for his role in burning a stolen Black Lives Matter banner. U.S. District Judge Tim Kelly, a Trump appointee, sentenced Tarrio to 22 years in prison, the lengthiest sentence of any Jan. 6 defendant. Now, Tarrio is asking Trump for a full pardon, claiming he was targeted by the Biden administration for his political views rather than the alle...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/proud-boys-enrique-tarrio-pardon-00196572	2025-01-06T07:04:10-08:00

Biden: Don’t forget Jan. 6 attack — but let’s get back to a peaceful transition	Shortly ahead of the expected certification of the 2024 election, President Joe Biden said the country cannot ignore the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, but the nation must also return to the norms of a peaceful transfer of power. Biden, speaking with reporters late Sunday after he signed the Social Security Fairness Act, said he is 'hopeful' the country can move beyond that period, adding that President-elect Donald Trump’s actions at the time posed a 'genuine threat to democracy.' 'I think it should not be rewritten. I don’t think it should be forgotten,' Biden said, adding that he’s tried to make the transition 'smooth' for the incoming Trump administration.

Gillibrand to chair Senate Democrats' campaign arm for 2026 cycle	Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) will chair Senate Democrats' campaign arm this cycle, teeing up the party’s attempt to regain the majority in 2026. Senate Democrats will have critical races next year in Georgia, Michigan and Maine, where swing-vote Republican Sen. Susan Collins is up for reelection. They will also have potential pickup opportunities in Texas and North Carolina, though those states have proved tricky for Democrats to topple in the past. While the 2026 map is not miraculously favorable for Senate Democrats, it's far more friendly than the 2024 map that had them on defense in virtually every race, including red states like West Virginia, Montana and Ohio, all of which went to the GOP.

Trump backs massive single bill for taxes, border and energy	Incoming President Donald Trump threw his support on Sunday behind having one sweeping border, energy and tax bill. 'Members of Congress are getting to work on one powerful Bill that will bring our Country back, and make it greater than ever before. We must Secure our Border, Unleash American Energy, and Renew the Trump Tax Cuts,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'Republicans must unite, and quickly deliver these Historic Victories for the American People. Get smart, tough, and send the Bill to my desk to sign as soon as possible,' he added.

Jim Clyburn on Sunday encouraged newly reelected House Speaker Mike Johnson to work with Democrats on agenda items in the new term.

Johnson tells House Republicans that Trump wants one ‘big beautiful’ reconciliation package	Speaker Mike Johnson told Republicans on Saturday that President-elect Donald Trump wants one reconciliation package, instead of the planned two that Republican leadership has been pushing, three people in the room told POLITICO. Johnson’s message came as Republicans are meeting behind closed doors at Fort McNair to map out their strategy for passing a sweeping border, tax and energy package that will be the heart of their legislative agenda. Trump wants 'one big beautiful bill,' Johnson told Republicans at the retreat, per two lawmakers.

Trump chooses Estonia-born lawyer as ambassador to the Baltic nation	President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Estonian-born lawyer Roman Pipko as his nominee for America’s next ambassador to the tiny Baltic country. The position requires Senate confirmation, and Republican control of the upper chamber should make such approval relatively easy to obtain. Still, the role could get more attention than normal because Estonia shares a border with Russia and is among the European countries most vocal about the need to defend Ukraine as it fights off a Russian invasion. Pipko has represented U.S. interests at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Russian American Enterprise Fund, according to Trump’s announcement Friday night. He’s also represented U.S. companies and negotiated projects from Europe to Africa, according to the announcement...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/trumps-estonia-pick-00196468	2025-01-03T16:37:50-08:00	
Johnson prevailed in the speakership race. His problems are just beginning.	Mike Johnson managed to avoid a drawn-out battle for the speakership on Friday. His headaches are just getting started. While Johnson ultimately secured enough votes to remain speaker on the first ballot — after two members switched their votes after further lobbying from Johnson and phone calls with President-elect Donald Trump — the aftermath of his victory made it clear that conservatives see this as a tentative truce. Hardliners said they have certain expectations for the speaker going forward, and signaled that forcing a vote to oust him is on the table if Johnson doesn’t meet them. The newly adopted rules package requires the support of nine GOP members, up from the current threshold of one, to trigger an ouster vote. 'It's always going to be there.

Under the section-by-section analysis of the rules, it would now take nine members of the Republican conference to trigger a motion to vacate the speakership, a threshold that was just a single member when the GOP opted to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last Congress.

Trump picks a former State Department official to be deputy Middle East envoy	Donald Trump has invited former State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus to join his new administration — but he doesn't seem thrilled about it. The president-elect said Friday that he would appoint Ortagus, who was the public face of the State Department for three years in his first administration, to be deputy special presidential envoy for Middle East Peace. Trump noted in a post on Truth Social that 'early on Morgan fought me for three years, but hopefully has learned her lesson.' He didn’t provide any specifics about their disagreement. In 2016, Ortagus criticized Trump’s isolationist views, but became a vocal Trump supporter when he won the Republican nomination at the time.

'We don't know all the information about some of these nominees,' Thune added. 'I think we know a lot about them, but they deserve a fair process. And that's what we've committed to and promised.'

They added that they want to see Johnson put forward legislation that hits on a range of policy goals including securing the border, lowering inflation and endi...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/freedom-caucus-warning-to-johnson-00196439	2025-01-03T13:02:11-08:00	
Trump's inside-the-box pick to run tax at Treasury	President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for his point man on tax at the Treasury Department is an experienced insider whose nomination signals business will have a strong ally in the administration as it pushes through major tax legislation. Ken Kies, a leading tax lobbyist who has advocated for big corporations such as Microsoft and Hess, is widely seen as extremely knowledgeable about both the tax code and the ways of Washington, though he has also developed a reputation among some for sharp elbows and a prickly, suffer-no-fools personality. If confirmed to be assistant secretary for tax policy, Kies would have a big voice in the fight over Republicans’ expiring tax cuts, not to mention a panoply of regulatory issues — from the fate of Democrats’ 'Direct File' initiative at the IRS to the sh...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/trumps-inside-the-box-pick-to-run-tax-at-treasury-00196438	2025-01-03T13:01:03-08:00	
Trump blasts ‘giddy’ Democrats for celebrating half-staff flags at his inauguration	President-elect Donald Trump on Friday slammed Democrats for being 'giddy' that American flags are set to fly at half-mast during his inauguration in honor of the late former President Jimmy Carter. Following Carter’s death last week, President Joe Biden issued a proclamation that all U.S. flags be displayed at half-staff at the White House and public buildings for 30 days — customary for a president’s death since 1954 — which overlaps with Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. 'Nobody wants to see this, and no American can be happy about it,' Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Why two GOP holdouts flipped their votes on Johnson	Reps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self received phone calls from President-elect Donald Trump between their initial votes against Speaker Mike Johnson and their eventual flips to support him, according to two Republicans who were granted anonymity to speak candidly. But most notably, the pair and other holdouts secured general commitments from Johnson and other Republicans about the GOP conference working more collaboratively, the two Republicans said. 'His one-on-one calls weren’t what got it done,' one of the Republicans said, referring to the Trump calls. A handful of Republicans repeated the same sentiment. Self confirmed that he spoke to Trump multiple times, calling it 'lively.' But he added that they have the same agenda. He also said that he and Norman wanted transparency on the budget ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/why-norman-and-self-flipped-00196423	2025-01-03T12:12:08-08:00	
House GOP aims to start setting budget targets for tax and other policies Saturday	House Republicans are hoping to start work on the budget targets for critical committees on Saturday — the first step in kicking off their ambitious legislative agenda involving energy, border and tax policy. 'The Ways and Means Committee is just going to be able to draft tax legislation according to what the budget reconciliation instructions are,' said House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.), who will be leading the charge on extensions of President-elect Donald Trump’s tax cuts. 'And so when the conference figures out what they want in those instructions, we’ll be able to deliver according to those parameters,' said Smith, when asked about the primary goal of a GOP conference meeting tentatively scheduled for Saturday at Fort McNair, an Army post in Southwest Washington.

Initial Norman holdout on speaker vote leads to GOP ire	Before the Freedom Caucus member switched his vote, conservatives lined up to criticize Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) after he originally opposed Mike Johnson on the first ballot for speaker. 'I have a team of 90 political operatives i’m ready to put to work to take out Ralph Norman and I know every inch of the district like the back of my hand. He doesn’t support MAGA and he’s an embarrassment to South Carolina,' wrote Wesley Donehue, a veteran South Carolina GOP strategist, in an X post. That prompted Mick Mulvaney, a former chief of staff to President-elect Donald Trump who represented the district before Norman, to reply: 'I might know a little about SC5. How can I help?' Norman, along with GOP Reps. Tho...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/norman-ire-speaker-vote-johnson-gop-00196418	2025-01-03T11:45:23-08:00	
Johnson reclaims speakership	In a surprising move, Mike Johnson managed to tamp down a conservative rebellion and secured the support to remain speaker on the first ballot Friday, after two Republicans who initially opposed him flipped their votes. After a long break, Reps. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) and Keith Self (R-Texas) switched their votes to Johnson after initially backing others for the top House job. It’s a major boon for Republican vows to swiftly implement President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda.

Johnson fails to reclaim speakership on first ballot	Mike Johnson came up short in his bid to remain speaker on the first ballot, but his allies are optimistic they can flip some of the three GOP votes against him in subsequent ballots. 'I’m confident when you go to bed tonight, we will know who the next speaker is, and I'm confident that that speaker will be Mike Johnson,' said Rep. Mike Flood (R-Neb.). 'There’s an active effort to get this wrapped up today,' he added. Reps. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Keith Self (R-Texas) voted against Johnson in the alphabetical roll call vote. Johnson can only afford to have one Republican vote for someone else and still reclaim the gavel, meaning he needs to flip at least two of those members in su...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/03/mike-johnson-to-fail-first-house-speaker-vote-00196387	2025-01-03T10:25:35-08:00	https://static.politico.com/54/5c/2c263c3a49b6b50766e439fea1d4/u-s-congress-34226.jpg
Johnson commits to working with Musk, Ramaswamy on spending cuts ahead of speakership vote	Speaker Mike Johnson committed to a number of new steps aimed at reining in the size and scope of the federal government as he seeks to round up the votes to retain his gavel. In a post on the social media site X just minutes before a speakership vote is set to begin, Johnson said he’d create 'a working group comprised of independent experts' to work with the so-called Department Of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy; review existing audits of federal agencies and instruct House committees to 'undertake aggressive authorizations and appropriations reviews.'

Centrists warn Johnson not to cut deals with conservatives to get the speakership	House centrists are warning Speaker Mike Johnson to not cut side deals with conservatives to win the gavel. The verbal red flag comes as Johnson is heading toward a showdown over keeping his speakership, with a vote set to begin shortly after noon. He doesn’t appear to have the votes to secure it on the first ballot, as one Republican vows to oppose him and about a dozen others are publicly undecided. Johnson’s right flank is making several demands, including seeking commitments on slashing spending. But it’s one significant ask — a bid to give Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) the Rules Committee gavel — that is sparking the biggest heartburn. Unlike most top committee spots, who gets the Rules gavel is up to the speaker alone.

Thune: The filibuster survives under my watch	Soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader John Thune will kick off his tenure atop the chamber by committing, again, to preserving the legislative filibuster, according to excerpts of his prepared remarks obtained by POLITICO. 'One of my priorities as leader will be to ensure that the Senate stays the Senate,' Thune’s prepared remarks read. 'That means preserving the legislative filibuster — the Senate rule that today has perhaps the greatest impact in preserving the Founders’ vision of the Senate.' 'That includes empowering committees, restoring regular order, and engaging in extended debate on the Senate floor, where all members should have a chance to make their voices — and the voices of their constituents — heard,' the remarks add.

Some of Johnson's detractors think he'll still win	Some potential Republican holdouts are signaling they’re preparing for Mike Johnson to win the speaker’s gavel Friday, in a positive shift for Johnson as his speakership hangs in the balance. Some of the Louisianan's detractors have privately said that they will 'vote for Trump’s agenda,' making clear that they will either support Johnson on the first ballot or at least after the first few rounds of voting, according to three Republicans familiar with the conversations who were granted anonymity to candidly discuss them. However, key holdout Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) has not yet privately expressed that same sentiment, four Republicans similarly granted anonymity said. Rep.

He has tapped health care executive Benjamin Leon Jr. for the post in Spain and chosen entrepreneur Joe Popolo to head to the Netherlands. Both positions will require Senate confirmation, but that should not prove a major hurdle given that Republicans control the upper chamber. Leon has made his fortune in the health care industry.

Trump’s former air chief may helm EPA landing team	Former acting EPA air chief Anne Idsal Austin is a member of the Trump transition landing team at the agency — and may be leading it, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss the transition. The Texas lawyer, who also served as a regional EPA administrator early in President-elect Donald Trump’s first term, is one of several landing team member names that have been shared with EPA career staff, said the people briefed on the agency’s transition. There’s less clarity about whether she is leading the team charged with readying EPA for Trump’s second term, which begins Jan. 20.

The House will kick off the new Congress and move almost immediately to a vote for the speaker’s gavel, with Johnson likely still short of the votes to retain the gavel with just hours to go. 'Good luck today for Speaker Mike Johnson, a fine man of great ability, who is very close to having 100% support.

Who to watch as Johnson’s speakership hangs in the balance	Mike Johnson can likely only afford to lose a single GOP vote if he wants to remain speaker. He’s already got one Republican promising to oppose him, and about a dozen more who won’t commit to backing him. Many of those publicly undecided lawmakers have indicated they won’t reveal how they plan to vote ahead of time so, for now, it’s impossible to predict if Johnson can succeed. And while Speaker Mike Johnson said Thursday that it was his 'plan' to win on the first ballot that will commence shortly after noon on Friday, even his allies are telegraphing that it might take a few votes before he clinches it.

Johnson tries to avoid McCarthy pitfalls as he preps for a speaker showdown	Mike Johnson is trying to avoid the mistakes of his predecessor as he faces the toughest test of his political career on Friday. With his bid to keep his speakership on the line — despite support from President-elect Donald Trump — the Louisiana Republican is looking to sidestep the kinds of side deals with conservative Republicans that ultimately cost Kevin McCarthy his own political future. But that's a hard tightrope to cross. Fiscal hawks want Johnson to make commitments, including giving them greater control over how bills move to the floor and slashing spending — pledges that could be untenable for Johnson with a razor-thin GOP margin.

Buddy MacKay, a Democrat who briefly served as Florida’s governor, dead at 91	TALLAHASSEE, Florida — Former Florida Gov. Buddy MacKay, who lost to Jeb Bush in 1998 but still served 23 days in office after the sudden death of Gov. Lawton Chiles, has died. He was 91. The former Democratic governor took a nap after lunch at his home in Ocklawaha, Florida, on Tuesday and never woke up, his son Ken MacKay told The Associated Press. All of the governor’s adult children were present at the time, he said. 'It was a very peaceful end to a great life,' said MacKay, who hopes his father is remembered as a defender of Florida’s environment and an advocate for minorities.

There’s a big problem with trying to replace Johnson — no clear alternates	Even House Republicans who are skeptical about keeping Mike Johnson on as speaker acknowledge they have a persistent problem: Who could replace him? As Johnson faces potentially a dozen holdouts or more going into the speakership vote on Friday, three familiar alternative candidates have come up in internal GOP conversations: Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan of Ohio and GOP Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota. All three ran for the speakership in October 2023 before Johnson was elected to take the gavel, and all three were forced to drop their bids as it became obvious they couldn’t get the near-unanimous support needed from House Republicans.

How a long speaker fight could impact Trump’s ability to start his next term	If Republicans fail to elect a speaker Friday, the ensuing chaos could impact two of the most crucial moments enshrined in the Constitution: the Jan. 6 certification of the 2024 election, and — if things really go haywire — the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has endorsed Speaker Mike Johnson for another stint atop the House and has privately indicated that he doesn’t want Republicans delaying his priorities with a drawn-out speaker fight. But Johnson’s restive right flank is weighing opposing him anyway, and the House is essentially frozen until it elects a speaker. So if the election to lead the House is significantly delayed, it will have a cascading effect that could upend the transfer of power from Joe Biden to Trump in unpredictable ways.

John Barrasso of Wyoming, in a statement, said Biden 'was either going to pardon Liz Cheney or give her an award. She doesn’t deserve either. She represents partisanship and divisiveness — not Wyoming.' Barrasso is set to become the Senate GOP whip. Biden on Thursday announced he would award Cheney, an outspoken critic of President-elect Donald Trump, and 19 others with the Presidential Citizens Award, which honors people who have performed 'exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens.'

Johnson doesn’t have the votes to remain speaker. But his allies insist it’s trending his way.	With less than 24 hours left until the start of the 119th Congress, Mike Johnson doesn’t have the votes yet to remain speaker. The Louisiana Republican has been working diligently over the past few days to lock down the 218 votes he needs, even after spending the holidays working the phones and meeting with incoming President-elect Donald Trump. But even the incoming president’s repeated endorsement earlier this week doesn’t mean Johnson is guaranteed a victory. Roughly a dozen Republicans are still on the fence, as some of them try to get concessions on the rules or commitments from Johnson on spending. There are some positive signs for the speaker.

Believing voters in the 2024 elections rejected Democrats’ more inclusive positions on transgender rights, Republicans appear ready in 2025 to double down in support of executive orders and provisions in spending bills that would make it harder for transgender individuals to get health care, serve in the military or participate in school activities.

That’s an increase from the current rule, which allows any single GOP member to force a vote. The deal to increase the threshold was negotiated in November by members of the House Freedom Caucus and the small business-oriented Main Street Caucus last year — an agreement that was first reported by POLITICO. Even after a vote is triggered, it still requires the support of a majority of the House in order for a speaker to be removed.

Chris Sununu still believes the GOP is bigger than Donald Trump	Donald Trump remade the GOP in his image. Chris Sununu doesn’t think it’ll stick. That’s because the outgoing Republican governor of New Hampshire, who routinely oscillates between supporting Trump and criticizing him, believes his party is bigger than both its enduring standard bearer and the political movement he created. 'Trump is extremely unique. There's no ‘Trump lite’ or ‘Trump 2.0’ that can replace or replicate what he's brought to the table, for better or for worse,' Sununu said in an interview. And the GOP, he insists, is still a 'big tent,' ticking off varied constituencies like the Log Cabin Republicans, fiscal hawks, libertarian-leaners and social conservatives. Sununu needs this to be true, at least if he wants a future in politics beyond punditry.

Trump says he would make calls for Mike Johnson	President-elect Donald Trump said he is willing to make calls to lawmakers to drum up support for Mike Johnson should there be a risk to his speakership ahead of a vote expected Friday on Capitol Hill. Speaking briefly with reporters outside of a New Year’s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect reaffirmed his support for the Louisiana Republican after his formal endorsement on Monday, saying 'he’s the one that can win right now.' The boost of support comes as Johnson’s path to retaining the speakership is tenuous. With the expected makeup of Congress on Friday, he can only have two Republican defections — and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has already indicated he would oppose Johnson. Trump also said he would attend former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral.

House Ethics Committee closes investigations into 4 members	The House Ethics Committee closed investigations into at least four members Monday for violating campaign finance rules. The investigations involved Reps. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.), Wesley Hunt (R-Tex.), Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.), Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.) and 'other confidential matters that have been under review.' The committee declined to disclose further details on those cases. The House panel found that, in at least some of those cases, 'evidence that the Member’s campaign did not fully comply with the applicable standards relating to personal use of campaign funds, as well as reporting or recordkeeping requirements for campaign expenditures.' But the Ethics Committee did not find that misuse was intentional and unanimously decided to close the cases, declining to take further action.

Whitehouse calls for ‘war machine’ to spar against GOP as DNC chair election looms	Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is calling for DNC delegates to consider how the Democratic Party’s infrastructure can support a 'war machine' to lead attacks against Republicans. The letter to state party chairs ahead of the DNC chair election, shared first with POLITICO, comes as Democrats scramble to figure out how to move forward after nationwide losses at the polls in November. Party leaders have bemoaned Democrats’ inability to define their own identity and push back against Republican attacks. Whitehouse argued that Democrats have no institutional and centralized setup to attack the GOP, writing Republicans 'rapidly and effectively deploy false narratives, while we struggle to bring true ones to bear.'

Carter to lie in state at the Capitol	Former President Jimmy Carter will lie in state in the U.S. Capitol's rotunda at the invitation of congressional leaders, the Carter Center announced Monday. The memorial services and honors for the former president are expected to span several days and include public events in Atlanta and Washington, followed by a private burial ceremony in his hometown of Plains, Georgia. Days for public viewing of Carter’s casket at the Capitol have not been announced, but the Carter Center confirmed that plans are underway. President Joe Biden has already announced a proclamation declaring a national day of mourning on Jan. 9, which could coincide with lying in state or the large public funeral service expected in Washi...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/30/congress/jimmy-carter-capitol-honor-lying-in-state-funeral-00196127	2024-12-30T10:34:45-08:00

How they got here: Fields won his return to Congress after defeating Republican Elbert Guillory and Democrat Quentin Anderson. He notched nearly 51 percent of the vote. Inside the campaign: The race for the seat began in earnest when Republican Gov. Jeff Landry agreed to redraw the state’s congressional map to create a second majority-minority district. The resulting seat, which includes much of Baton Rouge, Shreveport and Lafayette, forced out incumbent Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.).

Elaine Chao's advice for Trump's Labor and Transportation secretaries	Nothing much surprised Elaine Chao when she was named secretary of Labor by former President George W.

Happy New Year, the debt limit is here. Get ready for an all-out war over it.	GOP leaders are staring down two bad options to solve President-elect Donald Trump's debt-limit problem, after failing to execute his demand to lift the federal borrowing cap in the last government funding bill. One path requires full buy-in from Republican lawmakers to address the issue via budget reconciliation — a huge challenge thanks to the party’s fierce fiscal hawks. The other entails winning over Democrats, who for the most part rejected Trump’s initial debt-limit gambit last week.

Tributes pour in for Jimmy Carter	Former President Jimmy Carter’s death on Sunday prompted an outpouring of tributes from fellow presidents and politicians. 'Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well,' President Joe Biden said in a statement with first lady Jill Biden. The Bidens celebrated the long and loving marriage between Carter and his wife Rosalynn, writing that it was 'the definition of partnership and their humble leadership is the definition of patriotism.'

Former President Jimmy Carter dead at 100	Jimmy Carter had such confidence in his improbable path to the White House that he bet Americans worn down by Vietnam and Watergate would welcome a new kind of president: a peanut farmer who carried his own bags, worried about the heating bill and told it, more or less, like it was. And for a time, the voters embraced him. Yet just four years later, in the aftermath of a presidency that was widely seen as failed, it sometimes seemed as if all that was left of Carter was the smile — the wide, toothy grin that helped elect him in the first place, then came to be caricatured by countless cartoonists as an emblem of naïveté. But it was Carter’s great fortune to enjoy a post-presidency more than 10 times as long as his tenure in office — in March 2019, he became the longest-lived president ever...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/29/jimmy-carter-former-president-dead-at-100-033324	2024-12-29T13:25:18-08:00	https://static.politico.com/d0/da/4ee6068d421a995375dae1c9c618/carteroverride.jpg
Eric Schmitt, Ro Khanna voice support for H-1B visa reform, as GOP clashes over immigration	A Silicon Valley Democrat and a Republican Senator are calling for reform to the H-1B Visa program, which tech companies use to recruit thousands of high-skilled foreign workers every year. 'So I think the solution here, President Trump has actually articulated this in 2020, is to reform that system and get rid of the abuses, make it merit-based, and make sure that we're not undercutting wages, and having Americans train their foreign replacements,' Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) told 'Fox News Sunday' anchor Shannon Bream.

Is the Democratic brand toxic? A growing number of Dems wonder if going ‘independent’ will help them win	Losing to a twice-impeached convicted felon has left a small, but growing, number of Democrats wondering if their party brand is so toxic that they should shed the label — particularly in battleground and red states. Mike Duggan, the longtime Democratic mayor of Detroit, is pursuing an independent campaign for governor in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory in his state. Democratic strategists are studying this year’s bid by independent Dan Osborn, who as a Senate candidate in Nebraska overperformed the top of the ticket, as a model to win the upper chamber.

'Treasury currently expects to reach the new limit between January 14 and January 23, at which time it will be necessary for Treasury to start taking extraordinary measures,' Yellen wrote in a letter to congressional leadership.

Roy, the Freedom Caucus policy chair, added that Musk and Ramaswamy were working to identify spending waste, and the two businessmen could use their platforms to shine a light on the issue.

Former FBI and CIA head prods Senate to reject Patel, Gabbard	A former head of the FBI and CIA is raising objections over whether Kash Patel and Tulsi Gabbard, President-elect Donald Trump's picks to be directors of the FBI and national intelligence, respectively, are qualified to serve in the Cabinet. In a letter to senators on Thursday, William Webster, the only person to lead both the FBI and CIA, wrote that neither nominee meets the demands of top intelligence jobs. Webster, who is 100 years old, praised Patel's patriotism but wrote that his allegiance to Trump was concerning.

How Schumer is prepping for Trump 2.0	In less than a month, elected Democrats will find themselves with a lot less power in Washington, with a GOP-controlled House, Senate and White House resulting in a landscape in which their ability to tussle with President-elect Donald Trump will be largely rhetorical. But if Dem leaders have learned one thing from Republicans over the years, it’s that sometimes, the judiciary can be the best bulwark against the opposing party getting what it wants. As our Anthony Adragna reported Friday, Senate Democrats have approved 235 of Biden’s judicial picks, eclipsing Trump's 234 first-term judicial nominations.

Expect a quieter Jan. 6 this time around — as long as Republicans avert a looming speakership crisis	Donald Trump’s victory has made Jan. 6 boring again. Four years after a mob of Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s victory, Republicans and Democrats seem to agree they’ll give Trump the smooth, drama-free transfer of power he denied Democrats in 2020. That’s despite the fact that many Democrats see Trump as an insurrectionist, ineligible to hold the presidency because of his role in creating the conditions that led to the attack four years earlier. Instead, top Democrats say they have no plans to stand in the way of Trump’s victory — and they’re not even sure their rank-and-file colleagues will make the token objections they’ve lodged in years past.

Inside how the Capitol Police has changed since Jan. 6, 2021	As Congress prepares to certify another election on Jan. 6, the U.S. Capitol Police looks like a vastly different agency than it was ahead of the attack on the Capitol four years ago. Security officials on the Hill were widely excoriated for the lack of preparedness ahead of the attempted insurrection, prompting multiple high-level resignations in the following weeks. An oft-repeated criticism was that officials should have requested help prior to the attack, given clear signals that there would be a huge protest coming to the area with the potential to turn violent.
