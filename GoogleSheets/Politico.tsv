Senate Dems block GOP's first abortion bill	A GOP-led abortion bill failed in the Senate due to Democratic opposition on Wednesday, a sign of where the party is drawing the line on bipartisan cooperation. After a week marked by Senate Democrats' willingness to work with their Republican counterparts on both an immigration bill and confirming former Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of State, every Democrat voted against legislation that would 'prohibit a health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion.' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had come out against the bill ahead of the vote, and other Democrats who opposed it say the law already requires doctors to give children appropriate medical care. 'This proposed law plays on misinformati...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/22/congress/senate-dems-block-abortion-bill-00200003	2025-01-22T12:21:45-08:00	
Trump’s budget pick is famous for defying Congress. GOP senators want to confirm him anyway.	Senate Republicans are eager to seat the man who could undercut their funding power. As President Donald Trump boldly defies the will of Congress by issuing executive orders freezing billions of dollars in federal cash that lawmakers have approved in recent years, Senate Republicans are still speaking accolades of Russ Vought, the president’s pick for White House budget director and the man famous for withholding government money during Trump’s first administration. Key committee chairs are predicting that the Senate will confirm Vought without issue to head the Office of Management and Budget again, even as some GOP senators raise concern about protecting Congress’ 'power of the purse' — granted under Article I of the Constitution — from presidential overreach. 'I think all of us are goin...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/22/omb-vought-confirmation-trump-00199974	2025-01-22T12:05:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/14/f7/3df90ddf4f3f97deaaf9aa00ebd3/russell-vought-confirmation-hearing-79814.jpg
Democrats' immigration debate plays out inside Hispanic Caucus	With Democrats poised to deliver an early immigration victory to President Donald Trump, members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus split over how to approach the issue in a closed-door meeting Wednesday morning. Some discussed using Democrats' limited political leverage under unified GOP rule: Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) floated conditioning Democratic support for a debt-limit increase on protections for Dreamers — undocumented migrants brought to the U.S. as children. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Linda Sánchez (D-Calif....	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/22/democrats-immigration-hispanic-causus-00199970	2025-01-22T11:08:22-08:00	https://static.politico.com/18/c7/7d9ffe7a4f5392fe2b926c20f38f/u-s-congress-10506.jpg
Democratic senators ask for bipartisan immigration talks	A group of 12 Democratic senators, led by Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, asked Majority Leader John Thune Wednesday to pursue bipartisan immigration-related legislation instead of the party-line approach Republicans are currently planning for. 'We understand that Senate Republicans have discussed using the budget reconciliation process to advance border security budget measures without any Democratic input,' the senators wrote in the letter. 'While that’s your right, in working together on a bipartisan basis, we can achieve the best outcome for the American people. They added: 'There are also limitations to what can be done under budget reconciliation, and as we’ve seen time and time again, no party has all the solutions on this or any issue.'

Trump to meet with Republican key to tax negotiations	Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), a leader in the effort to lift the limit on a state and local tax deduction some key House Republicans are demanding, said at a POLITICO Playbook event on Wednesday morning that he will be meeting with President Donald Trump on Wednesday. New York, New Jersey and California Republicans made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago recently to reiterate their demands to lift the so-called SALT cap, which limits the deduction to $10,000, in negotiations over a large tax bill. The lawmakers say the cap is harming constituents in their politically competitive, high-tax districts. Their votes will be crucial to passing a major tax bill GOP lawmakers are assembling.	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/22/trump-meeting-salt-republicans-00199887	2025-01-22T07:10:23-08:00	https://static.politico.com/2d/65/1907ddc94886b7ffb26097cbb6f8/0t1a0511.jpg
NRCC chief digs in for midterms: ’The math is in our favor’	NRCC Chair Richard Hudson on Wednesday tried to rally House Republicans ahead of their tough battle to keep their majority in the upcoming midterms, with many GOP lawmakers wary they’ll lose a swath of seats in 2026. 'The math is in our favor. We’re on offense,' Hudson told House Republicans during their closed-door meeting Wednesday morning at the Capitol Hill Club, according to two people in the room. He did acknowledge a big challenge will be turning out Trump voters who are less engaged in nonpresidential election years, the people said. The current House Republican majority is razor-thin after GOP candidates won fewer seats than many expected last year despite President Donald Trump’s win.

Capitol agenda: Spending totals, nominees, immigration bill	Donald Trump, Mike Johnson and John Thune’s big meeting didn't do anything to settle Republicans’ mounting legislative headaches. But GOP leaders are indicating they’re going to move forward on at least one area. They’re nearing agreement on government funding totals and hope to finalize a number and inform impatient members in the coming days, according to two people granted anonymity to speak freely about the behind-the-scenes talks. That’s a good sign for appropriators, who reiterated Tuesday night that they want some clearer answers on the spending bills — as soon as this morning’s private House GOP conference meeting.

The Reluctant Steamroller in the White House	Just hours into his second presidency, Donald Trump was already bulldozing congressional Republicans. He granted clemency to some 1,500 Jan. 6 offenders, some of them convicted of violent assaults. He flouted a bipartisan TikTok ban, ordering it to remain unenforced. And he moved to cancel some of his predecessor’s energy programs over the pleadings of some in the GOP who wanted him to wait — to name just a few of the ways he undercut members of his own party. A day later, it was as if a switch had been flipped. In a meeting Tuesday with top GOP leaders, he didn’t move to settle key strategic disputes over raising the debt limit and passing the party’s big domestic policy package.

Jules Feiffer, Pulitzer-winning cartoonist and writer known for lacerating wit, dies at 95	NEW YORK — Jules Feiffer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist and writer whose prolific output ranged from a long-running comic strip to plays, screenplays and children’s books, died Friday. He was 95 and, true to his seemingly tireless form, published his last book just four months ago. Feiffer’s wife, writer JZ Holden, said Tuesday that he died of congestive heart failure at their home in Richfield Springs, New York, and was surrounded by friends, the couple’s two cats and his recent artwork. Holden said her husband had been ill for a couple of years, 'but he was sharp and strong up until the very end. And funny.' Artistically limber, Feiffer hopscotched among numerous forms of expression, chronicling the curiosity of childhood, urban angst and other societal currents. To each he brought...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/22/jules-feiffer-pulitzer-winning-cartoonist-and-writer-dies-at-95-00199846	2025-01-21T21:15:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/c5/f4/f4e0ad8f464b8d2d4483eba0f10e/obit-jules-feiffer-75593.jpg
Key committee to receive briefing on Trump’s TikTok order	Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee who led the effort to pass legislation banning TikTok last year will soon be formally briefed on President Donald Trump’s executive order to give the company a reprieve. The member briefing, confirmed in an interview by a committee Republican granted anonymity to share details of the upcoming private meeting, comes as GOP members of the panel grapple with how to respond to the president’s latest curveball. 'We all know Donald Trump is a negotiator,' Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), a senior Energy and Commerce member who worked on the legislation, said in an interview.

Democrats plot strategy for fighting Trump on funding freeze	Less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump’s Day One blitz of executive actions, Democrats on Capitol Hill mobilized Tuesday to fight his move to freeze a broad range of federal cash. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and other top House Democrats held a private call on Tuesday with more than 100 people, including leaders of outside groups, to discuss government funding strategy and how to stop Trump from violating so-called impoundment law by usurping Congress’ 'power of the purse,' according to three people familiar with the call. People on the call included advocates for a federal program granting food assistance to pregnant women and babies and the Head Start early education program....	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/21/congress/democrats-house-funding-freeze-trump-00199805	2025-01-21T17:04:00-08:00	
Judiciary Committee eyes next week for FBI nominee's confirmation hearing	The Senate Judiciary Committee intends to hold a confirmation hearing for President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the FBI, Kash Patel, on Jan. 29, committee ranking member Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters on Tuesday. If that date stands, it would coincide with the panel's scheduled vote the same day to report out the nomination of Pam Bondi, Trump's selection for attorney general. Durbin, along with Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), said he has now received Patel’s background investigation materials, which are required for every Cabinet nomination in advance of a confirmation hearing. Durbin emphasized, however, that he would not be supporting Patel’s confirmation, pointing to the 'trail of grievances' in his book 'Government Gangsters,' which the senator said he read before meeting with Pat...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/21/congress/kash-patel-confirmation-trump-00199795	2025-01-21T14:43:29-08:00

Trump pushes Hill GOP on recess appointments, debt limit	President Donald Trump prodded congressional leaders to consider recess appointments for his top nominees and expressed interest in trading California wildfire aid for a debt limit increase in a White House meeting Tuesday — resurfacing two controversial proposals floated during the returning president’s transition. The discussions, which were described by two people granted anonymity to describe the private talks, also touched on his proposal to exempt at least some tip income from federal taxes and his efforts more generally to extend tax cuts. Trump described wanting to use wildfire aid as a bargaining chip in comments to reporters shortly after the meeting: 'They're going to need a lot of money, and generally speaking I think you will find that a lot of Democrats are going to be asking...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/21/trump-johnson-thune-white-house-005697	2025-01-21T14:11:09-08:00	https://static.politico.com/01/77/6d24ae2145dab340582675b12d17/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2194408920

The Senate readies for a nominee siege	Democrats let Secretary of State Marco Rubio blitz to Senate confirmation Monday. Now it’s time for trench warfare. With Donald Trump’s nominees slowly emerging from Senate committees, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are preparing for a weekslong slog as Democrats force Republicans to work through procedural obstacles to fill out the new president’s Cabinet. CIA director pick John Ratcliffe is expected to get a relatively smooth bipartisan confirmation on Tuesday. But after that, more controversial nominees await, and cooperation could be hard to come by. Accelerating any confirmation will require unanimous agreement from senators, and after letting Rubio through, Democrats are not eager to ease the way for many other Trump picks.

A running list of Trump's planned executive orders, actions, proclamations and legislation	Donald Trump is promising a 'golden age of America' in his second term, and he’s issuing a raft of executive orders to try and make it happen. The president signed a slew of orders and directives that aim to end birthright citizenship and crack down on illegal crossings at the southern border, increase domestic energy production and transform a federal government he views as both too bloated and too 'woke.' It’s unclear which of Trump’s executive actions will have immediate impact or are merely symbolic. But they’re already facing challenges. The Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency drew lawsuits hours before Trump signed the paperwork to create it.

GOP senators criticize Trump over pardoning violent Jan. 6 rioters	Several Republican senators are roundly criticizing President Donald Trump's pardons of Jan. 6 rioters — particularly those convicted of violent crimes, like assaulting law enforcement officers. 'I’m disappointed to see that and I do fear the message that is sent to these brave men and women that stood by us,' said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) echoed that sentiment, saying there was a difference between those 'caught up in the crowd who did not commit a violent act' and those who committed violent crimes, like destroying property or assaulting officers, who should not be pardoned.

Stefanik paints a grim picture of a UN she wants to reform	Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), President Donald Trump’s nominee to represent the U.S. at the United Nations, on Tuesday painted the international organization as a body beset by bias against Israel, nefarious Chinese influence and ineffective peacekeeping efforts. But she argued the U.N. isn’t irredeemable and pledged that she’d help usher 'strong American leadership' at the multilateral body. Before a generally cordial panel of senators on the Foreign Relations Committee, the New York Republican said Washington could still thwart growing Chinese influence on the international stage by increasing its presence at the global forum. 'We need to have strong American leadership working with our allies to push back on this,' Stefanik said.

Democrats press VA secretary nominee on abortion, Project 2025	Abortion politics took center stage at the Tuesday morning confirmation hearing for President Donald Trump’s pick to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. VA Secretary nominee Doug Collins, a former Republican congressman from Georgia, was asked more than once by Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Democrats whether he would roll back a Biden administration rule allowing the agency to provide abortion counseling and, in some cases, the procedure itself.

'I haven't looked at it yet,' Johnson said in a brief interview Tuesday as he left the Capitol to meet with Trump at the White House. But he appeared to reference other Trump officials like Vice President JD Vance who suggested violent offenders wouldn’t receive blanket pardons but would instead be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 'The idea is that peaceful protesters should not be detained and anybody who committed violent offenses — that was something they talked about,' Johnson said, trailing off. 'I haven't seen the list.

Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune are expected to meet with Trump first before the larger group joins. It's their first business meeting since Trump took the oath of office Monday, and GOP leaders are hoping to hammer out more details there on how exactly they’re expected to accomplish his ambitious legislative agenda. After the top leaders meet with Trump, the expanded group will join.

The new Republican trifecta has much to discuss. GOP lawmakers want more guidance on whether they’ll be expected to cram Trump’s priorities on the border, energy and taxes into one bill or two. They also want directions on spending limits needed to pass government funding legislation by mid-March and clarity on how to handle the debt limit, as the U.S. faces a potential default in the months ahead.

Trump: ‘We don’t need’ Latin America	President Donald Trump issued a stark message Monday to would-be economic and strategic partners in Latin America: The U.S. doesn’t need you. Speaking from the Oval Office after signing a spate of executive orders, Trump was asked about relations with Latin America and Brazil and said the relationship 'should be great.' But he made it clear who needs who more in the relationship. 'They need us much more than we need them. We don't need them,' he said. 'They need us. Everybody needs us.' Those comments seem poised to deflate hopes of some in Latin America that Trump would refocus resources on shoring up ties with countries in the Americas.

Senate unanimously confirms Rubio as secretary of State	Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was confirmed Monday as secretary of State, the first of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks to take office. In becoming secretary of State, Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, also makes history as the highest-ranking U.S. politician of Latino and Hispanic descent to date. Rubio experienced a relatively easy and trouble-free confirmation process. The third-term Florida lawmaker was the top Republican member of the selective Senate Intelligence Committee and served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Not a single senator opposed his nomination on the Senate floor and he faced no opposition in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee markup that preceded it.

Trump promised the crowd in the inauguration’s 'overflow room' in the Capitol Visitors Center, following his formal inaugural remarks in the Rotunda: 'You’re going to see a lot of action on J6 hostages.' He has floated pardoning the rioters, many of whom are facing formal criminal charges.

TikTok celebrates Trump inauguration, over and over	With TikTok back online after shutting off for less than a day, the company embarked on an inaugural weekend goodwill tour aimed at incoming President Donald Trump, the person the video-sharing app is counting on to save it in the long term. On Sunday, TikTok contributed $50,000 to a party in honor of Gen Z Trump supporters and his biggest social media allies. TikTok’s lobbyist Mac Abrams made his rounds, and guests including Trump campaign adviser Alex Bruesewitz and Republican political activist Scott Presler rubbed elbows with former British Prime Minister Liz Truss and boxer Scott McGregor.

We're running out of time': GOP already antsy on Trump’s Hill agenda	Welcome to the Washington trifecta, Republicans. Now get ready to wait. Even as the GOP takes unified control of the House, Senate and White House on Monday, congressional leaders are facing doubts about just how quickly they will be able to deliver major wins for Donald Trump. Their legislative plans are highly unsettled, and the clock is ticking toward distracting fights over federal spending and the debt limit. And when it comes to the heart of Trump’s agenda — a sprawling party-line effort encompassing border, energy and tax policy — key strategic questions remain in flux. Once they agree on the general direction of travel, leaders will then have to navigate a thicket of nasty intraparty disputes on the policies themselves.

Why Trump supporters see sunshine in Trump’s dark and foreboding speeches	The first time Donald Trump gave an inaugural address, official Washington winced. It was a scorching and dystopian assessment of what he cast as a country in ruins — this 'American carnage,' Trump said. And it was, as George W. Bush reportedly called it, 'some weird shit.' But that’s not how much of Trump’s MAGA base remembers it. Like Trump, they, too, saw a hollowed-out nation in 2017. But what Trump’s supporters mostly recalled in the president-elect — and the repeat performance they are preparing for on Monday — is redemption.

‘Not enough room’: Lawmakers fret about indoor inauguration	The last-minute move to bring President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration indoors could leave some members of Congress out in the cold. Perhaps not literally: No one is expected to be seated outside in 25-degree bluster. But the possibility that not all lawmakers might get seats in the Rotunda for the oath-of-office ceremony has cast a chill over the occasion in some congressional offices, according to four lawmakers and aides. 'Simply put, there’s not enough room,' one senior Republican aide said. 'It’s a shitshow.' The initial guidance from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies after Trump’s team decided to move things indoors on Friday was that 't...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/19/trump-inauguration-rotunda-congress-004800	2025-01-19T13:43:05-08:00	https://static.politico.com/57/15/f0dca855496ab92debba3ab5e268/inauguration-57288.jpg
Tim Kaine explains strategy on Pete Hegseth	Sen. Tim Kaine said he pushed Defense Secretary-nominee Pete Hegseth about infidelity and sexual misconduct in a hearing last week because he believed it was the only way to get Republicans to consider voting against him. Speaking Sunday on CBS' 'Face the Nation,' Kaine (D-Va.) said: 'My observation of my Republican colleagues is the only reason they ever vote no on a nominee is either a belief of gross incompetence in terms of qualifications or serious character deficit.' As an example, Kaine cited the case of then-Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), whose chances to be President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general were quickly scuttled by personal scandal.

Trump says he will ‘probably’ travel to California next week after LA fires	President-elect Donald Trump will 'probably' travel to Southern California next week, he told NBC News, making the likely first trip of his second term to the liberal stronghold still reeling from some of the worst wildfires in its history. In a wide-ranging phone interview on Saturday with 'Meet the Press' moderator Kristen Welker, Trump said he 'was going to go, actually yesterday,' to the Golden State, but decided 'it would be better if I went as president.'

Trump hires fed-firing mastermind	President-elect Donald Trump is bringing back a senior White House official who led his first-term push to make it easier to fire civil servants. James Sherk, who served as a special assistant on domestic policy during Trump’s first term, will return to serve in the White House Domestic Policy Council, Trump announced Saturday. Sherk has worked at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute during the Biden administration. Sherk was central to the Trump administration’s efforts to make it easier to fire some federal employees using a classification called Schedule F. That effort generated an outcry from civil servants, and the Biden administration moved quickly to reverse course. But the effort 'could — and should — be reissued by another president,' Sherk wrote in a 2022 Wall Stre...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/18/trump-hires-fed-firing-mastermind-00199154	2025-01-18T11:36:44-08:00	https://static.politico.com/76/68/ac5fbe53477a92f06e69e390f343/1594391562082.jpg
The Real Story Behind Mike Turner’s Firing	When Speaker Mike Johnson summarily fired House Intelligence Chair Mike Turner this week, everyone assumed it was about Donald Trump. Actually, it was about power — not the incoming president’s, but Johnson’s.

The Capitol grapples with Trump's last-minute inauguration switch	Donald Trump won’t be crowing about crowd size at his second inauguration. Barely more than 2,000 people will pack into the Capitol Rotunda for a cold-weather inaugural ceremony backup plan not seen since Ronald Reagan. The call to move the swearing in and inaugural address indoors was made by the Trump team, but the pivot will have to be executed by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and hundreds of workers across Capitol Hill — who have less than 72 hours to pull off a huge pivot. The have nots: Just a tiny fraction of committed Trump supporters who traveled to Washington will get to see the ceremonies in person. The rotunda crowd will mostly be comprised of lawmakers, other high-ranking officials and Trump’s family.

The group said its letter had failed to make clear that progressive staff were dedicated to 'serving the American people no matter how many hours it takes to get the job done' and that there were 'well-known, longstanding workplace issues that deserve Congress’s immediate attention.'

Donald Trump’s DOJ could win convictions of two Jan. 6 defendants next week	By early next week, Donald Trump’s Justice Department may secure its first convictions of Jan. 6 felony defendants. That’s because two jury trials launched this week by President Joe Biden’s DOJ have not yet reached verdicts and are slated to continue into the first days of the Trump administration. Unless Trump pulls the plug on trials that are already reaching their final phase, it will be his DOJ that sees them through, perhaps as early as Tuesday. Trump could extend blanket pardons to all Jan. 6 defendants, which would short-circuit ongoing trials. However, his allies have signaled he’s unlikely to summarily pardon people charged with felonies and would instead review them on ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/17/congress/donald-trump-january-6-cases-00199097	2025-01-17T13:40:10-08:00

DeWine passes over Ramaswamy, will select Jon Husted for Senate	Gov. Mike DeWine has selected his own Lt. Gov. Jon Husted to become the next senator from Ohio, passing over entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Two sources, granted anonymity to speak freely about the appointment, confirmed that DeWine will pick Husted. DeWine is expected to make the announcement at 1p.m. Husted, a Republican more in DeWine’s institutionalist mold, had long planned to run for governor in 2026 to succeed DeWine. His ascent to the Senate will likely scramble the field in that race.

Democrats look to inject fresh energy into the LGBTQ+ movement	It's been a dozen years since the Stonewall Democrats, a once-prominent LGBTQ+ rights group, went defunct. But now, on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration, a new coalition of state-level advocacy groups is reestablishing a national presence to gird against the incoming president and a Republican-controlled Congress. The group, the National Federation of Stonewall Democrats, comes together at a fraught time for movement, amid recriminations from within the Democratic Party that its focus on transgender rights harmed Democrats in November.

Dozens of House Dems back GOP immigration bill related to sex crimes	More than 60 House Democrats backed a GOP bill that would make sexual and domestic violence deportable offenses, marking the second bipartisan immigration bill to pass the chamber this Congress. The bill, led by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), earned 10 more Democratic votes than the 51 who backed it in the last Congress. Many Democrats who supported it were from purple districts, but some in solidly blue seats also voted for it, including Reps. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), Sarah McBride (D-Del.), and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.). Congressional Democrats are under intense pressure from the GOP majority to vote for immigration and crime-related bills.

Get ready for a 🥶🥶🥶 Inauguration Day	Prepare to freeze at Donald Trump’s inauguration. It’s forecasted to be the coldest Inauguration Day since President Ronald Reagan’s second swearing-in ceremony in 1985 (temperature: A cool 7 degrees). The weather is expected to peak in the mid-20s (very cold!) and dip as low as 10 degrees (very very cold!) at night. The good news: The sun is set to shine during Trump’s ceremony, but 10 to 20 mph freezing winds will make it feel even colder. D.C.’s had its fair share of cold days in January, but frigid temperatures aren’t the norm for Inauguration Day. The average Jan. 20 temperature has hovered around a 45-degree high and 30-degree low with wind chill also in the 30s, according to the National Weather ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/16/congress/donald-trump-inauguration-day-weather-forecast-00198682	2025-01-16T09:12:28-08:00	
Trump selects private equity CEO Pulte as top housing regulator	President-elect Donald Trump has selected private equity CEO and philanthropist Bill Pulte to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency. If confirmed, Pulte would become the country's top housing regulator. FHFA oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage giants standing behind roughly half of the U.S. residential mortgage market. Pulte founded Pulte Capital Partners LLC, which focuses on housing products, in 2011 and garnered attention in recent years for promoting his giveaways of money and other goods on social media. He is a grandson of real estate magnate William Pulte. The Trump administration is expected to pursue a plan to release Fannie and Freddie from government control — a complex maneuver that could have major repercussions for the mortgage market.	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/16/congress/trump-picks-top-housing-regulator-00198667	2025-01-16T09:10:10-08:00	
Pelosi is skipping Trump's inauguration	Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi won’t be attending President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday, her spokesperson confirmed. She’s joining other Democrats who are expected to skip Trump’s swearing in, though lawmakers haven’t mounted an organized boycott of the inauguration like they did in 2017. Instead, a sizable number of House Democrats are expected to attend after their districts slid towards Trump in the November elections. Pelosi had gone to Trump’s inauguration in 2017, when she was the House Minority Leader. Since then, she’s departed the top House Democratic position and stepped off her committees. She’s attended 11 inaugurations so far; her first was President John F. Kennedy’s.

Tim Scott scoops then deletes Moody Senate announcement	Senate GOP campaign Chair Tim Scott welcomed Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody to the Senate on X — minutes before Gov. Ron DeSantis actually announced his pick for the open seat. In a quickly deleted tweet, Scott congratulated Moody on her appointment saying she’s a 'proven conservative fighter' for President-elect Donald Trump and has been a 'national leader on border security,' according to a screenshot of the tweet provided to POLITICO. DeSantis shortly after named Moody as his choice to fill the seat of Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump’s secretary of State nominee. Scott was elected to serve as chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee for the 2026 cycle.

Rep. Rick Crawford expected to serve as House Intelligence chair	Speaker Mike Johnson is expected to choose Rep. Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) as the next chair of the House Intelligence Committee, two people familiar with Johnson's intentions said. Johnson on Wednesday removed former Chair Mike Turner (R-Ohio) in a move that stunned even some Republicans on the panel.

DeSantis picks Florida AG Ashley Moody to replace Rubio in the Senate	Gov. Ron DeSantis has selected state Attorney General Ashley Moody to become the next senator from Florida. The elevation of Moody into the role, once Sen. Marco Rubio resigns to be President-elect Donald Trump’s secretary of State, installs a close DeSantis ally — someone who was the first and only state Cabinet-level official to endorse the governor in the 2024 Republican presidential primary over Trump. The seat will open up soon, with Rubio on a glide path to become Trump’s secretary of State shortly after he is inaugurated. Moody will hold the seat through at least a 2026 special election.

Progressive Hill staff group pitches lighter workweek	As the second Donald Trump presidential term dawns, some progressive Capitol Hill staffers are floating a bold new proposal: working less. The Congressional Progressive Staff Association proposed establishing a rotating 32-hour workweek on the Hill in a letter to top House and Senate leaders Thursday, saying reduced hours could 'improve worker satisfaction, increase staff retention in Congress, and model a more sustainable approach to work on a national level.' Under the proposal, congressional staffers would still work long hours when their boss is around. But when Congress is in session, district office staffers would be entitled to an abbreviated, 20-percent-lighter schedule, and when it is not, D.C.-bas...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/16/congress/32-hour-capitol-hill-workweek-00198640	2025-01-16T07:29:51-08:00	
Freedom Caucus pushes two-step reconciliation proposal, countering Johnson’s plan	The House Freedom Caucus is pushing against Speaker Mike Johnson’s plan to pass major GOP priorities. The ultra-conservative group made their preference for a two-step reconciliation plan official on Thursday, releasing a proposal that calls for an initial bill that would reverse Biden administration policies, fund border security and raise the debt ceiling for two years. The Freedom Caucus noted that this plan leaves room for a second reconciliation package with tax cuts, though it didn’t detail what conservatives want that legislation to look like.

Dems press Garland to release report on Trump charges	House Judiciary Committee Democrats are urging Attorney General Merrick Garland, in his final days in office, to release special counsel Jack Smith’s report on Donald Trump’s alleged mishandling and concealment of classified documents — even if it means dropping criminal charges against his alleged accomplices. 'It is essential that the American people and Congress understand how Mr. Trump mishandled our nation’s most sensitive classified information, especially because he will be sworn in as Commander-in-Chief and take leadership of our national security apparatus in just five days,' the Committee Democrats, led by write ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), wrote in a letter obtained by POLITICO.

Why Can't Mike Johnson and John Thune Just Get Along?	Ask Congress’ top two leaders about each other, and you’ll hear all the expected pleasantries — on the surface. When I asked Speaker Mike Johnson about Senate Majority Leader John Thune at a POLITICO Live event Tuesday, he was quick to praise the South Dakotan as a 'principled' and 'experienced' counterpart. He called Thune a straight shooter and spoke graciously about a recent dinner they’d shared with their wives. Thune, in turn, commended his 'strong working relationship' with Johnson in a 'Meet the Press' interview earlier this month and said he was ready to give 'deference to how he runs the House.'

Senate Democrats circulating memo alleging Bessent tax dodges	Senate Democrats are circulating a memo claiming that President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, improperly claimed nearly $2 million in tax losses and owes nearly $1 million in taxes related to his hedge fund — providing ready ammunition for them as Bessent goes before the Finance Committee on Thursday. The memo obtained by POLITICO, which was prepared by Finance Committee staff under ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), alleges Bessent should have paid $910,182 in taxes for income he made through his hedge fund, the Key Square Group, from 2021 through 2023. Bessent was able to avoid that income because he claimed he was a 'limited partner' not making decisions for Key Squa...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/15/senate-democrats-memo-scott-bessent-tax-dodges-00198567	2025-01-15T18:10:31-08:00	https://static.politico.com/75/44/c3434dd647fcb58cecaef75c0107/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2189258295
JD Vance hosts $250k-a-plate fundraiser in Palm Beach	Vice president-elect JD Vance hosted a who’s who of Trump-world types Wednesday at a ritzy, $250,000-a-plate fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, according to a person who attended the event and was granted anonymity to disclose details about it. The event, hosted at French restaurant Le Bilboquet, is an early example of Vance’s desire to position himself as heir-apparent to Trump and his 'America First' political movement. Donald Trump Jr., who was key in his father’s decision to name Vance as his No. 2, attended. Vance has been the presumed MAGA standard-bearer since Trump picked him as his running mate in July. But the fundraiser appears aimed at demonstrating he has not only the vision but the fundraising chops to inherit the Trump legacy.

Everything's on the table': Jordan mulls calling Jack Smith to Judiciary	House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan says he is mulling whether to call Jack Smith, the special counsel who led the federal investigations into President-elect Donald Trump, to testify before his committee. 'Everything’s on the table,' Jordan told reporters Wednesday. 'I’m just now looking at his report.' Smith led cases around Trump’s retention of classified documents after his first term in office, and Trump's efforts overturn the results of the 2020 election. This month, Smith released his report into the election subversion case, arguing that he would have been able to obtain a conviction had Trump not won reelection in 2024, making him immune to prosecution.

Johnson removes Mike Turner as Intel chair	Speaker Mike Johnson has removed Mike Turner as chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, according to three people familiar with the decision. House GOP hardliners and other Republicans have been pressing for Johnson to remove Turner for months; he’s made many enemies over his handling of key intelligence matters, including a major internal battle over a surveillance bill. The Ohio Republican has been an outspoken advocate for Ukraine funding and other hawkish national security stances. Still, the decision blindsided many members who remain loyal to Turner, including some current Intelligence panel members.	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/15/johnson-removes-mike-turner-as-intel-chair-00198522	2025-01-15T14:32:29-08:00	https://static.politico.com/a5/71/a893d60d48f599226f1eb050ba55/u-s-congress-13372.jpg
Trump’s pick for budget chief echoes his ‘power of the purse’ dreams	Russell Vought wouldn't commit to having the federal government spend all the money Congress approves. The issue came up during his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday, where he testified before lawmakers in pursuit of a second tour as White House budget director for President-elect Donald Trump. Vought famously froze aid to Ukraine and Puerto Rico the first time he ran the Office of Management and Budget during the first Trump administration. Now that Trump is claiming so-called 'impoundment' law is unconstitutional, senators in both parties are eager to hear Vought promise to spend federal cash as Congress intends.

Bondi won’t promise to enforce TikTok ban	Attorney general nominee Pam Bondi declined to say Wednesday whether she would enforce the law set to kick in on Sunday that would ban the popular social media app TikTok if it isn’t sold to a new owner. While Bondi vowed to follow the law on other subjects, she was evasive when Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pressed her on whether she would make sure that the ban takes effect despite the fact that President-elect Donald Trump has urged the Supreme Court to put the law on hold. 'That is pending litigation within the Department of Justice. … I can’t discuss pending litigation,' Bondi said. The Supreme Court heard arguments last Friday on cases challenging the constitutionality of ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/pam-bondi-on-tiktok-ban-00198394	2025-01-15T08:43:34-08:00	
Trump zeroes in on Sean Plankey to lead U.S. cyber agency	The Trump transition team is honing in on Sean Plankey as its choice to be the next director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, according to three people familiar with the matter. Any decision about who will head the roughly $3 billion Department of Homeland Security agency is not official until President-elect Donald Trump announces his pick for the Senate-confirmed role, the three people cautioned. But Plankey, a senior cyber policy official from Trump’s first administration and a veteran of the Pennsylvania National Guard and U.S. Coast Guard, is firmly the leading contender at this point in the process. The CISA Director announcement and those for other senior cybersecurity roles in the new administration 'are expected soon,' said one of the people, who like the o...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/sean-plankey-likely-to-lead-u-s-cyber-agency-00198382	2025-01-15T08:32:44-08:00	
Rubio: US diplomats should support Trump mission	Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio says he’s willing to promote career diplomats to top posts, including ambassadorships, but indicated that the candidates must be in step with the Trump administration’s foreign policy vision. Rubio, speaking Wednesday to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stressed that he wasn’t talking about partisan politics. But his comments are a sign that the incoming administration won’t tolerate much dissent in the diplomatic ranks. 'I’m not talking about political alignment,' Rubio said. 'I’m talking about alignment with the mission that we’ve outlined for American foreign policy, which is one of the things that I think has hurt the State Department under numerous administrations.' The last time Donald Trump was president, he and his team grew wary of Sta...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/rubio-us-diplomats-should-support-trump-mission-00198360	2025-01-15T08:13:07-08:00	
Rubio: ‘Top priority’ of State Department will be US interests	Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to be secretary of State, on Wednesday vowed that the 'top priority' of U.S. foreign policy 'will be the United States' as he outlined his life story and his goals if confirmed to be America’s top diplomat. In his remarks before his colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio outlined that under Trump and him, the State Department will put forward policies that make America 'more prosperous' and avoid past mistakes where 'America far too often continued to prioritize the 'global order' above our core national interests.' Rubio, who remains in the Senate until he is confirmed, received a chummy and friendly response from the foreign policy panel.

Bondi vows she won’t pursue DOJ ‘enemies list’ — but defends Patel	Attorney General nominee Pam Bondi promised the Senate Judiciary Committee that she won’t use her power to pursue a so-called 'enemies list,' even as she defended FBI Director nominee Kash Patel’s vow to target a list of people he views as 'government gangsters.' 'There will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice,' Bondi said under questioning from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). Asked to defend a comment she made on Fox News last year declaring that 'the prosecutors will be prosecuted' and 'the investigators will be investigated,' Bondi noted Wednesday that she also referred in that interview to focusing on 'bad' prosecutors.

Former Bernie Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir enters DNC Chair race	Faiz Shakir, who led Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign, is jumping into the race for chair of the Democratic National Committee — injecting a new candidate into the low-key contest. Shakir confirmed his candidacy in a text message to POLITICO. The New York Times first reported Shakir’s decision. Shakir’s late entrance into the race could shake up a contest that has largely focused on party mechanics rather than its ideology. In a letter to DNC members, Shakir said he’s become 'frustrated' by the 'lack of vision and conviction for what to do to restore a deeply damaged Democratic brand,' prompting his decision to join the race.

Bondi sidesteps question of whether Biden won the 2020 election	Pam Bondi, Donald Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, repeatedly declined to say Wednesday that Joe Biden won the 2020 election, saying he was 'duly sworn in' but sidestepping a question about whether he was the legal winner of the contest. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Bondi’s refusal to answer the 'yes or no' question was concerning and he encouraged her to listen to Trump’s hourlong call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which Trump asked Georgia officials to 'find' enough votes to reverse the outcome. Bondi said she’d only heard a clip. Durbin pressed Bondi on how she would advise Trump on clemency decisions for people who attacked police officers on Jan. 6, 2021.

Pam Bondi, Trump's AG pick, says ‘partisan’ weaponization of DOJ ‘will be gone’	President elect Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general Pam Bondi is being questioned by the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Democrats are expected to press her on whether she will prioritize loyalty to Trump over her constitutional duty. In her opening statement, the former Florida attorney general emphasized to lawmakers that she would not use the federal law enforcement agency to attack political rivals and endeavor to 'restore confidence and integrity' to the department. Trump has repeatedly suggested in his second term he would leverage his prosecutorial power against adversaries. 'The partisanship, the weaponization will be gone,' Bondi said in her statement.

It may be an indication that there will be a heavy focus on policy in the second Trump administration. Worthington and Vince Haley, the incoming director of the domestic policy council, crafted policy-infused speeches for Trump on the campaign trail, as well as the first drafts of scripts Trump used to record the policy videos that appeared on his campaign website. Trump praised his speechwriters but frequently went off script and had a habit of freelancing large portions of his speeches before returning to the teleprompter.

Ernst told an Iowa radio show that said the former Fox News host was able to adequately answer all her questions during his confirmation hearing before the Armed Services Committee. 'He pointed out the woke issues at the Pentagon and I think we’re at a point where now we can start moving forward. People know where he stands on these issues,' Ernst said.

‘Throwing mud up against the wall’: E&C Republicans plot health care cost savings	Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans met Tuesday to discuss where they might find billions of dollars in potential cuts to existing health care programs — including by making changes to the safety-net program Medicaid.

Addressing the debt limit in reconciliation is not 'completely foreclosed,' Johnson said at a POLITICO Live event, but he said House leaders were 'looking at all options.' 'I'm not wed to any of them,' he said. Striking a deal with Democrats to raise the debt ceiling would enrage the House’s conservative hard-liners.

Bannon on Musk: He doesn’t have that much power	Steve Bannon taunted his fellow Trump ally Elon Musk on Tuesday, telling POLITICO that the president-elect’s billionaire right-hand-man doesn’t have all that much power. Bannon, a former chief strategist for Trump and host of the 'War Room' podcast, told POLITICO White House bureau chief Dasha Burns that Musk has had some influence over Cabinet picks and policy discussions but that he doesn’t 'have the ability to actually make decisions and inform those decisions and drive those decisions.' As Trump’s big-tent GOP returns to power, Bannon and Musk have served as a prime example of the infighting already underway — and the challenges it will pose to the incoming president. Allies argue<...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/14/bannon-on-musk-he-doesnt-have-that-much-power-00198060	2025-01-14T06:34:16-08:00	http://vod.politico.com/media/v1/pmp4/static/clear/1155968404/11ac5a01-b9de-4196-9a56-2fa308db3524/314cf305-8720-4eae-8f61-22e18678fde5/main.mp4

How healthy are Donald Trump’s nominees?	President-elect Donald Trump’s top nominees are about to go under the Senate spotlight. Hearings kick off on Tuesday, and while some of Trump’s most controversial picks appear to be on track for confirmation, others remain short of the support they need, according to conversations with a half-dozen GOP senators and aides. This week’s public questioning could be decisive: 'Right now, I think it looks like smooth sailing, but sometimes unexpected things happen,' Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said. With a 53-seat majority and incoming Vice President JD Vance available to break ties, the nominees could be in trouble if they lose support from more than three GOP senators. Several Republicans, whose comments are bei...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/14/donald-trump-cabinet-nominees-health-check-00196964	2025-01-14T02:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/c5/dc/c28d5f7e4897b94796cd64fb62f7/main-debonismeyers-noms-in-peril-revise.jpg

‘Non-starter’: California Democrats blast GOP’s fire trade	Democrats are rejecting a tentative pitch by House Republicans to attach wildfire aid to a federal debt limit increase. GOP lawmakers began floating the idea in meetings this weekend with incoming President Donald Trump. The thinking behind the plan, according to House Republicans, is that they’ll need bipartisan support to raise the cap on federal borrowing authority in the coming months and that including assistance for fire-stricken Southern California would be an incentive for Democrats to help solve one of Trump’s most pressing economic problems this year. But Democrats are refusing to entertain the deal. 'Why would you be trying to link completely unrelated issues?' California Rep.

Senate Veterans’ Affairs Chair Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) said in a statement Monday that Collins has submitted necessary paperwork in a 'timely manner' and has been 'transparent and forthcoming' with the panel.

The notion that Congress could make the release of disaster relief dollars conditional upon also agreeing to raise the debt ceiling is already facing pushback from some Democrats.

Moon over Mars? Congress is determined to kill Elon Musk’s space dream.	Trump confidant Elon Musk wants NASA to drop its ambitious plans to return to the moon and instead head straight to Mars. Congress is ready to put up a fight. Republican and Democratic lawmakers, who control NASA’s purse strings, want Americans to return to the lunar surface in 2027 — and they’re not willing to abandon that mission despite Musk’s obsession with skipping the moon for Mars. The division sets up a potential showdown with Republican policymakers and the influential Trump ally over one of the most consequential space policy decisions this century. President-elect Donald Trump has, at least for now, stayed out of the fray. His first administration launched NASA’s plans to land on the moon, but he has also pressed the agency on why it can’t go directly to Mars.

Speaking on CBS' 'Face the Nation,' the Wyoming Republican said: 'When President Trump takes office next Monday, there is going to be shock and awe with executive orders. A blizzard of executive orders on the economy, as well as on the border.' Executive orders, for better or worse, allow a president to bypass Congress. But Barrasso, the new Senate majority whip, said that he expects Trump to also rely on the narrow Republican majority in the Senate and even more slender one in the House to get his agenda enacted.

Two months after Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to Donald Trump, the joint fundraising committee her campaign set up with the Democratic National Committee is still charging monthly recurring donors to the committee.

The Art of the Deal (Greenland edition)	It’s likely that few people started off this week expecting that president-elect Donald Trump’s desire to buy Greenland would be a standout story. Or that Trump’s insistence on taking back the Panama Canal and renaming the Gulf of Mexico 'The Gulf of America.' Or his continued references to Canada as America’s '51st State' while threatening our northern neighbor with a 25 percent tariff. It may appear that Trump is playing a practical joke on the world by making these proposals. But maybe not. There’s at least one prominent voice who thinks that maybe there’s a method to his madness, some clear goals and a few bedrock principles guiding them: Michael Froman, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and President Barack Obama’s second U.S. trade representative.

A delay in GOP’s tax plans could push up costs by hundreds of billions	The price of extending Republicans’ tax cuts will surge by hundreds of billions of dollars if lawmakers dawdle, new government figures show. The Treasury Department released numbers Friday showing that rolling over all of the soon-to-lapse provisions, as well as undoing other reductions in business benefits that were triggered by the 2017 law, would cost $5.5 trillion — substantially more than the $4 trillion the Congressional Budget Office has projected. There’s a number of reasons why Treasury’s price tag is much higher but a big one is that its analysis begins in 2026, not 2025, like CBO’s. That may not sound like a big deal, but when budget analysts estimate the price of legislation, they look at the anticipated expenses over a decade, and it makes a huge difference when the cost-count...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/10/congress/gop-tax-plan-delay-costs-00197566	2025-01-10T13:21:45-08:00

How they got here: Simon bested a fellow Democrat, Jennifer Tran, in the general election for this solidly Democratic seat based in Oakland. She won 65 percent to 35 percent.

OMB nominee Russell Vought pledges to divest from Bitcoin upon confirmation	A newly released financial disclosure for Russell Vought, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to run the Office of Management and Budget, shows he has both Bitcoin and college savings plans among his assets. Vought, a prominent contributor to the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 who led the powerful office during the first Trump administration, is on track to lead the agency a second time around in reviewing federal regulations and developing the president’s budget. He lists Bitcoin valuing between $1,001 and $15,000 among his assets, but he has pledged to get rid of them 'as soon as practical but not later than 90 days after my confirmation,' according to <a href='https://www.politico.co...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/10/congress/vought-financial-disclosure-trump-00197568	2025-01-10T10:15:01-08:00	
Senate Democratic moderates say they want to work with GOP on tax cuts	A group of eleven moderate Senate Democrats say they want to work with Republicans on addressing the GOP's expiring tax cuts and raising the debt ceiling. In a new letter to Republicanleaders, they say they are willing to cut spending, protect family-oriented tax policies, have 'competitive' rates on businesses — and that they can provide enough votes to allow Republicans to overcome a filibuster in the Senate without having to resort to so-called reconciliation. The lawmakers say they’re otherwise worried Republica...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/10/congress/senate-democrats-moderates-gop-tax-cuts-00197389	2025-01-10T10:01:56-08:00	
Oversight Chair plans meeting with Patel to plot take-down of ‘Deep State’	House Oversight and Government Reform Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) plans to meet next week with Kash Patel, President-elect Donald Trump’s yet-to-be-confirmed pick to run the FBI, to discuss how he can be an ally in the new administration’s efforts to root out the so-called Deep State. 'I want [Patel] to know that our committee will assist in any way possible to help him disrupt the ‘Deep State,’' Comer said in an interview on Thursday, referring to the conspiracy of illicit power-players running the government. Patel, who if confirmed would replace Christopher Wray as head of the FBI, has come under scrutiny for suggesting he intends to go after Trump’s political adversaries. But Trump’s allies, including Comer, have argued that Wray failed to address bias at the agency that they claim has b...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/10/congress/comer-patel-fbi-trump-00197551	2025-01-10T09:56:36-08:00	
Trump says hush money sentence means Democrats have lost the ‘Witch Hunt’	Donald Trump framed Friday’s sentencing hearing as a win, saying the sentence that will leave him unpunished for his felony conviction in the Manhattan hush money case means the 'Radical Democrats have lost another pathetic, unAmerican Witch Hunt.' 'That result alone proves that, as all Legal Scholars and Experts have said, THERE IS NO CASE, THERE WAS NEVER A CASE, and this whole Scam fully deserves to be DISMISSED,' Trump said in a post on Truth Social shortly after the proceeding ended.

Donald Trump appears on screen as his Manhattan hush money sentencing begins	Donald Trump’s sentencing for his criminal conviction in the hush money case is now underway in Manhattan criminal court. Trump isn’t in the room, but instead is appearing virtually. His image is broadcast on several large screens in the courtroom. On the video feed, he is seated next to his attorney Todd Blanche, and there are two American flags positioned in the background between them. Appearing in person is Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office prosecuted the case in which Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts of concealing a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Aside from Bragg and his prosecutors, the judge, a lawyer for Trump and a handful of sketch artists, the courtroom is largely occupied by several dozen reporters.

Trump discusses his viral moment with Obama	Donald Trump is talking about what appeared to be a warm moment between him and Barack Obama. Trump concedes the pair did seem to be on friendly terms when cameras captured them chatting, and Obama laughing as they sat next to each other Thursday at the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter. The president-elect was asked about it later in a Fox News interview from his home in Florida. 'It did look very friendly, I must say,' Trump said. 'I didn’t realize how friendly it looked. I saw it on your wonderful network, just a little while ago before I came in and I said 'Boy, they look like two people that like each other.' And we probably do,' he said.

Trump’s pick for Sweden ambassador didn’t clear the Senate when he nominated her the last time	Donald Trump is trying again with Christine Jack Toretti — this time nominating her to serve as the next ambassador to Sweden. During his last administration, Trump tapped Toretti, a businesswoman and GOP fundraiser, as his pick to become the ambassador to Malta. The Senate never confirmed her, returning her nomination in 2019 and again in 2020, with Democrats questioning the quality of some of Trump’s nominees.

The prime minister joined Jake Tapper in studio Thursday for his first one-on-one interview since he announced plans to resign from high office by March at the latest.

The theme of Adams’ SOTC? He's alive.	RISING FROM HIS GRAVE: Mayor Eric Adams’ State of the City address had a blaring message: I’m not just here — I’m thriving. 'Even dark moments are not burials, they’re plantings,' Adams said. 'Allow your planting to happen and you'll see the fruits of your labor. Mommy did it, and that's why I'm mayor.' The first New York City mayor in modern history to be indicted on criminal charges wants the world to know that the federal corruption indictment, the sinking poll numbers and the flurry of federal raids and mass resignations hasn’t chipped his self-belief one bit — lest there had been any doubt.

'Promises to help working people sound nice, but they mean nothing without real results,' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in kicking off the new Congress.

House Judiciary Chair to keep Hunter Biden investigation alive	The House Judiciary Committee will continue its probe into the criminal investigation of Hunter Biden, committee chair Jim Jordan said in an interview on Thursday. It’s a sure sign that, even as President Joe Biden prepares to leave office, his family will still face scrutiny from Republicans — and that the sweeping pardon of his son is unlikely to serve as a total shield for the next four years. Donald Trump and his allies have suggested they will go after the President-elect’s adversaries during his second stint at the White House, and Trump has tapped a number of his loyalists to drive his agenda at the Department of Justice.

Large swath of Senate Dems vote to advance GOP’s immigration bill	Senate Democrats overwhelmingly helped advance the GOP's first bill to address illegal immigration on Thursday, a signal the legislation could pass next week. Only nine Democrats voted against moving forward on the legislation, and even party leaders like Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.) voted to advance it. However, some of those Democrats have pushed to make amendments to the bill — something Republicans are unlikely to allow — so its prospects for passage are still unclear. The bill is named after a Georgia nursing student murdered by an undocumented immigrant last year and would mandate the detention of undocumented immigrants who are charged with theft or burglary. It passed the House earlier this week with notable bipartisan support.	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/09/congress/laken-riley-act-advances-in-senate-00197364	2025-01-09T12:34:58-08:00

Congress could wait until mid-March to consider new wildfire aid	Congress may not consider new aid for California to deal with its devastating spate of wildfires until mid-March, when Capitol Hill faces its next government funding deadline. Lawmakers see March 14 — the spending deadline — as the next chance to address any emergencies that may need congressional cash, including the blazes sweeping through Los Angeles County. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) said they’d address it in that negotiation, not in an upcoming budget reconciliation bill. 'You’ve got to wait until the disaster is over.

Then again, Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren are Democrats who represent Massachusetts, and Kennedy is… a Kennedy, the son of a Democratic senator and nephew of two other Democratic senators. Kennedy’s decision to meet with the Bay State’s Senate delegation on Thursday shows, to some political insiders, the lasting power of the Kennedy name in the state, which launched the political careers of Kennedy’s namesake father and uncles John F.

Heinrich urges Lee to delay hearing for Trump's Energy nominee	Senate Energy and Natural Resources ranking member Martin Heinrich is warning Chair Mike Lee to wait to schedule a confirmation hearing for Chris Wright, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for Energy secretary, until he receives all relevant paperwork. Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, sent a letter to Lee on Wednesday that urged the Utah Republican to follow the committee’s 'longstanding precedence and take seriously your constitutional responsibilities' by sharing final FBI background checks, financial disclosures and an ethics agreement before issuing a notice for a hearing for Wright, the CEO of fracking services company Liberty Ener...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/08/congress/delay-sought-for-hearing-for-energy-secretary-00197234	2025-01-08T18:12:55-08:00	
Trump sounds off on LA fires, Greenland and the border as he emerges from Hill talks on his legislative agenda	President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday that the wildfires ripping through the Los Angeles region were 'a true tragedy' and blamed the disaster in part on the state’s Democratic governor. Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill after meeting with Republican lawmakers, Trump criticized Gov. Gavin Newsom for the scarcity of water that has made it harder to fight fires that have killed at least five people. He didn't explain what the governor could have done about the dry, windy conditions. 'This is a true tragedy and it’s a mistake of the governor, and you could say the administration,' Trump said.'The governor has not done a good job,' Trump said. 'With that being said, I got along well with him when he was governor, we worked together very well. And we would work together — I guess it lo...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/08/congress/trump-on-the-hill-00197229	2025-01-08T17:57:20-08:00	
Dem support of immigration bill latest sign of vanishing Trump resistance	In 2019, at the height of the anti-Trump resistance, several Democrats running for president staked out an unapologetically progressive position on immigration. Asked at a debate if they would support decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings, the vast majority of White House hopefuls on stage raised their hands, making the calculation that the fired-up liberal base was appalled at then-President Donald Trump’s handling of the border and wanted a radically different approach. The Washington Post reported at the time that White H...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/08/democrats-immigration-trump-laken-riley-00197221	2025-01-08T17:36:53-08:00	https://static.politico.com/c8/41/a7e7d73d48ca9e497833367f286f/u-s-congress-92720.jpg
Senate Judiciary Committee schedules Bondi confirmation hearings	The Senate Judiciary Committee has officially slotted two days for confirmation hearings for President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi. The former Florida attorney general who served as Trump’s personal lawyer during his first impeachment trial is set to appear before lawmakers next Wednesday, January 15, and Thursday, January 16. As the nation's top prosecutor, Bondi would play a key role in implementing Trump’s regulatory agenda and defending the actions of his administration in court. She is Trump's second choice for attorney general following the implosion over the incoming president's initial selection for the job, former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who was the subject of a House Ethics Committee report alleging the ex-congressman committed statutory rape and u...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/08/congress/bondi-judiciary-trump-confirmation-00197214	2025-01-08T16:22:04-08:00

Rep. Rob Menendez won a competitive election for an open seat on the Energy and Commerce committee	Rep. Rob Menendez (D-N.J.) beat out a crowded field of Democratic lawmakers Wednesday for a coveted spot on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, according to three people familiar with the results granted anonymity to share the unofficial verdict. The second-term lawmaker bested a field that had originally grown as large as ten Democrats after eight rounds of voting. Seven slots had been open on the panel, of which six had been doled out Tuesday by the largely leadership-appointed Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. The seventh slot was kicked to an election among the steering committee members. Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) won a seat on the committee Tuesday along with Reps. Kevin Mullin (Calif.), Troy Carter (La.), Jennifer McClellan (Va.), Greg Landsman (Oh...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/08/congress/new-energy-and-commerce-member-00197208	2025-01-08T15:27:39-08:00	
Meta is trying to repair its relationship with Republicans. It seems to be working.	Big Tech is working overtime to mend its relationship with Republicans as the party takes full control of Washington. It looks like it’s paying off. In a brief interview, Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), previously a huge critic of Meta, indicated he’s turned over a new leaf with the company. Meta announced Tuesday it would end its third-party fact-checking, among other changes that would move the company in line with Elon Musk’s X. Joel Kaplan, a Bush administration alumnus who just recently started leading the company’s global affairs operation, announced the moves on 'Fox &amp; Friends.' He personally gave Jordan a heads-up the day before, during what the Ohio Republican called a 'great call.' Jordan said he hopes his onetime adversary, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, will be an ally in t...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/08/meta-relationship-republicans-zuckerberg-jordan-00197192	2025-01-08T14:59:03-08:00	https://static.politico.com/67/55/7608d1af49fca7f060d381ffa548/u-s-congress-19890.jpg
Johnson: Reconciliation path likely decided by Thursday	Republicans appear close to settling on a strategy for passing President-elect Donald Trump’s sweeping border security, energy and tax agenda. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said in a brief interview Wednesday evening that House and Senate GOP leaders are likely to make a final decision by Thursday about how they’ll pursue the budget reconciliation process to enact their policy priorities and extend expiring tax cuts. 'We’re coordinating both chambers to align them and we’ll make those final decisions, I think, probably by tomorrow,' said Johnson. Privately, House GOP leaders are optimistic key senators are getting behind Johnson’s push for one massive reconciliation bill, a procedural maneuver that allows the majority party to advance a legislative package without relying on the minor...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/08/congress/johnson-trump-reconciliation-strategy-00197187	2025-01-08T14:55:37-08:00

Democratic doctors in the House condemn RFK Jr., plan new caucus	Democratic doctors in Congress said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, would pose a danger to public health if confirmed. Rep. Kim Schrier (D-Wash.), a pediatrician, said the Democratic physicians in the House, who now number six, would form a caucus to elevate their voices in Congress. The lawmakers said Kennedy’s anti-vaccine activism was 'beyond irresponsible' and 'should disqualify' him to lead HHS in a press conference on Wednesday, suggesting a Kennedy confirmation would cause more to die of preventable diseases, referencing Kennedy longstanding efforts to discourage vaccination. Schrier joined Reps. Ami Bera (D-Calif.), Herb Conaway (D-N.J.) and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, all physicians, as well as Rep.
