Michigan Democrats make another run at Shri Thanedar	Michigan Democrats are once again plotting to oust Rep. Shri Thanedar. The Indian American Democrat has held a plurality Black district in the Detroit metro since 2023, much to the chagrin of the Congressional Black Caucus. Unable to oust Thanedar in 2024, some Black leaders are ready to try again in the midterms. State Rep. Donavan McKinney, a 32-year-old community leader, is seriously considering a run against Thanedar, according to two people who were granted anonymity to discuss his internal deliberations. McKinney, first elected to the state Legislature in 2022, has long been involved in Michigan politics and has ties to the state’s powerful labor unions. He has served as a legislative director in the state House, worked for SEIU Healthcare Michigan and nabbed a spot on Gov. Gretchen ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/28/congress/shri-thanedar-democratic-primary-00206668	2025-02-28T07:30:11-08:00

Capitol agenda: Signs point to a long stopgap	Signs are increasingly pointing to a full-year government funding patch as Congress barrels toward the March 14 shutdown deadline without a deal on overall spending totals. President Donald Trump endorsed 'a clean, temporary government funding Bill … to the end of September' in a social media post Thursday night. That backing came after Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune discussed the idea with Trump during a meeting Wednesday at the White House, two people familiar with the conversation told our colleague Meredi...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/28/congress/doge-musk-cuts-spending-shutdown-00206616	2025-02-28T05:00:00-08:00	
Are Trump and Republicans already baiting a backlash?	Move fast and break things.' It’s an old motto from Silicon Valley. But these days, speed and disruption are also the coin of the realm in Washington. President Donald Trump is moving fast to redefine the government and America’s place in the world; and many of his critics have voiced their concerns that something might get broken in the process. This past week, Trump entertained France and Britain’s heads of state, Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer — both of them courting his favor; he took a bite out of restructuring our relationship with Ukraine; and he promised some added tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. In domestic policy, Speaker Mike Johnson finally advanced a budget resolution that is a crucial step to passing Trump’s agenda through reconciliation. And coming next week, the gro...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/are-trump-and-republicans-already-baiting-a-backlash-00206636	2025-02-28T02:06:22-08:00	https://static.politico.com/c5/55/9e92d5fd4af1b3098106869554f8/unlimiteduse-02-27-2025-britishpm-005.jpg

How 7 states could thwart GOP plans to overhaul Medicaid	Republicans are facing a nationwide backlash over the fate of Medicaid — but the potential program cuts are most threatening in seven conservative-leaning states where voters have cast ballots to expand the entitlement in recent years. It’s a growing problem as Republicans hunt for enough savings to pay for the White House’s proposed tax cuts. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, which has enrolled more than 24,000 people in Medicaid since voters expanded the insurance program for low-income people in 2022, told POLITICO he’s been arguing against some of his own party’s proposals. One would reduce significantly how much funding for the program comes from...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/27/republicans-medicaid-expansion-budget-00206612	2025-02-27T17:20:38-08:00	https://static.politico.com/a8/94/399be49c4da39ca6602a87bcf176/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2201320785
Russia-gate’s long shadow hits the IC	Investigations into Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election dominated the news for much of Donald Trump’s first term in office.

Trump and GOP leaders discuss using tariffs to pay for agenda	GOP leaders and President Donald Trump are strategizing over how to incorporate revenue from new tariffs in their massive party-line domestic policy bill, with the goal of arguing the multitrillion-dollar legislation doesn’t add to the national debt. Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other senior Republicans discussed the topic during their White House meeting Wednesday, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Republicans are still planning to keep the tariffs outside the final reconciliation package. But the group discussed how to score and eventually count the revenue as part of their...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/27/congress/trump-tariffs-gop-agenda-budget-00206556	2025-02-27T13:00:04-08:00	
DOGE cuts eyed for GOP spending bill, raising shutdown fears	Senior Republicans are seriously exploring how to include cuts made by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency in an upcoming government funding bill — a move that would skyrocket tensions with Democrats and drastically raise the potential for a government shutdown. Top GOP leaders and President Donald Trump’s team have been discussing the idea, which is far from finalized, according to three people who were granted anonymity to discuss the conversations. But one of the people said the idea would be to codify some of the 'most egregious' examples of alleged waste that DOGE has identified and incorporate them into a government funding patch ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/27/doge-gop-shutdown-spending-00206536	2025-02-27T12:26:30-08:00	https://static.politico.com/72/82/990aa4df4bd58a98a1882562a46e/u-s-congress-17809.jpg
Senate advances Linda McMahon's nomination to lead Education Department	Education secretary nominee Linda McMahon is one step closer to being confirmed after her nomination cleared a key procedural vote Thursday. The full Senate advanced McMahon’s nomination in a 51-47 vote, setting up the nominee for a final confirmation vote on Monday. The vote was on party lines with no Democrats joining Republicans in moving the nomination. McMahon was grilled by senators earlier this month on her future boss's plans for the Education Department, an agency President Donald Trump has said he wants to close. The president has also said he told McMahon to put herself out of a job.

Walz announcement clears way for Angie Craig in Minnesota Senate race	Gov. Tim Walz’s announcement Wednesday that he would not run for an open Minnesota Senate seat has thawed a frozen field. Now, all eyes turn toward Democratic Rep. Angie Craig. A handful of ambitious Democrats already said they were considering runs after Sen. Tina Smith revealed her surprise retirement earlier this month. But others stayed quiet, watching the former vice presidential candidate closely. By stepping aside, Walz potentially clears the way for Craig, a strong fundraiser who could claim a more centrist lane among a group of left-leaning candidates. In a brief interview Thursday, Craig said she began testing the waters for a run on the day Walz made his decision public.

GOP senators privately push Musk to coordinate more with Congress	Members of the Senate DOGE Caucus, returning from a White House meeting with Elon Musk Thursday afternoon, privately pushed for the billionaire to coordinate more with Congress on his cuts to the federal government. The meeting began with a discussion about retaining important federal employees in the wake of massive firings across federal government, according to Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kansas). And Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) told Musk that it was important for senators to have points of contact within DOGE to address concerns from constituents. 'We want to make sure that we keep all the federal employees that are competent and care about America,' Marshall said.

Dems tap Slotkin to deliver response to Trump's joint address	Hill Democrats on Thursday named Sen. Elissa Slotkin to deliver their response to President Donald Trump’s joint address next week. It’s a high-profile platform for the first-term senator and an early indication that Democrats are looking to emphasize kitchen-table issues after their drubbing in the last election. 'I'm looking forward to speaking directly to the American people next week. The public expects leaders to level with them on what’s actually happening in our country,' Slotkin said in a statement. 'From our economic security to our national security, we’ve got to chart a way forward that actually improves people’s lives in the country we all love, and I’m looking forward to laying that out.'

House Judiciary panel plans discussion on college athlete pay	The House Judiciary Committee is hosting a roundtable on name, image and likeness issues in college athletics in mid-April, according to a person familiar with the planning. Lawmakers have been mulling federal legislation to regulate college athletes' ability to profit off their personal brand for years. In 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the existing NCAA restrictions on compensation amounted to antitrust violations, paving the way for paying college athletes with haphazard government regulations. The NCAA, now led by former Republican Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to lobby Washington in recent years, as Congress considered som...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/27/congress/college-athlete-pay-discussion-00206464	2025-02-27T09:23:07-08:00

Johnson, who met with Musk at the White House late Tuesday, said the billionaire adviser to President Donald Trump would 'meet with either small groups of members, appropriators or maybe all the House Republicans,' likely next week or shortly thereafter. 'He’s anxious to share what he's finding, and a lot of things he's told me in our private meetings, I said we have to make sure all the members understand the degree of the fraud, waste, abuse, and how egregious it is,' Johnson said.	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/27/congress/musk-to-meet-with-house-republicans-00206431	2025-02-27T07:43:59-08:00	
Senators give Trump’s latest budget nominee his first vote of approval	President Donald Trump’s pick for the No. 2 post at the White House budget office cleared his first hoop toward confirmation Thursday morning. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee voted 8-1 to approve the nomination of Dan Bishop to be deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, with ranking member Gary Peters (D-Mich.) the sole 'no' vote. Another panel, the Senate Budget Committee, is next to hold a hearing with the nominee before Republican senators can vote on the floor to confirm him.

Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) joined Republicans in supporting President Donald Trump’s pick to lead DOL. The trio’s support offset a 'no' vote from Sen.

Capitol agenda: Shutdown blame game rages	The shutdown blame game is in full swing on Capitol Hill — a tried-and-true negative sign for stalled government funding talks. State of play: GOP leaders won’t put language in their funding bills to stop President Donald Trump and Elon Musk from clawing back money Congress previously approved — something Democrats have been demanding in exchange for backing a spending deal.

Johnson rules out steepest Medicaid cut options	Speaker Mike Johnson has ruled out some of the biggest potential cuts to Medicaid for Republicans’ party-line package to enact President Donald Trump’s agenda. The House has targeted at least $880 billion in savings from the Energy and Commerce Committee, a task that is expected to require significant reductions to Medicaid spending. That has spurred significant concern among centrist Republicans, many of whom have a lot of Medicaid recipients in their districts. In an interview with CNN’s Kaitlin Collins Wednesday night, Johnson ruled out putting per-capita caps on Medicaid in the eventual budget reconciliation bill.

Musk meets with Johnson as DOGE tension heats up	Speaker Mike Johnson met with Elon Musk late Tuesday night at the White House, according to two people granted anonymity to discuss a private meeting. It comes as the Department of Government Efficiency's slash-and-burn cuts across the federal government are fueling growing tensions with Republican members of Congress. Musk and DOGE, which the tech billionaire helms, have been targets of recent town hall anger in some Republican-held districts.

It was the Senate's first action this year under the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to kill newly-issued rulemakings by simple majority.

The vote went almost entirely along party lines, 217-213, with every Democrat voting against the measure and only GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky joining them.

House budget vote back on as GOP leaders try to convince holdouts	Speaker Mike Johnson rescheduled a vote on the House Republican budget plan shortly after deputies announced it was canceled, creating widespread confusion about the next steps for President Donald Trump’s sweeping domestic policy agenda. The decision to scrap and then rescheduled the vote came after several conservative hard-liners made clear they would not support the fiscal blueprint as written. Adopting the budget measure is a key step toward passing the 'big, beautiful bill' that Trump and Johnson have called for — one that includes border security, tax and energy provisions that the president campaigned on. It is unclear when or if House GOP leaders will bring the measure back up.

Trump last week appeared to endorse Speaker Mike Johnson's bid for 'one big, beautiful bill,' then later in the week praised Senate Majority Leader John Thune as he advanced an alternative plan that would split Trump's agenda into two pieces.

Trump speaks with several holdouts ahead of key budget vote	President Donald Trump is speaking with some House Republican holdouts ahead of an imperiled vote on the GOP’s budget Tuesday evening. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Trump had been 'tremendously' helpful ahead of the critical vote. Speaker Mike Johnson likewise told reporters several House Republicans had called the president as they weighed their votes. Several House Republicans are holding out for a commitment to deeper spending cuts, while others fear that the eventual legislation will cut Medicaid too deeply. Johnson can lose only one vote if all Republicans are present.

Trump’s latest budget nominee avows funding freeze, pledges to follow Vought	The Senate began its public vetting on Tuesday of President Donald Trump’s pick for the No. 2 post at the White House budget office, a position key to carrying out the president’s funding freeze. Dan Bishop, a former congressmember from North Carolina, testified before senators in his first confirmation hearing to be deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. Pledging to follow the orders of Trump and White House budget director Russell Vought, the OMB nominee vowed to 'fix' a federal bureaucracy he characterized as 'self-absorbed, inefficient, unaccountable and mal-administered.' Bishop skirted a direct question about whether he would follow the law, or Trump, if the president directed him to take action that would break the law.

Prospects dim for reviving deal to grow the federal judiciary	Bipartisan talks to add judges to the federal judiciary are over — at least for now. At a Tuesday morning hearing of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet on Tuesday, Republicans and Democrats blamed the other for the demise of a deal last year to add dozens of new judgeships to U.S. courts. House Republicans failed to bring the agreement, in the form of legislation, up for a vote until after President Donald Trump’s election victory. Following its passage on the House floor, then-President Joe Biden vetoed the legislation in a bid to block Trump from being able to add a host of new conservative judges to the bench. 'In my 24 plus years here in Washington, it was the first time I ever saw a bipartisan, bicameral bill vetoed by a President,' said...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/25/congress/judges-trump-judiciary-courts-00206017	2025-02-25T11:20:56-08:00	
House budget plan advances to final floor vote	The House Republican approach to President Donald Trump’s sweeping domestic policy agenda moved a step closer to approval after Republicans stayed united on a test vote, setting up a possible final floor vote Tuesday evening. The Trump-backed fiscal blueprint still faces tough odds on final adoption, with a handful of conservative hard-liners demanding it get rewritten to guarantee deeper spending cuts. Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford one GOP defection on a party-line vote if all members are voting.

Democrats use committee hearing to rail against GOP Medicaid cuts and DOGE	Tensions are boiling over inside the typically bipartisan House Energy and Commerce Committee, with Democrats railing against Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and the GOP’s plan to extend Trump-era tax cuts. With little power in GOP-led Washington, Democrats are hijacking a markup to adopt the committee’s oversight plan to advance their message — both by speechifying and forcing votes on more than 50 likely-doomed amendments on thorny issues like preventing spending cuts to Medicaid, condemning President Donald Trump’s firing of inspectors general and disapproving of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

‘Furious and looking for action’: DOGE is turning into a Democratic candidate recruitment tool	Democrats say sweeping government cuts led by Elon Musk have started to awaken a latent opposition to President Donald Trump — and they’re hoping it will motivate a slew of new down-ballot candidates to run in the years ahead. Early interest in running for office is already beginning to rise — at least one major candidate recruitment organization saw a sharp spike of more than 2,000 new applications pouring in as Musk issued major actions pushing federal workers out. A lot of that web traffic came from Reddit threads of former federal employees considering runs for political office that sprang up last week.

Johnson brushes off Musk, but GOP budget holdouts stand firm	Speaker Mike Johnson said in a brief interview Tuesday he's not worried that a late-night post from Elon Musk signaling concerns with the GOP budget plan could tank support ahead of a vote this evening. 'No concerns,' Johnson said when asked about the post, adding that he felt 'very positive' about the vote’s prospects today. He is still, however, facing an array of opposition.

Top Committee Dem goes after Trump's interim U.S. attorney	Rep. Gerry Connolly, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, plans to investigate Washington’s top prosecutor for making threats against the Trump administration’s political adversaries — including one of his own members. In a letter shared first with POLITICO, Connolly, a Virginia lawmaker, announced he was leading the minority party in a probe against Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. Connolly is requesting materials related to Martin’s inquiries into Democratic officials, arguing that Martin is moving to suppress political expression. One of Martin’s targets is Rep.

The speaker insists he’s not changing the budget resolution, which would set parameters for a sweeping bill to address border security, energy and tax policy. If House Democrats are at full attendance, just two GOP 'no' votes would sink the resolution.

GOP leaders provided some generic but reassuring details about how they would protect certain Medicaid services and not cut into the share of federal payments for Medicaid, a joint state-federal program, according to several lawmakers who attended the late night confab in Johnson's office. A group of swing-district Republicans and others representing redder areas were in the meeting, along with House Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.).

Musk renews his ‘5 things’ demand with Trump’s apparent support	An emboldened Elon Musk is once again directing federal employees to justify their existence in writing — or face dismissal. Musk made his renewed demand in a social media post Monday after President Donald Trump seemed to contradict other senior administration officials and approve the directive that the billionaire initially sent out to workers over the weekend. 'Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance,' Musk wrote on X. 'Failure to respond a second time will result in termination.'

Government funding deal ‘very close’ as negotiations hinge on Trump power struggle	The fight over curbing President Donald Trump’s ability to freeze cash is now the make-or-break dispute as leading lawmakers close in on a deal to avert a government shutdown next month. Top appropriators on both sides of the Capitol reported good progress Monday night toward a bipartisan deal on overall spending totals for the military and non-defense programs, with a shutdown deadline looming on March 14. But House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole said Democrats’ insistence on adding conditions to stop Trump from withholding funding that Congress already appropriated could foil a final agreement.

In an interview at the Capitol on Monday evening, Mills emphasized that both he and the alleged victim — who POLITICO is declining to name as a possible target of domestic violence — denied that any assault took place. The woman initiated the call to law enforcement, but said in a statement afterwards she did so in a state of being 'severely jet-lagged and sleep-deprived' and that there was, in fact, 'no physical altercation.'

Capitol agenda: Johnson's make-or-break budget week	Speaker Mike Johnson doesn't yet have the votes to get his budget plan approved on the House floor. He’s barreling ahead anyway. Johnson is looking to move the budget resolution through House Rules today and to the floor on Tuesday. The former seems likely, at least — the Rules Committee’s conservative hard-liners, Reps. Chip Roy and Ralph Norman, are on board with Johnson’s framework. But Tuesday’s floor vote is ambitious, even with Trump endorsing Johnson’s one-bill strategy for passing the president’s border, energy and tax agenda.

‘Childbirth isn't fun, but it's necessary’: Republicans at CPAC shrug off voter anger at Musk	OXON HILL, Maryland — A political backlash is sneaking up on billionaire Elon Musk and President Donald Trump across America as they take an ax to the government. But inside the gleeful halls of the Conservative Political Action Conference, the vanguard of the Republican Party couldn’t care less. At the annual gathering of conservatives inaugurated by Ronald Reagan, attendees are buying up Musk-related merchandise and the tech mogul is being feted as a chainsaw-wielding warrior taking on the deep state on behalf of Trump.

‘Time is running out’: Lawmakers scramble for a deal to stop a shutdown	A Capitol Hill clash over President Donald Trump’s extraordinary moves to take control of federal spending is upping the chances that lawmakers won’t have a deal to fund the government before a shutdown deadline in just three weeks. Talks between the top appropriators in the House and Senate have soured in the past week, with lawmakers still searching for an agreement on topline spending levels that are a prerequisite for funding individual agencies and programs for the remainder of the fiscal year.

Molly Jong-Fast is thinking about challenging Jerry Nadler	NEW YORK — Novelist turned political journalist Molly Jong-Fast wants somebody 'serious' to run against Rep. Jerry Nadler in 2026 — so she doesn’t have to do it herself. The Vanity Fair correspondent and podcast host has been talking to political consultants about a run against the 77-year-old Manhattan Democrat. But Jong-Fast told POLITICO she’s 'still really on the fence.' 'If someone who is a good communicator and a serious Democrat will run for that seat,' Jong-Fast said in a phone call Friday, 'then I absolutely will not.

DC police probe incident involving Rep. Cory Mills	D.C. police have launched an internal investigation into the department's handling of a Wednesday incident involving an alleged assault by Florida Rep. Cory Mills. Metropolitan Police Department officers were called midday to a home in southwest Washington for a reported assault involving the use of force with hands or feet, according to a police report obtained Friday by POLITICO. A department spokesperson confirmed that Mills, a two-term Republican, is the alleged assailant. No arrest was made, and the matter remains under investigation, a second police spokesperson, Tony Lynch, said. Mills denied wrongdoing in a statement issued by his office Friday: 'This week, law enforcement was asked to resolve a private matter at Congressman Mills’ residence.

Trump talks of a third term amid growing concerns about a constitutional crisis	The Constitution expressly forbids presidents from running for a third term. But that hasn't stopped Donald Trump from raising it repeatedly — and this time from an official White House event. 'Should I run again? You tell me.' Trump said on Thursday before a crowded East Room filled with mostly Black supporters who were there for a Black History Month event held just a month into his second term. The crowd, which included elected officials, like Republicans Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Rep.

Trump continues to muddy the waters on path forward for budget plan	Donald Trump is continuing to complicate the path forward for congressional Republicans, who are desperate for clarity on what the president wants them to do to enact his massive domestic agenda. In comments on Brian Kilmeade’s radio show Friday, Trump openly entertained a notion that the GOP's efforts to extend expiring tax cuts with new policies on border security and energy production may need to be broken up into smaller bills to clear Congress. The Senate approved a budget resolution early in the morning after hours of amendment votes that would pave the way for two bills to accomplish those priorities, while the House is set to muscle through a budget blueprint next week that would set the stage for one piece of legislation encapsulating everything.

Capitol agenda: What you missed in the overnight vote-a-rama	Senate Republicans just approved their budget resolution after a more than 10-hour vote-a-rama. For now, it’s the GOP's 'Plan B,' as President Donald Trump's preferred budget may not have the support to move ahead next week in the House. Senators slogged through 25 roll-call votes on amendments as Democrats tried to squeeze the opposing party and lay the groundwork for 2026 attack ads. Some Republicans grumbled about having to go through the exercise. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) told reporters he spoke to Trump on Thursday evening, relaying that while the president did give a 'little nod' towards the Senate budget in <a href='https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114038732...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/21/congress/senate-budget-trump-thune-00205397	2025-02-21T05:00:00-08:00	
To resist Trump or work with him? This governor says you can do both.	Few things are more authentically Washington than a fly-in. As in, the great capital tradition of getting people from all 50 states into town and unleashing them on the halls of Congress for a few days of lobbying. This week, the group showing up to have their voices heard isn’t local farm bureaus, chambers of commerce or realtors associations. It’s the governors who are here for the National Governors Association’s winter meeting. And the Republicans and Democrats attending have a lot to talk about. The man in charge of the NGA is Colorado Governor Jared Polis, who has taken more than a few unconventional stances on the issues in his two terms as governor, and during his Congressional career before that.

Senate trudges through vote-a-rama to ready a backup budget	Senate Republicans are on track to adopt their budget resolution in the early hours of Friday morning — a bid to show support for a 'Plan B' if House GOP lawmakers can’t unite around their more expansive vision for a party-line package necessary to enact President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda. Senators had voted on more than 10 amendments to their budget resolution before midnight, with plans to continue their 'vote-a-rama' into the night.

Musk gets big cheers — and a chainsaw — at CPAC	Elon Musk was hailed as a chainsaw-wielding slasher of the government at his debut at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Appearing on stage in a gold chain, black MAGA hat and sunglasses, the tech mogul on Thursday boasted about taking on the federal bureaucracy and dismissed the Democratic opposition as fake during a sit-down interview with Newsmax host Rob Schmitt. Asked to give the audience a picture of the inside of his mind, he called it 'a storm.' 'I am become meme,' he told the crowd outside Washington. At one point, Argentine President Javier Milei delivered a gilded chainsaw to Musk on the stage. At another, Musk was handed a sci-fi-themed painting of himself.

It’s a homecoming for Tanden, who was named president and chief executive of CAP Thursday, resuming roles she held before serving in then-President Joe Biden’s administration.

Grassley starts talks with White House on moving judicial nominees	Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley is starting talks with the White House about moving judicial nominees through his committee. 'The only discussion I've had is the process,' the Iowa Republican said in an interview this week. 'Just with the White House Counsel.' The update, however preliminary, signals the start of President Donald Trump’s relaunched efforts to transform the courts. Confirming hundreds of judges — including three Supreme Court justices — was a marquee achievement of Trump's first term that is poised to leave the federal judiciary with a conservative slant for decades. This time around, there aren't many slots for Trump to fill: There are just 43 total vacancies in the federal judiciary, according to <a href='https://www.uscourts.gov/data-news/judicial-vacancies/current...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/20/congress/judges-grassley-white-house-00205308	2025-02-20T14:10:38-08:00	
Welcome to a new era of West Wing Playbook	Donald Trump returned to power exactly one month ago today, and it is hardly possible to overstate the magnitude of the changes he has brought and is seeking to bring to the federal government and to the workings of power in Washington. The modern federal government — and much of the economy that gravitates around government in the nation’s capital — is overwhelmingly the product of a few big historical movements: the New Deal in the 1930s, World War II and the 45 years of Cold War that followed, and the burst of government social and regulatory activism in the 1960s and 1970s. The policies and agencies of government that flowed from those movements shaped national life and the lives of many millions of people for decades. It seems certain that the disruption the Trump administration is pr...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/politico-west-wing-playbook-00205226	2025-02-20T13:30:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/b1/d7/5b89080a4f8283982268e082ace9/politico-cms-shared-graphic-1120x629.jpg

'But if you think about our core principles,' he added, noting the growing national debt: 'I think we need to pay down the credit card.' Johnson again cheered Musk’s efforts to slash the federal government. 'What Elon and the team are doing is what Congress has not had the ability to do,' Johnson said. 'They are exposing this massive fraud, waste and abuse that we have not been unable to uncover because the deep state has hidden it from us.'

Senate stares down an all-nighter to approve a ‘Plan B’ budget Trump spurned	Senate Republicans are embarking Thursday afternoon on an amendment free-for-all expected to keep lawmakers voting through the night — all to green-light a fiscal blueprint President Donald Trump doesn’t favor. The budget measure the Senate is on track to adopt at the end of an arduous 'vote-a-rama' sets a framework for a party-line package of energy policy, defense spending and border security investments.

Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced she would vote against him, saying in a statement that his 'recent political profile undermines his ability to serve in the apolitical role of Director of the FBI.'

The news of McConnell's retirement was described by three people with direct knowledge of the matter. They were granted anonymity to share the news ahead of a formal announcement.

'We've sanitized different language so significantly that, you know, people don't feel like we're talking to them.'

Fresh executive order targets sanctuary cities, federal aid for undocumented migrants	President Donald Trump signed an immigration executive order late Wednesday designed to target sanctuary cities and ensure undocumented immigrants aren’t receiving federal benefits. The order directs federal departments and agencies to identify any federal programs providing financial benefits to undocumented immigrants, while in the same breath acknowledging that under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, undocumented immigrants are already mostly barred from public programs. But the order argues that the Biden administration 'undercut the goal of' temporary parole authority, which allows the government to grant migrants temporary permission to live and work in the U.S., by using it too extensively.

The Republican representative, whose Central Valley district is being bombarded with TV ads pressuring him not to slash Medicaid, is parrying the Democratic-led campaign by withholding his support for a House resolution to cut at least $1.5 trillion from the federal budget — a goal that would be impossible to meet without reductions to <a href='https://www.kff.org/medicaid/poll-finding/public-o...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/david-valadao-medicaid-cuts-congress-00205072	2025-02-20T06:01:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/79/c0/f1318125400890480bde0a10ab73/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1731962721
Capitol agenda: The Senate vote-a-rama is on	Senate GOP leaders are coming dangerously close to defying President Donald Trump, moving forward on their budget resolution today despite his explicit demand for 'both Chambers to pass the House Budget.' Of course, that's not how they see it. Senate Majority Leader John Thune insists their two-track version is a back-up plan if the House can't rally the votes for its budget paving the way for 'one big, beautiful bill' that includes immigration, energy and tax policy. And even as Vice President JD Vance backed up the president when he came to a private GOP lunch on Wednesday, senators indicated he <a href='https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/19/congress/vote-a-rama...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/20/congress/senate-trump-thune-budget-agenda-00205076	2025-02-20T05:00:00-08:00	
The 6 most urgent policy questions we have for America’s governors	Governors are scrambling to figure out the most effective way to respond to the seismic changes unleashed in the opening weeks of the Trump administration. The basic calculus is clear: Democrats are searching for ways to thwart the White House’s most sweeping actions, while Republicans are desperate to show they’re fully on board with the MAGA agenda. But beneath that crude dynamic, the deliberations happening in state capitals are far more nuanced and politically fraught. Democrats are wary of simply mounting a scorched-earth resistance to President Donald Trump’s policies given the GOP’s sweeping victories on Election Day. That’s especially true on immigration, where the president’s hard-line tactics have resonated even with voters in deep blue swaths of the country. Republicans, meanwhi...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/six-policy-questions-american-governors-00203907	2025-02-20T02:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/5d/f3/d677a34a45e89abc3c92ca81a3a1/fifty-demko-govsummit.jpg

Republicans fret over giving Cruz broad subpoena power of key committee	Sen. Ted Cruz’s bid for broad subpoena powers as chair of the Senate Commerce Committee is facing consternation even among some Republicans who worry about giving their colleague so much control. It puts the Texas Republican in an awkward position as he seeks to find his footing as the leader of a powerful committee with jurisdiction over some of the major issues facing Congress under a new Republican governing trifecta. After nearly a month of uncertainty, GOP members of the Senate Commerce Committee met last week to discuss whether to give their chair unilateral authority to haul Big Tech CEOs before the panel, according to two people familiar with the private meeting.

Republicans in Hispanic-heavy districts push Johnson not to slash Medicaid or SNAP	Eight House Republicans who are members of the Hispanic conference or represent large Hispanic populations are publicly pressing Speaker Mike Johnson to not slash Medicaid, food assistance and Pell Grants in his budget plan. The group’s new letter to Johnson Wednesday is a serious escalation of private concerns lawmakers have been airing in recent days. House GOP leaders are pressing for rank-and-file lawmakers to back the latest budget plan on the House floor next week — the next step to unlock their massive, party-line bill that spans energy, border and tax policy.

Vance keeps Senate budget plan alive	Vice President JD Vance told Senate Republicans on Wednesday that Donald Trump prefers the House’s one-bill approach to his legislative agenda. But Vance didn’t put a stake in the Senate’s competing approach — as a backup. Senate Republicans took the message, delivered during a closed-door lunch, as a sign that they have a green light from the administration to move forward with their two-bill budget plan this week. It would tee up a border, defense and energy bill, saving an overhaul of the tax code for a separate bill later this year. 'We’re moving forward tomorrow,' Senate Budget Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said after the lunch. 'The president prefers one big, beautiful bill — so do I — but you always need a Plan B around here.'

Collins: Spending negotiations ‘not going well’ ahead of March shutdown cliff	Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins told reporters Wednesday afternoon that funding negotiations with Democrats 'are not going well' as lawmakers stare down a government shutdown deadline in just over three weeks. It usually takes congressional leaders at least a month to finalizing a dozen annual funding bills after top appropriators strike an initial agreement on overall totals for the military and non-defense programs. But Collins (R-Maine) and her fellow top appropriators have yet to strike that 'toplines' agreement to lay the groundwork for negotiating the details of the 12 bills — and the shutdown deadline on March 14 is quickly ticking closer.

Trump stuns Senate GOP with House budget endorsement	Republicans on Capitol Hill have long wanted President Donald Trump to weigh in on the strategic disputes that have divided the two chambers over how to pass his legislative agenda. But this is not what GOP senators had in mind. Trump’s public call Wednesday for the adoption of a House-drafted budget framework — and the 'one big, beautiful bill' it sketches out — left Senate Republicans flat-footed and uncertain about the path forward. 'As they say, did not see that one coming,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune said after emerging from a morning huddle with his fellow GOP leaders. Trump, he confirmed, gave him no heads up that his Truth Social missive backing the House was coming. It came less than a day after Thune moved to put the Senate’s two-bill blueprint on the floor — teeing up hou...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/19/donald-trump-senate-gop-house-budget-00204906	2025-02-19T09:59:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/3c/c5/0a864d024b4fa45381afed9b23f5/u-s-congress-73537.jpg
Senate still moving forward with budget, Thune says	Senate Majority Leader John Thune said that Republicans are moving ahead — for now — with their budget blueprint, even after President Donald Trump endorsed the House’s competing plan on Wednesday. 'We're planning to proceed. But, you know, obviously we are interested in and hoping to hear with more clarity where the White House is coming from,' Thune told reporters after meeting with fellow GOP leaders. The Senate voted to start debate on their budget plan Tuesday, with a marathon 'vote-a-rama' on amendments and final adoption expected to start Thursday. Senate Republicans will discuss the path forward with Vice President JD Vance at a conference lunch Wednesday.

Trump backs House budget plan, calls on Senate to stand down	President Donald Trump threw his support on Wednesday behind the House's budget blueprint — throwing a curveball into the Senate's plan to vote on a competing version this week. Trump, in a Truth Social post, said both chambers are 'doing a SPECTACULAR job of working together' but added that the House budget was preferable because it would fold all of his priorities together instead of separating them into two bills like the Senate GOP plan would. 'We need both Chambers to pass the House Budget to 'kickstart' the Reconciliation process, and move all of our priorities to the concept of, 'ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL.'

Capitol agenda: Senate's budget slog begins	Senate Republicans have begun the arduous process of adopting their budget blueprint and are now set to take a major step forward on President Donald Trump’s agenda later this week. GOP leaders face some objections that will slow them down, mostly from Democrats, but for now they’re on track. Contrast that with the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson is struggling to corral his conference, and it’s unclear whether he’ll have the votes to move forward with his own budget next week.

GOP privacy hawks brush off concerns about DOGE data dives	Some of the Senate’s most notorious GOP privacy hawks are shrugging off moves by Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency to access Americans’ sensitive taxpayer data. It’s a sharp turn for lawmakers who often carp about intrusions on individual privacy, and just the latest example of how Republicans are willing to forgive an unelected billionaire set on shattering institutional norms. In this case, Musk is seeking to give his team the ability to look up personal information on an IRS system that contains broad individual financial records along with information from the Social Security Administration.

Senate tees up ‘vote-a-rama’ on budget for party-line package	Senate Republicans took their first procedural vote Monday night on the budget plan they hope to use to swiftly enact a border security, energy and defense spending bill — and deliver President Donald Trump a major legislative victory during his first months in office. The 50-47 vote will allow GOP senators to forge ahead later this week with floor debate on that fiscal blueprint, followed by a so-called vote-a-rama — an overnight barrage of amendment votes that precedes adoption of the budget resolution. But the power of that measure to allow lawmakers to skirt Senate filibuster rules to draft and pass a partisan bill won't be unlocked until GOP leaders in the House and Senate get on the same page about the scope of their party-line package.

Trump's FBI pick one step closer to confirmation	Kash Patel, the controversial nominee to lead the FBI, cleared another key procedural hurdle Tuesday. The Senate voted 48-45 to move forward with Patel’s nomination, setting up his confirmation vote in the coming days to helm the agency for a 10-year term. Patel, if confirmed, is set to be a central figure in President Donald Trump’s efforts to leverage his powers against perceived enemies. A former House staffer who worked to discredit the congressional inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Patel has promised to go after Trump’s adversaries and shut down the FBI’s Washington headquarters on Day 1 of his tenure to create 'a museum' of the 'deep state.'

Ways and Means eyeing limits to corporate tax deductions	The House Ways and Means Committee is looking at limiting corporate state and local tax deductions as one way to offset the costs of a large party-line tax bill, according to two people familiar with the discussions. The panel, which oversees all tax policy, is considering the limit among other potential offsets for the bill, according to the people, who were granted anonymity to share private deliberations. Companies currently can deduct an unlimited amount of state income, property and sales taxes from their federal tax bill. The discussions signal that a proposal to limit corporate SALT, as the deduction is called, may have enough support among Republicans to make it into a party-line tax bill.

Senator says GOP's hands are tied on DOGE cuts — 'except complain'	Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley said Congress is powerless in the face of cuts from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. 'Congress can’t do anything except complain' about the slashing of the federal government at the hands of Musk and his allies, Grassley said during a press call on Tuesday, according to a report from RadioIowa. The Iowan's comments serve as a stark admission that, despite growing Republican discomfort that Musk's actions are getting the green light from President Donald Trump, there is little the GOP might be able, or willing, to do.

Trump is shocking official Washington. Will he leave his mark on the District too?	Donald Trump isn’t just looking to remake the federal government. He has his sights set on the city of Washington, too. In his first few weeks in office, the president has moved to drastically alter the fabric of the nation’s capital. He ordered thousands of Washington-area federal workers to return to the office — some of whom his administration is moving to lay off.

Elon Musk’s efforts to disrupt and dismantle the federal government at the behest of Donald Trump have already sparked a legion of lawsuits. Now the legal challengers are setting their sights on a new target: Musk himself. Two new cases accuse the ultra-wealthy CEO of illegally amassing too much government power without the accountability typically required of high-level executive branch officials. They are seeking court orders that would force Musk to halt the cost-cutting and information-gathering activities he has been spearheading through his U.S. DOGE Service. The lawsuits rest on a provision of the Constitution that says powerful federal officers must be 'established by law,' must be formally appointed by the president and must be confirmed by the Senate.
