How the Gaetz Ethics report could still come out if the panel blocks it	House Ethics Committee members are set to meet privately Wednesday as debate rages over whether the panel should release its report on its investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz. But even if they elect not to release it, that might not be the end of the road. The committee doesn’t disclose its agenda. But Ethics members are under intense scrutiny as they figure out how to address the report, which lawmakers in both chambers have said they would like to review, particularly given Gaetz’s attorney general nomination. The committee could vote to adopt or release a report during its closed-door meeting. If the vote is along party lines — the same number of Democrats and Republicans sit on the committee — a tie means the motion fails and defers to the majority, which is Republican. (Reminder...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/18/congress/gaetz-report-blocked-ethics-leak-00190263	2024-11-18T15:04:19-08:00	
Top Democrat on Ethics panel says she wants to publish Gaetz report	Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the House Ethics Committee, said Monday she wants her panel’s report on former Rep. Matt Gaetz to be released to the public. 'It should certainly be released to the Senate, and I think it should be released to the public, as we have done with many other investigative reports in the past,' she told a small group of reporters. Both Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are pushing for access to the report after President-elect Donald Trump tapped Gaetz to be his attorney general last week. Gaetz resigned from the House hours after the announcement — amid rumors that the Ethics report could be released in the coming days — complicating the decision to publish the findings of the investigation. The panel investigated several al...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/18/congress/top-ethics-dem-wants-gaetz-report-out-00190256	2024-11-18T14:49:55-08:00	
House Ethics chair: Panel’s decision on Gaetz report won’t be influenced by Johnson	House Ethics Chair Michael Guest said Monday that his panel will make its own decision about releasing the report into Matt Gaetz, regardless of Speaker Mike Johnson’s opinion that it should be kept under wraps. Guest (R-Miss.) told POLITICO in a brief interview that he and Johnson had spoken over the weekend. He added that all Ethics Committee members can now review the report, when only he and Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the panel, previously had a copy of it, according to two people familiar with the matter. 'We did talk this weekend,' Guest said, noting Johnson shared the same views he has publicly — that the panel should not release the report. Guest has not heard from anyone in the Trump administration, he added. 'I appreciate Mike reaching out,' Guest said.

Health care organization launches ‘Stop RFK War Room’	Democratic-aligned health care advocacy groups are putting together a strategy to fight Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination to be HHS secretary. During an organizing call on Monday, the details of which have not been reported publicly, more than 200 people from several dozen of those groups, along with other advocacy organizations, discussed strategies to oppose Kennedy’s nomination. That included which Republican senators to target and the most effective way to talk to them, according to Brad Woodhouse, executive director of Protect Our Care. 'We’re nowhere near conceding he’s going to be the next HHS secretary,' he said. On the call, Woodhouse’s organization launched a new 'Stop RFK War Room' effort focused on persuading not only GOP moderates like Sens.

Potential Trump picks for DOT: A reality TV star, a rail antagonist — and a former Uber exec	President-elect Donald Trump's transition effort is continuing to churn through potential picks for the next head of the Transportation Department, with the current crop of names including a former reality TV star, a former executive at Uber and a former Republican lawmaker from California who regularly lambasted his state's high-speed rail ambitions. According to three people familiar with discussions happening among Trump and his inner circle, including his transition team, the latest names to bubble up to succeed Pete Buttigieg atop DOT include former House lawmaker and Fox News contributor (and star of MTV's The Real World) Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) and Emil Michael, a former executive at Uber. All three were granted anonymity to discuss the inner workings of the transition effort.

White House asks Congress for $100B in aid for hurricanes, other disasters	The Biden administration on Monday sent Congress a roughly $100 billion emergency funding request to rebuild communities hit by hurricanes Helene and Milton, along with a slew of other disasters nationwide. Top lawmakers plan to spend the next few weeks finalizing a bipartisan bill that fulfills at least some of that request, with a goal of final passage sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Since Congress also faces a government shutdown deadline on Dec. 20, it’s possible disaster aid gets tied into a spending patch or broader funding package. Besides $40 billion to refill FEMA’s disaster relief fund, the White House is seeking emergency funding for more than a dozen other federal agen...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/18/white-house-asks-congress-for-100b-in-aid-for-hurricanes-other-disasters-00190167	2024-11-18T09:30:48-08:00	https://static.politico.com/a8/0e/6e59a82f42a788b1e7d0b0069b69/hurricane-helene-fema-threats-48350.jpg
Ron DeSantis’ ‘Apprentice’: Governor announces how he’ll pick Marco Rubio’s replacement	MIAMI — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis intends to hold interviews and 'extensive vetting' to help him decide who should replace Marco Rubio in the Senate. The seat will soon open up after President-elect Donald Trump announced he planned to nominate Rubio to be secretary of state, which will necessitate Rubio resigning from his role. DeSantis under Florida law will be tasked with appointing Rubio’s successor, and he said in a post on X Monday morning that he would likely finish the selection process 'by the beginning of January.' The governor also expanded on some of the qualities and policy priorities he would be looking for.

Sen. Cory Booker sounds like RFK Jr. — or vice versa	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may need every vote he can get to win confirmation as President-elect Donald Trump’s secretary of health and human services. No Senate Democrats have said they’d back Kennedy yet. But New Jersey’s Cory Booker shares RFK Jr.’s concerns about the U.S. food system, as he made clear in a post to X this morning, which said that the system prioritizes 'corporations feeding us unhealthy products' while flooding us with 'dangerous chemicals.' Kennedy took note, thanking Booker in a post 'for your long history of leadership on this issue.'

The mad scramble to be Trump’s Treasury secretary	Donald Trump’s political revival was fueled by a populist economic message that hit home with an electorate weary of Biden-era high prices and interest rates. Now the president-elect is having a hard time picking a quarterback to run his economic game plan. Nearly two weeks after Election Day — and after a flurry of high-profile Cabinet picks that blindsided Washington policymakers and industry leaders — Trump has yet to name his pick for who will lead the Treasury Department. Fighting between Trump world factions that support transition co-chair Howard Lutnick and hedge fund executive Scott Bessent has spilled into public view.

'For those asking why we would speak to the president-elect during such fraught times, I would ask back: Why wouldn’t we?' Brzezinski asked viewers Monday morning, adding that the hosts realized 'it’s time to do something different, and that starts with not only talking about Donald Trump, but talking with him.'

Matt Gaetz feels the heat	President-elect Donald Trump is dead serious about making him attorney general. Speaker Mike Johnson is pledging to bury a critical House Ethics Committee report into his alleged personal misconduct. But expect this to be a very uncomfortable week for former Rep.

There is new pressure to publicize details from investigations centering on allegations of underage sex and drug use by the Florida Republican as a potentially tawdry and dramatic confirmation battle takes shape.

Trump’s immigration crackdown is expected to start on Day 1	In his first 100 days, President-elect Donald Trump plans to begin the process of deporting hundreds of thousands of people. He is expected to end parole for people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. And he is likely to undo a policy that significantly constrained deportations for people who weren't deemed threats to public safety or national security. Trump’s team is already thinking about how to craft executive actions aimed to withstand the legal challenges from immigrants’ rights groups — all in hopes of avoiding an early defeat like the one his 2017 travel ban targeting majority-Muslim nations suffered. This time, Trump may have friendlier arbiters. These fights will be refereed by a federal judiciary that he transformed during his first term, including by appointing more than...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/18/immigration-100-days-trump-executive-action-00189286	2024-11-18T02:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/67/31/50eb82144abe80459adec06aef26/20241118-mexico-border-getty.jpg

Dems who outran Harris in battleground states urge party to focus on ‘kitchen-table issues’	Democrats aren’t blaming Kamala Harris.

His noncommittal posture was part of a time-honored Washington tradition that’s gone into overdrive in the leadup to Trump’s second inauguration: People in the private sector who reap the benefits of being name-checked for high-level administration jobs, even if the idea they would be chosen for or accept a role amounts to little more than speculation.

One major factor that's delayed the decision is the amount of control Lutnick has exerted in determining what information flows up to the president-elect, two of the sources said. Bessent is meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, The Washington Post reported. The jockeying between Lutnick, the head of New York investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, and Bessent, a former George Soros protege who now leads his own hedge fund, has left Treasury as one of the biggest remaining question marks in the Trump 2.0 cabinet.

These senators hold RFK Jr.’s fate in their hands. Here’s what they think about him.	To get confirmed as HHS secretary, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick Robert F.

And though Republicans will have an edge, it will only take a few defectors to sink his nomination if Democrats, as expected, oppose him in unison. Republicans have rushed to applaud some of Trump’s more conventional other Cabinet picks, but the lack of public enthusiasm for RFK among some on the committee suggests some may be skeptical.

Nuts on a lot of fronts': New York Post condemns Kennedy pick to lead HHS	The New York Post editorial board slammed President-elect Donald Trump’s choice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, calling the secretary-designate 'nuts on a lot of fronts.' The Post, owned by Rupert Murdoch, is reliably conservative and endorsed Trump for president this year. But Trump’s selection of the anti-vaccine activist Kennedy to lead HHS, the tabloid’s editorial board argued, would violate the first rule of medicine, 'do no harm.' Recalling a 2023 meeting with Kennedy, the Post’s editorial board called his views 'a head-scratching spaghetti of what we can only call warped conspiracy theories, and not just on vaccines.'

Hill Republicans rejoice over Burgum pick for Interior	President-elect Donald Trump has tapped North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum for Interior secretary, he announced at a gala at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida Thursday night. 'I won't tell you his name, might be something like Burgum, Burgum, ... he's gonna be announced tomorrow for a very big position,' Trump said Thursday evening. 'he's going to head the Department of Interior, and he's gonna be fantastic. Good Doug.' A two-term governor of a Western oil-rich state with five tribal nations, Burgum is already receiving a warm reception from Republicans on Capitol Hill, who for four years have slammed President Joe Biden's energy policies. Democrats will be unhappy with his promises to ramp up fossil fuel production but could be less critical of him because of his experience. Republicans who sit...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/15/congress/doug-burgum-interior-secretary-reaction-00189798	2024-11-15T06:28:30-08:00

House ethics panel cancels meeting amid pressure to release Gaetz report	The House Ethics Committee won’t be meeting after all on Friday as pressure builds to release the findings of its report on Rep. Matt Gaetz. Anticipation was high for the closed-door meeting after Donald Trump announced he was picking the Florida member of Congress to be attorney general. But the meeting was abruptly canceled Thursday, according to a person familiar with the schedule granted anonymity to discuss non-public information. It is unclear why the committee canceled a meeting that was scheduled before Gaetz resigned from Congress this week, three people familiar told POLITICO earlier.

Lawyer who argued for Trump’s immunity at Supreme Court is tapped for solicitor general	Dean John Sauer, the lawyer whose arguments led to a Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity that waylaid Donald Trump’s prosecution on charges of attempting to subvert the 2020 presidential election, is Trump’s pick to be solicitor general in his second term. The solicitor general represents the federal government at the high court. 'John is a deeply accomplished, masterful appellate attorney,' Trump said in a statement Thursday.

Matt Gaetz has bashed Senate Republicans for years. To be Trump's AG, he'll need their votes.	Before he can become Donald Trump’s attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) will need to face off with some potentially less-than-friendly faces to receive confirmation: Republican senators he’s previously antagonized. With a 53-seat majority, the Senate GOP can only lose up to three votes and still clear a nominee if Democrats unanimously oppose them. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), for one, said Wednesday that Gaetz has 'his work cut out for him to get a good, strong vote,' adding that 'it’ll make for a popcorn-eating confirmation hearing.'

Trump picks his New York hush money defense lawyers for top spots at DOJ	President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday tapped the lawyers who represented him in the New York hush money criminal trial for the No. 2 and No. 3 spots at the Department of Justice. Todd Blanche, a former federal prosecutor who defended Trump in his Manhattan criminal trial, which ended in Trump’s conviction on 34 counts, and his two federal criminal cases, will be deputy attorney general, the second-highest ranking post at DOJ and the person who runs its day-to-day operations, if confirmed. Emil Bove, who also represented the president-elect in the hush money trial and his two federal criminal cases, will serve as principal associate deputy attorney general.

Ethics panel to meet as pressure builds for Gaetz report release	Members of a secretive panel overseeing a long-running investigation into Matt Gaetz are set to privately meet on Friday, according to three people familiar with the matter. The House Ethics Committee meeting was scheduled before Gaetz (R-Fla.) resigned from Congress this week, the people said. The committee doesn’t disclose its agenda — but the highly anticipated closed-door powwow would let them discuss what to do with the probe now that Gaetz is technically outside of their jurisdiction. Speaker Mike Johnson announced that Gaetz had resigned Wednesday night, hours after President-elect Trump nominated the Florida firebrand to become attorney general. Johnson attributed the resignation to Gaetz wanting to allow his seat to be filled quickly, but House Republicans have speculated that he ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/14/congress/gop-lawmakers-want-to-see-gaetz-report-00189745	2024-11-14T15:36:55-08:00	
Trump selects Jay Clayton, a business-friendly former regulator, as top federal prosecutor in Manhattan	President-elect Donald Trump has picked Jay Clayton, a longtime corporate lawyer and former Wall Street regulator, to be the U.S. attorney overseeing Manhattan. Clayton served as the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump’s first term but has no experience as a criminal prosecutor. If confirmed by the Senate, Clayton would head the nation’s most prestigious federal prosecutor’s office: the Southern District of New York, which has jurisdiction over the largest financial institutions and brings many high-profile white-collar and public-corruption cases. During his first term, Trump attempted to install Clayton as the U.S. attorney for SDNY in an effort to oust Geoffrey Berman, who held the post from 2018 to 2020.

House GOP lawmakers hang on to critical rules deal	House Republicans have salvaged an agreement on their internal rules, according to six people familiar with the discussions, after it appeared to be on shaky ground for hours earlier on Thursday. If the agreement — struck by opposing factions within the GOP’s narrow majority Wednesday afternoon — had unraveled, it would have been a significant blow to Speaker Mike Johnson, who blessed the deal. The agreement had been a truce of sorts on conservatives’ and leadership allies’ most contentious battle lines, like hard-liner moves to block party-favored legislation on the House floor. Under the deal, which was first reported by POLITICO on Wednesday, centrists agreed to drop their proposed rule changes that would have established punishments for members who defied leaders and the will of the co...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/14/congress/house-gop-hanging-on-to-rules-deal-00189601	2024-11-14T09:25:50-08:00	
RFK Jr. has big asks of Washington. Republican lawmakers say they’re open.	MAGA won big. Now MAHA is ready to take on Washington. President-elect Donald Trump promised Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a chance to implement his Make America Healthy Again vision and Kennedy is in the mix to run the Department of Health and Human Services. That could turn the government’s role in public health upside down. Kennedy blames Americans’ poor health in part on a corrupt alliance among the food and drug industries and the regulators supposed to watch over them. He wants to replace the bureaucrats and overhaul the systems for overseeing pesticides, food additives and vaccines.

Senate Republicans squirm over Trump's tariff plans	Senate Republicans are skeptical of Donald Trump’s aggressive new tariff plans — especially lawmakers from states with large agriculture industries that could bear the brunt of likely foreign retaliation. 'Tariffs have a place, but there is also the other side, which is: what about the repercussions of [countries] putting tariffs in a retaliatory method on some of our items as well?' added Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). 'There is a place for tariffs, but I want to look at them case-by-case.'

House Republicans win the majority. Now they look to the margin.	House Republicans tapped their leadership team for the next Congress on Wednesday and formally notched their majority when the Associated Press called Rep. Juan Ciscomani’s (R-Ariz.) reelection.

It will be the first time Republicans have had full control of Congress and the White House since 2018. House Republicans have been quietly preparing their legislative agenda on tax cuts and other priorities for months, though an expected narrow majority will likely complicate those efforts, as well as Speaker Mike Johnson’s bid to hold onto the gavel in a January floor vote.

The Louisiana Republican has been shoring up support for months, crisscrossing the country to campaign for his colleagues, and the party is expected to hold onto House control by a slim margin.

Newsom talked about getting California lawmakers on the same page ahead of the Trump administration	California Governor Gavin Newsom rallied Democratic members of the state’s California delegation as they steeled themselves for a Trump presidency in a closed-door lunch meeting over sandwiches in a Capitol office building Wednesday afternoon. Newsom told reporters he and the lawmakers talked about getting on the same page ahead of California's upcoming special legislative session as they worked to prepare their legal defenses for Donald Trump’s return to the White House. 'We talked about the 122 lawsuits we were involved in in the Trump administration.

Cotton defeats Ernst for No. 3 spot in Senate GOP leadership	Senate Republicans have tapped Sen. Tom Cotton, an unwavering conservative, to be their Republican Conference chair, elevating a lawmaker known for his hawkish foreign policy positions and efforts to restrict immigration into a top-tier leadership role. Cotton (R-Ark.), who is serving his second term after being elected in 2014, bested Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa.) for the No. 3 spot in the Senate GOP hierarchy. The vote was 35-18, according to two people familiar with the vote. 'One priority is to make sure each senator has the tools and the resources they need to communicate with their voters in their states,' Cotton told 'The Hugh Hewitt Show' in March, speaking about how he saw the ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/13/congress/cotton-takes-senate-gop-no-3-spot-00189324	2024-11-13T10:31:12-08:00	
Thune wins contested race for Senate GOP leader	John Thune will lead the Senate Republican conference next term, winning a three-way election to succeed Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in a closed-door vote on Wednesday. The South Dakotan will take over in January at the turn of the new Congress, when Republicans are expected to control the government trifecta: the House, Senate and the presidency. And he’ll have some room to maneuver in his own chamber, with Republicans’ 53-seat majority, as the party considers wide-ranging legislation that would tackle tax cuts, immigration and energy policy. At 63, Thune, current GOP whip, is considered relatively young for leadership. Thune has not committed to imposing a term limit on the role of conference leader, meaning he’s well-positioned to hold the job for years to come. He is not up for ree...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/13/john-thune-senate-republican-leader-00189305	2024-11-13T09:06:14-08:00	https://static.politico.com/33/e5/dab2000c4fc198eb4614f3aabcb2/u-s-congress-50235.jpg
Trump thanks Biden for smooth transition	President-elect Donald Trump thanked President Joe Biden for overseeing a smooth transition of power during an Oval Office meeting on Wednesday that marked the rivals’ first face-to-face meeting since the election. 'I appreciate very much a transition that’s so smooth,' Trump said as the two men sat stiffly in oversized chairs, a fire roaring in the background. 'It’ll be as smooth as it can get and I very much appreciate that, Joe.' 'You’re welcome,' a smiling Biden said. The meeting, normally a formality between presidents, represented a striking contrast from four years ago, when Biden was poised to take the White House after unseating Trump. At that time, Trump refused to extend the courtesy of the invitation and instead spent the following weeks trying to overturn the results of the el...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/13/congress/biden-trump-meet-00189290	2024-11-13T08:44:51-08:00	
House Democrats start to air post-election grievances	Rank-and-file House Democrats started to air their grievances with leadership about what they think went wrong on Election Day, as the party began its internal reckoning in their first closed-door meeting since last Tuesday’s vote led to the likely loss of their majority. House Democratic leaders announced a series of three listening sessions over the coming weeks with lawmakers, according to a notice sent to lawmakers obtained by POLITICO. Democratic leaders are also expected to hold private meetings with lawmakers as they chart their path forward, three people in the room said.

Trump endorses Johnson hours ahead of GOP speaker vote	President-elect Donald Trump appeared to back Mike Johnson's speakership bid during his visit with the House GOP Wednesday morning, hours ahead of an internal party leadership vote, according to five people in the room. 'He said, ‘I am with him all the way,’' according to two people. Trump is meeting with House Republicans hours before an internal leadership election where they are expected to elect Johnson as their speaker nominee. That election will be conducted via secret ballot and only requires a simple majority. It’s a significant boost for Johnson, who has tied himself closely to the incoming president and needs his support in order to win the gavel in a tougher Jan. 3 vote, when Johnson will need near-unanimous support from House Republicans to officially become speaker.

Johnson tells House GOP he has no challengers for leadership race	Speaker Mike Johnson told House Republicans behind closed doors that he doesn’t have any challengers to his candidacy right now, according to four people familiar with the matter. The private comments come after two people familiar with the private discussions told POLITICO on Tuesday night that members of the House Freedom Caucus would not throw in a candidate but instead force an internal vote on the speakership race during a closed-door election set for Wednesday afternoon.

Biden is about to have the meeting he’s been dreading with Trump	Nearly four years after he walked out of the White House in the aftermath of a violent insurrection, President-elect Donald Trump will re-enter the building on Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden in the Oval Office. By inviting Trump, Biden is extending to his predecessor and successor a formal courtesy that Trump didn’t give him four years ago. In many ways, he is hosting a rival who he’d argued was a threat to American democracy to make the point that democracy itself hinges on elections where the losers accept the results. The meeting comes eight days after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris and six days after Biden’s Rose Garden speech, where he sought to <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/07/biden-gives-dems-a-pep-talk-after-voters-repudiation-00188240' tar...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/13/congress/donald-trump-joe-biden-meeting-00189125	2024-11-13T06:05:00-08:00	
State of Congress: Republicans near formal House majority	More than a week after Election Day, there are just a dozen House races left uncalled by The Associated Press.

In the remaining uncalled contests, Republicans currently lead in six, while Democrats have the advantage in six. Iowa’s 1st: Rep.

Freedom Caucus backs off plan to push a challenger to Johnson	House conservatives are planning to force an internal vote on Mike Johnson’s speakership during Wednesday’s leadership election instead of throwing in an alternate candidate, two people familiar with the discussions told POLITICO. Johnson’s critics in the House Freedom Caucus have been deliberating for days over how to push back against proposed internal rules changes and send a message to the Louisiana Republican.

House GOP rule proposals spotlight battle between conservatives and leadership allies	House Republicans are primed for a nasty fight over their internal rules this week. A review of the 20 amendments submitted to the current rules, first reported by POLITICO, indicate an ongoing clash between conservatives, who are looking to strip more power from leadership, and other members who want to see disruptive GOP lawmakers punished. The amendments do not include proposed changes to the rules governing how to oust a speaker, known as a motion to vacate, though that doesn’t mean that fight is over. Currently, one member can trigger a vote to boot a speaker, and leadership and many House Republicans want to raise that threshold. Debate over that rule will likely reignite before the full House speakership vote on Jan. 3, when the party is slated to deliberate broader House rules afte...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/12/congress/house-gops-rules-war-00189229	2024-11-12T19:19:59-08:00

GOP Rep. Valadao holds Central Valley, California, swing seat	California Republican Rep. David Valadao will maintain his grip on his swing seat in the Central Valley. Valadao was a top target for Democrats, who were hoping an uptick in voter turnout this year could finally clinch the district they’ve been eyeing for several cycles. He has represented the area for nearly a decade — save for the 2018 race, where he was defeated by former Rep. TJ Cox. After winning back that seat in 2020, Valadao went on to be one of only 10 Republicans to vote to impeach former President Donald Trump following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Meanwhile, Trump has already named two House Republicans, Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.), to positions within the administration.

How the GOP took back the Senate — even while continuing to struggle in swing states	Republicans celebrated as they took a decisive Senate majority last week: They’d finally figured out how to get past the candidate quality issues that had tanked them for two cycles. But they still have a purple-state problem. Even as President-elect Donald Trump swept every swing state, four of those battlegrounds are sending Democrats to the Senate. That’s the highest number of Senate-presidential ticket splits in 12 years, and a warning sign for Republicans as they try to protect and grow their ranks in 2026. That 53-seat majority will be a boon to the GOP agenda next year. But three of Republicans' wins were in solidly red seats in West Virginia, Ohio and Montana. They flipped a true swing state in Pennsylvania but suffered losses in Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona. That me...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/12/republican-senate-majority-battleground-states-00188953	2024-11-12T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/21/d5/e13842e94e449af76e762a06ac68/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2161710151
State of Congress: House looks to California (and Trump)	The breakdown of the Senate is all but set. And a handful of races in California — and President-elect Donald Trump’s personnel decisions — seem likely to determine how much wiggle room Republicans will have in their probable House majority. Arizona Senate: Almost a week after the election, the Associated Press called the open Senate race for Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego over GOP nominee Kari Lake. His lead at the time of the call stands at about 72,000 votes. It’s a crucial win for Democrats, who will now have a minority conference of 47 seats in the Senate. Pennsylvania Senate: Incumbent Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) chipped away at GOP Sen.-elect David McCormick’s lead, but the Democrat still trails by 35,000 votes after more ballots came in on Monday.

Schumer invites McCormick and Gallego to Senate orientation	Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has extended Senate orientation invitations to Pennsylvania Republican Dave McCormick and Arizona Democrat Ruben Gallego after previously withholding them while their respective races remained unsettled. Schumer previously insisted the Pennsylvania race had not yet been decided, despite the Associated Press calling it for McCormick over incumbent Democrat Bob Casey, who has yet to concede.

Democrat George Whitesides ousts GOP Rep. Mike Garcia from Los Angeles House seat	George Whitesides has defeated three-term GOP Rep. Mike Garcia, flipping a long-coveted Los Angeles area House seat to the Democrats’ column. Garcia — who conceded the race Monday — was a top target for multiple cycles, given the Democrats’ 10-point registration advantage in the district and his conservative votes in the House. But he had proven surprisingly durable in the blue-leaning seat, leaning on his fighter-jet pilot past to appeal to voters in a district dominated by aerospace. This time, Democrats were able to su...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/11/george-whitesides-wins-los-angeles-house-seat-00187088	2024-11-11T19:12:38-08:00	https://static.politico.com/d5/dd/daff030b41e28de5c02d92abfbfb/election-2024-house-california-46103.jpg

'It's been the greatest honor of my life to lead you, to serve you, to care for you, to defend you, just as you defended us generation after generation after generation.' Biden was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris, their first joint appearance since last week’s loss.

DOJ says Jack Smith’s delay in Trump case is no reason to do the same for Jan. 6 defendants	Special counsel Jack Smith’s decision to pause his prosecution of President-elect Donald Trump is no reason to do the same for members of the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the Justice Department argued Monday. Several Jan. 6 defendants have used Smith’s call for a three-week breather — quickly endorsed by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan — as proof that all criminal cases connected to the Jan. 6 attack deserve a similar slowdown. 'To deny this motion, in the face of the Justice Department’s official position [in the Trump case], would run contrary to the interests of justice and likely subject the defendant to criminal convictions for no purpose other tha...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/11/congress/department-of-justice-january-6-cases-00188804	2024-11-11T10:31:17-08:00	
Top Senate GOP defense hawk has Pentagon budget boost plan — with sunnier post-Trump-win prospects	Sen. Roger Wicker, one of Capitol Hill’s most vocal defense hawks, will soon get the chance to pursue a larger Pentagon budget — and it stands a much better chance with Donald Trump headed back to the White House. The Mississippi Republican is poised to chair the Armed Services Committee after the GOP romped in Tuesday’s Senate elections. And he brings to the role a plan for tens of billions of dollars in new military spending to expand the Navy and Air Force, modernize the nuclear arsenal and ramp up defense manufacturing.

Arizona Senate: Several days of strong vote counting numbers have put Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) on the precipice of holding this Senate seat for his party, even as President-elect Donald Trump carried the state by nearly 6 percentage points.

Jockeying begins for Stefanik’s open House GOP leadership position	Several lawmakers are launching bids for the No. 4 position in House GOP leadership — seemingly the only wide open race after Donald Trump tapped Rep.

McClain is presently serving in House Republican leadership as the conference secretary.

Trump presses next GOP Senate leader to allow ‘recess appointments’	President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday said Senate Republicans’ next leader must embrace so-called 'recess appointments,' temporary appointments when the chamber is out of session that occur without the chamber’s formal seal of approval. 'Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,' Trump wrote in a post to the social media network X.

After McCarthy ouster, GOP to consider new requirement for House leadership elections	House Republicans are set to consider a variety of new internal rules proposals this week, including some proposals that tie back to the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. While there is a broader push to amend the one-member threshold needed to trigger a motion to vacate, there are also some GOP members aiming to make internal changes to their party’s leadership election moving forward. Republicans from the various corners of the conference have put forward their proposals for the 119th Congress, which will be considered this week when the party votes on its new rules package Thursday.

Dearborn’s Arab Americans feel vindicated by Harris’ loss	DEARBORN, Michigan — Arab American leaders for months warned Vice President Kamala Harris that she needed to separate herself from President Joe Biden’s support of Israel in the war in Gaza — or face an electoral backlash from this influential community in a key battleground. But those pleas went largely ignored. Instead, Harris made strategic errors that deeply insulted Arab American voters reeling from intense grief as the death toll in the Middle East climbed. She refused to host a Palestinian American onstage at the Democratic National Convention. She curtly shut down protesters at campaign rallies who criticized her solidarity with Biden over the conflict. She dispatched pro-Israel surrogates to Michigan.

State of play: The battle for Congress	There are two uncalled Senate races — both leaning toward Democrats — and about two dozen uncalled House races three days after Election Day. With the seats remaining, Republicans have the clear inside track for retaining control of the House. Nevada Senate: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen padded her lead as more ballots were counted in the Silver State, now leading GOP nominee Sam Brown by around 17,000 votes — or a little more than 1 percentage point. Interestingly, the 'none of these candidates' option — a rather unique option in Nevada — is pulling in around 3 percent of the vote, a potentially decisive figure in this razor-thin contest. Late-counted ballots have consistently favored Rosen. Advantage Rosen.

Calling all nat sec wonks: These are the transition positions you should be paying attention to	President-elect Donald Trump’s national security transition team is already taking shape, giving early insights into who could staff his national security and defense team once he takes office in January. The speculation around Cabinet secretary posts is hogging a lot of attention, but lower-level appointees in the National Security Council, State Department and Pentagon could have outsized influence over the direction of Trump’s foreign policy. And transition officials often end up joining the administration in influential posts. Here’s who’s in the room or in the mix: The State Department Brian Hook, former State Department policy planner and special envoy for Iran, has been tapped to lead the State Department transition team. The Pentagon Robert Wilkie, former ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/07/congress/national-security-transition-donald-trump-00188379	2024-11-07T16:42:55-08:00	
Trump advisers, Congress discuss tariff legislation	Advisers close to President-elect Donald Trump have been in discussions with House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) on a broad tax package that is partially paid for by tariffs approved by Congress, according to two people familiar with the conversations who were granted anonymity to describe the internal discussions. As part of those conversations, staffers and advisers close to the Trump team have also investigated whether House rules need to be changed to use tariffs as offsets for tax cuts, those people say. A Ways and Means Committee spokesperson declined to comment. The discussions come as Republicans are gearing up to pass a massive tax bill, which would include $4.6 trillion of expiring Trump tax cuts and potentially several other tax proposals floated by Trump on the campa...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/07/congress/congress-considers-tariffs-00188362	2024-11-07T15:42:36-08:00	
Stefanik eyed for top Trump administration post	One of President-elect Donald Trump’s most vocal supporters in the House is on the short list to become his next ambassador to the United Nations, according to five people familiar with the potential appointment. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) tops the list of people the Trump transition team is considering for the influential diplomatic post. Stefanik has repeatedly attacked the United Nations over accusations that the world body is antisemitic. Last month she called for a 'complete reassessment of U.S. funding of the United Nations' in response to efforts by the Palestinian Authority to expel Israel from the United Nations as ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/07/congress/stefanik-eyed-for-post-00188354	2024-11-07T15:10:12-08:00	
Trump says mass deportations will have ‘no price tag’	On the campaign trail, Donald Trump vowed to commence the largest mass deportation of undocumented immigrants in history on Day 1 if he retook the Oval Office. Now that he’s president-elect, he’s pledging to make good on that promise — at any cost. 'It’s not a question of a price tag. It’s not — really, we have no choice,' Trump said Thursday in an interview with NBC News. 'When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they’re going to go back to those countries because they’re not staying here. There is no price tag.' There are about 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., according to <a href='https://ohss....	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/07/congress/trump-immigration-mass-deportations-00188339	2024-11-07T14:31:01-08:00	
The transition crisis Congress feared didn’t materialize	Donald Trump’s refusal to concede the 2020 election handicapped Joe Biden’s presidential transition so badly that it spooked Congress into taking action. But this year’s quick and decisive results mean the Trump-proofing they did for the process won’t be put to the test. Four years ago, Trump’s election defiance triggered a broader national crisis and prevented Biden’s transition team from accessing federal funding and information for several weeks, a holdup that hampered the new administration’s readiness on national security and tackling the then-raging Covid-19 pandemic. Lawmakers believe they solved at least part of the problem two years later: Instead of leaving the General Services Administration, an obscure federal agency that manages the government’s real estate, in charge of decla...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/07/congress/2020-transition-act-congress-00187913	2024-11-07T14:00:00-08:00	
House Democrats commiserate after Harris’ election loss as the blame game begins	House Democrats’ path to the majority is rapidly narrowing. The blame game over what went wrong is only just starting. In a subdued, somber call, their first since Tuesday’s election, Democratic leaders projected confidence in their party and told lawmakers to wait to see the results of the races that still haven’t been called — as many rank-and-file members are starting to air grievances. Democrats felt their leadership set expectations for how the call would go when Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told lawmakers to sit tight, according to two people on the call, and Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), who was formerly whip of the House Democrats, told Democrats to stand with their leaders but to speak for themselves and their races rather than for the caucus as a whole. Jeffries in a statement is...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/07/congress/dems-commiserate-point-fingers-after-election-losses-00188326	2024-11-07T13:40:54-08:00	
Fed's Powell says Trump can't fire him; `Not permitted under the law'	Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a simple response Thursday as to whether he would leave his post if President-elect Donald Trump asked him to. 'No.' Powell, speaking to reporters after Fed policymakers cut interest rates again, tried during his press conference to avoid the political fray. Still, he made clear that he’s not going anywhere. He declared that it’s 'not permitted under the law' for presidents to remove members of the independent central bank. Despite years of criticism of the Fed chief, the once and future president said over the summer that he would let Powell finish out his term, which doesn’t end until mid-2026 — 'especially if I thought he was doing the right thing.'

Here’s who’s in the running to be Trump’s White House counsel	Two lawyers who have played key roles in investigations into Donald Trump and his top allies are now under consideration for a crucial gig in his administration: White House counsel. David Warrington, the general counsel for the Trump campaign; and Stanley Woodward, a defense lawyer who has represented many prominent Trump aides, are both in the mix, according to two people familiar with the transition team’s deliberations. Other candidates are also under consideration. 'President-Elect Trump will begin making decisions on who will serve in his second Administration soon,' said Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt in a statement. 'Those decisions will be announced when they are made.' Both men are also advising the transition on legal matters. Woodward and Warrington did not respond to requ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/07/congress/donald-trump-white-house-counsel-00188284	2024-11-07T11:30:42-08:00	
A Brit’s take on Election Day? Americans are on another level.	Us British think our politics can be a bit mad at times. But we have nothing on the Americans. I'm from London and spent election night in D.C. as a political tourist chatting to the people I found as the results came in. It was an eye-opening experience. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris superfans who traveled across the nation to be in D.C. for election night? The sweating watch parties with political-themed cocktails and characters? The boarding up of businesses to protect against damage amid fears of violent disorder? Sure, we had Brexit, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss vs. the lettuce back in London. But you guys are on a whole other level to us. The verdict from a Brit? You guys are wild.

DNC chair hits back at Sanders over party criticism: 'Straight up BS'	DNC Chair Jaime Harrison hit back at Sen. Bernie Sanders’ claim that the Democratic Party has 'abandoned working-class people' as 'straight up BS.' 'This is straight up BS … Biden was the most-pro worker President of my life time — saved Union pensions, created millions of good paying jobs and even marched in a picket line and some of MVP’s plans would have fundamentally transformed the quality of life and closed the racial wealth gap for working people across this country,' Harrison wrote on X Thursday.

Elon Musk’s transgender daughter doesn’t see a ‘future’ in the US after Trump’s win	Vivian Jenna Wilson, the transgender daughter of Elon Musk, says she is leaving the U.S. over Donald Trump’s return to the White House. 'I’ve thought this for a while, but yesterday confirmed it for me. I don’t see my future being in the United States,' she said in a Threads post on Wednesday. 'Even if he’s only in office for 4 years, even if the anti-trans regulations magically don’t happen, the people who willingly voted this in are not going anywhere anytime soon.' Twenty-year-old Wilson is estranged from her father, who poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump’s campaign and has the ear of the president-elect.
