The brief but busy reign of Sen. George Helmy is coming to an end	Sen. George Helmy, a New Jersey Democrat, is making his brief tenure at the Capitol a busy one. Last Monday, Helmy was on the Senate floor to give a complex speech about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The remarks were based on a trip to the Middle East he took during the roughly 12 weeks he’ll be in office after Gov. Phil Murphy picked him to fill disgraced Sen. Bob Menendez’s vacant seat. The next day, a day after walking the tightrope of Middle Eastern politics, Helmy was back to make joint remarks with Sen. Katie Britt, the Alabama Republican. They are both backi...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/28/helmy-menendez-senate-fill-in-whirlwind-00192005	2024-11-28T08:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/c2/b4/f35e6a8b4b8999c70fed3beffc6b/u-s-congress-56694.jpg
‘He's not a manager’: Former RFK Jr. staffers on how he'd run HHS	If Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gets confirmed as secretary for President-elect Donald Trump's Department of Health and Human Services, it will be the biggest job he's ever had. And some of his former campaign staffers question whether he’s up for the challenge. Kennedy, who comes from one of the most high-profile families in Democratic politics, has held leadership roles as a lawyer and at nonprofit organizations but has more often been the public face of these operations than an executive manager. His presidential campaign was similarly run with Kennedy not closely involved in its daily management, according to interviews with a half dozen former campaign staffers. 'He's an inspirational leader who's able to communicate. But he's not a manager,' said Jeff Hutt, spokesperson for the Make America...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/28/rfk-hhs-management-doubts-00191852	2024-11-28T04:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/be/a4/e2d8b48a4b42a5fa750e96be36e8/election-2024-trump-30890.jpg
Mexico's president and Trump had an upbeat call despite dust-up over tariffs	President-elect Donald Trump said his conversation Wednesday with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was 'wonderful' and 'very productive.' She, in turn, described their phone call as 'excellent.' Their upbeat readouts on the call marked a contrast from earlier in the week, when Trump warned he would impose a 25 percent tariff on all goods from Mexico if it doesn’t stop the flow of migrants and drugs across their shared border – and Sheinbaum fired back by warning that her country could retaliate with tariffs of its own. 'Just had a wonderful conversation with the new President of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo,' Trump said in a Truth Social post. 'She has agreed to stop Migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border.' Sheinbaum did not say ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/27/congress/trump-and-mexico-00192016	2024-11-27T18:14:39-08:00	
Zuckerberg meets with Trump in Florida	Facebook founder Mark Zuckerbeg made the trek to Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday, where he met with President-elect Donald Trump and members of his soon-to-be second administration. The Meta CEO was seen with a large security and staff presence while at Trump’s private Palm Beach club in the evening, a person with direct knowledge told POLITICO. On Fox News, Trump deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller confirmed POLITICO’s reporting that Zuckerberg was there, saying he 'has made it very clear about his desire to be a supporter of and a participant in this change that we’re seeing all around America, all around the world, this reform movement that Donald Trump is leading.'

‘Delete CFPB’: Musk calls for elimination of consumer bureau	Elon Musk said Wednesday that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau should be abolished, calling for the elimination of an agency that would potentially regulate the future payments business of the Musk-owned X platform. 'Delete CFPB,' Musk, who is leading an effort on behalf of President-elect Donald Trump to shrink the size of the federal government, wrote in a post on X. 'There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.' Trump on the campaign trail called for easing regulation of the financial industry generally but didn’t explicitly call for the elimination of the CFPB, which Republicans have railed against for years.

Former SEC commissioner Atkins emerges as a top contender for chair	Paul Atkins, a veteran regulator and influential voice on financial policy, is emerging as a leading candidate to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission under President-elect Donald Trump, according to four people familiar with the transition. No final decision has been made, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss the private conversations. But Atkins was recently invited to interview with Trump, one of the people said. Trump is expected to announce his pick for Wall Street's top regulator soon. Others whose names have been floated for SEC chair include Brian Brooks, the one-time acting comptroller of the currency, and former SEC General Counsel Robert Stebbins. Atkins, if picked and confirmed, would rejoin the SEC after a 16-year hiatus from the agency.

Democrat Derek Tran ousts Michelle Steel in CA House battle	Derek Tran, a first-time Democratic candidate, has flipped a toss-up California House seat, narrowly defeating GOP Rep. Michelle Steel, who conceded on Wednesday after a protracted vote count. Tran had declared victory early this week, and currently leads by roughly 600 votes. Steel, a two-term congressmember, had been an elusive target for Democrats, occupying an Orange County district that had backed President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. The race ended up being the most expensive House battle in the country, with at least $46 million spent by the campaigns and an array of outside groups. Democrats hoped Tran was the right candidate to dislodge Steel, given his background as the son of Vietn...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/27/derek-tran-wins-california-45-election-00187118	2024-11-27T12:09:14-08:00	https://static.politico.com/23/c1/26c6f0bd49dfbd3199cc769f97b9/elections-2024-california-house-70698.jpg
Johnson's next margin headache: Manchin-style Republicans	Speaker Mike Johnson is staring down what could be a one-vote majority to enact the House GOP agenda in the first months of the second Trump era. The practical effect will be that every member of his conference has the potential to be the next Sen. Joe Manchin or Kyrsten Sinema, who had outsized power to snarl Democrats’ priorities under President Joe Biden. Who will have the biggest sway in the tiny House GOP majority?

Trump appoints Keith Kellogg as Ukraine peace envoy	President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday named former national security aide and retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg as a special envoy to Russia and Ukraine, commissioning him to lead negotiations to end the war. In a statement, Trump said that Kellogg, who served as national security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence, 'was with me right from the beginning' and 'will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!' The move is not likely to allay anxieties among European allies that Trump will attempt to pursue peace between Russia and Ukraine. Western leaders are concerned that Trump's terms could come at Ukraine’s long-term expense, including by pressuring Kyiv to give up territory or not providing Ukraine with adequate security guarantees t...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/27/congress/ukraine-peace-envoy-donald-trump-00191928	2024-11-27T10:29:21-08:00

How they got here: Olszewski won this blue-tinted seat, dispatching conservative Republican influencer Kimberly Klacik 58 percent to 40 percent. The two ran to replace longtime Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D). Inside the campaign: Olszewski, the sitting Baltimore County executive, effectively cleared the Democratic primary field once he jumped into the contest following Ruppersberger’s decision to stand aside. He lined up endorsements from statewide Democratic luminaries like Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Sen.-elect Angela Alsobrooks, former Sen. Barbara Mikulski, Rep. Steny Hoyer and Ruppersberger. He eventually won the primary with more than 78 percent of the votes.

Former head of HHS says success comes when a secretary appoints the right people	We’re chatting with former Cabinet members, chiefs of staff and government leaders from now to Jan. 20 to get a sense of what the incoming administration might face as it takes the reins. Today we’re talking to Tommy Thompson, the former governor of Wisconsin who also served as Health and Human Services secretary in the George W. Bush administration. Thompson joined Wisconsin Republicans on election night to celebrate President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier this month. What advice do you have for the next Cabinet secretary?

Moulton could draw challengers	BOSTON — Rep. Seth Moulton drew swift condemnation from local Democratic leaders and LGBTQ+ advocates for comments he made about transgender youth in sports in the wake of Democrats’ defeats earlier this month. But will the discontent translate to real competition next cycle? It’s early, but some potential challengers are already beginning to stir. Dan Koh, a former Andover selectman who narrowly lost the race for the open seat in the neighboring 3rd District in 2018, has been making — and fielding — calls about a possible campaign against Moulton, according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the conversations.

Musk wants to stop enforcing regulations. Why that’s ‘almost meaningless.’	Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy outlined a plan to help companies avoid environmental regulations: The government could just refuse to enforce its own rules. But some lawyers who specialize in federal regulation expressed doubt that companies would benefit from such a plan — or even want it. 'I don't think it would really reduce the burden on industry for the most part, because companies have a legal obligation to comply with regulatory requirements,' said Jeff Holmstead, a former EPA air chief under President George W. Bush who represents industry clients at Bracewell LLP. Musk and Ramaswamy, whom President-elect Donald Trump named to co-lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, asserted in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed that Trump could 'immediately pause the enforcement'...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/27/congress/elon-musk-federal-regulations-00191868	2024-11-27T07:26:45-08:00

Kevin Hassett returning as an economic adviser for second Trump administration	Kevin Hassett is heading back to the White House as an economic adviser. President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that Hassett will be director of the National Economic Council, a role that puts him in charge of executing the higher tariffs and tax cuts promised during the campaign. Hassett, whose appointment was expected, served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers for two years during Trump’s first term.

Trump picks former Gingrich aide to lead Domestic Policy Council	President-elect Donald Trump has chosen his campaign speechwriter to lead his Domestic Policy Council. Vince Haley, who was also director of policy during the campaign, will head his domestic policy agenda, Trump said in a statement Tuesday. 'As Director of the Domestic Policy Council, Vince will help make life better for ALL Americans, and unify our Country through SUCCESS,' the statement said. Before he joined Trump’s 2016 campaign, Haley worked for 12 years for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

Hassett, 62, served as chief economist during Trump's first term. Now, he would take on an expanded role as the president’s top adviser on economic matters and play a key part in coordinating policies and strategy across the government. One of the main orders of business for the new NEC director will be serving as an emissary in negotiating an extension to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, legislation that Hassett has spent years touting.

Kash Patel and Cliff Sims are jostling for the deputy director gig at the CIA	Two Trump transition insiders, Cliff Sims and Kash Patel, are angling to be deputy director of the CIA — and angering others who feel they're using their roles on the transition to undermine any would-be contenders, according to three people familiar with the matter. The No. 2 position at the powerful spy agency is one of the most sought-after national security posts that remains unfilled. It does not require Senate confirmation — a concern for other roles, like FBI director, Patel is said to be interested in — but wields enormous influence inside the U.S. intelligence community. The frustration toward Sims, the former White House and ODNI communications strategist, and Patel, the firebrand former House Intelligence Committee staffer and Pentagon official, stems from the fact that both are...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/26/congress/kash-patel-cliff-sims-deputy-director-cia-00191715	2024-11-26T11:12:39-08:00

A write-in campaign by Good allies didn’t end up manifesting in the general election. Inside the campaign: McGuire, a state senator, got a big boost in his primary challenge against the sitting Freedom Caucus chair: the endorsement of President-elect Donald Trump, a huge boost in this red-leaning district. He used the slogan of 'Pro-Life. Pro-Gun. Pro-Trump' throughout his successful campaign.

Trump threatened a wave of blanket tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China Monday evening via a social media post, unless the countries stop the flow of drugs and immigrants into the U.S. 'I think you got to see it as a negotiating tool,' Grassley told reporters Tuesday morning.

Trump is loading his administration up with Floridians. Is Washington ready?	Donald Trump adopted Florida as his home state. Now his second administration will look to transform the country in its image. His new administration is loaded with politicians and operatives who cut their teeth in the Sunshine State — from incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles; to Marco Rubio, the likely next secretary of State; and Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general Trump tapped to lead the Justice Department after the first Floridian he picked, Matt Gaetz, withdrew.

Trump adds senior Vance aide and 2 others to White House team	President-elect Donald Trump has announced three more members of his White House team, including a senior aide to Sen. JD Vance who will work with Congress to push the administration’s agenda. James Braid, Vance’s deputy chief of staff, will serve as director of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Trump said in a statement Monday. His appointment was announced alongside that of Matt Brasseaux to serve as director of the Office of Political Affairs and Alex Latcham as director of the Office of Public Liaison.

Hill GOP leaders meet to talk reconciliation	Congressional Republican leaders met Monday afternoon in Washington to start hammering out plans for partisan spending legislation that would allow them to bypass Democrats while enacting President-elect Donald Trump’s economic agenda, including massive tax cuts, a House leadership aide said. House Speaker Mike Johnson huddled with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and McConnell’s successor, Sen. John Thune, according to the aide, who was granted anonymity to discuss a private conversation. The meeting is another sign that the new Republican-controlled Congress is determined to act swiftly on Trump's agenda once he takes the oath of office. Most bills need a supermajority to pass the Senate. But a process known as budget reconciliation allows lawm...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/25/congress/gop-leaders-meet-to-talk-reconciliation-00191590	2024-11-25T15:15:00-08:00

Trump backs Florida's chief financial officer as successor to Gaetz in Congress	TALLAHASSEE, Florida — President-elect Donald Trump is throwing his support behind Florida’s chief financial officer as his choice to succeed former Rep. Matt Gaetz in Congress, a move that could increase pressure on Gov. Ron DeSantis to pick allies to the president-elect for other posts. Trump on Monday said on social media that he would support Republican Jimmy Patronis for the now-vacant northwest Florida congressional seat that Gaetz gave up during his truncated bid for attorney general. Gaetz withdrew from consideration amid an outcry over investigations into his conduct even though he has denied any wrongdoing. Trump said that Patronis had 'been a wonderful friend to me,' even though Patronis did not endorse Trump in this year’s presidential race until after DeSantis withdrew from th...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/25/trump-patronis-gaetz-congress-00191503	2024-11-25T09:49:05-08:00	https://static.politico.com/c4/ad/37c432694e9da0f8d4ee8ecf5b77/election-2024-republicans-florida-patronis-78683.jpg
Ernst pitches DOGE on spending cuts and savings	Sen. Joni Ernst is pitching President-elect Donald Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency on more than $2 trillion proposed cuts or savings— the latest example of GOP lawmakers embracing the commission. Ernst (R-Iowa) sent a letter on Monday to Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump tapped to lead the out-of-government panel tasked with coordinating with the White House and Office of Management and Budget. 'Thank you for stepping up to take on the challenge of saving taxpayers from Washington’s out- of-control spending that put our nation $36 trillion in debt.

This is the new progressive strategy for warring with Trump	Progressive Democrats wrestling with how to navigate a second Donald Trump presidency are settling on a new approach: Take his populist, working-class proposals at his word — or at least pretend to. If he succeeds, they can take some credit for bringing him to the table. If he doesn’t, they can bash him for it. It’s a change in strategy, emerging in private conversations among some liberal elected officials and operatives, that comes after years of resisting Trump ended with him returning to the White House. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in an interview that she would likely work with Trump if he pursues antitrust promises he made on the campaign trail...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/25/progressives-against-trump-00191392	2024-11-25T09:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/76/2f/290104fc430387d52df8a7244dd7/u-s-congress-59649.jpg

Fears are growing that Trump could push out dozens of government watchdogs	Two in-house investigators at U.S. intelligence agencies recently quit their jobs. There’s growing fear in Washington that they could be the start of an exodus — or a purge — of government watchdogs. A wave of departures by inspectors general would give President-elect Donald Trump the opportunity to nominate or appoint people of his choice to the watchdog posts — leaving dozens of federal departments, agencies and offices subject to oversight by people who would owe their positions to Trump. In the wake of Trump’s election, CIA Inspector General Robin Ashton and Intelligence Community Inspector General Thomas Monheim revealed they plan to leave government in the coming weeks.

Promotion delayed for general who oversaw Afghanistan pullout	A top general who oversaw the 82nd Airborne Division during the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was conspicuously left out of a large batch of military promotions approved Thursday by the Senate before it left town until December.

Christopher Donahue — President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Army in Europe and Africa and set for promotion to four-star general — suggests a senator is holding the nomination. Donahue was one of nearly 1,000 promotions the Senate Armed Services Committee approved on Tuesday, and senators in the full chamber typically clear the decks of uniform nominees before an extended recess. It’s unclear which senator might be delaying Donahue’s promotion and why.

Bob Casey concedes to Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania Senate race	Sen. Bob Casey has conceded the Pennsylvania Senate race to Dave McCormick. Cased said in a statement Thursday that he had called to congratulate McCormick after the first results from a recount had been completed. 'This race was one of the closest in our Commonwealth’s history, decided by less than a quarter of a point,' he said.

Trump once shunned Project 2025 as ‘ridiculous.’ Now he's staffing up with them.	Donald Trump spent his presidential campaign running from Project 2025. Now, he’s using it to stock his White House and administration. In recent days, Trump has tapped nearly a half-dozen Project 2025 authors and contributors, including Brendan Carr, who Trump picked this week to lead the FCC; former Rep. Pete Hoekstra, who got the nod for ambassador to Canada; and John Ratcliffe, who was tapped for director of the CIA. One of Trump’s first selections — Tom Homan as 'border czar' — was also a Project 2025 contributor. The next Project 2025 alum to join the administration could be Russ Vought, the president-elect’s former director of the Office of Management and Budget, who is being closely considered for a return to the role, <a href='https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/19/congr...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/21/trump-taps-project-2025-authors-administration-00191047	2024-11-21T14:27:17-08:00	https://static.politico.com/a0/be/5c2366164e9d85543db231981a9f/trump-rally-21368.jpg
Matt Gaetz won’t be the next attorney general. Will he go back to the Hill?	Matt Gaetz is out of the running for attorney general. He’s also out of a job on Capitol Hill. In Washington and Tallahassee, the question now is: Could he be back in the House in January? The Florida Republican resigned both from his current term and preemptively from his term in the next Congress, which he just won in the November election. 'I do not intend to take the oath of office for the same office in the 119th Congress,' he wrote in a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson that was also transmitted to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. One thing’s clear: He can’t come back for this Congress. But if Gaetz would like to return to Capitol Hill in January and serve in the seat his Florida constituents...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/21/will-matt-gaetz-go-back-to-congress-00191044	2024-11-21T13:35:18-08:00	https://static.politico.com/e4/5b/768d83c9449aa63fce0aa7cb191f/u-s-congress-35284.jpg
With Gaetz gone, Trump’s troubled Pentagon nominee is in the hot seat	Former Rep. Matt Gaetz’s abrupt withdrawal of his bid to be attorney general on Thursday could be bad news for another of President-elect Donald Trump’s picks: Pete Hegseth. Hegseth’s nomination for Defense secretary is facing headwinds over seven-year-old allegations of sexual assault, although he was never charged. But Hegseth so far had been overshadowed by Gaetz, a flame-throwing congressional ally with numerous foes in both parties who faced his own misconduct allegations, including that he engaged in sex with a minor. With Gaetz stepping out of contention, scrutiny could quickly shift to Hegseth after revelations that the Army veteran and former Fox News personality ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/hegseth-gaetz-pentagon-00191051	2024-11-21T13:31:10-08:00

Schumer explains reported GOP deal on judges	The office of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is defending a reported deal where Democrats ceded four appeals court nominations in favor of confirming more of President Joe Biden’s lower-level federal judicial appointees. 'The trade was four circuit nominees — all lacking the votes to get confirmed — for more than triple the number of additional judges moving forward,' a spokesperson for Schumer said Thursday. Democrats have confirmed 221 of Biden’s picks for the federal courts after the Senate overwhelmingly approved Sharad Desai for a federal judicial post in Arizona on Thursday. Republicans have tried throughout the week to erect procedural hurdles to slow confirmation of more Biden judicial nominees.

Fetterman on Gaetz withdrawal: 'I didn't see that coming'	Sen. John Fetterman mocked Matt Gaetz Thursday for withdrawing as Donald Trump's attorney general pick, saying sarcastically that he 'didn’t see that coming.' 'I heard a rumor that they're going to issue a new silver dollar in his honor because he had to withdraw,' Fetterman joked. 'OK, so can we freak out about that next?' Gaetz announced Thursday he was withdrawing, saying in a social media post his nomination had become a distraction. When the president-elect announced he tapped Gaetz to be his next attorney general last week, Fetterman called it 'god-tier-level trolling.' 'People have the opportunity and they can freak out over anything and respond and if they want to do that you better pace yourself though because it’s not even Thanksgiving,' Fetterman told reporters Thursday.

What does Gaetz’s withdrawal mean for the Ethics report?	House Democrats vowed to press forward with their plan to force the release of a long-awaited report into Matt Gaetz even after he withdrew from consideration as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Attorney General. But there are early signs that House Republicans, some of whom had indicated prior to Gaetz’s withdrawal that they supported the Democratic-led effort, are no longer on board. And Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.) the top Republican on the Ethics panel, told CBS Thursday that Gaetz's withdrawal 'should end the discussion of whether or not the Ethics Committee should continue to move forward in this matter.' Democrats introduced a measure on Wednesday that would theoretically force a House floor vote that would make the Ethics panel release the report.

RFK Jr. previously compared Trump to Hitler	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler and disparaged his supporters on his podcast in 2016. Kennedy, who ultimately backed Trump in the 2024 election after dropping his own independent bid, is now a newly selected cabinet member to lead Trump's Health and Human Services Department — but the old comments reflect the fact that Kennedy was a lifelong Democrat before joining forces with the Republican president-elect. In the now-eight-year-old radio show broadcasts, first reported by CNN, Kennedy said Trump was stoking fear on the campaign trail with his rhetoric and compared him to Hitler, the former-segregationist Gov.

Turning Point Action, the group spearheaded by prominent conservative activist Charlie Kirk, plans to hold rallies in states where they believe GOP senators may need extra 'encouragement' to approve nominees like Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler to step down Jan. 20	Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who pursued a sweeping and controversial agenda as Wall Street’s chief overseer over the last three-plus years, plans to step down on Jan. 20, the agency said Thursday. His departure will clear the way for President-elect Donald Trump to install his yet-to-be-named pick to lead the top U.S. financial markets regulator. Gensler's exit will cap one of the most memorable periods in the SEC's history, as the 67-year-old veteran regulator sought to enact a slate of ambitious rules and pursue lawsuits that led to high-profile clashes with both the traditional financial world and the cryptocurrency industry. Among the rules enacted under Gensler were measures seeking to shore up the U.S. Treasury market and to force corporate America to tell ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/wall-streets-top-regulator-to-exit-00190948	2024-11-21T10:20:42-08:00	
Donald Trump gets a brutal reality check	Donald Trump is not a monarch. That’s the unmistakable lesson of the ill-fated nomination of Matt Gaetz for attorney general. Rather than showcasing Trump’s absolute power over his GOP allies, it revealed his limits. The doomed nomination lasted just eight days — and its failure is an unwelcome lesson for the president-elect, who has been projecting invincibility and claiming a historic mandate despite his reed-thin popular vote victory. 'The short version is ‘checks and balances work,’' said Eugene Volokh, a UCLA professor of law.

Gaetz held multiple meetings with GOP senators over the past couple of days as he sought to game out his chances of getting confirmed. Even senators who supported him had expressed doubts that he could get confirmed, given he could only lose three Republican votes. 'It is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.

Beyond that, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will have half a dozen more nominees primed for final Senate approval — though the actual confirmations won’t take place until after Thanksgiving.

Peltola got to Congress following a 2022 special election following Republican Rep. Don Young’s death.

'The PRO Act would deprive employees of their right to a secret ballot and their privacy in union representation elections,' Kristen Swearingen, president of the Coalition for a Democratic Workplace, said in a statement.

Costa will challenge Scott for job leading Democrats on House Agriculture Committee	Senior House Agriculture Committee member Jim Costa (D-Calif.) will challenge ailing ranking member David Scott (D-Ga.) as the leader of the House Agriculture Committee, he told colleagues Wednesday. Costa informed a group of fellow California Democrats of his plans to challenge Scott during the state delegation lunch, according to three people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting. And he has invited some Democrats to a meeting Thursday to discuss the farm bill — which has been stalled in Congress for over a year.

Luna: Johnson blocked proxy voting for new moms	Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) said Wednesday that Speaker Mike Johnson has blocked her proposal to allow new mothers to vote by proxy for several months from being included in the rules package for the next Congress. 'Today, after speaking with @SpeakerJohnson about this for months, I was told, He will not support allowing female members to vote if they give birth,' she wrote in a thread on X. 'Among other things, this is something that I fundamentally disagree with him on.' Johnson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but he has backup from other corners of the Republican conference.

Steve Bannon ally reuses Vance’s ‘mouth breathing imbeciles’ quip	Grace Chong, chief financial officer and chief operating officer for MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon’s 'War Room,' called Republicans who missed the vote to confirm a judicial nominee Wednesday 'mouth breathing imbeciles!!!' on X — a clapback to JD Vance’s recent pointed remarks at her. Chong was commenting directly on the Senate confirming Rebecca Pennell as District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Washington by a vote of 50-48 on Wednesday. If GOP Sens. Mike Braun and Ted Cruz had been present and voted no, their two votes would have led to a tie that Vice President Kamala Harris would have to break. Chong reused the colorful phrase 'mouth breathing imbeciles' just one day after <a href='https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/19/congress/jd-vance-grace-chong-bannon-00190484' t...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/mouth-breathing-imbeciles-00190688	2024-11-20T11:16:37-08:00	
Trump's plan to let Lutnick oversee trade office needs Congress' buy-in	In announcing his Commerce secretary pick Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump also suggested he wants to dramatically reorder how trade policy is made in Washington. Congress will likely have something to say about that. Trump tapped Howard Lutnick for the role, saying in a statement that his transition co-chair and Wall Street billionaire will 'lead his tariff and trade agenda' and will have 'direct responsibility for the Office of the United States Trade Representative.' But as numerous trade policy experts immediately pointed out, the move could set off a battle with Congress over who controls trade policy in the next Trump administration. 'I think keeping the independence of USTR is very important, but also it is an offshoot of congressional authority,' said Rep. <a href='https://dir...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/trumps-trade-00190687	2024-11-20T11:16:07-08:00	
The Vance-Gaetz message to senators: Get him to a hearing	Senators exiting closed-door meetings with Matt Gaetz on Wednesday had a message: Just get the man to a hearing. Gaetz, Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, and Vice President-elect JD Vance (R-Ohio) met with GOP senators on Wednesday to discuss the congressman’s embattled nomination. Swaths of Senate Republicans have not yet committed to supporting Gaetz, and at least two senators — Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) — have cast serious doubts on Gaetz getting confirmed to the top position at the Justice Department. Gaetz faces a litany of allegations, including that he had sex with a minor and paid for sex, though he has denied any wrongdoing. The House Ethics Committee is currently weighing whether to share a report they have been assembling on those accusations ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/readout-from-vance-gaetz-meetings-00190682	2024-11-20T10:53:40-08:00	
Powerful GOP steering committee comes together	House Republicans named the members of their steering committee Wednesday, locking in a new group that holds power to set most committee assignments and committee chairs, significantly influencing how the conference as a whole operates. The 30 person body includes regional representation and members of leadership — whose votes have more weight than other members. But the rank-and-file members are usually allies of leadership, which helps concentrate the power of committee slots to leadership. Speaker Mike Johnson’s vote counts as four and Majority Leader Steve Scalise’s counts as two, with the rest of leadership and rank and file members weighted equally at one vote. Louisiana, in particular, is going to be a powerful voting bloc for members.

Gaetz recess appointment could be unconstitutional, former DOJ official who wrote torture memos warns	The former Justice Department official who authored the post-9/11 'torture memos' cautioned that President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of former Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general 'would plunge the DOJ into a political and legal quagmire' — and that a recess appointment could even be 'unconstitutional.' 'Gaetz would serve the returning president better by withdrawing,' wrote John Yoo, who has served in all three branches of government, in an op-ed published Wednesday and co-written with the legal scholar Robert J.

Rand Paul breaks with Trump on using military for mass deportations: ‘Huge mistake’	GOP Sen. Rand Paul denounced President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to deploy the military to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants upon his return to office, saying it would be a 'huge mistake' and a misuse of military personnel. 'I’m not in favor of sending the Army in uniforms into our cities to collect people,' Paul (R-Ky.) told Newsmax host Rob Schmitt on Tuesday.

In a letter obtained by POLITICO sent to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Democratic members of Judiciary Committee requested the evidentiary file from law enforcement’s probe into whether Gaetz engaged in child sex trafficking.

Johnson announces policy barring transgender women from women's bathrooms on House side of Capitol	Speaker Mike Johnson has banned transgender women from using women’s bathrooms in the House portion of the Capitol building, enacting into policy a push led by Rep. Nancy Mace. 'All single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office Buildings — such as restrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms — are reserved for individuals of that biological sex,' Johnson said in a statement Wednesday.

In a statement, Trump said that 'Matt is a strong warrior and loyal Patriot, who will ensure the United States’ interests are advanced and defended.' Trump added: 'Matt will strengthen relationships with our NATO Allies, and stand firm in the face of threats to Peace and Stability - He will put AMERICA FIRST.' Whitaker’s foreign policy views are largely unknown.

The Democratic leaders stepping up as Trump’s biggest foes	Democrats are deeply divided on how aggressively to resist President-elect Donald Trump and his allies. While some are taking a conciliatory approach to the incoming Republican trifecta, others are vowing to thwart their policies with every legal and legislative tool available. It’s a moment those in the resistance camp — many with grander political ambitions — have been preparing for behind the scenes for many months. Those preparations were aided by Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that outlined a policy wish-list for the next Republican administration, from slashing environmental regulations to issuing a national abortion ban.

Race for the House: Capitol Hill ponders how thin a razor-thin majority can be	More than two weeks after Election Day, there are still five uncalled House races — four of which have a margin of just hundreds of votes. In California, the two uncalled races each have margins of about 300 votes. Why does this matter? If Democrats flip both California seats, Republicans would have just a 220-215 House majority at the start of the new Congress. That’s before factoring in the departures of three GOP congresspeople — Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), Matt Gaetz (Fla.) and Michael Waltz (Fla.) — nominated for roles in the Trump administration that would temporarily trim that margin even further. Republican leadership would need incredibly strict caucus management in this scenario to pass anything.

MAGA world is thrilled with Hegseth pick. Republican senators have questions.	After a weekend of brutal headlines disclosing sexual assault allegations against Pete Hegseth, Senate Republicans are offering a tepid defense of Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon. Republicans have downplayed and deflected when asked about Hegseth — arguing Trump picked an outsider to shake up the Pentagon bureaucracy or that the confirmation process should play out. 'Let me say this: I have asked to read the allegations and I honestly have not had time to look at it, so I just can’t comment,' Senate Armed Services ranking Republican Roger Wicker said on Monday. 'I am looking to be very supportive of his nomination.' By Tuesday, Wicker, who will preside over Hegseth’s confirmation process when Republicans take control of the Senate in January, wasn’t taking reporters’ questions.

O’Brien is privately raising Chavez-DeRemer’s name as a top pick for the role. GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have also advocated for Chavez-DeRemer for the job directly with President-elect Donald Trump and his team, according to another person familiar with the matter.

POLITICO spoke with seven people who were granted anonymity to discuss deliberations within the Trump team.

Just one GOP vote on the Ethics Committee could release the Gaetz report	The House Ethics Committee is scheduled to meet Wednesday. And if members vote on whether to share their investigative findings about attorney general nominee Matt Gaetz, it would only take one Republican to trigger the release of the report. The panel is evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, and it only requires a majority vote in the private meeting to release the report. A tie would defer to the party that controls the House — meaning if all Republicans voted against releasing it, the report would not be published. But it would only take one, combined with all Democrats, to share the report, either with senators or publicly. Republicans on the committee have largely declined to comment on the upcoming meeting at all, let alone whether they would vote to release the report.

Judge denies Jan. 6 defendant’s bid to delay trial that could straddle Trump inauguration	A Jan. 6 defendant facing five felony charges could be on trial at the precise moment power changes hand from Joe Biden to Donald Trump — an uncomfortable prospect for prosecutors bracing for a leadership change that could upend cases stemming from the attack on the Capitol. U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich on Tuesday denied a bid by defendant Michael Picciuto to postpone his Jan. 13 trial into April, who cited the prospect of a pardon from Trump and the potential awkwardness of being on trial at the moment the transfer of power occurs as a reason to delay. 'The chances of this going a week could easily actually roll into the date of the inauguration itself,' Picciuto’s attorney Jay Crook said. But Friedrich, a Trump appointee, said the hope for a pardon is 'entirely speculative in nat...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/19/congress/january-6-donald-trump-doj-00190348	2024-11-19T07:22:10-08:00

Republicans slow down Senate floor to delay Biden judicial picks	Senate Republicans moved to slow down the pace of judicial nomination confirmations in the waning days of Joe Biden’s presidency on Monday evening, forcing the chamber into hours of routine votes. What happened? Senators initially confirmed Embry Kidd to an appeals court post by a 49-45 vote on Monday evening. But then the roadblocks began. Moving between executive session — to consider nominations — and legislative session — to consider bills — is normally done by unanimous consent, but Republicans forced votes on those procedural actions throughout the evening. Those votes only required a simple majority, so Democrats were able to easily pass them. But they had to stay close to the chamber. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was unbowed by the procedural obstacles. 'We'll keep going,' ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/19/congress/senate-slowdown-00190335	2024-11-19T05:42:15-08:00	
Negative signs for Gaetz as senators brush off questions amid Trump pressure	A negative sign looms for Matt Gaetz: Nearly a dozen GOP senators won’t commit to confirming him for attorney general, saying they want to let the process play out. And many, even if they aren’t insisting on seeing the potentially damaging House Ethics report on the recently resigned lawmaker, assume the information will have to come out. 'He’s got an uphill climb,' said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a senior member of the conference who said she looked forward to meeting with Gaetz and the Judiciary Committee's review of the nomination. Promising to follow the vetting process doesn’t mean senators will necessarily oppose a nominee, but it’s notable given GOP senators are clearly wary of crossing President-elect Donald Trump. And it contrasts heavily with more Trump-aligned senators, many of w...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/18/congress/gop-senators-on-gaetz-ethics-report-00190295	2024-11-18T16:39:02-08:00	
McBride responds to effort to ban transgender women from Capitol women’s bathrooms	Rep.-elect Sarah McBride said a resolution from Rep. Nancy Mace to ban transgender women from women’s bathrooms in the Capitol was a distraction in a Monday statement. 'This is a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing,' McBride, a Delaware Democrat who is set to become the first openly transgender member of Congress, said. 'We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.

Congress is running out of time to pass a December funding deal	Facing a government shutdown deadline in just over a month, Congress is quickly running out of time to do anything but punt funding levels into next year — unless bipartisan talks begin in earnest. Congressional leaders have yet to announce the start of negotiations over a more comprehensive funding deal, raising the odds that lawmakers will resort to a stopgap in late December that kicks the next funding cliff into President-elect Donald Trump’s first months in office. Even if Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer started talking now, it could already be too late to pass final funding measures by the Dec. 20 deadline. That’s because it usually takes Congress about a month to clear bills with updated spending levels once leaders have reached a deal on overall totals...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/18/congress/congress-running-out-of-time-on-funding-00190271	2024-11-18T16:20:48-08:00	
Trump to join Musk at SpaceX launch in Texas	Donald Trump plans to accompany billionaire Elon Musk to a SpaceX launch in Texas on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the president-elect's plans. Musk, who emerged as a top donor and Trump surrogate during the 2024 election, has been an influential person in Trump's orbit since the election. The world's richest person has sat in on Trump's calls with world leaders, and has chimed in on his Cabinet picks. Recently, he publicly advocated for Howard Lutnick to be Treasury secretary and used his social media platform to back Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) for Senate majority leader (Scott flamed out). Musk flew with Trump to Washington last week and also joined him over the weekend for the Ultimate Fighting Championship match at Madison Square Garden.

How the Gaetz Ethics report could still come out if the panel blocks it	House Ethics Committee members are set to meet privately Wednesday as debate rages over whether the panel should release its report on its investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz. But even if they elect not to release it, that might not be the end of the road. The committee doesn’t disclose its agenda. But Ethics members are under intense scrutiny as they figure out how to address the report, which lawmakers in both chambers have said they would like to review, particularly given Gaetz’s attorney general nomination. The committee could vote to adopt or release a report during its closed-door meeting. If the vote is along party lines — the same number of Democrats and Republicans sit on the committee — a tie means the motion fails and defers to the majority, which is Republican.

Top Democrat on Ethics panel says she wants to publish Gaetz report	Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the House Ethics Committee, said Monday she wants her panel’s report on former Rep. Matt Gaetz to be released to the public. 'It should certainly be released to the Senate, and I think it should be released to the public, as we have done with many other investigative reports in the past,' she told a small group of reporters. Both Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are pushing for access to the report after President-elect Donald Trump tapped Gaetz to be his attorney general last week. Gaetz resigned from the House hours after the announcement — amid rumors that the Ethics report could be released in the coming days — complicating the decision to publish the findings of the investigation.

House Ethics chair: Panel’s decision on Gaetz report won’t be influenced by Johnson	House Ethics Chair Michael Guest said Monday that his panel will make its own decision about releasing the report into Matt Gaetz, regardless of Speaker Mike Johnson’s opinion that it should be kept under wraps. Guest (R-Miss.) told POLITICO in a brief interview that he and Johnson had spoken over the weekend. He added that all Ethics Committee members can now review the report, when only he and Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the panel, previously had a copy of it, according to two people familiar with the matter. 'We did talk this weekend,' Guest said, noting Johnson shared the same views he has publicly — that the panel should not release the report.

Health care organization launches ‘Stop RFK War Room’	Democratic-aligned health care advocacy groups are putting together a strategy to fight Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination to be HHS secretary. During an organizing call on Monday, the details of which have not been reported publicly, more than 200 people from several dozen of those groups, along with other advocacy organizations, discussed strategies to oppose Kennedy’s nomination. That included which Republican senators to target and the most effective way to talk to them, according to Brad Woodhouse, executive director of Protect Our Care. 'We’re nowhere near conceding he’s going to be the next HHS secretary,' he said.

According to three people familiar with discussions happening among Trump and his inner circle, including his transition team, the latest names to bubble up to succeed Pete Buttigieg atop DOT include former House lawmaker and Fox News contributor (and star of MTV's The Real World) Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) and Emil Michael, a former executive at Uber.

White House asks Congress for $100B in aid for hurricanes, other disasters	The Biden administration on Monday sent Congress a roughly $100 billion emergency funding request to rebuild communities hit by hurricanes Helene and Milton, along with a slew of other disasters nationwide. Top lawmakers plan to spend the next few weeks finalizing a bipartisan bill that fulfills at least some of that request, with a goal of final passage sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Since Congress also faces a government shutdown deadline on Dec. 20, it’s possible disaster aid gets tied into a spending patch or broader funding package. Besides $40 billion to refill FEMA’s disaster relief fund, the White House is seeking emergency funding for more than a dozen other federal agen...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/18/white-house-asks-congress-for-100b-in-aid-for-hurricanes-other-disasters-00190167	2024-11-18T09:30:48-08:00	https://static.politico.com/a8/0e/6e59a82f42a788b1e7d0b0069b69/hurricane-helene-fema-threats-48350.jpg
Ron DeSantis’ ‘Apprentice’: Governor announces how he’ll pick Marco Rubio’s replacement	MIAMI — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis intends to hold interviews and 'extensive vetting' to help him decide who should replace Marco Rubio in the Senate. The seat will soon open up after President-elect Donald Trump announced he planned to nominate Rubio to be secretary of state, which will necessitate Rubio resigning from his role. DeSantis under Florida law will be tasked with appointing Rubio’s successor, and he said in a post on X Monday morning that he would likely finish the selection process 'by the beginning of January.'

Trump’s immigration crackdown is expected to start on Day 1	In his first 100 days, President-elect Donald Trump plans to begin the process of deporting hundreds of thousands of people. He is expected to end parole for people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. And he is likely to undo a policy that significantly constrained deportations for people who weren't deemed threats to public safety or national security. Trump’s team is already thinking about how to craft executive actions aimed to withstand the legal challenges from immigrants’ rights groups — all in hopes of avoiding an early defeat like the one his 2017 travel ban targeting majority-Muslim nations suffered.

Matt Gaetz as attorney general. 'Critics of unfit appointees should applaud when the President picks qualified people with integrity,' Rosenstein wrote on X Friday.

These senators hold RFK Jr.’s fate in their hands. Here’s what they think about him.	To get confirmed as HHS secretary, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will first need to get through the Senate Finance Committee. And though Republicans will have an edge, it will only take a few defectors to sink his nomination if Democrats, as expected, oppose him in unison. Republicans have rushed to applaud some of Trump’s more conventional other Cabinet picks, but the lack of public enthusiasm for RFK among some on the committee suggests some may be skeptical. Here’s where committee Republicans stand on Kennedy, so far: Mike Crapo, Idaho: The top Republican on the committee said in a statement that Kennedy has 'prioritized addressing chronic diseases through consumer choice and healthy lifestyle. American patients, providers and taxpayers deserve a ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/15/congress/robert-f-kennedy-jr-hhs-confirmation-00189833	2024-11-15T09:15:20-08:00	
Johnson: Ethics shouldn't release Gaetz report	Speaker Mike Johnson said he does not think the House Ethics report into Matt Gaetz should be released, as the former representative faces a Senate confirmation for attorney general. 'I'm going to strongly request that the Ethics Committee not issue the report, because that is not the way we do things in the House,' Johnson said. 'And I think that would be a terrible precedent to set.' Johnson said he plans to talk to House Ethics Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.), but does not know when yet, adding that he got back from Mar-a-Lago at about 3 a.m. 'The rules of the House have always been that a former member is beyond the ju...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/15/congress/johnson-ethics-shouldnt-release-gaetz-report-00189827	2024-11-15T08:39:53-08:00	
Pence urges Senate to reject RFK Jr. for HHS over abortion stance	Mike Pence is urging Senate Republicans to not confirm Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as Health and Human Services secretary, calling his nomination by President-elect Donald Trump 'deeply concerning.' 'I believe the nomination of RFK Jr. to serve as Secretary of HHS is an abrupt departure from the pro-life record of our administration and should be deeply concerning to millions of Pro-Life Americans who have supported the Republican Party and our nominees for decades,' Pence said in a statement Friday on behalf of his conservative nonprofit Advancing American Freedom.

House Ethics chair says meeting on Gaetz report has been postponed, not canceled	Chair of the House Ethics Committee Michael Guest said Friday morning the group has only postponed, not canceled, a meeting to discuss the panel's report about Matt Gaetz. Guest (R-Miss.) declined to say whether the panel is open to sharing it with the Senate Judiciary Committee, as some senators say they want to see the report as they vet him as Donald Trump's attorney general nominee. Guest noted Ethics members need to meet first. 'We've not met as a committee, and so at this point, there's nothing that I'm sure I can't comment about,' he said, noting the meeting will be rescheduled. Guest also dismissed suggestions that he was worried about potential retribution from Trump world if the committee released the report.

Thune faces first loyalty test: What to do with Trump’s most controversial Cabinet picks	A series of controversial Cabinet picks have become an early test for how Senate leader-in-waiting John Thune will balance proving his loyalty to Donald Trump with the interests of his wide-ranging conference. So far, he seems to be giving the president-elect wide deference. Trump hasn’t finished his selections yet, but three picks for some of the most influential roles in the Cabinet are already prompting anxiety among GOP senators who must decide whether to confirm them: Matt Gaetz for attorney general, Pete Hegseth for secretary of Defense and Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence. And POLITICO first reported another pick Thursday afternoon: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services secretary. Broadly, Republican senators, led by Thune (R-S.D.), say Trump should ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/15/thune-loyalty-test-trump-cabinet-picks-00189722	2024-11-15T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/ec/83/1e01111a40f98b782237435fea7a/u-s-congress-15399.jpg
Nuts on a lot of fronts': New York Post condemns Kennedy pick to lead HHS	The New York Post editorial board slammed President-elect Donald Trump’s choice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, calling the secretary-designate 'nuts on a lot of fronts.' The Post, owned by Rupert Murdoch, is reliably conservative and endorsed Trump for president this year. But Trump’s selection of the anti-vaccine activist Kennedy to lead HHS, the tabloid’s editorial board argued, would violate the first rule of medicine, 'do no harm.' Recalling a 2023 meeting with Kennedy, the Post’s editorial board called his views 'a head-scratching spaghetti of what we can only call warped conspiracy theories, and not just on vaccines.' Kennedy is well known for touting debunked claims that vaccines cause autism and questioning other issues widely seen as ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/15/congress/robert-f-kennedy-jr-new-york-post-00189800	2024-11-15T06:54:52-08:00	
Hill Republicans rejoice over Burgum pick for Interior	President-elect Donald Trump has tapped North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum for Interior secretary, he announced at a gala at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida Thursday night. 'I won't tell you his name, might be something like Burgum, Burgum, ... he's gonna be announced tomorrow for a very big position,' Trump said Thursday evening. 'he's going to head the Department of Interior, and he's gonna be fantastic. Good Doug.' A two-term governor of a Western oil-rich state with five tribal nations, Burgum is already receiving a warm reception from Republicans on Capitol Hill, who for four years have slammed President Joe Biden's energy policies. Democrats will be unhappy with his promises to ramp up fossil fuel production but could be less critical of him because of his experience. Republicans who sit...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/15/congress/doug-burgum-interior-secretary-reaction-00189798	2024-11-15T06:28:30-08:00

House ethics panel cancels meeting amid pressure to release Gaetz report	The House Ethics Committee won’t be meeting after all on Friday as pressure builds to release the findings of its report on Rep. Matt Gaetz. Anticipation was high for the closed-door meeting after Donald Trump announced he was picking the Florida member of Congress to be attorney general. But the meeting was abruptly canceled Thursday, according to a person familiar with the schedule granted anonymity to discuss non-public information. It is unclear why the committee canceled a meeting that was scheduled before Gaetz resigned from Congress this week, three people familiar told POLITICO earlier. An Ethics Committee spokesperson declined to comment on...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/14/congress/gaetz-ethics-probe-00189757	2024-11-14T17:20:04-08:00	
Lawyer who argued for Trump’s immunity at Supreme Court is tapped for solicitor general	Dean John Sauer, the lawyer whose arguments led to a Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity that waylaid Donald Trump’s prosecution on charges of attempting to subvert the 2020 presidential election, is Trump’s pick to be solicitor general in his second term. The solicitor general represents the federal government at the high court. 'John is a deeply accomplished, masterful appellate attorney,' Trump said in a statement Thursday. The president-elect credited Sauer for 'winning a historic victory on presidential immunity which was key to defeating the unconstitutional campaign of lawfare against me and the entire MAGA movement.'

Matt Gaetz has bashed Senate Republicans for years. To be Trump's AG, he'll need their votes.	Before he can become Donald Trump’s attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) will need to face off with some potentially less-than-friendly faces to receive confirmation: Republican senators he’s previously antagonized. With a 53-seat majority, the Senate GOP can only lose up to three votes and still clear a nominee if Democrats unanimously oppose them. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), for one, said Wednesday that Gaetz has 'his work cut out for him to get a good, strong vote,' adding that 'it’ll make for a popcorn-eating confirmation hearing.' Gaetz has a history of speaking h...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/14/congress/gaetz-attorney-general-trump-00189721	2024-11-14T16:00:00-08:00	
Trump picks his New York hush money defense lawyers for top spots at DOJ	President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday tapped the lawyers who represented him in the New York hush money criminal trial for the No. 2 and No. 3 spots at the Department of Justice. Todd Blanche, a former federal prosecutor who defended Trump in his Manhattan criminal trial, which ended in Trump’s conviction on 34 counts, and his two federal criminal cases, will be deputy attorney general, the second-highest ranking post at DOJ and the person who runs its day-to-day operations, if confirmed. Emil Bove, who also represented the president-elect in the hush money trial and his two federal criminal cases, will serve as principal associate deputy attorney general. Blanche is known as a mild-mannered and by-the-books lawyer, in sharp contrast with Trump’s attorney general nominee, the firebrand ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/14/congress/todd-blanche-deputy-attorney-general-trump-00189746	2024-11-14T15:42:15-08:00	
Ethics panel to meet as pressure builds for Gaetz report release	Members of a secretive panel overseeing a long-running investigation into Matt Gaetz are set to privately meet on Friday, according to three people familiar with the matter. The House Ethics Committee meeting was scheduled before Gaetz (R-Fla.) resigned from Congress this week, the people said. The committee doesn’t disclose its agenda — but the highly anticipated closed-door powwow would let them discuss what to do with the probe now that Gaetz is technically outside of their jurisdiction. Speaker Mike Johnson announced that Gaetz had resigned Wednesday night, hours after President-elect Trump nominated the Florida firebrand to become attorney general. Johnson attributed the resignation to Gaetz wanting to allow his seat to be filled quickly, but House Republicans have speculated that he ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/14/congress/gop-lawmakers-want-to-see-gaetz-report-00189745	2024-11-14T15:36:55-08:00	
Trump selects Jay Clayton, a business-friendly former regulator, as top federal prosecutor in Manhattan	President-elect Donald Trump has picked Jay Clayton, a longtime corporate lawyer and former Wall Street regulator, to be the U.S. attorney overseeing Manhattan. Clayton served as the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump’s first term but has no experience as a criminal prosecutor. If confirmed by the Senate, Clayton would head the nation’s most prestigious federal prosecutor’s office: the Southern District of New York, which has jurisdiction over the largest financial institutions and brings many high-profile white-collar and public-corruption cases. During his first term, Trump attempted to install Clayton as the U.S. attorney for SDNY in an effort to oust Geoffrey Berman, who held the post from 2018 to 2020. But Trump’s effort was met with fierce resistance in the ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/14/congress/key-u-s-attorney-pick-00189709	2024-11-14T14:25:53-08:00
