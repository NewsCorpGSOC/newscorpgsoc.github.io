Trump once shunned Project 2025 as ‘ridiculous.’ Now he's staffing up with them.	Donald Trump spent his presidential campaign running from Project 2025. Now, he’s using it to stock his White House and administration. In recent days, Trump has tapped nearly a half-dozen Project 2025 authors and contributors, including Brendan Carr, who Trump picked this week to lead the FCC; former Rep. Pete Hoekstra, who got the nod for ambassador to Canada; and John Ratcliffe, who was tapped for director of the CIA. One of Trump’s first selections — Tom Homan as 'border czar' — was also a Project 2025 contributor. The next Project 2025 alum to join the administration could be Russ Vought, the president-elect’s former director of the Office of Management and Budget, who is being closely considered for a return to the role, <a href='https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/19/congr...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/21/trump-taps-project-2025-authors-administration-00191047	2024-11-21T14:27:17-08:00	https://static.politico.com/a0/be/5c2366164e9d85543db231981a9f/trump-rally-21368.jpg
Matt Gaetz won’t be the next attorney general. Will he go back to the Hill?	Matt Gaetz is out of the running for attorney general. He’s also out of a job on Capitol Hill. In Washington and Tallahassee, the question now is: Could he be back in the House in January? The Florida Republican resigned both from his current term and preemptively from his term in the next Congress, which he just won in the November election. 'I do not intend to take the oath of office for the same office in the 119th Congress,' he wrote in a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson that was also transmitted to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. One thing’s clear: He can’t come back for this Congress. But if Gaetz would like to return to Capitol Hill in January and serve in the seat his Florida constituents...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/21/will-matt-gaetz-go-back-to-congress-00191044	2024-11-21T13:35:18-08:00	https://static.politico.com/e4/5b/768d83c9449aa63fce0aa7cb191f/u-s-congress-35284.jpg
With Gaetz gone, Trump’s troubled Pentagon nominee is in the hot seat	Former Rep. Matt Gaetz’s abrupt withdrawal of his bid to be attorney general on Thursday could be bad news for another of President-elect Donald Trump’s picks: Pete Hegseth. Hegseth’s nomination for Defense secretary is facing headwinds over seven-year-old allegations of sexual assault, although he was never charged. But Hegseth so far had been overshadowed by Gaetz, a flame-throwing congressional ally with numerous foes in both parties who faced his own misconduct allegations, including that he engaged in sex with a minor. With Gaetz stepping out of contention, scrutiny could quickly shift to Hegseth after revelations that the Army veteran and former Fox News personality ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/hegseth-gaetz-pentagon-00191051	2024-11-21T13:31:10-08:00

Schumer explains reported GOP deal on judges	The office of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is defending a reported deal where Democrats ceded four appeals court nominations in favor of confirming more of President Joe Biden’s lower-level federal judicial appointees. 'The trade was four circuit nominees — all lacking the votes to get confirmed — for more than triple the number of additional judges moving forward,' a spokesperson for Schumer said Thursday. Democrats have confirmed 221 of Biden’s picks for the federal courts after the Senate overwhelmingly approved Sharad Desai for a federal judicial post in Arizona on Thursday. Republicans have tried throughout the week to erect procedural hurdles to slow confirmation of more Biden judicial nominees. President-elect Donald Trump has urged GOP senators to do everything possible to ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/schumer-on-gop-judges-deal-00191038	2024-11-21T12:57:59-08:00	
Fetterman on Gaetz withdrawal: 'I didn't see that coming'	Sen. John Fetterman mocked Matt Gaetz Thursday for withdrawing as Donald Trump's attorney general pick, saying sarcastically that he 'didn’t see that coming.' 'I heard a rumor that they're going to issue a new silver dollar in his honor because he had to withdraw,' Fetterman joked. 'OK, so can we freak out about that next?' Gaetz announced Thursday he was withdrawing, saying in a social media post his nomination had become a distraction. When the president-elect announced he tapped Gaetz to be his next attorney general last week, Fetterman called it 'god-tier-level trolling.' 'People have the opportunity and they can freak out over anything and respond and if they want to do that you better pace yourself though because it’s not even Thanksgiving,' Fetterman told reporters Thursday.

GOP senators expect to meet with RFK Jr. soon	Republican senators expect Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to soon make the rounds on Capitol Hill as he seeks to win their votes for his confirmation to be Trump’s Health and Human Services secretary. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) said Thursday Kennedy was likely to journey to the Hill in the coming days, suggesting he’d meet with GOP senators after the Thanksgiving break. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), the top Republican on the HELP Committee, confirmed there has been 'some preliminary reach out' to organize the meetings.

What does Gaetz’s withdrawal mean for the Ethics report?	House Democrats vowed to press forward with their plan to force the release of a long-awaited report into Matt Gaetz even after he withdrew from consideration as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Attorney General. But there are early signs that House Republicans, some of whom had indicated prior to Gaetz’s withdrawal that they supported the Democratic-led effort, are no longer on board. And Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.) the top Republican on the Ethics panel, told CBS Thursday that Gaetz's withdrawal 'should end the discussion of whether or not the Ethics Committee should continue to move forward in this matter.' Democrats introduced a measure on Wednesday that would theoretically force a House floor vote that would make the Ethics panel release the report. It’s still unclear if th...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/future-of-the-gaetz-ethics-report-00190980	2024-11-21T10:51:12-08:00

RFK Jr. previously compared Trump to Hitler	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler and disparaged his supporters on his podcast in 2016. Kennedy, who ultimately backed Trump in the 2024 election after dropping his own independent bid, is now a newly selected cabinet member to lead Trump's Health and Human Services Department — but the old comments reflect the fact that Kennedy was a lifelong Democrat before joining forces with the Republican president-elect. In the now-eight-year-old radio show broadcasts, first reported by CNN, Kennedy said Trump was stoking fear on the campaign trail with his rhetoric and compared him to Hitler, the former-segregationist Gov. George Wallace and other divisive leaders. O...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/rfk-jr-trump-hitler-00190944	2024-11-21T10:29:36-08:00	
Turning Point readies state lobbying effort to help Trump’s nominees	As uncertainty mounts about whether the new Republican-controlled Senate will sign off on some of President-Elect Donald Trump’s more controversial Cabinet picks, a top conservative grassroots group is dialing up the pressure. Turning Point Action, the group spearheaded by prominent conservative activist Charlie Kirk, plans to hold rallies in states where they believe GOP senators may need extra 'encouragement' to approve nominees like Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. That list also initially included Rep. Matt Gaetz, who Trump tapped for attorney general, though the Florida Republican on Thursday announced he was withdrawing from consideration, expla...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/turning-point-00190959	2024-11-21T10:21:37-08:00	
SEC Chair Gary Gensler to step down Jan. 20	Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who pursued a sweeping and controversial agenda as Wall Street’s chief overseer over the last three-plus years, plans to step down on Jan. 20, the agency said Thursday. His departure will clear the way for President-elect Donald Trump to install his yet-to-be-named pick to lead the top U.S. financial markets regulator. Gensler's exit will cap one of the most memorable periods in the SEC's history, as the 67-year-old veteran regulator sought to enact a slate of ambitious rules and pursue lawsuits that led to high-profile clashes with both the traditional financial world and the cryptocurrency industry. Among the rules enacted under Gensler were measures seeking to shore up the U.S. Treasury market and to force corporate America to tell ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/wall-streets-top-regulator-to-exit-00190948	2024-11-21T10:20:42-08:00	
Donald Trump gets a brutal reality check	Donald Trump is not a monarch. That’s the unmistakable lesson of the ill-fated nomination of Matt Gaetz for attorney general. Rather than showcasing Trump’s absolute power over his GOP allies, it revealed his limits. The doomed nomination lasted just eight days — and its failure is an unwelcome lesson for the president-elect, who has been projecting invincibility and claiming a historic mandate despite his reed-thin popular vote victory. 'The short version is ‘checks and balances work,’' said Eugene Volokh, a UCLA professor of law.

Matt Gaetz withdraws from consideration for Trump's AG	Matt Gaetz announced Thursday he is withdrawing his name from consideration as President-elect Donald Trump's pick as attorney general, noting in a social media post that his nomination had become a distraction. Gaetz held multiple meetings with GOP senators over the past couple of days as he sought to game out his chances of getting confirmed. Even senators who supported him had expressed doubts that he could get confirmed, given he could only lose three Republican votes. 'It is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.

Keep your eyes on these Senate Republicans. They could upend Pete Hegseth’s confirmation.	Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Pentagon, is on Capitol Hill Thursday to make his case with Senate Republicans as controversy continues to build around his nomination. The Army veteran and Fox News host will need to address allegations of sexual assault that surfaced in recent days. Concern on the Hill is only likely to build after a police report into the 2017 allegations, which Hegseth denies and wasn’t charged in, became public on Wednesday. Four Senate Republicans would need to break ranks to sink Hegseth’s nomination.

Biden’s judicial nominees roll onward in the Senate	Senate Democrats confirmed the Biden administration’s 220th lifetime appointment to the federal judiciary on Wednesday — and are poised to add to that total as they wind down their time in Washington before Thanksgiving. Lawmakers voted beyond midnight to end debate on a handful of other nominees. On Thursday, they’ll vote to confirm Sharad Desai to be district judge for the District of Arizona. Beyond that, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will have half a dozen more nominees primed for final Senate approval — though the actual confirmations won’t take place until after Thanksgiving. Of note: Vice President-elect JD Vance was present and voted no on the latter half of these judicial moves, so he was near the Senate floor until around midnight.

Republican Begich unseats Peltola in Alaska House race	Alaska Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola lost her reelection campaign Wednesday, a little more than two years after she unexpectedly flipped the Republican-held seat. Peltola lost to Republican challenger Nick Begich III, a business owner and grandson of former Sen. Nick Begich (D). The winner ended up with 51 percent of the vote after more ballots were counted and the state applied its rank choice voting process. Peltola got to Congress following a 2022 special election following Republican Rep. Don Young’s death.

The response to The Trump Show’s casting call will be even more clarifying. In short: Will the Senate remain the Senate? While much of the GOP has become a Trump subsidiary, there are still some Senate Republicans who consider themselves members of a co-equal branch of government and take their Advise and Consent duty seriously.

'He did an outstanding job as United States Ambassador to the Netherlands during our first four years, and I am confident that he will continue to represent our Country well in this new role.'

The inaction is triggering outrage among Democrats, who argue the committee is dragging out the process, while Republicans remain furious that Gaetz put them in this position. In a bid to force the release of the Ethics report, which is expected to cover several allegations, including that Gaetz had sex with a minor, Democratic Reps.

Nikki Haley has thoughts on RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard	Nikki Haley has a blunt assessment of Donald Trump’s choices of Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for high-profile roles in his administration. Haley, who was Trump’s most significant Republican primary opponent, argued Wednesday on her radio show against confirming Gabbard as director of national intelligence and Kennedy to lead Health and Human Services. Haley first went after Gabbard, a former Democratic member of Congress and 2020 presidential candidate who endorsed Trump this year before announcing she was a Republican.

'The PRO Act would deprive employees of their right to a secret ballot and their privacy in union representation elections,' Kristen Swearingen, president of the Coalition for a Democratic Workplace, said in a statement.

Luna: Johnson blocked proxy voting for new moms	Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) said Wednesday that Speaker Mike Johnson has blocked her proposal to allow new mothers to vote by proxy for several months from being included in the rules package for the next Congress. 'Today, after speaking with @SpeakerJohnson about this for months, I was told, He will not support allowing female members to vote if they give birth,' she wrote in a thread on X. 'Among other things, this is something that I fundamentally disagree with him on.' Johnson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but he has backup from other corners of the Republican conference. 'I don’t give a crap who you are or whether you just had a baby in the last six weeks,' Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said on 'CR...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/house-proxy-voting-blocked-00190692	2024-11-20T11:32:20-08:00	
Steve Bannon ally reuses Vance’s ‘mouth breathing imbeciles’ quip	Grace Chong, chief financial officer and chief operating officer for MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon’s 'War Room,' called Republicans who missed the vote to confirm a judicial nominee Wednesday 'mouth breathing imbeciles!!!' on X — a clapback to JD Vance’s recent pointed remarks at her. Chong was commenting directly on the Senate confirming Rebecca Pennell as District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Washington by a vote of 50-48 on Wednesday. If GOP Sens. Mike Braun and Ted Cruz had been present and voted no, their two votes would have led to a tie that Vice President Kamala Harris would have to break. Chong reused the colorful phrase 'mouth breathing imbeciles' just one day after <a href='https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/19/congress/jd-vance-grace-chong-bannon-00190484' t...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/mouth-breathing-imbeciles-00190688	2024-11-20T11:16:37-08:00	
Trump's plan to let Lutnick oversee trade office needs Congress' buy-in	In announcing his Commerce secretary pick Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump also suggested he wants to dramatically reorder how trade policy is made in Washington. Congress will likely have something to say about that. Trump tapped Howard Lutnick for the role, saying in a statement that his transition co-chair and Wall Street billionaire will 'lead his tariff and trade agenda' and will have 'direct responsibility for the Office of the United States Trade Representative.' But as numerous trade policy experts immediately pointed out, the move could set off a battle with Congress over who controls trade policy in the next Trump administration. 'I think keeping the independence of USTR is very important, but also it is an offshoot of congressional authority,' said Rep. <a href='https://dir...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/trumps-trade-00190687	2024-11-20T11:16:07-08:00	
The Vance-Gaetz message to senators: Get him to a hearing	Senators exiting closed-door meetings with Matt Gaetz on Wednesday had a message: Just get the man to a hearing. Gaetz, Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, and Vice President-elect JD Vance (R-Ohio) met with GOP senators on Wednesday to discuss the congressman’s embattled nomination. Swaths of Senate Republicans have not yet committed to supporting Gaetz, and at least two senators — Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) — have cast serious doubts on Gaetz getting confirmed to the top position at the Justice Department. Gaetz faces a litany of allegations, including that he had sex with a minor and paid for sex, though he has denied any wrongdoing. The House Ethics Committee is currently weighing whether to share a report they have been assembling on those accusations ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/readout-from-vance-gaetz-meetings-00190682	2024-11-20T10:53:40-08:00	
Powerful GOP steering committee comes together	House Republicans named the members of their steering committee Wednesday, locking in a new group that holds power to set most committee assignments and committee chairs, significantly influencing how the conference as a whole operates. The 30 person body includes regional representation and members of leadership — whose votes have more weight than other members. But the rank-and-file members are usually allies of leadership, which helps concentrate the power of committee slots to leadership. Speaker Mike Johnson’s vote counts as four and Majority Leader Steve Scalise’s counts as two, with the rest of leadership and rank and file members weighted equally at one vote. Louisiana, in particular, is going to be a powerful voting bloc for members.

Gaetz recess appointment could be unconstitutional, former DOJ official who wrote torture memos warns	The former Justice Department official who authored the post-9/11 'torture memos' cautioned that President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of former Rep.

'Gaetz would serve the returning president better by withdrawing,' wrote John Yoo, who has served in all three branches of government, in an op-ed published Wednesday and co-written with the legal scholar Robert J.

Rand Paul breaks with Trump on using military for mass deportations: ‘Huge mistake’	GOP Sen. Rand Paul denounced President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to deploy the military to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants upon his return to office, saying it would be a 'huge mistake' and a misuse of military personnel. 'I’m not in favor of sending the Army in uniforms into our cities to collect people,' Paul (R-Ky.) told Newsmax host Rob Schmitt on Tuesday.

In a letter obtained by POLITICO sent to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Democratic members of Judiciary Committee requested the evidentiary file from law enforcement’s probe into whether Gaetz engaged in child sex trafficking.

Johnson announces policy barring transgender women from women's bathrooms on House side of Capitol	Speaker Mike Johnson has banned transgender women from using women’s bathrooms in the House portion of the Capitol building, enacting into policy a push led by Rep. Nancy Mace. 'All single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office Buildings — such as restrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms — are reserved for individuals of that biological sex,' Johnson said in a statement Wednesday.

In a statement, Trump said that 'Matt is a strong warrior and loyal Patriot, who will ensure the United States’ interests are advanced and defended.' Trump added: 'Matt will strengthen relationships with our NATO Allies, and stand firm in the face of threats to Peace and Stability - He will put AMERICA FIRST.' Whitaker’s foreign policy views are largely unknown.

The Democratic leaders stepping up as Trump’s biggest foes	Democrats are deeply divided on how aggressively to resist President-elect Donald Trump and his allies. While some are taking a conciliatory approach to the incoming Republican trifecta, others are vowing to thwart their policies with every legal and legislative tool available. It’s a moment those in the resistance camp — many with grander political ambitions — have been preparing for behind the scenes for many months. Those preparations were aided by Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that outlined a policy wish-list for the next Republican administration, from slashing environmental regulations to issuing a national abortion ban.

Race for the House: Capitol Hill ponders how thin a razor-thin majority can be	More than two weeks after Election Day, there are still five uncalled House races — four of which have a margin of just hundreds of votes. In California, the two uncalled races each have margins of about 300 votes. Why does this matter? If Democrats flip both California seats, Republicans would have just a 220-215 House majority at the start of the new Congress. That’s before factoring in the departures of three GOP congresspeople — Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), Matt Gaetz (Fla.) and Michael Waltz (Fla.) — nominated for roles in the Trump administration that would temporarily trim that margin even further. Republican leadership would need incredibly strict caucus management in this scenario to pass anything.

MAGA world is thrilled with Hegseth pick. Republican senators have questions.	After a weekend of brutal headlines disclosing sexual assault allegations against Pete Hegseth, Senate Republicans are offering a tepid defense of Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon. Republicans have downplayed and deflected when asked about Hegseth — arguing Trump picked an outsider to shake up the Pentagon bureaucracy or that the confirmation process should play out. 'Let me say this: I have asked to read the allegations and I honestly have not had time to look at it, so I just can’t comment,' Senate Armed Services ranking Republican Roger Wicker said on Monday. 'I am looking to be very supportive of his nomination.' By Tuesday, Wicker, who will preside over Hegseth’s confirmation process when Republicans take control of the Senate in January, wasn’t taking reporters’ questions.

O’Brien is privately raising Chavez-DeRemer’s name as a top pick for the role. GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have also advocated for Chavez-DeRemer for the job directly with President-elect Donald Trump and his team, according to another person familiar with the matter.

Just one GOP vote on the Ethics Committee could release the Gaetz report	The House Ethics Committee is scheduled to meet Wednesday. And if members vote on whether to share their investigative findings about attorney general nominee Matt Gaetz, it would only take one Republican to trigger the release of the report. The panel is evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, and it only requires a majority vote in the private meeting to release the report. A tie would defer to the party that controls the House — meaning if all Republicans voted against releasing it, the report would not be published. But it would only take one, combined with all Democrats, to share the report, either with senators or publicly. Republicans on the committee have largely declined to comment on the upcoming meeting at all, let alone whether they would vote to release the report.

U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich on Tuesday denied a bid by defendant Michael Picciuto to postpone his Jan. 13 trial into April, who cited the prospect of a pardon from Trump and the potential awkwardness of being on trial at the moment the transfer of power occurs as a reason to delay.

Republicans slow down Senate floor to delay Biden judicial picks	Senate Republicans moved to slow down the pace of judicial nomination confirmations in the waning days of Joe Biden’s presidency on Monday evening, forcing the chamber into hours of routine votes. What happened? Senators initially confirmed Embry Kidd to an appeals court post by a 49-45 vote on Monday evening. But then the roadblocks began. Moving between executive session — to consider nominations — and legislative session — to consider bills — is normally done by unanimous consent, but Republicans forced votes on those procedural actions throughout the evening. Those votes only required a simple majority, so Democrats were able to easily pass them. But they had to stay close to the chamber. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was unbowed by the procedural obstacles. 'We'll keep going,' ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/19/congress/senate-slowdown-00190335	2024-11-19T05:42:15-08:00	
Negative signs for Gaetz as senators brush off questions amid Trump pressure	A negative sign looms for Matt Gaetz: Nearly a dozen GOP senators won’t commit to confirming him for attorney general, saying they want to let the process play out. And many, even if they aren’t insisting on seeing the potentially damaging House Ethics report on the recently resigned lawmaker, assume the information will have to come out. 'He’s got an uphill climb,' said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a senior member of the conference who said she looked forward to meeting with Gaetz and the Judiciary Committee's review of the nomination. Promising to follow the vetting process doesn’t mean senators will necessarily oppose a nominee, but it’s notable given GOP senators are clearly wary of crossing President-elect Donald Trump. And it contrasts heavily with more Trump-aligned senators, many of w...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/18/congress/gop-senators-on-gaetz-ethics-report-00190295	2024-11-18T16:39:02-08:00	
McBride responds to effort to ban transgender women from Capitol women’s bathrooms	Rep.-elect Sarah McBride said a resolution from Rep. Nancy Mace to ban transgender women from women’s bathrooms in the Capitol was a distraction in a Monday statement. 'This is a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing,' McBride, a Delaware Democrat who is set to become the first openly transgender member of Congress, said. 'We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.

Congress is running out of time to pass a December funding deal	Facing a government shutdown deadline in just over a month, Congress is quickly running out of time to do anything but punt funding levels into next year — unless bipartisan talks begin in earnest. Congressional leaders have yet to announce the start of negotiations over a more comprehensive funding deal, raising the odds that lawmakers will resort to a stopgap in late December that kicks the next funding cliff into President-elect Donald Trump’s first months in office. Even if Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer started talking now, it could already be too late to pass final funding measures by the Dec. 20 deadline. That’s because it usually takes Congress about a month to clear bills with updated spending levels once leaders have reached a deal on overall totals...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/18/congress/congress-running-out-of-time-on-funding-00190271	2024-11-18T16:20:48-08:00	
Trump to join Musk at SpaceX launch in Texas	Donald Trump plans to accompany billionaire Elon Musk to a SpaceX launch in Texas on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the president-elect's plans. Musk, who emerged as a top donor and Trump surrogate during the 2024 election, has been an influential person in Trump's orbit since the election. The world's richest person has sat in on Trump's calls with world leaders, and has chimed in on his Cabinet picks. Recently, he publicly advocated for Howard Lutnick to be Treasury secretary and used his social media platform to back Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) for Senate majority leader (Scott flamed out). Musk flew with Trump to Washington last week and also joined him over the weekend for the Ultimate Fighting Championship match at Madison Square Garden.

How the Gaetz Ethics report could still come out if the panel blocks it	House Ethics Committee members are set to meet privately Wednesday as debate rages over whether the panel should release its report on its investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz. But even if they elect not to release it, that might not be the end of the road. The committee doesn’t disclose its agenda. But Ethics members are under intense scrutiny as they figure out how to address the report, which lawmakers in both chambers have said they would like to review, particularly given Gaetz’s attorney general nomination. The committee could vote to adopt or release a report during its closed-door meeting. If the vote is along party lines — the same number of Democrats and Republicans sit on the committee — a tie means the motion fails and defers to the majority, which is Republican.

Top Democrat on Ethics panel says she wants to publish Gaetz report	Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the House Ethics Committee, said Monday she wants her panel’s report on former Rep. Matt Gaetz to be released to the public. 'It should certainly be released to the Senate, and I think it should be released to the public, as we have done with many other investigative reports in the past,' she told a small group of reporters. Both Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are pushing for access to the report after President-elect Donald Trump tapped Gaetz to be his attorney general last week. Gaetz resigned from the House hours after the announcement — amid rumors that the Ethics report could be released in the coming days — complicating the decision to publish the findings of the investigation.

House Ethics chair: Panel’s decision on Gaetz report won’t be influenced by Johnson	House Ethics Chair Michael Guest said Monday that his panel will make its own decision about releasing the report into Matt Gaetz, regardless of Speaker Mike Johnson’s opinion that it should be kept under wraps. Guest (R-Miss.) told POLITICO in a brief interview that he and Johnson had spoken over the weekend. He added that all Ethics Committee members can now review the report, when only he and Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the panel, previously had a copy of it, according to two people familiar with the matter. 'We did talk this weekend,' Guest said, noting Johnson shared the same views he has publicly — that the panel should not release the report.

Health care organization launches ‘Stop RFK War Room’	Democratic-aligned health care advocacy groups are putting together a strategy to fight Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination to be HHS secretary. During an organizing call on Monday, the details of which have not been reported publicly, more than 200 people from several dozen of those groups, along with other advocacy organizations, discussed strategies to oppose Kennedy’s nomination. That included which Republican senators to target and the most effective way to talk to them, according to Brad Woodhouse, executive director of Protect Our Care. 'We’re nowhere near conceding he’s going to be the next HHS secretary,' he said.

Potential Trump picks for DOT: A reality TV star, a rail antagonist — and a former Uber exec	President-elect Donald Trump's transition effort is continuing to churn through potential picks for the next head of the Transportation Department, with the current crop of names including a former reality TV star, a former executive at Uber and a former Republican lawmaker from California who regularly lambasted his state's high-speed rail ambitions. According to three people familiar with discussions happening among Trump and his inner circle, including his transition team, the latest names to bubble up to succeed Pete Buttigieg atop DOT include former House lawmaker and Fox News contributor (and star of MTV's The Real World) Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) and Emil Michael, a former executive at Uber.

White House asks Congress for $100B in aid for hurricanes, other disasters	The Biden administration on Monday sent Congress a roughly $100 billion emergency funding request to rebuild communities hit by hurricanes Helene and Milton, along with a slew of other disasters nationwide. Top lawmakers plan to spend the next few weeks finalizing a bipartisan bill that fulfills at least some of that request, with a goal of final passage sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Since Congress also faces a government shutdown deadline on Dec. 20, it’s possible disaster aid gets tied into a spending patch or broader funding package. Besides $40 billion to refill FEMA’s disaster relief fund, the White House is seeking emergency funding for more than a dozen other federal agen...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/18/white-house-asks-congress-for-100b-in-aid-for-hurricanes-other-disasters-00190167	2024-11-18T09:30:48-08:00	https://static.politico.com/a8/0e/6e59a82f42a788b1e7d0b0069b69/hurricane-helene-fema-threats-48350.jpg
Ron DeSantis’ ‘Apprentice’: Governor announces how he’ll pick Marco Rubio’s replacement	MIAMI — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis intends to hold interviews and 'extensive vetting' to help him decide who should replace Marco Rubio in the Senate. The seat will soon open up after President-elect Donald Trump announced he planned to nominate Rubio to be secretary of state, which will necessitate Rubio resigning from his role. DeSantis under Florida law will be tasked with appointing Rubio’s successor, and he said in a post on X Monday morning that he would likely finish the selection process 'by the beginning of January.'

Trump’s immigration crackdown is expected to start on Day 1	In his first 100 days, President-elect Donald Trump plans to begin the process of deporting hundreds of thousands of people. He is expected to end parole for people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. And he is likely to undo a policy that significantly constrained deportations for people who weren't deemed threats to public safety or national security. Trump’s team is already thinking about how to craft executive actions aimed to withstand the legal challenges from immigrants’ rights groups — all in hopes of avoiding an early defeat like the one his 2017 travel ban targeting majority-Muslim nations suffered.

And though Republicans will have an edge, it will only take a few defectors to sink his nomination if Democrats, as expected, oppose him in unison. Republicans have rushed to applaud some of Trump’s more conventional other Cabinet picks, but the lack of public enthusiasm for RFK among some on the committee suggests some may be skeptical. Here’s where committee Republicans stand on Kennedy, so far: Mike Crapo, Idaho: The top Republican on the committee said in a statement that Kennedy has 'prioritized addressing chronic diseases through consumer choice and healthy lifestyle.

Johnson: Ethics shouldn't release Gaetz report	Speaker Mike Johnson said he does not think the House Ethics report into Matt Gaetz should be released, as the former representative faces a Senate confirmation for attorney general. 'I'm going to strongly request that the Ethics Committee not issue the report, because that is not the way we do things in the House,' Johnson said. 'And I think that would be a terrible precedent to set.' Johnson said he plans to talk to House Ethics Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.), but does not know when yet, adding that he got back from Mar-a-Lago at about 3 a.m. 'The rules of the House have always been that a former member is beyond the ju...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/15/congress/johnson-ethics-shouldnt-release-gaetz-report-00189827	2024-11-15T08:39:53-08:00	
Pence urges Senate to reject RFK Jr. for HHS over abortion stance	Mike Pence is urging Senate Republicans to not confirm Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as Health and Human Services secretary, calling his nomination by President-elect Donald Trump 'deeply concerning.' 'I believe the nomination of RFK Jr. to serve as Secretary of HHS is an abrupt departure from the pro-life record of our administration and should be deeply concerning to millions of Pro-Life Americans who have supported the Republican Party and our nominees for decades,' Pence said in a statement Friday on behalf of his conservative nonprofit Advancing American Freedom.

House Ethics chair says meeting on Gaetz report has been postponed, not canceled	Chair of the House Ethics Committee Michael Guest said Friday morning the group has only postponed, not canceled, a meeting to discuss the panel's report about Matt Gaetz. Guest (R-Miss.) declined to say whether the panel is open to sharing it with the Senate Judiciary Committee, as some senators say they want to see the report as they vet him as Donald Trump's attorney general nominee. Guest noted Ethics members need to meet first. 'We've not met as a committee, and so at this point, there's nothing that I'm sure I can't comment about,' he said, noting the meeting will be rescheduled. Guest also dismissed suggestions that he was worried about potential retribution from Trump world if the committee released the report.

Thune faces first loyalty test: What to do with Trump’s most controversial Cabinet picks	A series of controversial Cabinet picks have become an early test for how Senate leader-in-waiting John Thune will balance proving his loyalty to Donald Trump with the interests of his wide-ranging conference. So far, he seems to be giving the president-elect wide deference. Trump hasn’t finished his selections yet, but three picks for some of the most influential roles in the Cabinet are already prompting anxiety among GOP senators who must decide whether to confirm them: Matt Gaetz for attorney general, Pete Hegseth for secretary of Defense and Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence. And POLITICO first reported another pick Thursday afternoon: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services secretary.

Nuts on a lot of fronts': New York Post condemns Kennedy pick to lead HHS	The New York Post editorial board slammed President-elect Donald Trump’s choice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, calling the secretary-designate 'nuts on a lot of fronts.' The Post, owned by Rupert Murdoch, is reliably conservative and endorsed Trump for president this year. But Trump’s selection of the anti-vaccine activist Kennedy to lead HHS, the tabloid’s editorial board argued, would violate the first rule of medicine, 'do no harm.' Recalling a 2023 meeting with Kennedy, the Post’s editorial board called his views 'a head-scratching spaghetti of what we can only call warped conspiracy theories, and not just on vaccines.' Kennedy is well known for touting debunked claims that vaccines cause autism and questioning other issues widely seen as ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/15/congress/robert-f-kennedy-jr-new-york-post-00189800	2024-11-15T06:54:52-08:00	
Hill Republicans rejoice over Burgum pick for Interior	President-elect Donald Trump has tapped North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum for Interior secretary, he announced at a gala at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida Thursday night. 'I won't tell you his name, might be something like Burgum, Burgum, ... he's gonna be announced tomorrow for a very big position,' Trump said Thursday evening. 'he's going to head the Department of Interior, and he's gonna be fantastic. Good Doug.' A two-term governor of a Western oil-rich state with five tribal nations, Burgum is already receiving a warm reception from Republicans on Capitol Hill, who for four years have slammed President Joe Biden's energy policies. Democrats will be unhappy with his promises to ramp up fossil fuel production but could be less critical of him because of his experience.

House ethics panel cancels meeting amid pressure to release Gaetz report	The House Ethics Committee won’t be meeting after all on Friday as pressure builds to release the findings of its report on Rep. Matt Gaetz. Anticipation was high for the closed-door meeting after Donald Trump announced he was picking the Florida member of Congress to be attorney general. But the meeting was abruptly canceled Thursday, according to a person familiar with the schedule granted anonymity to discuss non-public information. It is unclear why the committee canceled a meeting that was scheduled before Gaetz resigned from Congress this week, three people familiar told POLITICO earlier.

The solicitor general represents the federal government at the high court. 'John is a deeply accomplished, masterful appellate attorney,' Trump said in a statement Thursday.

Matt Gaetz has bashed Senate Republicans for years. To be Trump's AG, he'll need their votes.	Before he can become Donald Trump’s attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) will need to face off with some potentially less-than-friendly faces to receive confirmation: Republican senators he’s previously antagonized. With a 53-seat majority, the Senate GOP can only lose up to three votes and still clear a nominee if Democrats unanimously oppose them. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), for one, said Wednesday that Gaetz has 'his work cut out for him to get a good, strong vote,' adding that 'it’ll make for a popcorn-eating confirmation hearing.'

Trump picks his New York hush money defense lawyers for top spots at DOJ	President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday tapped the lawyers who represented him in the New York hush money criminal trial for the No. 2 and No. 3 spots at the Department of Justice. Todd Blanche, a former federal prosecutor who defended Trump in his Manhattan criminal trial, which ended in Trump’s conviction on 34 counts, and his two federal criminal cases, will be deputy attorney general, the second-highest ranking post at DOJ and the person who runs its day-to-day operations, if confirmed. Emil Bove, who also represented the president-elect in the hush money trial and his two federal criminal cases, will serve as principal associate deputy attorney general.

Ethics panel to meet as pressure builds for Gaetz report release	Members of a secretive panel overseeing a long-running investigation into Matt Gaetz are set to privately meet on Friday, according to three people familiar with the matter. The House Ethics Committee meeting was scheduled before Gaetz (R-Fla.) resigned from Congress this week, the people said. The committee doesn’t disclose its agenda — but the highly anticipated closed-door powwow would let them discuss what to do with the probe now that Gaetz is technically outside of their jurisdiction. Speaker Mike Johnson announced that Gaetz had resigned Wednesday night, hours after President-elect Trump nominated the Florida firebrand to become attorney general. Johnson attributed the resignation to Gaetz wanting to allow his seat to be filled quickly, but House Republicans have speculated that he ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/14/congress/gop-lawmakers-want-to-see-gaetz-report-00189745	2024-11-14T15:36:55-08:00	
Trump selects Jay Clayton, a business-friendly former regulator, as top federal prosecutor in Manhattan	President-elect Donald Trump has picked Jay Clayton, a longtime corporate lawyer and former Wall Street regulator, to be the U.S. attorney overseeing Manhattan. Clayton served as the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump’s first term but has no experience as a criminal prosecutor. If confirmed by the Senate, Clayton would head the nation’s most prestigious federal prosecutor’s office: the Southern District of New York, which has jurisdiction over the largest financial institutions and brings many high-profile white-collar and public-corruption cases. During his first term, Trump attempted to install Clayton as the U.S. attorney for SDNY in an effort to oust Geoffrey Berman, who held the post from 2018 to 2020.

Trump has already selected Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida to serve as his national security adviser.

House GOP lawmakers hang on to critical rules deal	House Republicans have salvaged an agreement on their internal rules, according to six people familiar with the discussions, after it appeared to be on shaky ground for hours earlier on Thursday. If the agreement — struck by opposing factions within the GOP’s narrow majority Wednesday afternoon — had unraveled, it would have been a significant blow to Speaker Mike Johnson, who blessed the deal. The agreement had been a truce of sorts on conservatives’ and leadership allies’ most contentious battle lines, like hard-liner moves to block party-favored legislation on the House floor. Under the deal, which was first reported by POLITICO on Wednesday, centrists agreed to drop their proposed rule changes that would have established punishments for members who defied leaders and the will of the co...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/14/congress/house-gop-hanging-on-to-rules-deal-00189601	2024-11-14T09:25:50-08:00	
RFK Jr. has big asks of Washington. Republican lawmakers say they’re open.	MAGA won big. Now MAHA is ready to take on Washington. President-elect Donald Trump promised Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a chance to implement his Make America Healthy Again vision and Kennedy is in the mix to run the Department of Health and Human Services. That could turn the government’s role in public health upside down. Kennedy blames Americans’ poor health in part on a corrupt alliance among the food and drug industries and the regulators supposed to watch over them. He wants to replace the bureaucrats and overhaul the systems for overseeing pesticides, food additives and vaccines. That could mean rules and product bans that threaten the profits of the food and pharma sectors GOP lawmakers have long deferred to — and who employ many of their constituents.

House Republicans tapped their leadership team for the next Congress on Wednesday and formally notched their majority when the Associated Press called Rep. Juan Ciscomani’s (R-Ariz.) reelection.

Johnson clinches GOP speaker nomination — but the real test looms in January	Mike Johnson clinched the internal GOP nod to serve as speaker again. But he’s not in the clear yet — the true test is a formal vote on the House floor in January, where he’ll have almost no room for error. House Republicans voted unanimously Wednesday to make Johnson their speaker nominee, according to three people in the room. The Louisiana Republican has been shoring up support for months, crisscrossing the country to campaign for his colleagues, and the party is expected to hold onto House control by a slim margin.

Reckless pick': Lawmakers express doubts that Gaetz can get confirmed as attorney general	GOP lawmakers expressed disbelief at President-elect Donald Trump’s decision to tap Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) to be his attorney general, indicating the conservative firebrand could have a tough road to confirmation. Senate Republicans largely refrained from wading into whether Gaetz — who the Department of Justice investigated for years over allegations that he engaged in sex with underage girls and paid for their transportation — could be confirmed. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) rolled his eyes and Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) declined to comment.

California Republican Ken Calvert holds off Dem challenge in Palm Springs area	Republican Rep. Ken Calvert has withstood the toughest reelection fight of his 32-year career on Capitol Hill, eking out a victory in his Southern California House district despite being massively outspent by Democrats. Calvert defeated Democrat Will Rollins, a former federal prosecutor, according to a projection by The Associated Press. The contest was a rematch after Calvert narrowly defeated Rollins in 2022 in one of the most closely-watched swing contests this cycle. Former President Donald Trump even traveled to the region to hold a rally with Calvert in the final weeks of the race. Republicans have a slight registration advantage in the district, which spans a large area east of Los Angeles...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/13/california-republican-ken-calvert-holds-off-dem-challenge-in-palm-springs-area-00187094	2024-11-13T12:47:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/ca/f5/fd158f7340bda0c2376587c7ef21/ap24291706469516.jpg
Trump officially nominates Marco Rubio for secretary of State	President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday officially announced he will nominate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to be secretary of State, ending a nearly-two day delay between initial reports and the official announcement. In a statement, Trump said that Rubio is a 'Highly Respected Leader, and a very powerful Voice for Freedom.' Trump also called Rubio a 'strong Advocate for our nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our allies.' Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the top Republican on the selective Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

Biden faces pressure from Hill Democrats to grant clemency for drug crimes	Hill Democrats are pressuring President Joe Biden to shorten the sentences of thousands of federal prisoners incarcerated for drug crimes before he leaves office. Seven members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) sent a letter to Biden dated Oct. 21 urging him to commute prison sentences that would have been shorter under the 2018 First Step Act. That legislation, passed during President-elect Donald Trump’s first term, reduced mandatory minimum sentences for some drug offenses. But the sentencing reductions did not apply to people already convicted for those crimes. The group of Democrats, led by Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, is urging Biden to categoricall...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/13/congress/joe-biden-clemency-00189312	2024-11-13T11:00:00-08:00	
Rubio report casts spotlight on Trump transition leaks	News of Marco Rubio’s selection as Donald Trump’s secretary of State Monday night prompted a flurry of reports about Trump’s forthcoming announcement of one of his most important cabinet positions. Except Tuesday rolled around, and now Wednesday, and Trump has yet to officially name Rubio as his pick. As of midday Wednesday, more than 41 hours have passed since the New York Times reported Trump would tap Rubio, a report POLITICO and other major outlets quickly confirmed. The Rubio news was the most notable in a series of leaks in recent days about Trump’s still-forming cabinet — a stark contrast to the nearly two-year presidential campaign his team ran that was relatively leak-free. According to a count by POLITICO, half the Cabinet and senior staff decisions so far were shared with the pr...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/13/congress/rubio-leaks-trump-transition-00189332	2024-11-13T10:54:28-08:00

Cotton defeats Ernst for No. 3 spot in Senate GOP leadership	Senate Republicans have tapped Sen. Tom Cotton, an unwavering conservative, to be their Republican Conference chair, elevating a lawmaker known for his hawkish foreign policy positions and efforts to restrict immigration into a top-tier leadership role. Cotton (R-Ark.), who is serving his second term after being elected in 2014, bested Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa.) for the No. 3 spot in the Senate GOP hierarchy. The vote was 35-18, according to two people familiar with the vote.

Thune wins contested race for Senate GOP leader	John Thune will lead the Senate Republican conference next term, winning a three-way election to succeed Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in a closed-door vote on Wednesday. The South Dakotan will take over in January at the turn of the new Congress, when Republicans are expected to control the government trifecta: the House, Senate and the presidency. And he’ll have some room to maneuver in his own chamber, with Republicans’ 53-seat majority, as the party considers wide-ranging legislation that would tackle tax cuts, immigration and energy policy. At 63, Thune, current GOP whip, is considered relatively young for leadership. Thune has not committed to imposing a term limit on the role of conference leader, meaning he’s well-positioned to hold the job for years to come.

Trump thanks Biden for smooth transition	President-elect Donald Trump thanked President Joe Biden for overseeing a smooth transition of power during an Oval Office meeting on Wednesday that marked the rivals’ first face-to-face meeting since the election. 'I appreciate very much a transition that’s so smooth,' Trump said as the two men sat stiffly in oversized chairs, a fire roaring in the background. 'It’ll be as smooth as it can get and I very much appreciate that, Joe.' 'You’re welcome,' a smiling Biden said. The meeting, normally a formality between presidents, represented a striking contrast from four years ago, when Biden was poised to take the White House after unseating Trump. At that time, Trump refused to extend the courtesy of the invitation and instead spent the following weeks trying to overturn the results of the el...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/13/congress/biden-trump-meet-00189290	2024-11-13T08:44:51-08:00

House Democratic leaders announced a series of three listening sessions over the coming weeks with lawmakers, according to a notice sent to lawmakers obtained by POLITICO.

Trump endorses Johnson hours ahead of GOP speaker vote	President-elect Donald Trump appeared to back Mike Johnson's speakership bid during his visit with the House GOP Wednesday morning, hours ahead of an internal party leadership vote, according to five people in the room. 'He said, ‘I am with him all the way,’' according to two people. Trump is meeting with House Republicans hours before an internal leadership election where they are expected to elect Johnson as their speaker nominee. That election will be conducted via secret ballot and only requires a simple majority.

Biden is about to have the meeting he’s been dreading with Trump	Nearly four years after he walked out of the White House in the aftermath of a violent insurrection, President-elect Donald Trump will re-enter the building on Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden in the Oval Office. By inviting Trump, Biden is extending to his predecessor and successor a formal courtesy that Trump didn’t give him four years ago. In many ways, he is hosting a rival who he’d argued was a threat to American democracy to make the point that democracy itself hinges on elections where the losers accept the results.

In the remaining uncalled contests, Republicans currently lead in six, while Democrats have the advantage in six. Iowa’s 1st: Rep.

House GOP rule proposals spotlight battle between conservatives and leadership allies	House Republicans are primed for a nasty fight over their internal rules this week. A review of the 20 amendments submitted to the current rules, first reported by POLITICO, indicate an ongoing clash between conservatives, who are looking to strip more power from leadership, and other members who want to see disruptive GOP lawmakers punished. The amendments do not include proposed changes to the rules governing how to oust a speaker, known as a motion to vacate, though that doesn’t mean that fight is over. Currently, one member can trigger a vote to boot a speaker, and leadership and many House Republicans want to raise that threshold.

Valadao was a top target for Democrats, who were hoping an uptick in voter turnout this year could finally clinch the district they’ve been eyeing for several cycles. He has represented the area for nearly a decade — save for the 2018 race, where he was defeated by former Rep. TJ Cox. After winning back that seat in 2020, Valadao went on to be one of only 10 Republicans to vote to impeach former President Donald Trump following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Frey, Herbster in mix for Agriculture secretary	Sarah Frey, founder of Frey Farms, and longtime Trump ally Charles Herbster are among the list of names President-elect Donald Trump is considering tapping as his Agriculture secretary, according to four people familiar with the transition. Both are GOP donors and outsiders to the federal government. Trump has yet to wade into final decisions about who will lead his USDA. But he faces a major question over how much influence he’ll allow Robert Kennedy Jr. to have at the Agriculture Department, given Kennedy’s antipathy to broad swathes of agribusiness. Politically powerful, conservative-leaning agriculture groups are eager for Trump to slash regulations. But some of Kennedy’s biggest goals to ban or limit certain farming practices and unhealthy foods would require Trump to implement an ent...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/12/congress/more-names-floated-for-usda-00189060	2024-11-12T10:48:49-08:00	
Breaking down Donald Trump's deportation agenda	Carlos Trujillo may not be a household name, but he was instrumental in helping President-elect Donald Trump hone his message and win a historic number of Latino voters last week. Trujillo, who’s been a senior adviser to Trump since his 2016 presidential run and served in his first administration, believes the Republican's decisive victory ushered in a mandate to implement far-reaching immigration reforms, including mass deportations. The son of immigrants who defected from Fidel Castro’s communist Cuba, Trujillo applauds Trump’s recent decision to name immigration hard-liners Stephen Miller and Tom Homan as deputy chief of staff for policy and border czar, respectively. And he believes they'll bring back two of Trump’s previous migration-deterrent policies: the so-called <a href='https://...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/12/congress/carlos-trujillo-trump-immigration-deportations-agenda-00189037	2024-11-12T09:33:01-08:00	
How will Congress handle government funding? Johnson says it depends on Trump's 'preference'	How Congress will eventually choose to handle the December government shutdown deadline is largely up to President-elect Donald Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday. The speaker said he 'can make a case for a number of different options that are on the table' for keeping cash flowing to federal agencies beyond the Dec. 20 deadline. The two obvious choices: Punting the deadline into Trump’s second term, or striking a full bipartisan agreement that lasts through next September, when the current fiscal year ends. 'Again, this is a consensus-building exercise, as always,' Johnson told reporters Tuesday morning. 'The president's preference on that will carry a lot of weight obviously.'

Paulson withdraws from Treasury secretary contention	John Paulson, the billionaire financier, said Tuesday he was withdrawing his name from contention to be President-elect Donald Trump’s next Treasury secretary. 'Although various media outlets have mentioned me as a candidate for Secretary of the Treasury, my complex financial obligations would prevent me from holding an official position in President Trump’s administration at this time,' Paulson said in a statement. The veteran investor and close Trump ally said he planned to 'remain actively involved with the President’s economic team and helping in the implementation of President Trump’s outstanding policy proposals.' The statement was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.

Johnson: Trump not expected to pick more admin members from House GOP	House GOP leadership is urging President-elect Donald Trump to refrain from tapping any more Republican members for his administration — at least for now. Republicans have not officially clinched the House majority yet, though they’re expected to do so with a narrow margin, likely just a handful of seats more than Democrats. Meanwhile, Trump has already named two House Republicans, Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.), to positions within the administration. Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters on Tuesday that he and Trump have discussed the math crunch he faces in the Capitol. 'President Trump and I have talked about this multiple times a day for the last several days. … I don’t expect that we will have more members leaving,' Johnson said, adding that Trump...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/12/congress/trump-not-expected-to-tap-more-house-members-00189003	2024-11-12T08:18:59-08:00	
How the GOP took back the Senate — even while continuing to struggle in swing states	Republicans celebrated as they took a decisive Senate majority last week: They’d finally figured out how to get past the candidate quality issues that had tanked them for two cycles. But they still have a purple-state problem. Even as President-elect Donald Trump swept every swing state, four of those battlegrounds are sending Democrats to the Senate. That’s the highest number of Senate-presidential ticket splits in 12 years, and a warning sign for Republicans as they try to protect and grow their ranks in 2026. That 53-seat majority will be a boon to the GOP agenda next year. But three of Republicans' wins were in solidly red seats in West Virginia, Ohio and Montana. They flipped a true swing state in Pennsylvania but suffered losses in Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona.

State of Congress: House looks to California (and Trump)	The breakdown of the Senate is all but set. And a handful of races in California — and President-elect Donald Trump’s personnel decisions — seem likely to determine how much wiggle room Republicans will have in their probable House majority. Arizona Senate: Almost a week after the election, the Associated Press called the open Senate race for Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego over GOP nominee Kari Lake. His lead at the time of the call stands at about 72,000 votes. It’s a crucial win for Democrats, who will now have a minority conference of 47 seats in the Senate. Pennsylvania Senate: Incumbent Sen.

Democrat George Whitesides ousts GOP Rep. Mike Garcia from Los Angeles House seat	George Whitesides has defeated three-term GOP Rep. Mike Garcia, flipping a long-coveted Los Angeles area House seat to the Democrats’ column. Garcia — who conceded the race Monday — was a top target for multiple cycles, given the Democrats’ 10-point registration advantage in the district and his conservative votes in the House. But he had proven surprisingly durable in the blue-leaning seat, leaning on his fighter-jet pilot past to appeal to voters in a district dominated by aerospace.

DOJ says Jack Smith’s delay in Trump case is no reason to do the same for Jan. 6 defendants	Special counsel Jack Smith’s decision to pause his prosecution of President-elect Donald Trump is no reason to do the same for members of the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the Justice Department argued Monday. Several Jan. 6 defendants have used Smith’s call for a three-week breather — quickly endorsed by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan — as proof that all criminal cases connected to the Jan. 6 attack deserve a similar slowdown.

The Mississippi Republican is poised to chair the Armed Services Committee after the GOP romped in Tuesday’s Senate elections. And he brings to the role a plan for tens of billions of dollars in new military spending to expand the Navy and Air Force, modernize the nuclear arsenal and ramp up defense manufacturing.

Dearborn’s Arab Americans feel vindicated by Harris’ loss	DEARBORN, Michigan — Arab American leaders for months warned Vice President Kamala Harris that she needed to separate herself from President Joe Biden’s support of Israel in the war in Gaza — or face an electoral backlash from this influential community in a key battleground. But those pleas went largely ignored. Instead, Harris made strategic errors that deeply insulted Arab American voters reeling from intense grief as the death toll in the Middle East climbed. She refused to host a Palestinian American onstage at the Democratic National Convention. She curtly shut down protesters at campaign rallies who criticized her solidarity with Biden over the conflict. She dispatched pro-Israel surrogates to Michigan.

Talk of Lighthizer return to USTR ‘complete bulls--t,’ says one insider	Not even a week has passed from the election and confusion is already swirling about who will run President-elect Donald Trump’s trade policy as head of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. On Friday, the Financial Times reported that Trump had asked former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to return to lead the agency, which is a Cabinet-level position in the Executive office of the President and is responsible for much White House's trade policy. But one source familiar with the issue, who was granted anonymity to discuss internal personnel discussions, says that’s 'totally untrue' and that no conversation like that has occurred. For months, Lighthizer has had...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/08/congress/lighthizers-landing-00188523	2024-11-08T12:07:08-08:00	
Trump's DOT transition team includes officials from his first term	President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign has tapped two former Transportation Department officials to help the agency’s transition efforts as he prepares for his second term, POLITICO has learned. That includes Skip Elliott, who worked under Trump’s DOT as administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and also as acting DOT inspector general, two former Trump administration officials and a transportation industry official with knowledge of the transition told POLITICO. They were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media. Elliott also served as vice president for public safety, health and environment at freight rail giant CSX and before that at Conrail as the director of hazardous materials systems. 'Skip is an honorable and real...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/08/congress/trumps-dot-transition-relies-on-old-hands-00188519	2024-11-08T11:55:35-08:00	
Trump transition staff poised to access national security secrets, Justice Department says	The Justice Department issued its first official comment on the presidential transition Friday, indicating that officials there are prepared to help incoming advisers to President-elect Donald Trump get access to classified information. 'The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring an orderly and effective transition to the new Administration,' the statement said. 'We are prepared to deliver briefings to the transition team on our operations and responsibilities, and we stand ready to process requests for security clearances for those who will need access to national security information.' The provision of security clearances to transition team members is overseen by the Office of Director of National Intelligence, but also involves the Justice Department and FBI, according to a repo...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/08/congress/trump-transition-national-security-clearances-00188481	2024-11-08T10:37:28-08:00	
Trump: 'NO INTENTION OF SELLING' $3.5B stake in Trump Media	President-elect Donald Trump is doubling down on his plans to hold on to his roughly $3.5 billion stake in the parent company of Truth Social, just days after winning back the White House. In a social media post, Trump, who is the company's majority shareholder, said Friday he has 'NO INTENTION OF SELLING' his nearly 115 million shares. He added that there have been 'fake, untrue, and probably illegal rumors and/or statements made by, perhaps, market manipulators or short sellers, that I am interested in selling shares of Truth,' which he rejected. 'THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE,' Trump said on Truth Social. 'I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statement...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/08/congress/trump-not-dumping-truth-social-shares-00188456	2024-11-08T09:48:42-08:00	
Get your Susie Wiles fix here	The hottest ticket in town is about to be Susie Wiles' cell phone number. There are many reasons why Trump chose Wiles, who will be the first woman to hold the job, as his chief of staff. She largely eschews the spotlight — except for when she’s hitting back at Mark Cuban for saying Trump doesn’t have 'strong, intelligent women' around him. It’s a trait that has made her an effective operator and helped keep her in Trump’s good graces. (When Trump called her onstage to speak at his victory party, she politely declined. 'Susie likes to stay in the background. She’s not in the background,' he said.) She is one of the few top officials to survive an entire Trump campaign and was part of the team that put together a far more professional operation for his third White House bid — even if the fo...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/08/congress/susie-wiles-donald-trump-chief-of-staff-00188425	2024-11-08T07:08:36-08:00	
State of play: The battle for Congress	There are two uncalled Senate races — both leaning toward Democrats — and about two dozen uncalled House races three days after Election Day. With the seats remaining, Republicans have the clear inside track for retaining control of the House. Nevada Senate: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen padded her lead as more ballots were counted in the Silver State, now leading GOP nominee Sam Brown by around 17,000 votes — or a little more than 1 percentage point. Interestingly, the 'none of these candidates' option — a rather unique option in Nevada — is pulling in around 3 percent of the vote, a potentially decisive figure in this razor-thin contest. Late-counted ballots have consistently favored Rosen. Advantage Rosen. Arizona Senate: Republican nominee Kari Lake c...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/08/congress/hill-state-of-play-00188428	2024-11-08T07:06:31-08:00

Calling all nat sec wonks: These are the transition positions you should be paying attention to	President-elect Donald Trump’s national security transition team is already taking shape, giving early insights into who could staff his national security and defense team once he takes office in January. The speculation around Cabinet secretary posts is hogging a lot of attention, but lower-level appointees in the National Security Council, State Department and Pentagon could have outsized influence over the direction of Trump’s foreign policy. And transition officials often end up joining the administration in influential posts. Here’s who’s in the room or in the mix: The State Department Brian Hook, former State Department policy planner and special envoy for Iran, has been tapped to lead the State Department transition team. The Pentagon Robert Wilkie, former ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/07/congress/national-security-transition-donald-trump-00188379	2024-11-07T16:42:55-08:00	
Trump advisers, Congress discuss tariff legislation	Advisers close to President-elect Donald Trump have been in discussions with House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) on a broad tax package that is partially paid for by tariffs approved by Congress, according to two people familiar with the conversations who were granted anonymity to describe the internal discussions. As part of those conversations, staffers and advisers close to the Trump team have also investigated whether House rules need to be changed to use tariffs as offsets for tax cuts, those people say. A Ways and Means Committee spokesperson declined to comment. The discussions come as Republicans are gearing up to pass a massive tax bill, which would include $4.6 trillion of expiring Trump tax cuts and potentially several other tax proposals floated by Trump on the campa...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/07/congress/congress-considers-tariffs-00188362	2024-11-07T15:42:36-08:00
