Trump to sit down with Kristen Welker on ‘Meet the Press’	President-elect Donald Trump has lined up his first network interview since winning the election. Trump will sit down with NBC’s Kristen Welker for an interview on 'Meet the Press' set to air at 10:30 a.m. ET on Sunday, the network announced Wednesday. The interview will take place on Friday. The president-elect rarely participated in interviews with mainstream media outlets during the campaign, sticking to Fox News and nontraditional forms of media, including a range of podcasters. Welker last sat down with Trump for her debut 'Meet the Press' interview in September 2023, where he spoke about immigration, abortion and his then-Republican primary opponent Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Welker was criticized at the time for not fact-checking Trump during the interview.

Jeffries stays out of the way as Dems mutiny against senior panel leaders	House Democrats are poised to unseat several senior committee leaders, and Hakeem Jeffries is letting it happen. Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, 76, announced this week that he would step down from the top Democratic spot on the Natural Resources Committee. Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, 77, dropped his bid to continue leading Democrats on Judiciary in the face of a tough challenge from 61-year-old Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland. And Rep. David Scott of Georgia, 79, is facing multiple challenges for the top Democratic spot on the Agriculture Committee. It's akin to a mutiny, especially given Democrats’ typical deference to seniority in who leads panels.

Trump taps Michael Whatley to remain RNC chair	Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley has agreed to remain in the role following President-elect Donald Trump’s request for him to stay. In a post to X on Wednesday, Whatley said the RNC has 'crucial fights ahead,' from 'supporting President Trump’s cabinet nominees and preparing for the 2026 midterms, to our ongoing fight for election integrity across America.' 'The RNC’s priorities will remain the same: get out the vote, protect the ballot, and raise the money we need to elect Republicans up and down the ticket,' Whatley said in the post.

Hegseth’s future as Defense secretary hangs by a thread	How much trouble is Pete Hegseth facing in his bid to lead the Department of Defense? 'A lot,' as one GOP senator put it. Despite Hegseth, a veteran and Fox News personality, zigzagging across the Capitol to meet with Republican lawmakers over his imperiled nomination, there are still significant doubts he’ll have the necessary support to be confirmed. Backup nominees are already being floated, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, raising speculation that President-elect Donald Trump is ready to move on. 'That's definitely how my colleagues are taking it,' said the GOP senator, granted anonymity to speak candidly. 'That’s sending the signal to everybody here that Hegseth’s not likely to survive.'

Detroit mayor launches independent 2026 run for Michigan governor	Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan announced Wednesday that he will run for Michigan governor as an independent, breaking from the Democratic Party. 'I’m not running to be the Democrats’ governor or the Republicans’ governor — I’m running to be your governor,' Duggan, a lifelong Democrat, said in a video announcement. The three-term mayor is the first to officially enter what is expected to be a crowded 2026 field vying to replace Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is term-limited from running again.

GOP lawmakers already divided over sweeping Trump policy bill	Congressional Republicans are clashing over sweeping legislation on taxes, energy and immigration that will be the heart of President-elect Donald Trump’s legislative agenda — underscoring the hurdles ahead as the party tries to unify amid thin margins. Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune sparked heartburn across the Capitol this week when he told GOP senators that the package, which under budget reconciliation rules would allow the GOP to bypass a Democratic filibuster, would be split into two parts. The first would focus on border and energy, with a goal to pass it in the first 30 days of the new Trump administration, and the second on tax.

Former SEC commissioner Atkins picked to lead Wall Street regulator	President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday he will nominate former Wall Street regulator Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, turning to one of Washington’s most influential voices on financial policy to lead the U.S. markets watchdog. Atkins, if confirmed, would be tasked with steering the SEC as it embarks on what is expected to be a new deregulatory age for Wall Street after nearly four years of aggressive rulemaking by the current chair, Gary Gensler. He would also be thrust into a series of policy fights over the $3 trillion cryptocurrency market, artificial intelligence and the cost of raising capital in the U.S. Atkins previously served as an SEC commissioner in the early-to-mid 2000s before launching his consultancy firm, Patomak Global Partners.

If confirmed by the Senate, Slater will replace Jonathan Kanter and grapple with the various antitrust lawsuits and investigations against the tech industry and other sectors already underway.

Faulkender, who served as chief economist for Treasury during Trump’s first term, now teaches at the University of Maryland’s business school and also serves as chief economist at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute. If confirmed, he would be the No. 2 to hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, who has been tapped for the top job at Treasury.

Johnson: No Ukraine aid on year-end spending stopgap	Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday shot down the Biden administration’s request to include $24 billion in Ukraine-related aid as part of an expected short-term spending bill Congress needs to pass by Dec. 20. The Office of Management and Budget included the funding request in a list sent to Congress late last month. The new tranche of emergency Pentagon funding would go toward furnishing weapons and equipment for Ukraine and refilling U.S. inventories. But Johnson, asked if he would attach the Ukraine-related money to what is expected to be a spending stopgap into early next year, told reporters: 'I’m not planning to do that.'

New York’s D’Esposito makes play for top DEA role after failed reelection bid	New York GOP Rep.

'President Trump has a mandate from the people of this country to Make America Safe Again, and I would be honored to lend my experience as a decorated NYPD Detective and member of the House Homeland Security Committee to assist President Trump in that mission,' D’Esposito said in a statement.

FEMA officials worry Trump will divert disaster aid to the border	In 2019, then-President Donald Trump took $155 million from the federal government’s main disaster fund and used it to build immigration facilities near the U.S.-Mexico border. Now senior officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency are expressing concern that Trump could again redirect disaster resources after he takes office, but on a much larger scale. That could limit FEMA’s ability to help people and communities after major disasters, they say. 'But I am concerned that could happen, or that FEMA is given tasks to do things that are in support of immigration programs, whether it’s deportation or other aspects of immigration,' the agency's chief of staff, Michael Coen, said in a rare interview.

Trump's transition was supposed to be a show of force. What happened?	Over the last 24 hours, Donald Trump lost his pick to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration. His choice for Defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, is struggling to gain support from Senate Republicans. The president-elect is now even considering his onetime rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis, to lead the Pentagon. And these shake-ups to his not-yet-formed administration come after former Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew from consideration as Trump’s choice for attorney general. All told, the setbacks are raising new questions about Trump’s power over his party, whether Republicans would submit to any and all of his demands — and the expectation that his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, would bring order to Trump’s transition and White House.

Democrat launches push to force release of the Gaetz ethics report	Rep. Sean Casten isn’t giving up on his quest to see the House Ethics Committee’s investigation into Matt Gaetz, despite the former Florida representative withdrawing from consideration for attorney general. Casten took to the floor Tuesday to introduce a new privileged resolution that would force the release of the latest version of the ethics report. House leaders will have two legislative days to schedule a vote, which would only be successful if Casten gets a majority of the House to approve it. 'Withholding this report from the American people would impede the dignity and integrity of the legislative proceedings of the House,' Casten said in a statement Tuesday.

Trump picks billionaire investor as Pentagon deputy	President-elect Donald Trump has selected Stephen Feinberg to be his deputy Defense secretary, two people familiar with the decision told POLITICO, potentially putting a secretive billionaire financier with no experience in the agency into the Pentagon’s No. 2 job. Feinberg, who had a role on Trump’s intelligence advisory board during his first term, is a major donor to the president-elect, but his selection could present some significant conflicts of interest. He is the chief executive of private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, which has investments in military aircraft training and maintenance, and holds a majority stake in Navistar Defense, a manufacturer of military vehicles. Feinberg has yet to accept the offer, though one of the people familiar said he is expected to accept....	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/03/congress/trump-picks-billionaire-investor-pentagon-deputy-00192390	2024-12-03T11:38:36-08:00	
Grijalva ally weighs bid for top Natural Resources Democratic position	Rep. Melanie Stansbury is touting support from top Natural Resources panel Democrat Raúl Grijalva as she tests the waters on a long-shot bid to succeed him, according to three people familiar with the matter. Stansbury’s office told POLITICO on Monday that she is 'taking a serious look' at entering the race against Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), the presumptive favorite who appears to be in a strong position to win. The New Mexico Democrat, who joined the House in 2021, has quietly sounded out her congressional colleagues as she weighs a bid, the three people said. In messages to colleagues, she has stated that Grijalva asked her if she’d consider running with his support after he dropped out.

Thune tells Senate GOP he wants sweeping bill within first 30 days of Trump admin	Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune is pushing for two major partisan bills next term, including one within the first 30 days of the Trump administration, he told Republican senators at a private GOP conference meeting on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his remarks. Thune was broadly outlining priorities for the next Congress during the closed-door meeting. He said the first of the two pieces of legislation, which would pass under a process known as budget reconciliation that can bypass the Senate filibuster, would focus on the border, defense and energy. A subsequent package would focus on taxes and other priorities for the Trump administration. It’d be a significant first swing at legislation for Thune — 30 days is an ambitious timeline, even for a targeted package.

Trump EPA pick Lee Zeldin begins meeting with senators	Lee Zeldin has begun meeting with senators to smooth his path for confirmation as President-elect Donald Trump's EPA administrator. On Monday, the former New York Republican representative met with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who will soon chair the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Securing Capito's support will be key for Zeldin. Capito said on social media she had 'an excellent meeting' with Zeldin to talk about his vision for the agency.

The White House has not yet shared President Joe Biden’s schedule past Thursday, when he returns from a diplomatic trip to Angola. But about 50 heads of state will attend the reopening for the landmark church, according to the Associated Press.

Hegseth starts to branch out to shore up Pentagon bid	Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to be defense secretary, is back on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to continue meeting with Republican senators. This time, the embattled nominee is branching out beyond the Trump-allied GOP senators to some who aren’t yet committed. Hegseth is set to meet with at least three Republicans this afternoon: Sens.

How a potential panel shakeup will test Ocasio-Cortez's influence	Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could face the biggest test of her influence yet if a coveted spot as the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee opens up. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who currently holds the job, is running against Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) for the top Democratic spot on the Judiciary Committee. If Raskin successfully ousts Nadler, that will kick off a scramble to replace him. Although Democrats are reluctant to publicly discuss an Oversight bid before the Judiciary challenges are settled, lawmakers are privately making calls to test the waters, quietly jockeying behind the scenes. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), possible contenders for the top spot include Reps. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.).

Schumer reelected as Senate Democratic leader	Democrats nationally are wrestling over who will lead their party post-election. But in the Senate, they’re largely staying the course. In a closed-door party meeting on Tuesday, Senate Democrats elected leadership for their return to the minority, including tapping Sen. Chuck Schumer for another term as caucus leader, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) was also elected to another term as whip, the No. 2 spot. Two other Democrats rose in the ranks: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) was elected to the No. 3 spot as chair of the Steering and Policy Committee. It’s a step up for Klobuchar, who is currently No. 4 in the Democratic leadership rankings and serves as chair of the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee. And Sen.

Senate confirms stalled promotion for general involved in Afghanistan withdrawal	The promotion of President Joe Biden’s pick to lead U.S. Army forces in Europe and Africa has cleared the Senate after an unexplained delay. The promotion of Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue — who led the 82nd Airborne Division during the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan — to the rank of four-star general was approved quietly before the Senate adjourned. Donahue's promotion was conspicuously left out of a tranche of hundred of routine military nominees confirmed before the Senate's Thanksgiving recess, indicating a senator was holding up his nomination.

A top GOP senator predicts Trump’s picks will get FBI background checks	An impasse over FBI background checks for Trump's Cabinet nominees will likely be resolved 'in the next few days,' a top Republican told reporters Monday. 'I do think there will be FBI background checks,' said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the ranking GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The comments came amid fears the incoming Trump administration plans to bypass the customary step for top appointees, raising concerns about its vetting of candidates.

'I had heard his name, but I don't know his background, and I'm going to have to do a lot of work before reaching a decision on him.

Trump to nominate Republican donor to serve as UK ambassador	President-elect Donald Trump has nominated investment banker Warren Stephens to be his ambassador to the United Kingdom. Stephens, a financial backer of Trump’s campaign, would be among at least five other billionaires selected for major roles by the president-elect. 'Warren has always dreamed of serving the United States full time,' Trump said Monday in a Truth Social post. 'I am thrilled that he will now have that opportunity as the top Diplomat, representing the U.S.A. to one of America’s most cherished and beloved Allies.'

Congress readies another funding punt ahead of pre-Christmas shutdown deadline	Staring down a government shutdown deadline in less than three weeks, congressional leaders have begun serious negotiations toward a funding patch that punts the deadline into President-elect Donald Trump’s second term. A grand deal on final funding bills is highly unlikely before the Dec. 20 deadline, considering Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have yet to strike a 'toplines' agreement on overall spending totals for the military and non-defense programs. So lawmakers must now ready yet another stopgap that keeps federal agencies running on static funding — after they already punted on spending back in September.

Senate Dems set to bump up Klobuchar and Booker in leadership ranks	Sen. Amy Klobuchar is expected to be tapped for Senate Democrats’ No. 3 spot in caucus leadership elections this week, according to two people familiar with the shuffling. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is expected to fill the no. 4 role, which Klobuchar (D-Minn.) currently holds as chair of the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee. The No. 3 spot is currently held by retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who is head of Senate Democrats’ Policy and Communications Committee. Both Booker and Klobuchar — who both ran for president in 2020 and have wide name recognition in the party — had been eyeing the gig, but Booker's apparent acquiescence to instead take the spot one rung lower means the caucus will avoid that intra-party clash.

The most immediate issue: Congress faces a Dec. 20 government funding deadline. While a shutdown isn't atop anyone's holiday wish list, there’s significant disagreement about how long a short-term government funding patch should last into President-elect Donald Trump's new term — and what other priorities, like tens of billions in sought-after disaster aid, might hitch a ride to that bill.

And some of his former campaign staffers question whether he’s up for the challenge. Kennedy, who comes from one of the most high-profile families in Democratic politics, has held leadership roles as a lawyer and at nonprofit organizations but has more often been the public face of these operations than an executive manager.

Mexico's president and Trump had an upbeat call despite dust-up over tariffs	President-elect Donald Trump said his conversation Wednesday with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was 'wonderful' and 'very productive.' She, in turn, described their phone call as 'excellent.' Their upbeat readouts on the call marked a contrast from earlier in the week, when Trump warned he would impose a 25 percent tariff on all goods from Mexico if it doesn’t stop the flow of migrants and drugs across their shared border – and Sheinbaum fired back by warning that her country could retaliate with tariffs of its own.

Zuckerberg meets with Trump in Florida	Facebook founder Mark Zuckerbeg made the trek to Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday, where he met with President-elect Donald Trump and members of his soon-to-be second administration. The Meta CEO was seen with a large security and staff presence while at Trump’s private Palm Beach club in the evening, a person with direct knowledge told POLITICO. On Fox News, Trump deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller confirmed POLITICO’s reporting that Zuckerberg was there, saying he 'has made it very clear about his desire to be a supporter of and a participant in this change that we’re seeing all around America, all around the world, this reform movement that Donald Trump is leading.'

‘Delete CFPB’: Musk calls for elimination of consumer bureau	Elon Musk said Wednesday that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau should be abolished, calling for the elimination of an agency that would potentially regulate the future payments business of the Musk-owned X platform. 'Delete CFPB,' Musk, who is leading an effort on behalf of President-elect Donald Trump to shrink the size of the federal government, wrote in a post on X. 'There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.' Trump on the campaign trail called for easing regulation of the financial industry generally but didn’t explicitly call for the elimination of the CFPB, which Republicans have railed against for years.

Former SEC commissioner Atkins emerges as a top contender for chair	Paul Atkins, a veteran regulator and influential voice on financial policy, is emerging as a leading candidate to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission under President-elect Donald Trump, according to four people familiar with the transition. No final decision has been made, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss the private conversations. But Atkins was recently invited to interview with Trump, one of the people said. Trump is expected to announce his pick for Wall Street's top regulator soon. Others whose names have been floated for SEC chair include Brian Brooks, the one-time acting comptroller of the currency, and former SEC General Counsel Robert Stebbins. Atkins, if picked and confirmed, would rejoin the SEC after a 16-year hiatus from the agency.

Democrat Derek Tran ousts Michelle Steel in CA House battle	Derek Tran, a first-time Democratic candidate, has flipped a toss-up California House seat, narrowly defeating GOP Rep. Michelle Steel, who conceded on Wednesday after a protracted vote count. Tran had declared victory early this week, and currently leads by roughly 600 votes. Steel, a two-term congressmember, had been an elusive target for Democrats, occupying an Orange County district that had backed President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. The race ended up being the most expensive House battle in the country, with at least $46 million spent by the campaigns and an array of outside groups. Democrats hoped Tran was the right candidate to dislodge Steel, given his background as the son of Vietn...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/27/derek-tran-wins-california-45-election-00187118	2024-11-27T12:09:14-08:00	https://static.politico.com/23/c1/26c6f0bd49dfbd3199cc769f97b9/elections-2024-california-house-70698.jpg
Johnson's next margin headache: Manchin-style Republicans	Speaker Mike Johnson is staring down what could be a one-vote majority to enact the House GOP agenda in the first months of the second Trump era.

Trump appoints Keith Kellogg as Ukraine peace envoy	President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday named former national security aide and retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg as a special envoy to Russia and Ukraine, commissioning him to lead negotiations to end the war. In a statement, Trump said that Kellogg, who served as national security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence, 'was with me right from the beginning' and 'will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!' The move is not likely to allay anxieties among European allies that Trump will attempt to pursue peace between Russia and Ukraine.

Dutch Ruppersberger (D). Inside the campaign: Olszewski, the sitting Baltimore County executive, effectively cleared the Democratic primary field once he jumped into the contest following Ruppersberger’s decision to stand aside. He lined up endorsements from statewide Democratic luminaries like Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Sen.-elect Angela Alsobrooks, former Sen. Barbara Mikulski, Rep. Steny Hoyer and Ruppersberger.

Moulton could draw challengers	BOSTON — Rep. Seth Moulton drew swift condemnation from local Democratic leaders and LGBTQ+ advocates for comments he made about transgender youth in sports in the wake of Democrats’ defeats earlier this month. But will the discontent translate to real competition next cycle? It’s early, but some potential challengers are already beginning to stir. Dan Koh, a former Andover selectman who narrowly lost the race for the open seat in the neighboring 3rd District in 2018, has been making — and fielding — calls about a possible campaign against Moulton, according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the conversations.

Musk wants to stop enforcing regulations. Why that’s ‘almost meaningless.’	Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy outlined a plan to help companies avoid environmental regulations: The government could just refuse to enforce its own rules. But some lawyers who specialize in federal regulation expressed doubt that companies would benefit from such a plan — or even want it. 'I don't think it would really reduce the burden on industry for the most part, because companies have a legal obligation to comply with regulatory requirements,' said Jeff Holmstead, a former EPA air chief under President George W. Bush who represents industry clients at Bracewell LLP.

President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that Hassett will be director of the National Economic Council, a role that puts him in charge of executing the higher tariffs and tax cuts promised during the campaign. Hassett, whose appointment was expected, served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers for two years during Trump’s first term.

Vince Haley, who was also director of policy during the campaign, will head his domestic policy agenda, Trump said in a statement Tuesday.

Now, he would take on an expanded role as the president’s top adviser on economic matters and play a key part in coordinating policies and strategy across the government. One of the main orders of business for the new NEC director will be serving as an emissary in negotiating an extension to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, legislation that Hassett has spent years touting.

Kash Patel and Cliff Sims are jostling for the deputy director gig at the CIA	Two Trump transition insiders, Cliff Sims and Kash Patel, are angling to be deputy director of the CIA — and angering others who feel they're using their roles on the transition to undermine any would-be contenders, according to three people familiar with the matter. The No. 2 position at the powerful spy agency is one of the most sought-after national security posts that remains unfilled. It does not require Senate confirmation — a concern for other roles, like FBI director, Patel is said to be interested in — but wields enormous influence inside the U.S. intelligence community. The frustration toward Sims, the former White House and ODNI communications strategist, and Patel, the firebrand former House Intelligence Committee staffer and Pentagon official, stems from the fact that both are...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/26/congress/kash-patel-cliff-sims-deputy-director-cia-00191715	2024-11-26T11:12:39-08:00

Inside the campaign: McGuire, a state senator, got a big boost in his primary challenge against the sitting Freedom Caucus chair: the endorsement of President-elect Donald Trump, a huge boost in this red-leaning district. He used the slogan of 'Pro-Life. Pro-Gun. Pro-Trump' throughout his successful campaign.

Trump is loading his administration up with Floridians. Is Washington ready?	Donald Trump adopted Florida as his home state. Now his second administration will look to transform the country in its image. His new administration is loaded with politicians and operatives who cut their teeth in the Sunshine State — from incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles; to Marco Rubio, the likely next secretary of State; and Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general Trump tapped to lead the Justice Department after the first Floridian he picked, Matt Gaetz, withdrew.

Trump on Monday said on social media that he would support Republican Jimmy Patronis for the now-vacant northwest Florida congressional seat that Gaetz gave up during his truncated bid for attorney general.

Ernst pitches DOGE on spending cuts and savings	Sen. Joni Ernst is pitching President-elect Donald Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency on more than $2 trillion proposed cuts or savings— the latest example of GOP lawmakers embracing the commission. Ernst (R-Iowa) sent a letter on Monday to Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump tapped to lead the out-of-government panel tasked with coordinating with the White House and Office of Management and Budget. 'Thank you for stepping up to take on the challenge of saving taxpayers from Washington’s out- of-control spending that put our nation $36 trillion in debt. Your mission could not be more urgent, and there’s no team better suited to lead the effort,' Ernst wrote in the letter, <a href='...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/25/congress/ernst-pitches-doge-on-cuts-and-savings-00191487	2024-11-25T09:00:00-08:00	
This is the new progressive strategy for warring with Trump	Progressive Democrats wrestling with how to navigate a second Donald Trump presidency are settling on a new approach: Take his populist, working-class proposals at his word — or at least pretend to. If he succeeds, they can take some credit for bringing him to the table. If he doesn’t, they can bash him for it. It’s a change in strategy, emerging in private conversations among some liberal elected officials and operatives, that comes after years of resisting Trump ended with him returning to the White House. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in an interview that she would likely work with Trump if he pursues antitrust promises he made on the campaign trail...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/25/progressives-against-trump-00191392	2024-11-25T09:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/76/2f/290104fc430387d52df8a7244dd7/u-s-congress-59649.jpg

Fears are growing that Trump could push out dozens of government watchdogs	Two in-house investigators at U.S. intelligence agencies recently quit their jobs. There’s growing fear in Washington that they could be the start of an exodus — or a purge — of government watchdogs. A wave of departures by inspectors general would give President-elect Donald Trump the opportunity to nominate or appoint people of his choice to the watchdog posts — leaving dozens of federal departments, agencies and offices subject to oversight by people who would owe their positions to Trump. In the wake of Trump’s election, CIA Inspector General Robin Ashton and Intelligence Community Inspector General Thomas Monheim revealed they plan to leave government in the coming weeks. Neither cited Trump’s victory as a basis for the decision, but the timing of the announcements troubled some longt...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/25/trump-inspectors-general-watchdogs-00191381	2024-11-25T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/df/7f/10b16fa24963b62d3e61d327acf6/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1345757892

Harris is telling her advisers and allies to keep her political options open	Kamala Harris has been lying low since her defeat in the presidential race, unwinding with family and senior aides in Hawaii before heading back to the nation’s capital. But privately, the vice president has been instructing advisers and allies to keep her options open — whether for a possible 2028 presidential run, or even to run for governor in her home state of California in two years. As Harris has repeated in phone calls, 'I am staying in the fight.'

Round one in that fight — the Matt Gaetz saga — went to Senate Republicans. And it gives early hints of how GOP lawmakers may respond on spending and other controversial nominees.

But they stand apart from the presidential race, in which Vice President Kamala Harris lost every single swing state — including states where Democrats made gains in state government or preserved their majorities.

Promotion delayed for general who oversaw Afghanistan pullout	A top general who oversaw the 82nd Airborne Division during the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was conspicuously left out of a large batch of military promotions approved Thursday by the Senate before it left town until December. The apparent delay for Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue — President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Army in Europe and Africa and set for promotion to four-star general — suggests a senator is holding the nomination. Donahue was one of nearly 1,000 promotions the Senate Armed Services Committee approved on Tuesday, and senators in the full chamber typically clear the decks of uniform nominees before an extended recess. It’s unclear which senator might be delaying Donahue’s promotion and why.

Trump once shunned Project 2025 as ‘ridiculous.’ Now he's staffing up with them.	Donald Trump spent his presidential campaign running from Project 2025. Now, he’s using it to stock his White House and administration.

One of Trump’s first selections — Tom Homan as 'border czar' — was also a Project 2025 contributor.

Matt Gaetz won’t be the next attorney general. Will he go back to the Hill?	Matt Gaetz is out of the running for attorney general. He’s also out of a job on Capitol Hill. In Washington and Tallahassee, the question now is: Could he be back in the House in January? The Florida Republican resigned both from his current term and preemptively from his term in the next Congress, which he just won in the November election.

With Gaetz gone, Trump’s troubled Pentagon nominee is in the hot seat	Former Rep. Matt Gaetz’s abrupt withdrawal of his bid to be attorney general on Thursday could be bad news for another of President-elect Donald Trump’s picks: Pete Hegseth. Hegseth’s nomination for Defense secretary is facing headwinds over seven-year-old allegations of sexual assault, although he was never charged. But Hegseth so far had been overshadowed by Gaetz, a flame-throwing congressional ally with numerous foes in both parties who faced his own misconduct allegations, including that he engaged in sex with a minor. With Gaetz stepping out of contention, scrutiny could quickly shift to Hegseth after revelations that the Army veteran and former Fox News personality ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/hegseth-gaetz-pentagon-00191051	2024-11-21T13:31:10-08:00

Schumer explains reported GOP deal on judges	The office of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is defending a reported deal where Democrats ceded four appeals court nominations in favor of confirming more of President Joe Biden’s lower-level federal judicial appointees. 'The trade was four circuit nominees — all lacking the votes to get confirmed — for more than triple the number of additional judges moving forward,' a spokesperson for Schumer said Thursday. Democrats have confirmed 221 of Biden’s picks for the federal courts after the Senate overwhelmingly approved Sharad Desai for a federal judicial post in Arizona on Thursday. Republicans have tried throughout the week to erect procedural hurdles to slow confirmation of more Biden judicial nominees. President-elect Donald Trump has urged GOP senators to do everything possible to ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/schumer-on-gop-judges-deal-00191038	2024-11-21T12:57:59-08:00	
Fetterman on Gaetz withdrawal: 'I didn't see that coming'	Sen. John Fetterman mocked Matt Gaetz Thursday for withdrawing as Donald Trump's attorney general pick, saying sarcastically that he 'didn’t see that coming.' 'I heard a rumor that they're going to issue a new silver dollar in his honor because he had to withdraw,' Fetterman joked. 'OK, so can we freak out about that next?' Gaetz announced Thursday he was withdrawing, saying in a social media post his nomination had become a distraction. When the president-elect announced he tapped Gaetz to be his next attorney general last week, Fetterman called it 'god-tier-level trolling.' 'People have the opportunity and they can freak out over anything and respond and if they want to do that you better pace yourself though because it’s not even Thanksgiving,' Fetterman told reporters Thursday.

GOP senators expect to meet with RFK Jr. soon	Republican senators expect Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to soon make the rounds on Capitol Hill as he seeks to win their votes for his confirmation to be Trump’s Health and Human Services secretary. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) said Thursday Kennedy was likely to journey to the Hill in the coming days, suggesting he’d meet with GOP senators after the Thanksgiving break. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), the top Republican on the HELP Committee, confirmed there has been 'some preliminary reach out' to organize the meetings.

What does Gaetz’s withdrawal mean for the Ethics report?	House Democrats vowed to press forward with their plan to force the release of a long-awaited report into Matt Gaetz even after he withdrew from consideration as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Attorney General. But there are early signs that House Republicans, some of whom had indicated prior to Gaetz’s withdrawal that they supported the Democratic-led effort, are no longer on board. And Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.) the top Republican on the Ethics panel, told CBS Thursday that Gaetz's withdrawal 'should end the discussion of whether or not the Ethics Committee should continue to move forward in this matter.' Democrats introduced a measure on Wednesday that would theoretically force a House floor vote that would make the Ethics panel release the report. It’s still unclear if th...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/future-of-the-gaetz-ethics-report-00190980	2024-11-21T10:51:12-08:00

RFK Jr. previously compared Trump to Hitler	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler and disparaged his supporters on his podcast in 2016. Kennedy, who ultimately backed Trump in the 2024 election after dropping his own independent bid, is now a newly selected cabinet member to lead Trump's Health and Human Services Department — but the old comments reflect the fact that Kennedy was a lifelong Democrat before joining forces with the Republican president-elect. In the now-eight-year-old radio show broadcasts, first reported by CNN, Kennedy said Trump was stoking fear on the campaign trail with his rhetoric and compared him to Hitler, the former-segregationist Gov. George Wallace and other divisive leaders. O...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/rfk-jr-trump-hitler-00190944	2024-11-21T10:29:36-08:00	
Turning Point readies state lobbying effort to help Trump’s nominees	As uncertainty mounts about whether the new Republican-controlled Senate will sign off on some of President-Elect Donald Trump’s more controversial Cabinet picks, a top conservative grassroots group is dialing up the pressure. Turning Point Action, the group spearheaded by prominent conservative activist Charlie Kirk, plans to hold rallies in states where they believe GOP senators may need extra 'encouragement' to approve nominees like Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. That list also initially included Rep. Matt Gaetz, who Trump tapped for attorney general, though the Florida Republican on Thursday announced he was withdrawing from consideration, expla...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/turning-point-00190959	2024-11-21T10:21:37-08:00	
SEC Chair Gary Gensler to step down Jan. 20	Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who pursued a sweeping and controversial agenda as Wall Street’s chief overseer over the last three-plus years, plans to step down on Jan. 20, the agency said Thursday. His departure will clear the way for President-elect Donald Trump to install his yet-to-be-named pick to lead the top U.S. financial markets regulator. Gensler's exit will cap one of the most memorable periods in the SEC's history, as the 67-year-old veteran regulator sought to enact a slate of ambitious rules and pursue lawsuits that led to high-profile clashes with both the traditional financial world and the cryptocurrency industry. Among the rules enacted under Gensler were measures seeking to shore up the U.S. Treasury market and to force corporate America to tell ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/wall-streets-top-regulator-to-exit-00190948	2024-11-21T10:20:42-08:00	
Donald Trump gets a brutal reality check	Donald Trump is not a monarch. That’s the unmistakable lesson of the ill-fated nomination of Matt Gaetz for attorney general. Rather than showcasing Trump’s absolute power over his GOP allies, it revealed his limits. The doomed nomination lasted just eight days — and its failure is an unwelcome lesson for the president-elect, who has been projecting invincibility and claiming a historic mandate despite his reed-thin popular vote victory. 'The short version is ‘checks and balances work,’' said Eugene Volokh, a UCLA professor of law.

Matt Gaetz withdraws from consideration for Trump's AG	Matt Gaetz announced Thursday he is withdrawing his name from consideration as President-elect Donald Trump's pick as attorney general, noting in a social media post that his nomination had become a distraction. Gaetz held multiple meetings with GOP senators over the past couple of days as he sought to game out his chances of getting confirmed. Even senators who supported him had expressed doubts that he could get confirmed, given he could only lose three Republican votes. 'It is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General.

Keep your eyes on these Senate Republicans. They could upend Pete Hegseth’s confirmation.	Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Pentagon, is on Capitol Hill Thursday to make his case with Senate Republicans as controversy continues to build around his nomination. The Army veteran and Fox News host will need to address allegations of sexual assault that surfaced in recent days. Concern on the Hill is only likely to build after a police report into the 2017 allegations, which Hegseth denies and wasn’t charged in, became public on Wednesday. Four Senate Republicans would need to break ranks to sink Hegseth’s nomination.

Biden’s judicial nominees roll onward in the Senate	Senate Democrats confirmed the Biden administration’s 220th lifetime appointment to the federal judiciary on Wednesday — and are poised to add to that total as they wind down their time in Washington before Thanksgiving. Lawmakers voted beyond midnight to end debate on a handful of other nominees. On Thursday, they’ll vote to confirm Sharad Desai to be district judge for the District of Arizona. Beyond that, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will have half a dozen more nominees primed for final Senate approval — though the actual confirmations won’t take place until after Thanksgiving. Of note: Vice President-elect JD Vance was present and voted no on the latter half of these judicial moves, so he was near the Senate floor until around midnight.

Republican Begich unseats Peltola in Alaska House race	Alaska Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola lost her reelection campaign Wednesday, a little more than two years after she unexpectedly flipped the Republican-held seat. Peltola lost to Republican challenger Nick Begich III, a business owner and grandson of former Sen. Nick Begich (D). The winner ended up with 51 percent of the vote after more ballots were counted and the state applied its rank choice voting process. Peltola got to Congress following a 2022 special election following Republican Rep. Don Young’s death. She flipped the seat from Republican control on a centrist message that included promoting fisheries, natural resources and abortion rights, among other priorities; she made 'Fish, Family, Freedom' a campaign motto.

The response to The Trump Show’s casting call will be even more clarifying. In short: Will the Senate remain the Senate? While much of the GOP has become a Trump subsidiary, there are still some Senate Republicans who consider themselves members of a co-equal branch of government and take their Advise and Consent duty seriously.

TSA administrator makes bid to stay on under Trump	Transportation Security Administration chief David Pekoske is signaling that he'd like to stay on in his current role as President-elect Donald Trump begins his second term. During a segment about Thanksgiving travel with CBS on Tuesday, Pekoske was clear that he's hoping to stay until his term ends in 2027, saying that he 'loves' the role. 'It’s important for continuity in TSA to run the second term to its conclusion,' he said, adding that the agency has made numerous investments and increased partnerships not just in air travel but on surface transportation security, too. A TSA spokesperson on Wednesday backstopped Pekoske’s comments.

Members of the House Ethics Committee deadlocked over whether to release the findings of an investigation into the former Florida lawmaker, who is Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general. The inaction is triggering outrage among Democrats, who argue the committee is dragging out the process, while Republicans remain furious that Gaetz put them in this position. In a bid to force the release of the Ethics report, which is expected to cover several allegations, including that Gaetz had sex with a minor, Democratic Reps.
