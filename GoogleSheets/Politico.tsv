How Trump is hammering Congress ‘on every issue’ — with a clear focus	President-elect Donald Trump is beginning to lean on Congress in a big way, but it's all about next year. Trump is focusing his efforts and expending political capital to ensure that Republican lawmakers go along with confirming his Cabinet picks and can ramp up right away on delivering on his campaign pledges in 2025. He regularly talks to senators about his nominees, ensuring they’re on a path to confirmation next year, according to a Trump adviser granted anonymity to discuss the conversations. He’s speaking with incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson about his legislative priorities, namely how to quickly pass immigration, energy and tax policies in major party-line bills. 'Did you hear we have another member? We have 221 members,' joked Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/12/how-trump-hammering-congress-every-issue-00193871	2024-12-12T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/dc/40/b18bbc7b4881a96d44da1c15dc69/trump-47824.jpg
Biden judicial nominations endgame comes into focus	The judicial branch will be top of mind in the legislative branch on Thursday. Senate Democrats are nearing the judicial confirmations total that President-elect Donald Trump achieved in his first term. Meanwhile, the Biden White House is poised to block an expansion of the federal judiciary once it passes the House. First up: The House will consider the Judicial Understaffing Delays Getting Emergencies Solved Act — or JUDGES Act — on Thursday morning. The measure would incrementally create 66 new federal judicial positions over the next decade. But the White House has vowed to veto the measure, accusing the House of waiting until the results of the November election to take it up.

SBA staff at Washington headquarters would shrink under Ernst bill	Sen. Joni Ernst wants to make restructuring the Small Business Administration one of her first legislative acts as chair of the Senate caucus carrying out Donald Trump’s 'Department of Government Efficiency' agenda. The Iowa Republican‘s bill that she will announce Thursday would require the SBA administrator to relocate at least 30 percent of workers at its headquarters outside the Washington metro area, according to a copy of legislation obtained by POLITICO. SBA would then reduce the office space at its headquarters by at least 30 percent, under her legislation.

Some Democrats want to thaw their frosty relationship with Elon Musk	Ro Khanna is trading texts with Elon Musk. Josh Shapiro took a call from him. And John Fetterman has compared him to the superhero Tony Stark. As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to install Musk as the federal government’s cutter-in-chief, some ambitious Democrats are taking a warmer approach to the billionaire businessman than their party leaders have in the past as he has become one the most influential people on the planet. 'He’s had an undeniable impact on the Pennsylvania election, and I think the election overall,' Fetterman, the Democratic Pennsylvania senator, told POLITICO.

Trump picks Kari Lake to lead Voice of America	President-elect Donald Trump has selected Kari Lake to serve as the next director of Voice of America — the publicly funded broadcast network that drew his ire in his first term. Lake, a former local news anchor and staunch Trump ally, will be appointed by the next head of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which Trump plans to announce soon, the president-elect said in a Truth Social post Wednesday. The U.S. Agency for Global Media oversees Voice of America. Trump said in the post that Lake and the head of the U.S. Agency for Global Media will work 'to ensure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media.'

Trump fills out more of his Latin American diplomatic team	President-elect Donald Trump announced a trio of picks Wednesday for Latin America ambassadorships, elevating major donors to critical diplomatic postings in the Western Hemisphere. In a series of late-night Truth Social posts, Trump said he would tap former Conair executive Leandro Rizzuto Jr. as ambassador to the Organization of American States. He also said he would appoint philanthropist and urgent care network executive Peter Lamelas as ambassador to Argentina and personal injury lawyer and former law enforcement officer Dan Newlin to the role of ambassador to Colombia. Only Rizzuto has diplomatic experience — he served as consul to Bermuda. Lamelas and Newlin will be thrust immediately into complicated diplomatic discussions without that kind of background.

Black Caucus faces internal pressure to stay out of races for panel leaders — a bad signal for one of their own	The powerful Congressional Black Caucus is under intense pressure from within to refrain from endorsing any candidates in contested committee leader races — including one of their own. Several members stood up during the Black Caucus meeting Wednesday afternoon to argue against the group formally endorsing any Democrats in the contested races and instead allow Democratic caucus members to make their own choices, according to two people familiar with the meeting who were granted anonymity to discuss a closed-door event. Such a move would signal a stunning shift for the group, especially if it refrains from backing ailing House Agriculture ranking member Rep. David Scott (D-Ga.).

Trump's bringing several billionaires — and their conflicts — to Washington	Donald Trump has reshaped the Republican Party to embrace a brand of populism that prioritizes its working-class base and is at least outwardly skeptical of corporate power. But since his second election last month, Trump has leaned heavily on aides and Cabinet picks who share a distinctive characteristic with him: wealth from complex business entanglements. Trump has appointed a raft of rich business people and investors — including several billionaires and multiple Wall Street executives with complex financial interests — to fill out top roles in his administration, raising a vast array of potential conflicts of interest that could span the federal government and complicate Senate confirmations. The billionaires set to join the second Trump administration include Howard Lutnick, a Wall S...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/11/trumps-bringing-several-billionaires-and-their-conflicts-to-washington-00193844	2024-12-11T15:22:44-08:00	https://static.politico.com/87/72/c0e2ae8447a3b098a0ce170837c0/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2170630919

Pritzker questions whether Trump's border czar has the 'authority' to implement massive immigration changes	CHICAGO — Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said he's open to working with President-elect Donald Trump's new border czar — but said he was skeptical the incoming official had the 'authority' to do everything he said. 'Being a border czar is not an official position in the government, and it will be up to the President of the United States and up to the leaders of the Customs and Border Patrol to make decisions about how we'll manage the border,' Pritzker said. Trump's incoming border czar, Tom Homan, visited Chicago on Monday and said both Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson 'suck' for their comments about not working with federal agents on deportations. Illinois is a sanctuary state and Chicago is a sanctuary city, meaning there are laws and ordinances that prevent local law enforcement f...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/11/congress/jb-pritzker-tom-homan-00193864	2024-12-11T14:12:38-08:00

NLRB pick stalls after Senate floor drama with Manchin	The Senate failed to end debate on a bid to extend the tenure of Lauren McFerran at the National Labor Relations Board after drama on the Senate floor — and a final decisive 'no' vote from Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.). Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hoped to extend McFerran’s tenure at the NLRB to give Democrats effective control of the body into 2026 — part of the way through President-elect Donald Trump’s second term. The floor stayed open at length awaiting a decision from Manchin with the tally tied at 49. The retiring West Virginian, who voted against several NLRB picks in September 2023, ultimately emerged in opposition to the nomination, making the finally tally 49-50.

Fetterman agrees to meet with Hegseth	Sen. John Fetterman plans to meet with Pete Hegseth on Thursday, making him the first Senate Democrat to sit down with Donald Trump's embattled pick for Pentagon chief. The Pennsylvania senator, known for his blunt and pragmatic approach, confirmed the meeting on Wednesday and said he’s not ruling out supporting Hegseth. His decision comes amid allegations against the former Fox News anchor of sexual misconduct, excessive drinking and financial mismanagement. 'He could theoretically become the head of the Defense Department,' he said. 'I've discovered in my time in D.C. that that's important.

Chip Roy makes bid for House Rules chair	Rep. Chip Roy is making a bid to lead the House Rules Committee next year, which would give him and the chamber’s right flank an influential perch for shaping legislation.

'A number of my colleagues, I’m proud to have their support. … I think I would add some value to that position because of my expertise on the rules and because I think I can figure out how to bring the conference together,' Roy added.

GOP Drama: Cotton Seeks Intelligence Chair, Thwarting Cornyn	Senate Republicans have discussed elevating Sen. John Cornyn to chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, according to party officials, a move that would hand Cornyn a prized gavel as consolation for losing his GOP leader bid and could help induce him to run for reelection in two years. The complication, and almost certain deal-breaker: Cornyn would have to leapfrog the Republican next in line to chair the Intelligence Committee, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and Cotton has privately made clear to Cornyn he would claim the position. Likely ensuring Cotton’s ascension to the chair is the raw politics of last month’s Senate Republican leadership race between Cornyn and Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.).

Johnson, a Green Beret who spent more than 20 years at the Central Intelligence Agency before a diplomatic posting in San Salvador, would bring significant foreign policy expertise to one of the most important bilateral diplomatic portfolios in the U.S. government. Mexico is the United States’ largest trading partner and thorny discussions around bilateral trade, drug trafficking, migration and border security are expected to dominate the agenda between Washington and Mexico City under the Trump administration.

Trump taps private equity executive Tom Barrack as ambassador to Turkey	President-elect Donald Trump announced private equity executive Tom Barrack, a long-time ally who faced legal scrutiny for his work on behalf of the United Arab Emirates, as his pick to be the next U.S. ambassador to Turkey. In a Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump said that Barrack, a California billionaire, is 'a well respected and experienced voice of reason to a wide range of thought leaders in both political and business circles.' Barrack’s relationship with Trump goes back to the 1980s and he has fundraised and supported Trump throughout his political career. Barrack, who served as a deputy undersecretary at the Department of the Interior during the Reagan administration, was a senior adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016 and chaired the 2017 inaugural committee.

Kimberly Guilfoyle picked by Trump to be ambassador to Greece	Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former Court TV anchor and Fox News host who became a staunch advocate for Donald Trump, has been chosen by him to be the next U.S. ambassador to Greece. Trump announced the decision Tuesday in a social media post, calling her a a 'close friend and ally' who 'is perfectly suited to foster strong bilateral relations with Greece.' Guilfoyle was engaged to Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest child, but newspapers have recently published photos suggesting that he is now romantically involved with socialite Bettina Anderson.

Sanders says this is likely his last term	Sen. Bernie Sanders, former presidential candidate and leader of the progressive movement in the United States for decades, said this would likely be his last term in an interview with POLITICO. Sanders (I-Vt.) won reelection in November and has six more years in the Senate ahead of him. When asked whether his fourth Senate term would be his last, Sanders said: 'I’m 83 now. I’ll be 89 when I get out of here. You can do the figuring. I don’t know, but I would assume, probably, yes.' Sanders has been in Congress since 1991.

Cotton blocks federal journalist shield legislation in Senate	Sen. Tom Cotton has blocked a first-of-its-kind federal shield law for journalists against revealing their confidential sources, arguing its passage would represent a threat to national security. 'The liberal media doesn’t deserve more protections,' Cotton (R-Ark.), who will chair the Intelligence Committee next year, said on the Senate floor. 'The press badge doesn’t make you better than the rest of America or put you above the law.' The Protect Reporters from Exploitative State Spying Act — or the PRESS Act — previously passed the House by voice vote in January. Cotton said he was providing the 'sober second thought' to the 'rash, impetuous, hasty, impulsive' action by the House on the legislation.

RFK Jr. faces trouble in the Senate	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the latest Donald Trump Cabinet pick facing trouble in the Senate. At least three closely watched senators are noncommittal about confirming the vaccine critic, who’s being considered to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Those include swing votes like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as well as Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who will chair a committee that could host confirmation hearings for Kennedy. Kennedy can afford to lose only three Republicans during his confirmation if all Senate Democrats vote against him. This group of senators closely resembles those who weren’t sold on former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general or have questioned defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth.

Trump considers Andrew Ferguson to replace Lina Khan	President-elect Donald Trump is considering replacing Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan with Andrew Ferguson. Trump has not made a final decision and is set to meet with Ferguson this afternoon, according to a person familiar with the meeting who was granted anonymity to discuss the potential nomination. A decision could come soon. If selected, Ferguson won’t need Senate confirmation since he is already on the commission. Ferguson, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, is well-known in Republican circles. He previously did stints as chief counsel for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen.

Schiff bats aside suggestion of preemptive pardon for Jan. 6 committee members	Newly sworn-in Sen. Adam Schiff said Tuesday that it would be unnecessary for President Joe Biden to issue preemptive pardons for members of the Jan. 6 committee. 'I don't think the incoming president should be threatening his political opponents with jail time,' Schiff (D-Calif) said at a press conference alongside Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. 'Nor do I think that a pardon is necessary for members of the Jan. 6 committee. We're proud of the work we did on that committee.' Schumer seemed to agree that a pardon wouldn’t be necessary for Schiff: 'He broke no laws whatsoever, and the truth stands for itself.'

A federal union pushes back after congressional leaders and DOGE call out teleworking	The nation's biggest federal union is pushing back against claims by President-elect Donald Trump's supporters over teleworking for civil servants. The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 800,000 federal and Washington city workers, said assertions that staffers are abusing work-from-home flexibility are serving as cover for Republican lawmakers to try to tear down the government. The clash over telework is expected to be one of the major battles for the incoming Trump administration as conservatives push for the civil service to return to the office.

Johnson needs Dems to pass a stopgap spending bill. Here's what they want.	Lawmakers only have nine working days left to figure out government funding before the shutdown deadline, and Speaker Mike Johnson will almost certainly need House Democratic votes to pass it. Congress is likely to pass a stopgap government funding measure before Dec. 20, likely to fund the government until March of next year at its current levels. But considering Johnson’s razor-thin margin and a notable conservative faction of his conference that doesn’t generally support stopgap spending bills, known as continuing resolutions, House Democrats will likely be the ones to get the legislation over the finish line. Typically, punting a funding deadline into a new year when Republicans will control every lever of power would make Democrats shudder.

Trump SEC pick wants to ditch landmark climate disclosure rule	President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission has been a vocal critic of the financial regulator’s recent effort to require companies to disclose their risks from climate change. Paul Atkins, a Republican whom President George W. Bush named to the SEC in 2002, is best known as an advocate for cryptocurrency since leaving the commission in 2008. He’s also assailed the SEC’s controversial climate-disclosure rule as a burden to corporate America. Finalized in March under Biden SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the rule would require publicly traded companies to divulge details about the risks that clima...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/09/congress/paul-atkins-sec-climate-00193254	2024-12-09T06:50:46-08:00	
Defense bill, nominee meetings and judges headline crucial December Hill week	While you’re busy buying presents and running to the dry cleaners after yet another holiday party, Congress is racing toward the end of the year — and one of the final weeks in session of Joe Biden’s presidency. Top of mind: Getting a compromise version of the annual defense policy bill across the finish line.

Lara Trump leaves RNC amid Senate chatter	Lara Trump is stepping down as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, a role she has held since March, as some of Donald Trump’s allies continue to push for her to replace Florida Sen.

She’s expressed openness to replacing Rubio, the president-elect’s pick to be secretary of State, in the Senate, telling The Associated Press it’s a role she 'would seriously consider.'

Officially, the event was a time to chart a path forward under a Trump administration. Unofficially, it also served as a preview of the next Democratic primary.

Democrats inch toward the anger phase of their election loss	SCOTTSDALE, Arizona — Exactly one month after losing to Donald Trump in every battleground on the map, Democratic Party leaders from across the country decamped to one of the states that rejected them and struggled to pull themselves out of their funk. At a Hilton hotel outside of Phoenix, where Christmas carols piped into the lobby, state Democratic chairs gathered for their annual winter meeting. They weren’t frantic like they had been after Trump’s first stunning victory. They were exhausted. Even after Trump tapped the likes of Kash Patel and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to staff his government, they still weren’t ready to demonstrate in the streets or tune into liberal networks.

Pam Bondi’s lobbying past will create an ethics morass at DOJ	Over the past six years, Pam Bondi has worked as a Washington lobbyist for one of the top firms in the country, representing corporate behemoths such as Amazon and Uber. Now, some of the same clients her firm represents are squaring off against the Department of Justice she's poised to lead. And corporate interests are cautiously optimistic that her selection will shepherd in an administration more friendly to their interests than President Joe Biden's. Her appointment, lobbyists say, could be a win for major U.S. corporations that find themselves crosswise with the Justice Department, including health care giant UnitedHealthcare and social media company TikTok.

President Yoon Suk Yeol made a public apology in a brief televised address Saturday morning, hours ahead of a parliamentary vote on a motion to impeach him. Yoon said he won’t shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration, adding that he will leave it to his conservative party to map out measures to stabilize politics, 'including matters related to my term in office.' It wasn’t immediately clear whether the motion submitted by opposition lawmakers would get the two-thirds majority required for Yoon to be impeached.

Ron DeSantis should his preferred pick drop out. That isn’t to say Hegseth is out of the woods. Multiple Republican senators have said the allegations against him are serious and deserve scrutiny.

Obama calls political ‘divisiveness’ one of the ‘greatest challenges of our time’	CHICAGO — Former President Barack Obama called out divisiveness and polarization as 'one of the greatest challenges of our time,' as he avoided any specific political references in his first public remarks since the election.

'It’s about recognizing that in a democracy, power comes from forging alliances and building coalitions… not only for the woke, but also for the waking,' Obama told the crowd of about 650 participants at the Obama Foundation event on Chicago’s South Side, just a few miles from where Obama’s presidential center is under construction.

Elon Musk was behind mysterious pro-Trump super PAC that invoked Ruth Bader Ginsburg	Elon Musk was the sole funder of a super PAC formed in the final weeks of the election that spent millions on ads claiming Donald Trump’s position on abortion was aligned with that of the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Musk poured $20.5 million into the group on Oct. 24, according to a campaign finance filing submitted to the Federal Election Commission late Thursday. The timing of the donation meant that Musk’s support did not have to be disclosed until after the election. The group, named RBG PAC, spent nearly all of that money on advertising. Its ads claimed that Ginsburg — the liberal longtime justice and staunch women’s rights advocate who died in 2020 — was of 'one mind' with Trump on the issue of abortion.

Ethics Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.) declined to comment on the meeting but said he’d vote against a last-ditch effort by Democrats to force the release of the report. The panel’s top Democrat, Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania, wasn’t at Thursday’s meeting, though Guest brushed off her absence and said 'it’s not uncommon' for members to not be able to attend. Wild expressed frustration with Guest after the panel's last closed-door meeting, saying he had mischaracterized a vote. Guest said the panel would meet again this year.

Former officials urge closed-door Senate hearings on Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s pick for intel chief	Nearly 100 former senior U.S. diplomats and intelligence and national security officials have urged Senate leaders to schedule closed-door hearings to allow for a full review of the government’s files on former Rep.

House GOP opposition signals trouble ahead for Johnson on a spending deal	Speaker Mike Johnson is in talks when his own conference about how to fund the government. But he’s got at least two 'no' votes no matter what he does. Reps. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) and Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), two House Freedom Caucus members, told POLITICO they would oppose any short-term government funding bill, known as a continuing resolution or a CR, regardless of whether Johnson attaches disaster aid to it. The Freedom Caucus took an official position this week that any disaster relief needs to be paid for and limited to what is 'absolutely necessary' right now. President Joe Biden requested nearly $100 billion in emergency disaster aid. 'I have never voted for a CR and I don’t intend on concluding my time here by voting for one now.

GOP lawmakers already divided over sweeping Trump policy bill	Congressional Republicans are clashing over sweeping legislation on taxes, energy and immigration that will be the heart of President-elect Donald Trump’s legislative agenda — underscoring the hurdles ahead as the party tries to unify amid thin margins. Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune sparked heartburn across the Capitol this week when he told GOP senators that the package, which under budget reconciliation rules would allow the GOP to bypass a Democratic filibuster, would be split into two parts. The first would focus on border and energy, with a goal to pass it in the first 30 days of the new Trump administration, and the second on tax.

Former SEC commissioner Atkins picked to lead Wall Street regulator	President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday he will nominate former Wall Street regulator Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, turning to one of Washington’s most influential voices on financial policy to lead the U.S. markets watchdog. Atkins, if confirmed, would be tasked with steering the SEC as it embarks on what is expected to be a new deregulatory age for Wall Street after nearly four years of aggressive rulemaking by the current chair, Gary Gensler. He would also be thrust into a series of policy fights over the $3 trillion cryptocurrency market, artificial intelligence and the cost of raising capital in the U.S. Atkins previously served as an SEC commissioner in the early-to-mid 2000s before launching his consultancy firm, Patomak Global Partners. He played a ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/04/congress/trump-picks-atkins-for-sec-chair-00192600	2024-12-04T10:09:48-08:00	
Trump taps Vance staffer to head DOJ’s antitrust division	President-elect Donald Trump will name his former tech policy aide Gail Slater to head the Justice Department’s antitrust division, he announced on social media Wednesday. Slater is a well-known figure in Washington circles and joined the Senate office of Vice President-elect JD Vance earlier this year as an economic policy adviser. If confirmed by the Senate, Slater will replace Jonathan Kanter and grapple with the various antitrust lawsuits and investigations against the tech industry and other sectors already underway.

Trump taps former Mnuchin aide Faulkender for No. 2 Treasury job	President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday his selection of finance professor Michael Faulkender to be deputy Treasury secretary, where he will play a key role in running the department. Faulkender, who served as chief economist for Treasury during Trump’s first term, now teaches at the University of Maryland’s business school and also serves as chief economist at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute. If confirmed, he would be the No. 2 to hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, who has been tapped for the top job at Treasury. In his previous stint at the department under then-Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Faulkender was responsible for running the Paycheck Protection Program, a massive lending plan rolled out in 2020 to help small businesses weather the pandemic.

Johnson: No Ukraine aid on year-end spending stopgap	Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday shot down the Biden administration’s request to include $24 billion in Ukraine-related aid as part of an expected short-term spending bill Congress needs to pass by Dec. 20. The Office of Management and Budget included the funding request in a list sent to Congress late last month. The new tranche of emergency Pentagon funding would go toward furnishing weapons and equipment for Ukraine and refilling U.S. inventories. But Johnson, asked if he would attach the Ukraine-related money to what is expected to be a spending stopgap into early next year, told reporters: 'I’m not planning to do that.'

New York’s D’Esposito makes play for top DEA role after failed reelection bid	New York GOP Rep. Anthony D’Esposito is making a play for a job in the incoming Trump administration: the next head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. After losing a reelection bid for his competitive Long Island district, D'Esposito is working to consolidate support from regional law enforcement unions, in addition to calling key players in Trump’s orbit, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. 'President Trump has a mandate from the people of this country to Make America Safe Again, and I would be honored to lend my experience as a decorated NYPD Detective and member of the House Homeland Security Committee to assist President Trump in that mission,' D’Esposito said in a statement.

Trump taps former aide Navarro as senior counselor for trade and manufacturing	President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday tapped his once-imprisoned former adviser Peter Navarro to be senior counselor for trade and manufacturing in his next administration. Navarro, 75, who served as director of the White House National Trade Council in Trump’s first administration, spent four months in federal prison earlier this year after being held in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 riot.

Army vet: Daniel Driscoll, an investor and close friend of Vice President-elect JD Vance from Yale Law School, has been tapped to become the next secretary of the Army, Trump announced on social media. Driscoll, an Army veteran with a combat deployment to Iraq under his belt, became close to Vance at Yale before moving back to North Carolina where he has worked as an investor and ran for Congress in an unsuccessful bid in 2020 in which he focused on national security issues.

FEMA officials worry Trump will divert disaster aid to the border	In 2019, then-President Donald Trump took $155 million from the federal government’s main disaster fund and used it to build immigration facilities near the U.S.-Mexico border. Now senior officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency are expressing concern that Trump could again redirect disaster resources after he takes office, but on a much larger scale. That could limit FEMA’s ability to help people and communities after major disasters, they say. 'But I am concerned that could happen, or that FEMA is given tasks to do things that are in support of immigration programs, whether it’s deportation or other aspects of immigration,' the agency's chief of staff, Michael Coen, said in a rare interview.

Trump's transition was supposed to be a show of force. What happened?	Over the last 24 hours, Donald Trump lost his pick to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration. His choice for Defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, is struggling to gain support from Senate Republicans. The president-elect is now even considering his onetime rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis, to lead the Pentagon. And these shake-ups to his not-yet-formed administration come after former Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew from consideration as Trump’s choice for attorney general. All told, the setbacks are raising new questions about Trump’s power over his party, whether Republicans would submit to any and all of his demands — and the expectation that his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, would bring order to Trump’s transition and White House.

Johnson braces for no wiggle room as he works to pass ambitious GOP agenda	House Republicans’ starting majority has now been cemented at 220 votes, with Democratic Rep.-elect Adam Gray formally ousting GOP Rep. John Duarte as of Tuesday night. That’s already an incredibly thin margin, but it’s going to get slimmer. After some of President-elect Donald Trump’s expected nominees leave the House, Speaker Mike Johnson is expected to have literally no wiggle room, right as Republicans embark on an ambitious agenda to pass a sweeping party-line package on energy, immigration and defense policy within the first 30 days of the Trump administration.

Tammy Duckworth is taking the unorthodox step of asking Donald Trump to wade into a legislative debate before he becomes president, urging him to support her proposal to expand coverage for in vitro fertilization for military personnel. Duckworth, who serves on the Armed Services Committee, penned a letter to the president-elect, obtained by POLITICO, encouraging him to endorse provisions in the annual defense policy bill that would expand TRICARE coverage for IVF and other fertility services for military families.

Senate confirms stalled promotion for general involved in Afghanistan withdrawal	The promotion of President Joe Biden’s pick to lead U.S. Army forces in Europe and Africa has cleared the Senate after an unexplained delay. The promotion of Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue — who led the 82nd Airborne Division during the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan — to the rank of four-star general was approved quietly before the Senate adjourned. Donahue's promotion was conspicuously left out of a tranche of hundred of routine military nominees confirmed before the Senate's Thanksgiving recess, indicating a senator was holding up his nomination. Several outlets reported that Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a critic of the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal from...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/02/congress/afghan-withdrawal-fallout-00192282	2024-12-02T17:43:55-08:00	
Trump to attend reopening of Notre Dame in Paris	Donald Trump says he will attend the reopening of Notre Dame in Paris on Saturday. The visit will be his first major outing since winning the election. 'President Emmanuel Macron has done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!' Trump said Monday in a post on Truth Social. The reopening of the cathedral, which was badly damaged in a 2019 fire, will be a major global affair. Heads of state and government from about 50 nations are expected to attend, according to The Associated Press. The restoration of the cathedral, a World Heritage site, was financed by donors from 150 countries and cost nearly 700...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/02/congress/trump-in-paris-00192276	2024-12-02T17:35:52-08:00	
A top GOP senator predicts Trump’s picks will get FBI background checks	An impasse over FBI background checks for Trump's Cabinet nominees will likely be resolved 'in the next few days,' a top Republican told reporters Monday. 'I do think there will be FBI background checks,' said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the ranking GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The comments came amid fears the incoming Trump administration plans to bypass the customary step for top appointees, raising concerns about its vetting of candidates. The potential departure from protocol has sparked a debate about the necessity of reviewing the background of people who would hold high-level positions, with <a href='https://www.politico....	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/02/congress/vetting-trumps-picks-00192265	2024-12-02T16:40:54-08:00	
GOP senators signal they’re open to Patel leading FBI	Few GOP senators are raising early opposition to President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the FBI, Kash Patel. Even Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) — who was outspoken against Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) potentially becoming attorney general — didn’t immediately dismiss Patel on Monday, saying she’d need time to review his profile. 'I don't know Kash Patel,' Collins said. 'I had heard his name, but I don't know his background, and I'm going to have to do a lot of work before reaching a decision on him. In general, I’ve found it's important to review the background check, the committee work and the public hearing.'

Trump to nominate Republican donor to serve as UK ambassador	President-elect Donald Trump has nominated investment banker Warren Stephens to be his ambassador to the United Kingdom. Stephens, a financial backer of Trump’s campaign, would be among at least five other billionaires selected for major roles by the president-elect. 'Warren has always dreamed of serving the United States full time,' Trump said Monday in a Truth Social post. 'I am thrilled that he will now have that opportunity as the top Diplomat, representing the U.S.A. to one of America’s most cherished and beloved Allies.' Stephens donated $1 million to Trump’s campaign over the summer after supporting other Republican presidential candidates, including former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. In 2016, Stephens gave a combined $5.9 million to a pair of s...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/02/congress/choice-for-uk-ambassador-00192248	2024-12-02T15:05:52-08:00	
Congress readies another funding punt ahead of pre-Christmas shutdown deadline	Staring down a government shutdown deadline in less than three weeks, congressional leaders have begun serious negotiations toward a funding patch that punts the deadline into President-elect Donald Trump’s second term. A grand deal on final funding bills is highly unlikely before the Dec. 20 deadline, considering Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have yet to strike a 'toplines' agreement on overall spending totals for the military and non-defense programs. So lawmakers must now ready yet another stopgap that keeps federal agencies running on static funding — after they already punted on spending back in September. Schumer said on the floor Monday that 'both sides are making progress negotiating on a bill that will pass the House and Senate with bipartisan suppo...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/02/congress/government-funding-sprint-00192190	2024-12-02T13:46:03-08:00

Senate Dems set to bump up Klobuchar and Booker in leadership ranks	Sen. Amy Klobuchar is expected to be tapped for Senate Democrats’ No. 3 spot in caucus leadership elections this week, according to two people familiar with the shuffling. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is expected to fill the no. 4 role, which Klobuchar (D-Minn.) currently holds as chair of the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee. The No. 3 spot is currently held by retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who is head of Senate Democrats’ Policy and Communications Committee. Both Booker and Klobuchar — who both ran for president in 2020 and have wide name recognition in the party — had been eyeing the gig, but Booker's apparent acquiescence to instead take the spot one rung lower means the caucus will avoid that intra-party clash. Both roles could still be subject to change as Democrats reorganiz...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/02/congress/senate-democrats-leadership-klobuchar-booker-00192157	2024-12-02T10:31:41-08:00	
Raskin launches challenge for top Judiciary panel Democratic spot	Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) launched a challenge to top House Judiciary Democrat Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) on Monday afternoon in a letter to Democratic colleagues. The bid sets up a generational clash for the leadership of one of the most high-profile congressional panels as Democrats look to build a bulwark against Donald Trump’s presidency. 'After a week consulting most of our Colleagues and engaging in serious introspection about where we are, I am running today to be your Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee in the 119th Congress,' Raskin wrote.

House staffer arrested Monday for entering Capitol complex with ammunition	A House staffer was arrested Monday morning for entering the Cannon House Office Building with ammunition, according to a statement from the US Capitol Police. Capitol Police said the staffer is Michael Hopkins, who is the communications director for Rep. Joe Morelle (D-N.Y.). 'USCP officers noticed what appeared to be ammunition on the x-ray screen. After a hand search of the bag, officers found four ammunition magazines and eleven rounds of ammunition,' the police statement read. 'The staffer told the officers that he forgot the ammunition was in the bag. 38-year-old Michael Hopkins was arrested, and he is facing charges for unlawful possession of ammunition, including one charge for possession of a high-capacity magazine.'

Swalwell tells Trump supporters to ‘sit out’ criticizing Biden pardon	At least one Democrat is responding to President Joe Biden’s Sunday pardon of his son Hunter with a reminder about President-elect Donald Trump: He’s a convicted criminal, too. 'If you defended the 34x felon, who committed sexual assault, stole national security documents, and tried running a coup on his country…you can sit out the Hunter Biden pardon discussion,' Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) posted on X overnight. Other Democrats have stayed mum or defended the president’s decision to give his son a 'full and unconditional' pardon, though Rep. Greg Landsman toed a finer line.

Congress preps for spending sprint amid Biden pardon fallout	Lawmakers are back for the annual legislative end-of-year sprint, in what should be a busy three weeks in the waning days of Joe Biden’s presidency. The most immediate issue: Congress faces a Dec. 20 government funding deadline. While a shutdown isn't atop anyone's holiday wish list, there’s significant disagreement about how long a short-term government funding patch should last into President-elect Donald Trump's new term — and what other priorities, like tens of billions in sought-after disaster aid, might hitch a ride to that bill. With lawmakers now back in Washington post-Thanksgiving, look for some decisions to start being made on the way forward. Some other pressing questions: The Senate returns Monday while the House comes back Tuesday.

How a Trump sign could pave the way to Congress	ALBANY, New York — A 42-year-old boxer in upstate New York is leveraging the 100-foot sign he built to support Donald Trump — and allies like Roger Stone and the president-elect’s son — into a bid to succeed Rep. Elise Stefanik. The man behind the sign, Anthony Constantino, wants Stefanik’s House seat and has been meeting GOP leaders with the power to select a nominee to replace her. Constantino, who founded the printing company Sticker Mule, has ties to the Trump family. He told POLITICO he ate dinner with Donald Trump Jr. earlier this year and visited Mar-a-Lago in November. He’s also received support and unpaid advice from Stone, a longtime Trump ally.

The brief but busy reign of Sen. George Helmy is coming to an end	Sen. George Helmy, a New Jersey Democrat, is making his brief tenure at the Capitol a busy one. Last Monday, Helmy was on the Senate floor to give a complex speech about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The remarks were based on a trip to the Middle East he took during the roughly 12 weeks he’ll be in office after Gov. Phil Murphy picked him to fill disgraced Sen. Bob Menendez’s vacant seat. The next day, a day after walking the tightrope of Middle Eastern politics, Helmy was back to make joint remarks with Sen. Katie Britt, the Alabama Republican.
