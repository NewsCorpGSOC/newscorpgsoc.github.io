Trump vows to ‘love and cherish’ Medicaid — while Republicans plot cuts for savings	President Donald Trump on Friday pledged not to cut Medicaid, save for fraud and abuse — a vow that puts him at odds with Republicans in Congress who hope to use changes to the program to help finance a massive legislative package to enact the president's domestic agenda. Asked about broader spending cuts in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon while signing executive orders, Trump said we’ll 'love and cherish' Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the last of which insures more than 70 million Americans. 'We’re not going to do anything with that, unless we can find some abuse or waste,' Trump said. 'The people won’t be affected. It will only be more effective and better.'

The LA Times’ owner cited his op-ed to boost RFK Jr. He says they got it all wrong.	A writer who recently published an opinion column in the Los Angeles Times that warned of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation as Health and Human Services Secretary says the paper gave the piece a misleading headline and omitted portions of his argument in order to promote Kennedy. The paper’s billionaire owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, posted the piece on social media, which was headlined 'Trump’s healthcare disruption could pay off — if he pushes real reform.' Soon-Shiong added his own commentary as part of a string of pro-Kennedy posts, saying the president’s pick 'is our best chance of doing so.'

DEI not to blame in crash, says top Republican overseeing FAA	Rep. Sam Graves, the Missouri Republican in charge of overseeing the Federal Aviation Administration in the House, said Friday that diversity initiatives at the agency had nothing to do with a crash between a commercial airplane and an Army helicopter that killed 67 people earlier this week. In an interview with POLITICO, Graves, who chairs the House Transportation Committee and is an experienced private pilot who is rated to fly a commercial airplane, said many questions remain about just what caused the crash. He urged allowing investigators to do their work — but said that he doesn't believe DEI initiatives played a role, despite insistence to the contrary from President Donald Trump and some others in t...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/31/congress/dei-not-to-blame-crash-graves-00201777	2025-01-31T10:03:00-08:00	
Cruz: ‘Reasonable inference’ that helicopter pilot in air collision may have looked the wrong way	Sen. Ted Cruz, who leads the panel overseeing the Federal Aviation Administration, said Friday it’s a 'reasonable inference' that the helicopter pilot involved in the deadly collision with a commercial flight earlier this week may have been looking at the wrong plane — though he stressed that nothing has been confirmed. Speaking at length on his podcast about the incident that killed 67 people — and following his Thursday briefing by the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board — the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee chair said that air traffic control asked the helicopter for visual confirmation of the airplane, which the helicopter pilot gave. But instead of going behind the plane as instructed by controllers, it appeared to go in front of it.

Chuck Todd, former ‘Meet the Press’ host, leaving NBC News	Longtime NBC News political reporter Chuck Todd is leaving the network after 18 years, he announced on his podcast Friday morning. 'So look, I’m leaving a bit earlier than we had all originally planned, but there’s a reason for it,' Todd said on his 'Chuck Toddcast,' adding that he had exciting projects that were 'near reality' and would focus on the future of media, 'local in particular.' In his 18 years at NBC, Todd has held various positions, including political director, and eventually helming NBC’s Sunday flagship show 'Meet the Press' from late 2014 until 2023. Todd’s departure comes less than two weeks into Donald Trump’s second term in the White House. The president has routinely mocked the journalist, who at times was critical in his coverage of Trump.

Capitol agenda: Congress ramps up scrutiny on DCA crash	The deadly crash near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is triggering new aviation oversight efforts on Capitol Hill as potential contributing factors draw scrutiny, including whether congressional dysfunction has strained the safety of air travel. Here’s the latest on how Congress is responding to the Wednesday night tragedy at an airport that hundreds of lawmakers use to commute: Committees dig in: Senate Commerce Chair Ted Cruz, who has authority over the FAA and DOT, is pledging to monitor the federal investigation and continue speaking with relevant authorities.

Inside Trump’s first clashes with Congress and the courts	Washington had four years to prepare for a second Trump presidency. But are there signs that the president’s political opponents didn’t do their homework? In his first week in office, President Donald Trump issued a stack of executive orders that went after DEI, the federal workforce, birthright citizenship and more. He fired 18 inspectors general, in defiance of Congressional procedure. And finally, this Monday, his administration shocked the country with OMB memo M-25-13 — the 'spending freeze' that’s made so much news, and that he’s been trying to walk back. Trump is clearly testing the limits of his power. The big questions now are: What is his grand strategy? Where does he think he can win, and where is he just satisfying campaign promises that he believes the courts will strike down?...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/31/trump-clashes-with-congress-courts-00201727	2025-01-31T02:00:15-08:00	https://static.politico.com/52/74/1514bb074bb6912d7a599328a562/trump-11221.jpg
Trump still wants a spending fight with Congress, even after memo debacle	The Trump administration has been spoiling for a legal fight over its power to ignore Congress’s spending laws since the president was last in office. But sending Washington into a tailspin over a poorly written memo was not part of the plan. While the Trump administration intends to ax funding for initiatives it views as out of step with its priorities — like foreign aid, diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and environmental spending — it didn’t mean to blow up funding for a broader suite of programs as it did when the White House budget office on Monday released a memo that brought all federal financial assistance programs to a grinding halt, according to two senior administration officials, granted anonymity to speak about private conversations. The memo appeared to be a brazen and ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/31/trump-spending-fight-congress-memo-00201665	2025-01-31T02:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/73/54/00ad30d544f88f1fe7b9b8069db6/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2196824450

Congressional staffers 'unauthorized' to use DeepSeek	House staffers are being urged not to use the Chinese artificial intelligence program DeepSeek, which has soared in popularity since its recent launch. In a notice to staffers obtained by POLITICO, the House Chief Administrator Officer said it is reviewing the technology, and until then it isn't authorized for official House use. That means staffers can’t install it on 'House-issued devices, including phones, computers and tablets,' and extra precautions have been taken to restrict its functionality on those devices. 'Threat actors are already exploiting DeepSeek to deliver malicious software and infect devices,' reads the CAO notice. DeepSeek’s surprise emergence as an AI success story for China has led to bipartisan calls for a crackdown on sending high-tech microchips to the country.

Chris Wright nomination clears key procedural hurdle	The Senate voted 62-35 on Thursday to invoke cloture on Chris Wright’s nomination to lead the Energy Department. The procedural step sets up a final vote on Wright’s confirmation for early next week. Wright is the CEO of Colorado-based oil field services company Liberty Energy. He would lead a department that maintains the country’s nuclear weapons arsenal and oversees the network of national laboratories. The department was also at the center of the Biden administration’s efforts to dole out funds for domestic manufacturing and clean energy — which is currently undergoing thorough review by the Trump administration.

Senate confirms Burgum as Interior secretary	The Senate easily confirmed Doug Burgum as secretary of the Interior Department Thursday, a job that positions him to act on President Donald Trump’s energy strategy. The 79-18 vote makes the wealthy former North Dakota governor the official in charge of Trump’s 'drill, baby, drill' plans as Interior oversees energy production on public land and in federal waters. Burgum promised in his nomination hearing to open more areas up for production of oil, natural gas and coal and warned that too much emphasis had been placed on renewable energy projects during the Biden administration, a stance that worried some Democrats.

In a first for a Trump nominee, Gabbard gets a not-so-friendly reception from Republicans	Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump’s pick to be director of national intelligence, came into her nomination hearing Thursday ready to parry a volley of attacks from Democrats. But they weren’t the only ones asking the tough questions. A number of Republicans seemed skeptical about Gabbard’s answers to questions about NSA contractor Edward Snowden and a controversial surveillance program. They also prodded her about her previous statements on Russia, Syria and Ukraine. It was a marked difference from the hearing of now-Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth two weeks ago, in which Republicans heaped praise on the nominee and defended him from Democrats’ attacks.

Anti-abortion groups like what they heard from RFK Jr.	Anti-abortion groups were nervous when President Donald Trump tapped former Democrat and onetime abortion-rights supporter Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to run the nation’s health agencies. After two days of hearings, many now feel confident he will carry out their agenda. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said Thursday the group will not score Kennedy’s confirmation vote — either at the committee or floor level. And its leaders said they are 'encouraged' by promises Kennedy made to hire anti-abortion staff at HHS, scrutinize regulations around abortion pills, halt support for medical research using fetal tissue and cut funding to organizations that provide or refer for the procedure.

Tragedy hits home for Reagan National’s powerful frequent flyers	America’s worst air disaster in a generation happened at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and its powerful frequent flyers are watching the aftermath intently. Members of Congress have an intimate relationship with the airport, which is a 10-minute drive from Capitol Hill and is used by hundreds of lawmakers as a commuter hub.

Bill Cassidy offered RFK Jr. an out. He didn't take it.	Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s bid to lead the Department of Health and Human Services could come down to one senator. That senator, Bill Cassidy (R-La.), said he was deeply torn about his vote during a hearing of the Senate committee in charge of health policy on Thursday. Cassidy, the panel’s chair and a gastroenterologist before entering politics, spoke of his own experience with life-saving vaccines and repeatedly asked Kennedy to disavow his past anti-vaccine advocacy. Kennedy said he’d review the evidence and 'apologize for any statement that misled people' if proven wrong, but also indicated he didn’t think he was wrong when he spent years linking vaccines to rising autism and chaired an anti-vaccine advoca...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/08/congress/bill-cassidy-offered-rfk-jr-an-out-he-didnt-take-it-00201618	2025-01-30T11:59:28-08:00

Senate Intelligence Committee ranking member Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and other panel Democrats condemned Gabbard during her confirmation hearing for sympathizing with Snowden, an intelligence contractor who leaked numerous highly classified programs in 2013 and then fled to Russia.

Trump's FBI pick dodges on 2020 election results	Kash Patel, Donald Trump’s nominee to run the FBI, repeatedly refused to say that Joe Biden won the 2020 election — following similar refusals by Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, Pam Bondi. 'What’s so hard about saying Biden won the 2020 election?' said Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee convening Patel's confirmation hearing Thursday. 'President Biden was certified and sworn in. I don’t know how else to say it,' Patel said. 'The other way to say it is, he won,' Welch replied. 'I can say Trump won. I didn’t vote for him, but he won … You’re so skillful. You understand what I’m asking. Can you say the words, ‘Joe Biden won?’' 'Joe Biden was the president of the United States,' Patel replied.

Patel, in late 2022, initially pleaded the fifth when called to appear but was later compelled to testify after the Justice Department granted him testimonial immunity. 'I did not commit a crime,' Patel said under questioning from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) during his confirmation hearing. 'I utilized my constitutional rights during that process with the advice and consent of counsel.' Patel’s lawyer at the time, Stanley Woodward, was among the attorneys Trump tapped to join the White House as a senior adviser.

The panel voted 11-0 to move Vought’s nomination to the floor – a vote made up entirely of Republicans, as Democrats less than an hour before the scheduled markup announced they would be boycotting the meeting. Instead of attending the markup, Democratic senators gathered at a press conference elsewhere in the Capitol to deride Vought as 'dangerously unfit.'

Kash Patel says warrant requirement for Section 702 searches isn’t practical	Get a warrant' has become a battle cry for many conservative and liberal critics of federal government surveillance programs — but President Donald Trump’s pick for FBI director said Thursday he opposes such a requirement. 'Having a warrant requirement to go through that information in real time is just not comported with the requirement to protect American citizens,' Kash Patel said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. 'It’s almost impossible to make that function and serve the national, no-fail mission.' The U.S. government uses a provision called Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to collect a vast amount data from social media sites, email platforms and other companies.

Democrats to boycott committee vote on OMB nominee	Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee say they will boycott Thursday’s scheduled vote on Russ Vought’s nomination to lead the Office of Management and Budget. It won't affect the panel's ability to send Vought's nomination to the Senate floor, as Budget Committee rules only require 11 members to be present and voting, according to a committee aide for Republicans. But Democrats are nonetheless sending a strong message about their displeasure with the Trump administration's decision to freeze federal funding across the government — and fears that Vought, who led OMB during President Donald Trump's first term, will be a cheerleader in that effort.

He added that 'I have always advocated for imprisoning those' who cause 'harm to our law enforcement and civilian communities.'

Organizers said the nonprofit group, Families Over Billionaires, will be backed by an eight-figure funding campaign, which will include advertising, rapid response and surrogate operations. They said the campaign will serve as a centralized war room to attack Trump and Republicans during the looming tax debate in Congress. The details of the group were shared first with POLITICO.

Senate’s reconciliation blueprint is ready to go, Thune says	Down in Florida on Wednesday, House Republicans tried to coalesce around a plan to pass 'one big, beautiful bill.' Meanwhile, up in Washington, Senate Republicans are ready to go with their own Plan B. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in an interview that 'text is ready' for a budget blueprint that would tee up a two-bill approach to the GOP’s ambitious border, energy and tax agenda.

Democrats prep for Patel in the hot seat	Kash Patel, President Donald Trump’s controversial pick for FBI director, will have his day before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday — and Senate Democrats have been battle-testing their message in hopes it might break through. It started a few weeks ago, when Democrats turned attorney general nominee Pam Bondi’s confirmation hearing into a practice round for Patel’s grilling. There, Democrats brought up the FBI nominee repeatedly, asking Bondi to respond to a variety of incendiary statements Patel had made over the years, including about his plans to go after members of the 'Executive Branch Deep State.' Now, it’s Patel’s turn in the hot seat. 'There's immense am...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/29/congress/kash-patel-fbi-confirmation-trump-00201410	2025-01-29T15:13:15-08:00	
Senate tees up Burgum for confirmation vote for Interior	The Senate voted 78-20 Wednesday to invoke cloture on the nomination of former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to lead the Interior Department. The Senate is expected to vote tomorrow whether to confirm Burgum's nomination. It would put the former governor in the department's top chair as the Trump administration is pushing for spending freezes that would halt Interior's payments to tribal communities and certain energy programs. A federal judge blocked the freeze until 5 p.m. Feb. 3 and two dozen states have filed their own lawsuit to stop the move.

Republicans brace for a messy slog on Capitol Hill	DORAL, Florida — House Republicans came here to President Donald Trump’s resort to map out what’s ahead for their legislative agenda. The big takeaway: It’s looking treacherous. Despite progress on the stated goal of the three-day retreat — coalescing around a fiscal blueprint for their vast party-line agenda — what they saw wasn’t pretty: Key strategic disputes continued to fester inside the GOP ranks, and the uproar from Trump’s federal spending freeze gave vulnerable members a taste of the backlash that could result if they follow through on promised cuts to key programs.

Senate confirms Zeldin to head EPA	Lee Zeldin, the former Republican congressmember who leveraged his full-throated defense of President Donald Trump into a position in his inner circle and ultimately his Cabinet, was confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday to be the 17th administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency by a 56-42 vote. Zeldin has a mandate from Trump to carry out an aggressive deregulatory agenda aimed at boosting domestic energy production and bolstering the increasingly power-hungry data center and artificial intelligence sectors.

Billionaire Howard Lutnick, the pick to lead the Commerce Department, had his turn on Wednesday. Democratic senators on the typically bipartisan Committee on Commerce, Science and Technology had a nearly singular focus on the issue, asking Lutnick if he’d obey orders that defy the law. The freeze caused widespread backlash and was seemingly rescinded by the White House during Lutnick’s confirmation hearing. Sen.

Jack Schlossberg launches hours-long X rant during RFK Jr.’s confirmation hearing	We’re hours into Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s hearing now, and there’s one person who is ALL over it online: Jack Schlossberg. Schlossberg, the chronically online sensation and the only grandson of former president John F. Kennedy, has some choice words on his cousin’s Senate hearing, sharing MSNBC videos and adding his own commentary. Schlossberg and Kennedy have butted heads on politics before. (Schlossberg is notably more liberal-leaning than the would-be secretary of Health and Human Services.) In all caps, Schlossberg is responding in real time to Kennedy's views on abortion and chronic diseases, and is calling out Kennedy for being a 'liar' and a 'guru shaman figure' who runs a cult.

When Kennedy said he was not opposed to vaccines, a woman in the hearing room stood up and screamed 'You lie … do no harm,' before she was removed.

The effort culminated Monday night with a budget office memo freezing 'all federal financial assistance' pending a review by administration political appointees.

'This is a very responsible measure.' Leavitt insisted that the freeze would not affect federal assistance that goes directly to individuals, such as Social Security benefits and food aid. But she would not directly answer whether other social service programs that serve people indirectly — such as Meals on Wheels and Medicaid — would be affected. She dismissed reports of widespread confu...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/28/trump-omb-funding-cuts-00200998	2025-01-28T11:07:28-08:00	http://vod.politico.com/media/v1/pmp4/static/clear/1155968404/80961acc-ea05-4b2a-84d4-9f39ab5069c6/7c00da0f-9cd2-4a4c-87c3-75235e38c375/main.mp4
Jim Acosta, prominent Trump critic, leaves CNN	Longtime reporter and anchor Jim Acosta is exiting CNN — but not before warning viewers about navigating the news during the second Trump administration. The 'CNN Newsroom' anchor announced on his show Tuesday that he would be leaving. On air, he reflected on what he viewed as the highlight of his time at CNN: questioning the Castro regime on Cuba's political prisoners, during former President Barack Obama’s visit in 2016. The son of a Cuban refugee, Acosta said he learned an important lesson: 'It is never a good time to bow down to a tyrant.' Acosta, a CNN veteran of 18 years, was the network’s chief White House correspondent during the first Trump administration. He often sparred with President Donald Trump during his first term, and said he was grateful to the network and to all the peo...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/28/jim-acosta-leave-cnn-007255	2025-01-28T10:31:43-08:00	https://static.politico.com/2b/ae/9ffaad0c4cd69799f80a4e4c9f38/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1045098554
Man charged with carrying Molotov cocktails into the Capitol was targeting Johnson, Hegseth, Bessent	A man who was arrested Monday after allegedly bringing Molotov cocktails to the Capitol told police that he intended to kill Speaker Mike Johnson, Pete Hegseth and Scott Bessent, federal prosecutors said in court filings.

Emmer cheers Trump's federal aid freeze	DORAL, Florida — The No. 3 House Republican applauded Donald Trump's sweeping move to freeze federal aid Tuesday morning, calling it a step to shake up the status quo. Whip Tom Emmer said in a brief interview on the sidelines of the House GOP retreat that Trump's move — scheduled to take effect at 5 p.m. — signals he's 'doing exactly what he was elected to do.' 'You're going to see things like this, and your first reaction is going to be, 'Well, this isn't the way it's been done,'' Emmer said.

Hegseth will be Defense secretary. Here's how he plans to upend the Pentagon.	The Senate on Friday confirmed Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary, a triumphant moment for the former Fox News host who overcame allegations of sexual misconduct, alcohol abuse and inexperience to attain one of the country’s most crucial positions. Republicans largely rebuffed those accusations and approved Hegseth with the help of Vice President JD Vance, who broke a rare 50-50 tie, in the first big nomination fight for President Donald Trump’s Cabinet. Hegseth’s confirmation could smooth the way for other controversial Trump administration picks. He will enter the Pentagon with a stated desire — and a mandate from the president — to upend traditional practices, from the role of top generals to where U.S. forces are stationed overseas.

Florida Republican says deportation effort should spare some migrants	A South Florida Republican is urging President Donald Trump to spare hundreds of thousands of people from Latin America and the Caribbean from his immigration crackdown. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar called on the Department of Homeland Security in a letter Friday not to remove people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who were allowed to enter the U.S. by President Joe Biden’s administration under a humanitarian parole program. 'Although President Biden originally created this program on dubious legal grounds and brought individuals here without a plan for their future, they were still enrolled under programs offered to them.

One thing is certain — they’ll have a raft of meetings to attend, if they choose.

Not gonna fly:' Senate Republicans cool on recess appointments	Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) pitched Senate Republicans on Friday about allowing President Donald Trump to make recess appointments. By his own admission, it didn’t gain traction. Johnson made his case to his Senate GOP colleagues during a closed-door lunch meeting as the chamber is staring down the possibility of a rare weekend session as it slogs through Trump’s Cabinet picks amid Democratic slow-walking. Asked afterward if his colleagues were interested in the idea, Johnson said, 'No, not at this point in time.' Johnson added that, 'if we can grind through this process,' Republicans can get close to reaching the pace of confirmations during the Obama years and his Senate GOP colleagues would be 'OK just maintaining the process' rather than allowing recess appointments.

Lutnick also formally reiterated his promise to resign from his position at his financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald and divest from a variety of business interests if he’s confirmed, according to the ethics agreement.

House Democrats worry a repeat loser will ruin their chances in a Michigan battleground	Some Democrats are worried the third time will not be the charm for a failed congressional candidate. Carl Marlinga, a septuagenarian former judge and attorney, is telling Michigan Democrats that he plans to run again against GOP Rep. John James, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations who were granted anonymity to reveal private discussions. That's sparked concerns among Democrats in Michigan and in Washington who believe he will once again tank their chances in the crucial battleground district. Marlinga ran in the 2022 midterms, coming within a fraction of a point of besting James in what was then a newly created southeastern Michigan seat. He tried again two years later and lost by 6 points. (He also ran in 2002.)

Trump ‘very surprised’ at Collins, Murkowski over Hegseth vote	President Donald Trump took notice on Friday of two old sparring partners — Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who voted against advancing Pete Hegseth’s Defense secretary nomination Thursday. 'I was very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that,' Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Friday. The two moderate Republicans vote with their party most of the time, but came under intense scrutiny during the first Trump administration because of their willingness to break ranks on some high-profile votes, including Cabinet and judicial nominees and a high-stakes GOP health care plan.

Capitol agenda: Spending heats up, Hegseth up in the Senate, House GOP retreat	Democrats are widely opposed to pairing the debt limit and wildfire aid — two key parts of a spending proposal GOP leaders are circling behind closed doors. But unless Democrats are willing to flirt with a government shutdown or a potential debt default, they’re likely stuck with the deal, or one similar to it. One House Democrat says his party isn’t willing to make those threats. 'The one thing that has united Democrats, in my entire career here, is a commitment to do what's necessary to govern, to keep the government open and to work to improve the lives of the people we all represent, whether that's lowering costs or helping them in a time of crisis,' said Rep.

Bipartisan funding negotiations begin in Congress ahead of March shutdown cliff	Republican funding leaders have made an opening offer to Democrats as the two parties launch negotiations toward a deal to fund the government before the mid-March shutdown deadline. Congress’ top appropriators gathered privately Thursday evening in the Capitol for an hour-long 'four corners' meeting — the first concrete step toward a bipartisan funding agreement as Republican leaders begin to embrace the idea of a cross-party accord that funds the government and raises the debt limit, while also potentially boosting disaster aid and border security funding. The beginning of negotiations follows months of inaction on a bipartisan government funding plan, after lawmakers first pun...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/23/bipartisan-funding-negotiations-begin-in-congress-ahead-of-march-shutdown-cliff-00200393	2025-01-23T16:41:30-08:00	https://static.politico.com/b6/d9/2378f2c24e2e8cc99b6daf498116/congress-budget-29447.jpg
E&C Chair Guthrie talks TikTok, AI, privacy	House Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie said Thursday he's in favor of President Donald Trump’s decision to extend the deadline for TikTok to divest from Chinese ownership. 'Giving him a window of opportunity to make significant progress — I support that,' said the Kentucky Republican in his first public comments on Trump’s actions. 'I also understand the confines that we have in the law.' Guthrie’s comments are notable in that his panel, then chaired by retired Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), led the charge last year to pass legislation, 50-0, to force TikTok to find a new buyer by a certain deadline or shut down. The bill included language allowing for a 90-day extension if 'significant progr...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/23/congress/e-c-chair-guthrie-talks-tiktok-ai-privacy-00200367	2025-01-23T16:20:00-08:00	
Congress finds Trump's TikTok sale scheme confusing, possibly illegal	Members of Congress are declaring themselves bewildered by Donald Trump’s latest proposal to save TikTok by brokering a joint-ownership deal. 'I don’t know what he means by that,' said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), of Trump’s suggestion to broker a 'joint venture' in which 'the U.S. should be entitled to get half of TikTok.' 'I don't understand what the president is doing,' said Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Trump has promised to hash out a deal to keep TikTok in business, despite a law that ordered its parent company to divest by last Sunday. His solution is a split-ownership arrangement that may involve the U.S. itself owning a share of the company.

The former vice president established an LLC called Pioneer49 last month in her home state of California, according to her presidential campaign's final financial disclosure that was filed last week and confirmed by a person familiar with the organization's plans. The disclosure form described the organization as an 'entity to assist the former vice president' and is likely to help fuel Harris’ next political move.

Two Republicans, Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine also came out in opposition to Hegseth.

Senate confirms Ratcliffe as new CIA director	The Senate voted by a wide margin Thursday to confirm John Ratcliffe as the next CIA director. The former Republican congressman and director of national intelligence was confirmed by a 74-25 vote. He faced only modest resistance from Senate Democrats, who had stalled Ratcliffe's nomination for days over concerns that he would politicize the agency’s work — as President Donald Trump has called for overhauls in the nation’s intelligence community. Ratcliffe is only the second Trump Cabinet nominee to get confirmed since the new president was sworn in Monday, as Republicans have prioritized national security picks. Democrats have resisted attempts to speed up the process, only greenlighting former Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) as secretary of State on Monday.

Tulsi Gabbard gets Jan. 30 Intelligence hearing	The Senate Intelligence Committee will hold a hearing on Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination to be director of national intelligence on Thursday, Jan. 30. Gabbard is one of President Donald Trump’s most controversial nominees — with open speculation over whether she can be confirmed. At least two Republican members of the Intelligence Committee remain on the fence, raising the prospect that she could be at risk of not even advancing out of the panel. Republicans are watching closely to see how she does in the hearing, as well as a closed-door session that will immediately follow the public grilling.

Senate panel advances Turner for HUD on party-line vote	The Senate Banking Committee voted 13-11, along party lines, on Thursday to advance Scott Turner’s nomination to be secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, with Democrats voting no over concerns about Turner’s unfinished FBI background check. If confirmed by the full Senate, the NFL veteran and former developer would run a department with a $70 billion budget and roughly 8,000 employees at a time when housing has risen to the forefront politically after costs soared in the wake of the pandemic. Turner told the committee during his confirmation hearing last week that 'HUD is failing at its most basic mission,' pointing to the high cost of housing and a recent surge in homelessness.

Senior Republicans have been privately mulling a bipartisan government funding deal for weeks now, wary that they may not be able to add a debt-limit hike to their party-line reconciliation package given internal GOP divisions over the matter.

New York, New Jersey and California Republicans made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago recently to reiterate their demands to lift the so-called SALT cap, which limits the deduction to $10,000, in negotiations over a large tax bill. The lawmakers say the cap is harming constituents in their politically competitive, high-tax districts. Their votes will be crucial to passing a major tax bill GOP lawmakers are assembling.	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/22/trump-meeting-salt-republicans-00199887	2025-01-22T07:10:23-08:00	https://static.politico.com/2d/65/1907ddc94886b7ffb26097cbb6f8/0t1a0511.jpg
NRCC chief digs in for midterms: ’The math is in our favor’	NRCC Chair Richard Hudson on Wednesday tried to rally House Republicans ahead of their tough battle to keep their majority in the upcoming midterms, with many GOP lawmakers wary they’ll lose a swath of seats in 2026. 'The math is in our favor. We’re on offense,' Hudson told House Republicans during their closed-door meeting Wednesday morning at the Capitol Hill Club, according to two people in the room. He did acknowledge a big challenge will be turning out Trump voters who are less engaged in nonpresidential election years, the people said. The current House Republican majority is razor-thin after GOP candidates won fewer seats than many expected last year despite President Donald Trump’s win.

Capitol agenda: Spending totals, nominees, immigration bill	Donald Trump, Mike Johnson and John Thune’s big meeting didn't do anything to settle Republicans’ mounting legislative headaches. But GOP leaders are indicating they’re going to move forward on at least one area. They’re nearing agreement on government funding totals and hope to finalize a number and inform impatient members in the coming days, according to two people granted anonymity to speak freely about the behind-the-scenes talks. That’s a good sign for appropriators, who reiterated Tuesday night that they want some clearer answers on the spending bills — as soon as this morning’s private House GOP conference meeting.

The Reluctant Steamroller in the White House	Just hours into his second presidency, Donald Trump was already bulldozing congressional Republicans. He granted clemency to some 1,500 Jan. 6 offenders, some of them convicted of violent assaults. He flouted a bipartisan TikTok ban, ordering it to remain unenforced. And he moved to cancel some of his predecessor’s energy programs over the pleadings of some in the GOP who wanted him to wait — to name just a few of the ways he undercut members of his own party. A day later, it was as if a switch had been flipped. In a meeting Tuesday with top GOP leaders, he didn’t move to settle key strategic disputes over raising the debt limit and passing the party’s big domestic policy package.

Jules Feiffer, Pulitzer-winning cartoonist and writer known for lacerating wit, dies at 95	NEW YORK — Jules Feiffer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist and writer whose prolific output ranged from a long-running comic strip to plays, screenplays and children’s books, died Friday. He was 95 and, true to his seemingly tireless form, published his last book just four months ago. Feiffer’s wife, writer JZ Holden, said Tuesday that he died of congestive heart failure at their home in Richfield Springs, New York, and was surrounded by friends, the couple’s two cats and his recent artwork. Holden said her husband had been ill for a couple of years, 'but he was sharp and strong up until the very end. And funny.' Artistically limber, Feiffer hopscotched among numerous forms of expression, chronicling the curiosity of childhood, urban angst and other societal currents.

Key committee to receive briefing on Trump’s TikTok order	Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee who led the effort to pass legislation banning TikTok last year will soon be formally briefed on President Donald Trump’s executive order to give the company a reprieve. The member briefing, confirmed in an interview by a committee Republican granted anonymity to share details of the upcoming private meeting, comes as GOP members of the panel grapple with how to respond to the president’s latest curveball.

Democrats plot strategy for fighting Trump on funding freeze	Less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump’s Day One blitz of executive actions, Democrats on Capitol Hill mobilized Tuesday to fight his move to freeze a broad range of federal cash. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and other top House Democrats held a private call on Tuesday with more than 100 people, including leaders of outside groups, to discuss government funding strategy and how to stop Trump from violating so-called impoundment law by usurping Congress’ 'power of the purse,' according to three people familiar with the call.

Judiciary Committee eyes next week for FBI nominee's confirmation hearing	The Senate Judiciary Committee intends to hold a confirmation hearing for President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the FBI, Kash Patel, on Jan. 29, committee ranking member Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters on Tuesday. If that date stands, it would coincide with the panel's scheduled vote the same day to report out the nomination of Pam Bondi, Trump's selection for attorney general. Durbin, along with Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), said he has now received Patel’s background investigation materials, which are required for every Cabinet nomination in advance of a confirmation hearing. Durbin emphasized, however, that he would not be supporting Patel’s confirmation, pointing to the 'trail of grievances' in his book 'Government Gangsters,' which the senator said he read before meeting with Pat...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/21/congress/kash-patel-confirmation-trump-00199795	2025-01-21T14:43:29-08:00

Trump pushes Hill GOP on recess appointments, debt limit	President Donald Trump prodded congressional leaders to consider recess appointments for his top nominees and expressed interest in trading California wildfire aid for a debt limit increase in a White House meeting Tuesday — resurfacing two controversial proposals floated during the returning president’s transition. The discussions, which were described by two people granted anonymity to describe the private talks, also touched on his proposal to exempt at least some tip income from federal taxes and his efforts more generally to extend tax cuts.

The Senate readies for a nominee siege	Democrats let Secretary of State Marco Rubio blitz to Senate confirmation Monday. Now it’s time for trench warfare. With Donald Trump’s nominees slowly emerging from Senate committees, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are preparing for a weekslong slog as Democrats force Republicans to work through procedural obstacles to fill out the new president’s Cabinet. CIA director pick John Ratcliffe is expected to get a relatively smooth bipartisan confirmation on Tuesday. But after that, more controversial nominees await, and cooperation could be hard to come by. Accelerating any confirmation will require unanimous agreement from senators, and after letting Rubio through, Democrats are not eager to ease the way for many other Trump picks.

A running list of Trump's planned executive orders, actions, proclamations and legislation	Donald Trump is promising a 'golden age of America' in his second term, and he’s issuing a raft of executive orders to try and make it happen. The president signed a slew of orders and directives that aim to end birthright citizenship and crack down on illegal crossings at the southern border, increase domestic energy production and transform a federal government he views as both too bloated and too 'woke.' It’s unclear which of Trump’s executive actions will have immediate impact or are merely symbolic. But they’re already facing challenges. The Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency drew lawsuits hours before Trump signed the paperwork to create it.

'I’m disappointed to see that and I do fear the message that is sent to these brave men and women that stood by us,' said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) echoed that sentiment, saying there was a difference between those 'caught up in the crowd who did not commit a violent act' and those who committed violent crimes, like destroying property or assaulting officers, who should not be pardoned.

Stefanik paints a grim picture of a UN she wants to reform	Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), President Donald Trump’s nominee to represent the U.S. at the United Nations, on Tuesday painted the international organization as a body beset by bias against Israel, nefarious Chinese influence and ineffective peacekeeping efforts. But she argued the U.N. isn’t irredeemable and pledged that she’d help usher 'strong American leadership' at the multilateral body. Before a generally cordial panel of senators on the Foreign Relations Committee, the New York Republican said Washington could still thwart growing Chinese influence on the international stage by increasing its presence at the global forum.

But he appeared to reference other Trump officials like Vice President JD Vance who suggested violent offenders wouldn’t receive blanket pardons but would instead be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 'The idea is that peaceful protesters should not be detained and anybody who committed violent offenses — that was something they talked about,' Johnson said, trailing off. 'I haven't seen the list.

Trump: ‘We don’t need’ Latin America	President Donald Trump issued a stark message Monday to would-be economic and strategic partners in Latin America: The U.S. doesn’t need you. Speaking from the Oval Office after signing a spate of executive orders, Trump was asked about relations with Latin America and Brazil and said the relationship 'should be great.' But he made it clear who needs who more in the relationship. 'They need us much more than we need them. We don't need them,' he said. 'They need us. Everybody needs us.'

Rubio experienced a relatively easy and trouble-free confirmation process. The third-term Florida lawmaker was the top Republican member of the selective Senate Intelligence Committee and served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Trump promised the crowd in the inauguration’s 'overflow room' in the Capitol Visitors Center, following his formal inaugural remarks in the Rotunda: 'You’re going to see a lot of action on J6 hostages.' He has floated pardoning the rioters, many of whom are facing formal criminal charges.

And when it comes to the heart of Trump’s agenda — a sprawling party-line effort encompassing border, energy and tax policy — key strategic questions remain in flux.

Why Trump supporters see sunshine in Trump’s dark and foreboding speeches	The first time Donald Trump gave an inaugural address, official Washington winced. It was a scorching and dystopian assessment of what he cast as a country in ruins — this 'American carnage,' Trump said. And it was, as George W. Bush reportedly called it, 'some weird shit.' But that’s not how much of Trump’s MAGA base remembers it. Like Trump, they, too, saw a hollowed-out nation in 2017. But what Trump’s supporters mostly recalled in the president-elect — and the repeat performance they are preparing for on Monday — is redemption.

‘Not enough room’: Lawmakers fret about indoor inauguration	The last-minute move to bring President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration indoors could leave some members of Congress out in the cold. Perhaps not literally: No one is expected to be seated outside in 25-degree bluster. But the possibility that not all lawmakers might get seats in the Rotunda for the oath-of-office ceremony has cast a chill over the occasion in some congressional offices, according to four lawmakers and aides. 'Simply put, there’s not enough room,' one senior Republican aide said. 'It’s a shitshow.' The initial guidance from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies after Trump’s team decided to move things indoors on Friday was that 't...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/19/trump-inauguration-rotunda-congress-004800	2025-01-19T13:43:05-08:00	https://static.politico.com/57/15/f0dca855496ab92debba3ab5e268/inauguration-57288.jpg
Tim Kaine explains strategy on Pete Hegseth	Sen. Tim Kaine said he pushed Defense Secretary-nominee Pete Hegseth about infidelity and sexual misconduct in a hearing last week because he believed it was the only way to get Republicans to consider voting against him. Speaking Sunday on CBS' 'Face the Nation,' Kaine (D-Va.) said: 'My observation of my Republican colleagues is the only reason they ever vote no on a nominee is either a belief of gross incompetence in terms of qualifications or serious character deficit.' As an example, Kaine cited the case of then-Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), whose chances to be President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general were quickly scuttled by personal scandal. In Hegseth's Senate h...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/19/tim-kaine-strategy-pete-hegseth-00199180	2025-01-19T11:03:16-08:00	https://static.politico.com/53/cf/2ef59fe24bb89fc0429f3f8d3c34/hegseth-confirmation-60552.jpg

Trump says he will ‘probably’ travel to California next week after LA fires	President-elect Donald Trump will 'probably' travel to Southern California next week, he told NBC News, making the likely first trip of his second term to the liberal stronghold still reeling from some of the worst wildfires in its history. In a wide-ranging phone interview on Saturday with 'Meet the Press' moderator Kristen Welker, Trump said he 'was going to go, actually yesterday,' to the Golden State, but decided 'it would be better if I went as president.' The wildfires have been raging in and around Los Angeles since Jan. 7, killing dozens and forcing tens of thousands to evacuate, <a href='https://apnews.com/article/los-angeles-wildfires-southe...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/18/trump-california-fires-gavin-newsom-00199161	2025-01-18T13:26:06-08:00	https://static.politico.com/1c/fe/af9b60a2466dbceef43043c29eb0/181117-newsom-trump-states-ap-489.jpg
Trump hires fed-firing mastermind	President-elect Donald Trump is bringing back a senior White House official who led his first-term push to make it easier to fire civil servants. James Sherk, who served as a special assistant on domestic policy during Trump’s first term, will return to serve in the White House Domestic Policy Council, Trump announced Saturday. Sherk has worked at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute during the Biden administration. Sherk was central to the Trump administration’s efforts to make it easier to fire some federal employees using a classification called Schedule F. That effort generated an outcry from civil servants, and the Biden administration moved quickly to reverse course. But the effort 'could — and should — be reissued by another president,' Sherk wrote in a 2022 Wall Stre...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/18/trump-hires-fed-firing-mastermind-00199154	2025-01-18T11:36:44-08:00	https://static.politico.com/76/68/ac5fbe53477a92f06e69e390f343/1594391562082.jpg
