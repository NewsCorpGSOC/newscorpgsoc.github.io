Taiwan’s former president says Ukraine needs US weapons more urgently than Taipei	Tsai Ing-wen’s comments come after a top U.S. military leader said supplying U.S. weapons to Kyiv was cutting into stockpiles that could be used in a war in Asia.	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/23/taiwans-former-president-says-ukraine-needs-u-s-weapons-more-urgently-than-taipei-00191400	2024-11-23T15:46:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/1c/69/b688c5d84436a6634d61a1a2a1da/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1727318512
After a Friday night flurry, Trump’s Cabinet is complete	At 6:52 p.m. on Friday, President-elect Donald Trump announced his choice for Treasury secretary. Minutes later, he tapped a director for the Office of Management and Budget. Then came his picks for Labor secretary, deputy national security adviser and surgeon general. The evening flurry lasted just over an hour, and in that time Trump announced nine high-ranking administration officials. And on Saturday afternoon, Trump announced Brooke Rollins as his pick for agriculture secretary, rounding out the core roles in his Cabinet with the spate o...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/23/trump-cabinet-00191395	2024-11-23T14:56:12-08:00	https://static.politico.com/2f/db/ee96f56b4321aaa454b525f4ec08/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2183216841
What the Gaetz episode says about Trump’s attempts to control Congress	Donald Trump is making it clear he wants to bend the Republican-led Congress to his will, pushing the limits of what lawmakers will accept on staffing his Cabinet and also on looming questions of federal spending authority. Round one in that fight — the Matt Gaetz saga — went to Senate Republicans. And it gives early hints of how GOP lawmakers may respond on spending and other controversial nominees. 'The Senate also has a responsibility for advice and consent — and in this particular case, I think there was advice offered, rather than consent,' Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said shortly after Gaetz announced he was withdrawing his name from consideration for attorney general. In that tumultuous episode, GOP ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/23/gaetz-trump-attempt-control-congress-00191343	2024-11-23T13:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/dc/40/b18bbc7b4881a96d44da1c15dc69/trump-47824.jpg

Blue states race to stymie Trump's mass deportation plans	Democratic attorneys general are preparing a raft of legal actions to prevent Donald Trump from carrying out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, setting the stage for a series of showdowns over one of his central campaign pledges. In interviews with POLITICO, six leading blue-state prosecutors said they are girding to take Trump to court over misusing military troops on domestic soil, attempting to commandeer local or state law enforcement to do the job of the federal government and denying people’s constitutional right to due process. The attorneys general also said they would move to challenge Trump if he tries to federalize the National Guard — or attempts to direct active-duty military units or National Guard troops from red states into blue states.

Ernst to head new Senate DOGE Caucus	President-elect Donald Trump’s big plan to have Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy shape federal cost cutting has a new partnership with the Senate. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) will take charge of a new Senate DOGE Caucus, which will work with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Musk and Ramaswamy.

Florida sets special election to fill Matt Gaetz vacancy on April Fool’s day	MIAMI — Florida will conduct a special election on April 1, 2025, to fill the House seat vacated by Matt Gaetz, kicking off a sprint among Florida Republicans to represent the deep-red district. Gaetz resigned from Congress after President-elect Donald Trump said he planned to appoint him as attorney general.

She’ll be replacing Rep. Dean Phillips, who is retiring after serving two terms in the House and mounting a primary challenge to Joe Biden last year. Key issues: In the statehouse, under Gov.

Robinhood's Dan Gallagher bows out of contention for SEC chair	Former Wall Street regulator and Robinhood Chief Legal Officer Dan Gallagher said Friday he is not interested in taking over as SEC chair under President-elect Donald Trump. Gallagher, who previously served at the SEC as a commissioner, was widely seen in Washington and on Wall Street as a leading contender to take over the top U.S. financial markets regulator under Trump. 'It is always an honor to have your name in the mix for an incredibly important job like SEC Chairman.

Democrats find hope in state legislative races	As Democrats regroup after the 2024 election, some are finding cautious optimism in an unlikely place: state legislatures. While the party faced disappointing results such as losing the Michigan state House, it did not face the kind of devastating wreckage down-ballot that often accompanies other national elections. The state legislative results were far from a triumph for Democrats. But they stand apart from the presidential race, in which Vice President Kamala Harris lost every single swing state — including states where Democrats made gains in state government or preserved their majorities. Democrats held onto a one-seat majority in the Pennsylvania House, flipped 14 seats in Wisconsin under new electoral maps, and broke the GOP supermajority in North Carolina, giving weight to Democrat...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/22/democrat-state-legislature-races-00191073	2024-11-22T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/e6/d2/999468324bb98b1a765d2c89208e/election-2024-wisconsin-legislature-81226.jpg

5 things you need to know about Pam Bondi	One of Donald Trump’s most loyal supporters just got picked for one of the most important roles in his second administration. Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida, was chosen Thursday to be the nation’s top law enforcement official by Trump just hours after Matt Gaetz withdrew from consideration in the face of Senate opposition. Bondi is a partner at Ballard Partners, the lobbying firm that had been run by Trump's incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles and whose founder, Brian Ballard, is a top Trump fundraiser. She is co-chair of the law and justice division at the pro-Trump America First Policy Institute, which has been likened to a <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/29/trump-transition-plan-...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/21/5-things-pam-bondi-00191199	2024-11-21T18:17:32-08:00	https://static.politico.com/ee/a3/a3552165412ab39080acceac66c7/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2026271834
Matt Gaetz praises Trump's AG replacement pick Pam Bondi	Former Rep. Matt Gaetz is praising Donald Trump's choice of fellow Floridian Pam Bondi to replace him as the attorney general nominee. Gaetz said Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida, is a 'stellar choice' to serve as the nation's top law enforcement officer. The two worked together when Gaetz served in Florida's legislature. 'She’s a proven litigator, an inspiring leader and a champion for all Americans,' Gaetz said in a post on X. 'She will bring the needed reforms to DOJ.' His endorsement came hours after he withdrew his nomination for AG in the face of opposition in the Senate.	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/gaetz-on-his-replacement-00191139	2024-11-21T16:43:37-08:00	
Promotion delayed for general who oversaw Afghanistan pullout	A top general who oversaw the 82nd Airborne Division during the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was conspicuously left out of a large batch of military promotions approved Thursday by the Senate before it left town until December. The apparent delay for Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue — President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Army in Europe and Africa and set for promotion to four-star general — suggests a senator is holding the nomination. Donahue was one of nearly 1,000 promotions the Senate Armed Services Committee approved on Tuesday, and senators in the full chamber typically clear the decks of uniform nominees before an extended recess. It’s unclear which senator might be delaying Donahue’s promotion and why. Such holds can be done anonymously and can still be bypassed by the fu...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/politics-and-promotions-00191098	2024-11-21T16:07:25-08:00

'I am grateful to the thousands of people who worked to make sure every eligible vote cast could be counted, including election officials in all 67 counties.'

Trump once shunned Project 2025 as ‘ridiculous.’ Now he's staffing up with them.	Donald Trump spent his presidential campaign running from Project 2025. Now, he’s using it to stock his White House and administration. In recent days, Trump has tapped nearly a half-dozen Project 2025 authors and contributors, including Brendan Carr, who Trump picked this week to lead the FCC; former Rep. Pete Hoekstra, who got the nod for ambassador to Canada; and John Ratcliffe, who was tapped for director of the CIA. One of Trump’s first selections — Tom Homan as 'border czar' — was also a Project 2025 contributor.

The Florida Republican resigned both from his current term and preemptively from his term in the next Congress, which he just won in the November election.

With Gaetz gone, Trump’s troubled Pentagon nominee is in the hot seat	Former Rep. Matt Gaetz’s abrupt withdrawal of his bid to be attorney general on Thursday could be bad news for another of President-elect Donald Trump’s picks: Pete Hegseth. Hegseth’s nomination for Defense secretary is facing headwinds over seven-year-old allegations of sexual assault, although he was never charged. But Hegseth so far had been overshadowed by Gaetz, a flame-throwing congressional ally with numerous foes in both parties who faced his own misconduct allegations, including that he engaged in sex with a minor.

Schumer explains reported GOP deal on judges	The office of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is defending a reported deal where Democrats ceded four appeals court nominations in favor of confirming more of President Joe Biden’s lower-level federal judicial appointees. 'The trade was four circuit nominees — all lacking the votes to get confirmed — for more than triple the number of additional judges moving forward,' a spokesperson for Schumer said Thursday. Democrats have confirmed 221 of Biden’s picks for the federal courts after the Senate overwhelmingly approved Sharad Desai for a federal judicial post in Arizona on Thursday.

When the president-elect announced he tapped Gaetz to be his next attorney general last week, Fetterman called it 'god-tier-level trolling.'

House Democrats vowed to press forward with their plan to force the release of a long-awaited report into Matt Gaetz even after he withdrew from consideration as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Attorney General.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler to step down Jan. 20	Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who pursued a sweeping and controversial agenda as Wall Street’s chief overseer over the last three-plus years, plans to step down on Jan. 20, the agency said Thursday.

Gensler's exit will cap one of the most memorable periods in the SEC's history, as the 67-year-old veteran regulator sought to enact a slate of ambitious rules and pursue lawsuits that led to high-profile clashes with both the traditional financial world and the cryptocurrency industry.

Donald Trump gets a brutal reality check	Donald Trump is not a monarch. That’s the unmistakable lesson of the ill-fated nomination of Matt Gaetz for attorney general. Rather than showcasing Trump’s absolute power over his GOP allies, it revealed his limits. The doomed nomination lasted just eight days — and its failure is an unwelcome lesson for the president-elect, who has been projecting invincibility and claiming a historic mandate despite his reed-thin popular vote victory. 'The short version is ‘checks and balances work,’' said Eugene Volokh, a UCLA professor of law.

Matt Gaetz withdraws from consideration for Trump's AG	Matt Gaetz announced Thursday he is withdrawing his name from consideration as President-elect Donald Trump's pick as attorney general, noting in a social media post that his nomination had become a distraction. Gaetz held multiple meetings with GOP senators over the past couple of days as he sought to game out his chances of getting confirmed. Even senators who supported him had expressed doubts that he could get confirmed, given he could only lose three Republican votes. 'It is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General.

Keep your eyes on these Senate Republicans. They could upend Pete Hegseth’s confirmation.	Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Pentagon, is on Capitol Hill Thursday to make his case with Senate Republicans as controversy continues to build around his nomination. The Army veteran and Fox News host will need to address allegations of sexual assault that surfaced in recent days. Concern on the Hill is only likely to build after a police report into the 2017 allegations, which Hegseth denies and wasn’t charged in, became public on Wednesday. Four Senate Republicans would need to break ranks to sink Hegseth’s nomination.

House Oversight plans new subcommittee to coordinate with DOGE efforts	House Oversight Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) intends to establish a new subcommittee next year led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) that will oversee Delivering on Government Efficiency, a person familiar with the plans confirmed to POLITICO. The subcommittee will be tasked with coordinating with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, an outside-of-government effort announced by Donald Trump which will be led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. The commission has been tasked with providing advice and coordinating with the White House and Office of Management and Budget.

Biden’s judicial nominees roll onward in the Senate	Senate Democrats confirmed the Biden administration’s 220th lifetime appointment to the federal judiciary on Wednesday — and are poised to add to that total as they wind down their time in Washington before Thanksgiving. Lawmakers voted beyond midnight to end debate on a handful of other nominees. On Thursday, they’ll vote to confirm Sharad Desai to be district judge for the District of Arizona. Beyond that, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will have half a dozen more nominees primed for final Senate approval — though the actual confirmations won’t take place until after Thanksgiving. Of note: Vice President-elect JD Vance was present and voted no on the latter half of these judicial moves, so he was near the Senate floor until around midnight.

Republican Begich unseats Peltola in Alaska House race	Alaska Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola lost her reelection campaign Wednesday, a little more than two years after she unexpectedly flipped the Republican-held seat. Peltola lost to Republican challenger Nick Begich III, a business owner and grandson of former Sen. Nick Begich (D). The winner ended up with 51 percent of the vote after more ballots were counted and the state applied its rank choice voting process. Peltola got to Congress following a 2022 special election following Republican Rep. Don Young’s death. She flipped the seat from Republican control on a centrist message that included promoting fisheries, natural resources and abortion rights, among other priorities; she made 'Fish, Family, Freedom' a campaign motto.

Here Are the GOP Senators Who Could Take Down Trump's Cabinet Picks	President-elect Donald Trump’s rapid-fire cabinet appointments have made clear what he values: loyalty to Donald Trump and a demonstrated ability to articulate that loyalty on television. The response to The Trump Show’s casting call will be even more clarifying. In short: Will the Senate remain the Senate? While much of the GOP has become a Trump subsidiary, there are still some Senate Republicans who consider themselves members of a co-equal branch of government and take their Advise and Consent duty seriously.

TSA administrator makes bid to stay on under Trump	Transportation Security Administration chief David Pekoske is signaling that he'd like to stay on in his current role as President-elect Donald Trump begins his second term. During a segment about Thanksgiving travel with CBS on Tuesday, Pekoske was clear that he's hoping to stay until his term ends in 2027, saying that he 'loves' the role. 'It’s important for continuity in TSA to run the second term to its conclusion,' he said, adding that the agency has made numerous investments and increased partnerships not just in air travel but on surface transportation security, too.

'He did an outstanding job as United States Ambassador to the Netherlands during our first four years, and I am confident that he will continue to represent our Country well in this new role.' Hoekstra served as ambassador to the Netherlands from 2018 to 2021 and in Congress from 1993 to 2011. He unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2010 and for the Senate in 2012.

Members of the House Ethics Committee deadlocked over whether to release the findings of an investigation into the former Florida lawmaker, who is Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general. The inaction is triggering outrage among Democrats, who argue the committee is dragging out the process, while Republicans remain furious that Gaetz put them in this position. In a bid to force the release of the Ethics report, which is expected to cover several allegations, including that Gaetz had sex with a minor, Democratic Reps.

Mark Milley disagrees with Trump pick on women in combat	Retired Army Gen. Mark Milley, the former chair of the joint chiefs of staff, is defending the role of women in combat — clashing with the views of Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Pentagon. Milley, who served as the top U.S. military officer under Trump and President Joe Biden until his retirement in 2023, said at an event Wednesday that women have served in battle throughout history. And he pointedly recalled the service of an Army nurse who braved minefields to save fellow service members and was killed in action. 'Don’t lecture me about women in combat,' Milley said at a national security innovation event hosted by the Pallas Foundation.

Nikki Haley has thoughts on RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard	Nikki Haley has a blunt assessment of Donald Trump’s choices of Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for high-profile roles in his administration. Haley, who was Trump’s most significant Republican primary opponent, argued Wednesday on her radio show against confirming Gabbard as director of national intelligence and Kennedy to lead Health and Human Services. Haley first went after Gabbard, a former Democratic member of Congress and 2020 presidential candidate who endorsed Trump this year before announcing she was a Republican. The nomination has also raised concerns from some traditional GOP foreign policy thinkers. 'She opposed ending the Iran nuclear deal. She opposed sanctions on Iran.

Lori Chavez-DeRemer for Labor secretary, zeroing in on the Oregon Republican's support for legislation that has been a top priority for unions. 'The PRO Act would deprive employees of their right to a secret ballot and their privacy in union representation elections,' Kristen Swearingen, president of the Coalition for a Democratic Workplace, said in a statement. 'It would also impose overly broad liability for ‘joint employment,’ limiting opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs, and create rigid standards for independent contractors, undermining workers’ ability to work independently.'

Swaths of Senate Republicans have not yet committed to supporting Gaetz, and at least two senators — Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) — have cast serious doubts on Gaetz getting confirmed to the top position at the Justice Department.

But the rank-and-file members are usually allies of leadership, which helps concentrate the power of committee slots to leadership.

The Democratic leaders stepping up as Trump’s biggest foes	Democrats are deeply divided on how aggressively to resist President-elect Donald Trump and his allies. While some are taking a conciliatory approach to the incoming Republican trifecta, others are vowing to thwart their policies with every legal and legislative tool available. It’s a moment those in the resistance camp — many with grander political ambitions — have been preparing for behind the scenes for many months. Those preparations were aided by Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that outlined a policy wish-list for the next Republican administration, from slashing environmental regulations to issuing a national abortion ban. Blue states began 'Trump proof-ing' programs anticipated to be under attack by the federal government and beefing up teams of lawyers who will battle the ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/20/democrats-trump-foes-governors-attorneys-general-interest-groups-00190177	2024-11-20T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/a8/2b/db700c684bbc9e2b37f1ce8f7431/fifty-trumpresistance2-0.jpg
Race for the House: Capitol Hill ponders how thin a razor-thin majority can be	More than two weeks after Election Day, there are still five uncalled House races — four of which have a margin of just hundreds of votes. In California, the two uncalled races each have margins of about 300 votes. Why does this matter? If Democrats flip both California seats, Republicans would have just a 220-215 House majority at the start of the new Congress. That’s before factoring in the departures of three GOP congresspeople — Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), Matt Gaetz (Fla.) and Michael Waltz (Fla.) — nominated for roles in the Trump administration that would temporarily trim that margin even further. Republican leadership would need incredibly strict caucus management in this scenario to pass anything. So, here’s where things stand in the remaining contests: Iowa’s 1st: Incumb...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/hill-state-of-play-00190591	2024-11-20T06:19:42-08:00

House Republicans are playing the Trump card in committee chair races	Republican lawmakers jockeying to lead House committees in the next Congress are touting their loyalty to President-elect Donald Trump as much as their ability to advance policy priorities as they make appeals to colleagues over the next two weeks. With scores of members competing for a few key positions, contenders believe that success could hinge on their ability to show just how well-positioned they are to drive Trump's legislative agenda across a range of policy areas including finance, energy and education.

MAGA world is thrilled with Hegseth pick. Republican senators have questions.	After a weekend of brutal headlines disclosing sexual assault allegations against Pete Hegseth, Senate Republicans are offering a tepid defense of Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon. Republicans have downplayed and deflected when asked about Hegseth — arguing Trump picked an outsider to shake up the Pentagon bureaucracy or that the confirmation process should play out. 'Let me say this: I have asked to read the allegations and I honestly have not had time to look at it, so I just can’t comment,' Senate Armed Services ranking Republican Roger Wicker said on Monday. 'I am looking to be very supportive of his nomination.' By Tuesday, Wicker, who will preside over Hegseth’s confirmation process when Republicans take control of the Senate in January, wasn’t taking reporters’ questions.

Teamsters president pushing Chavez-DeRemer for Labor secretary	Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Ore.) is in the mix to be Trump’s Labor secretary and, notably, has the backing of Teamsters President Sean O’Brien, according to three people familiar with the conversations granted anonymity to share private discussions. O’Brien is privately raising Chavez-DeRemer’s name as a top pick for the role. GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have also advocated for Chavez-DeRemer for the job directly with President-elect Donald Trump and his team, according to another person familiar with the matter. Kara Deniz, a Teamsters spokesperson, confirmed that O’Brien supports Chavez-DeRemer for the role, saying 'we think she would be an excellent choice.'

JD Vance attacks Steve Bannon ally as a ‘mouth breathing imbecile’	JD Vance called a close ally of influential MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon 'a mouth breathing imbecile' after she criticized him for missing a Senate vote to confirm judicial nominees this week. Grace Chong, chief financial officer and chief operating officer for Bannon’s War Room, encouraged Republicans on X to do everything they could do to block any of outgoing President Joe Biden's judicial picks for the federal bench. Bannon served in Donald Trump's first White House and is widely credited with giving him the intellectual framework for the MAGA movement. 'You guys better show up and do your fricken job!!'

Vance says Trump is interviewing FBI director replacements	President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to end business-as-usual at the Justice Department apparently include replacing FBI Director Christopher Wray, Vice President-elect JD Vance indicated in a social media post on Tuesday. Vance revealed he and the president-elect were conducting interviews for the crucial FBI position in a since-deleted post on X. The post was responding to criticism the vice president-elect received for missing a Monday Senate vote that confirmed one of President Joe Biden's judicial nominees to the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. 'When this 11th Circuit vote happened, I was meeting with President Trump to interview multiple positions for our government, including for FBI Director,' Vance wrote.

Dems propose bill to ensure FBI role in vetting White House security clearances	House Democrats are proposing legislation to codify the FBI’s role in vetting White House appointees for security clearances, a bill aimed squarely at recent reports that Donald Trump is bypassing the bureau. The Security Clearance Review Act would require employees of the Executive Office of the President to be approved for a security clearance by the FBI. Any decision by the FBI director to recommend against approving a prospective employee’s clearance would be reported to Congress.

This time around, Trump's transition team has a new approach toward the media	As president-elect, Donald Trump has shied away from the media as he releases a stream of Cabinet picks and White House staffers in statements, most posted to his social media platform Truth Social. He has yet to hold a press conference. Since the election, Trump has done a handful of one-on-one interviews and delivered public remarks at an event at Mar-a-Lago.

Vought, a prominent contributor to the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 initiative to draft proposals for a second Trump administration, is among the people being seriously considered for the post, according to three people familiar with the transition effort granted anonymity to discuss the considerations.

Vance will be on Capitol Hill on Wednesday and Thursday, sitting in on some meetings with former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Pete Hegseth, Trump’s picks for attorney general and Defense secretary respectively, and key senators. Some Republican senators have already expressed scrutiny over the two controversial Cabinet nominations. CNN was first to report the plans. Rep.

Johnson sidesteps questions on transgender bathroom bill	Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Tuesday he believed 'a man is a man and a woman is a woman' amid controversy about a measure that would ban transgender women from women's bathrooms on the House side of the Capitol. But he added: 'I also believe that we treat everybody with dignity, and so we can do and believe all those things at the same time.' Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) is pushing the effort as Rep.-elect Sarah McBride is set to assume office in January as the first openly transgender member of Congress. Mace wants the measure approved as part of the House rules, but has threatened to force a vote if leadership doesn't agree to include it. Johnson has been noncommittal on how he plans to handle Mace's effort. But it’s drawn fierce criticism from Democratic leaders.

Trump still mulling Ag secretary choices including Maldonado, Starling	President-elect Donald Trump is considering a former GOP lieutenant governor of California and a former USDA official from his first term to serve as his next agriculture secretary, according to four people familiar with the transition conversations. Abel Maldonado served as former California Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s lieutenant governor before stepping down to mount an unsuccessful run for Congress. Maldonado is the son of immigrant farmworkers, a winery owner, one-time mayor and former California state lawmaker. Former Trump White House and USDA official Ray Starling’s name has been in the mix for some time, but his stock is rising among some Trump officials.

In their weekly conference meeting, Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) highlighted the various pillars they aim to pass using a so-called reconciliation bill, a procedural tool they can use to pass legislation without Democratic support when they control both the Senate and House majorities next year.

Why House Democrats stayed the course with their leaders	Despite coming up short in their fight for the majority, House Democrats aren’t tossing their leaders aside. The caucus opted to keep their top slate of leaders in Tuesday’s party elections, with every single top Democratic leader reelected without opposition. It’s a mark of confidence, even as the party girds for another Congress in the minority. Even with public and private venting over the future of their party, alongside debate over the Democratic message, most in the party were satisfied with their performance in congressional elections.

Who could be the Pentagon's No. 2 in a Pete Hegseth DOD?	Two seasoned Defense Department insiders are in the running to be the Pentagon's No. 2, and names of other possible nominees are swirling as the Trump transition team looks to fill top posts in the Army, Navy and Air Force. Potential nominees for deputy defense secretary include former Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie and former Pentagon No. 2 David Norquist — both veterans of President-elect Donald Trump’s first administration. POLITICO spoke with seven people who were granted anonymity to discuss deliberations within the Trump team.

Just one GOP vote on the Ethics Committee could release the Gaetz report	The House Ethics Committee is scheduled to meet Wednesday. And if members vote on whether to share their investigative findings about attorney general nominee Matt Gaetz, it would only take one Republican to trigger the release of the report. The panel is evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, and it only requires a majority vote in the private meeting to release the report. A tie would defer to the party that controls the House — meaning if all Republicans voted against releasing it, the report would not be published. But it would only take one, combined with all Democrats, to share the report, either with senators or publicly. Republicans on the committee have largely declined to comment on the upcoming meeting at all, let alone whether they would vote to release the report.

House GOP discusses banning transgender women from Capitol women’s bathrooms	Speaker Mike Johnson said he’s working on a solution to address GOP concerns about transgender women using women’s restrooms on the House side of Capitol Hill, as Rep.-elect Sarah McBride is poised to assume office as the first openly transgender lawmaker in January. 'This is an issue that Congress has never had to address before and we're going to do that in a deliberate fashion ... and we will accommodate the needs of every single person,' Johnson said at a press conference Tuesday.

Judge denies Jan. 6 defendant’s bid to delay trial that could straddle Trump inauguration	A Jan. 6 defendant facing five felony charges could be on trial at the precise moment power changes hand from Joe Biden to Donald Trump — an uncomfortable prospect for prosecutors bracing for a leadership change that could upend cases stemming from the attack on the Capitol. U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich on Tuesday denied a bid by defendant Michael Picciuto to postpone his Jan. 13 trial into April, who cited the prospect of a pardon from Trump and the potential awkwardness of being on trial at the moment the transfer of power occurs as a reason to delay. 'The chances of this going a week could easily actually roll into the date of the inauguration itself,' Picciuto’s attorney Jay Crook said.

Republicans slow down Senate floor to delay Biden judicial picks	Senate Republicans moved to slow down the pace of judicial nomination confirmations in the waning days of Joe Biden’s presidency on Monday evening, forcing the chamber into hours of routine votes. What happened? Senators initially confirmed Embry Kidd to an appeals court post by a 49-45 vote on Monday evening. But then the roadblocks began. Moving between executive session — to consider nominations — and legislative session — to consider bills — is normally done by unanimous consent, but Republicans forced votes on those procedural actions throughout the evening. Those votes only required a simple majority, so Democrats were able to easily pass them. But they had to stay close to the chamber. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was unbowed by the procedural obstacles.

Negative signs for Gaetz as senators brush off questions amid Trump pressure	A negative sign looms for Matt Gaetz: Nearly a dozen GOP senators won’t commit to confirming him for attorney general, saying they want to let the process play out. And many, even if they aren’t insisting on seeing the potentially damaging House Ethics report on the recently resigned lawmaker, assume the information will have to come out. 'He’s got an uphill climb,' said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a senior member of the conference who said she looked forward to meeting with Gaetz and the Judiciary Committee's review of the nomination. Promising to follow the vetting process doesn’t mean senators will necessarily oppose a nominee, but it’s notable given GOP senators are clearly wary of crossing President-elect Donald Trump.

Congress is running out of time to pass a December funding deal	Facing a government shutdown deadline in just over a month, Congress is quickly running out of time to do anything but punt funding levels into next year — unless bipartisan talks begin in earnest. Congressional leaders have yet to announce the start of negotiations over a more comprehensive funding deal, raising the odds that lawmakers will resort to a stopgap in late December that kicks the next funding cliff into President-elect Donald Trump’s first months in office. Even if Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer started talking now, it could already be too late to pass final funding measures by the Dec. 20 deadline. That’s because it usually takes Congress about a month to clear bills with updated spending levels once leaders have reached a deal on overall totals...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/18/congress/congress-running-out-of-time-on-funding-00190271	2024-11-18T16:20:48-08:00

Musk, who emerged as a top donor and Trump surrogate during the 2024 election, has been an influential person in Trump's orbit since the election. The world's richest person has sat in on Trump's calls with world leaders, and has chimed in on his Cabinet picks. Recently, he publicly advocated for Howard Lutnick to be Treasury secretary and used his social media platform to back Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) for Senate majority leader (Scott flamed out).

How the Gaetz Ethics report could still come out if the panel blocks it	House Ethics Committee members are set to meet privately Wednesday as debate rages over whether the panel should release its report on its investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz. But even if they elect not to release it, that might not be the end of the road. The committee doesn’t disclose its agenda. But Ethics members are under intense scrutiny as they figure out how to address the report, which lawmakers in both chambers have said they would like to review, particularly given Gaetz’s attorney general nomination. The committee could vote to adopt or release a report during its closed-door meeting. If the vote is along party lines — the same number of Democrats and Republicans sit on the committee — a tie means the motion fails and defers to the majority, which is Republican.

Top Democrat on Ethics panel says she wants to publish Gaetz report	Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the House Ethics Committee, said Monday she wants her panel’s report on former Rep. Matt Gaetz to be released to the public. 'It should certainly be released to the Senate, and I think it should be released to the public, as we have done with many other investigative reports in the past,' she told a small group of reporters. Both Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are pushing for access to the report after President-elect Donald Trump tapped Gaetz to be his attorney general last week.

White House asks Congress for $100B in aid for hurricanes, other disasters	The Biden administration on Monday sent Congress a roughly $100 billion emergency funding request to rebuild communities hit by hurricanes Helene and Milton, along with a slew of other disasters nationwide. Top lawmakers plan to spend the next few weeks finalizing a bipartisan bill that fulfills at least some of that request, with a goal of final passage sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Since Congress also faces a government shutdown deadline on Dec. 20, it’s possible disaster aid gets tied into a spending patch or broader funding package. Besides $40 billion to refill FEMA’s disaster relief fund, the White House is seeking emergency funding for more than a dozen other federal agen...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/18/white-house-asks-congress-for-100b-in-aid-for-hurricanes-other-disasters-00190167	2024-11-18T09:30:48-08:00	https://static.politico.com/a8/0e/6e59a82f42a788b1e7d0b0069b69/hurricane-helene-fema-threats-48350.jpg
Ron DeSantis’ ‘Apprentice’: Governor announces how he’ll pick Marco Rubio’s replacement	MIAMI — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis intends to hold interviews and 'extensive vetting' to help him decide who should replace Marco Rubio in the Senate. The seat will soon open up after President-elect Donald Trump announced he planned to nominate Rubio to be secretary of state, which will necessitate Rubio resigning from his role. DeSantis under Florida law will be tasked with appointing Rubio’s successor, and he said in a post on X Monday morning that he would likely finish the selection process 'by the beginning of January.' The governor also expanded on some of the qualities and policy priorities he would be looking for.

Sen. Cory Booker sounds like RFK Jr. — or vice versa	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may need every vote he can get to win confirmation as President-elect Donald Trump’s secretary of health and human services. No Senate Democrats have said they’d back Kennedy yet. But New Jersey’s Cory Booker shares RFK Jr.’s concerns about the U.S. food system, as he made clear in a post to X this morning, which said that the system prioritizes 'corporations feeding us unhealthy products' while flooding us with 'dangerous chemicals.' Kennedy took note, thanking Booker in a post 'for your long history of leadership on this issue.'

The mad scramble to be Trump’s Treasury secretary	Donald Trump’s political revival was fueled by a populist economic message that hit home with an electorate weary of Biden-era high prices and interest rates. Now the president-elect is having a hard time picking a quarterback to run his economic game plan. Nearly two weeks after Election Day — and after a flurry of high-profile Cabinet picks that blindsided Washington policymakers and industry leaders — Trump has yet to name his pick for who will lead the Treasury Department. Fighting between Trump world factions that support transition co-chair Howard Lutnick and hedge fund executive Scott Bessent has spilled into public view.

There is new pressure to publicize details from investigations centering on allegations of underage sex and drug use by the Florida Republican as a potentially tawdry and dramatic confirmation battle takes shape.

Trump’s immigration crackdown is expected to start on Day 1	In his first 100 days, President-elect Donald Trump plans to begin the process of deporting hundreds of thousands of people. He is expected to end parole for people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. And he is likely to undo a policy that significantly constrained deportations for people who weren't deemed threats to public safety or national security. Trump’s team is already thinking about how to craft executive actions aimed to withstand the legal challenges from immigrants’ rights groups — all in hopes of avoiding an early defeat like the one his 2017 travel ban targeting majority-Muslim nations suffered. This time, Trump may have friendlier arbiters.

His noncommittal posture was part of a time-honored Washington tradition that’s gone into overdrive in the leadup to Trump’s second inauguration: People in the private sector who reap the benefits of being name-checked for high-level administration jobs, even if the idea they would be chosen for or accept a role amounts to little more than speculation.

One major factor that's delayed the decision is the amount of control Lutnick has exerted in determining what information flows up to the president-elect, two of the sources said. Bessent is meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, The Washington Post reported.

Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, calling the secretary-designate 'nuts on a lot of fronts.' The Post, owned by Rupert Murdoch, is reliably conservative and endorsed Trump for president this year. But Trump’s selection of the anti-vaccine activist Kennedy to lead HHS, the tabloid’s editorial board argued, would violate the first rule of medicine, 'do no harm.' Recalling a 2023 meeting with Kennedy, the Post’s editorial board called his views 'a head-scratching spaghetti of what we can only call warped conspiracy theories, and not just on vaccines.'

A two-term governor of a Western oil-rich state with five tribal nations, Burgum is already receiving a warm reception from Republicans on Capitol Hill, who for four years have slammed President Joe Biden's energy policies.

The committee doesn’t disclose its agenda — but the highly anticipated closed-door powwow would let them discuss what to do with the probe now that Gaetz is technically outside of their jurisdiction. Speaker Mike Johnson announced that Gaetz had resigned Wednesday night, hours after President-elect Trump nominated the Florida firebrand to become attorney general. Johnson attributed the resignation to Gaetz wanting to allow his seat to be filled quickly, but House Republicans have speculated that he ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/14/congress/gop-lawmakers-want-to-see-gaetz-report-00189745	2024-11-14T15:36:55-08:00	
Trump selects Jay Clayton, a business-friendly former regulator, as top federal prosecutor in Manhattan	President-elect Donald Trump has picked Jay Clayton, a longtime corporate lawyer and former Wall Street regulator, to be the U.S. attorney overseeing Manhattan. Clayton served as the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump’s first term but has no experience as a criminal prosecutor. If confirmed by the Senate, Clayton would head the nation’s most prestigious federal prosecutor’s office: the Southern District of New York, which has jurisdiction over the largest financial institutions and brings many high-profile white-collar and public-corruption cases. During his first term, Trump attempted to install Clayton as the U.S. attorney for SDNY in an effort to oust Geoffrey Berman, who held the post from 2018 to 2020. But Trump’s effort was met with fierce resistance in the ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/14/congress/key-u-s-attorney-pick-00189709	2024-11-14T14:25:53-08:00

Musk’s efficiency department is seeking volunteers for ‘tedious’ work with no compensation	Elon Musk’s new Department of Government Efficiency is calling for volunteers to send in their resumes — via X direct message. DOGE, which uses the same acronym as its X handle, wants to recruit 'super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting,' according to its post on X. Musk then added, with a post from his personal X account, that this work will be unpaid. 'Indeed, this will be tedious work, make lots of enemies &amp; compensation is zero,' Musk wrote. 'What a great deal!' The post also included a laughing emoji.

Michael Anton and Sebastian Gorka in the running for deputy national security adviser	Michael Anton and Sebastian Gorka are in the running to be President-elect Donald Trump’s deputy national security adviser, according to three people familiar with the competition who were granted anonymity to speak candidly. With either selection Trump would elevate a firebrand loyalist who served in the incoming commander-in-chief’s first administration to one of the White House’s top roles. Trump has already selected Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida to serve as his national security adviser. Neither role requires Senate confirmation, but Anton and Gorka would both be controversial picks that are likely to stir anger in Washington.

Lawyer of alleged Gaetz victim: Release House ethics report ‘immediately'	The lawyer representing a woman former Rep. Matt Gaetz allegedly had sex with when she was a minor called on the House Ethics Committee to 'immediately' release its report into his alleged conduct. 'Mr. Gaetz's likely nomination as Attorney General is a perverse development in a truly dark series of events,' attorney John Clune wrote Thursday on X.

House GOP lawmakers hang on to critical rules deal	House Republicans have salvaged an agreement on their internal rules, according to six people familiar with the discussions, after it appeared to be on shaky ground for hours earlier on Thursday. If the agreement — struck by opposing factions within the GOP’s narrow majority Wednesday afternoon — had unraveled, it would have been a significant blow to Speaker Mike Johnson, who blessed the deal. The agreement had been a truce of sorts on conservatives’ and leadership allies’ most contentious battle lines, like hard-liner moves to block party-favored legislation on the House floor. Under the deal, which was first reported by POLITICO on Wednesday, centrists agreed to drop their proposed rule changes that would have established punishments for members who defied leaders and the will of the co...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/14/congress/house-gop-hanging-on-to-rules-deal-00189601	2024-11-14T09:25:50-08:00	
RFK Jr. has big asks of Washington. Republican lawmakers say they’re open.	MAGA won big. Now MAHA is ready to take on Washington. President-elect Donald Trump promised Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a chance to implement his Make America Healthy Again vision and Kennedy is in the mix to run the Department of Health and Human Services. That could turn the government’s role in public health upside down. Kennedy blames Americans’ poor health in part on a corrupt alliance among the food and drug industries and the regulators supposed to watch over them. He wants to replace the bureaucrats and overhaul the systems for overseeing pesticides, food additives and vaccines. That could mean rules and product bans that threaten the profits of the food and pharma sectors GOP lawmakers have long deferred to — and who employ many of their constituents.

House Ethics chair reiterates he does not plan to release Gaetz report	House Ethics Chair Michael Guest is seemingly sticking to his decision to not release his panel’s report about Matt Gaetz after the Floridian’s abrupt resignation Wednesday. 'What happens in Ethics is confidential. We're going to maintain that confidentiality,' Guest (R-Miss.) told reporters Thursday morning as he left the House floor. 'I’ve given my statement yesterday and there’s nothing new that has changed from then until now.' When asked if he’s allowed to release the Ethics report if Gaetz isn’t in the House: 'I’ve got no further comment.'

Senate Republicans squirm over Trump's tariff plans	Senate Republicans are skeptical of Donald Trump’s aggressive new tariff plans — especially lawmakers from states with large agriculture industries that could bear the brunt of likely foreign retaliation. 'Tariffs have a place, but there is also the other side, which is: what about the repercussions of [countries] putting tariffs in a retaliatory method on some of our items as well?' added Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). 'There is a place for tariffs, but I want to look at them case-by-case.' Those sentiments were echoed by a number of Midwestern Republican senators this week as they returned from the election recess. And they hint at what’s likely to be a major source of tension within the party during the next Trump administration — over just how far the president should go in imposing tariff...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/14/congress/tariff-tension-00189566	2024-11-14T07:43:04-08:00

'I had no interest in being in his Cabinet, he knew that,' Haley said during an episode of her radio show, 'SiriusXM’s Nikki Haley Live,' on Wednesday. She said Steve Witkoff, whom Trump has since announced he’ll name Middle East special envoy in his administration, came to Haley’s home in South Carolina and 'wanted a truce' between Haley and Trump and asked if there was anything she wanted.

McCarthy has long feuded with now-former Rep.

House Republicans win the majority. Now they look to the margin.	House Republicans tapped their leadership team for the next Congress on Wednesday and formally notched their majority when the Associated Press called Rep. Juan Ciscomani’s (R-Ariz.) reelection. But the size of that razor-thin majority remains in flux — even before factoring in the departures of three GOP members nominated for roles in the Trump administration. Here’s the latest on where things stand. California’s 45th: Several more favorable batches of ballots for Democrats have put Derek Tran within 349 votes of overtaking Rep.

GOP holds onto House majority — clinching the trifecta	Republicans have achieved the government trifecta — keeping control of the House as well as winning the Senate and the presidency. It will be the first time Republicans have had full control of Congress and the White House since 2018. House Republicans have been quietly preparing their legislative agenda on tax cuts and other priorities for months, though an expected narrow majority will likely complicate those efforts, as well as Speaker Mike Johnson’s bid to hold onto the gavel in a January floor vote. The GOP held onto a slew of at-risk incumbents as results trickled in over the past week, and Republicans also picked up a few seats in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Colorado.

GOP senators brush off concerns about Thune’s relationship with Trump	John Thune triumphed in his campaign for GOP leader by laser-focusing on two things: Republican senators and mending his relationship with Donald Trump. He spent the last few months donating heavily to colleagues and joining them on their campaigns. He spoke frequently with Trump directly, including after the general election last week. And he ignored a conservative and MAGA-world pressure campaign to elect Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) as the GOP leader. 'I've been focused on my colleagues,' Thune said. He narrowly defeated Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) on the second ballot by a vote of 29-24. Scott fell on the first ballot.

Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) 146-67-1, with one person voting for Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), according to two people familiar with the vote. The Michigan Republican, who was first elected in 2020 and campaigned with other GOP leaders this year, will replace Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), who was tapped to serve in the incoming Trump administration. The No. 4 spot in GOP leadership was the highest-ranking open slot this year, sparking a flurry of lobbying.

Johnson clinches GOP speaker nomination — but the real test looms in January	Mike Johnson clinched the internal GOP nod to serve as speaker again.

House Republicans voted unanimously Wednesday to make Johnson their speaker nominee, according to three people in the room. The Louisiana Republican has been shoring up support for months, crisscrossing the country to campaign for his colleagues, and the party is expected to hold onto House control by a slim margin.

Senate Republicans largely refrained from wading into whether Gaetz — who the Department of Justice investigated for years over allegations that he engaged in sex with underage girls and paid for their transportation — could be confirmed.

The contest was a rematch after Calvert narrowly defeated Rollins in 2022 in one of the most closely-watched swing contests this cycle.

Seven members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Sen.

As of midday Wednesday, more than 41 hours have passed since the New York Times reported Trump would tap Rubio, a report POLITICO and other major outlets quickly confirmed. The Rubio news was the most notable in a series of leaks in recent days about Trump’s still-forming cabinet — a stark contrast to the nearly two-year presidential campaign his team ran that was relatively leak-free.

Thune wins contested race for Senate GOP leader	John Thune will lead the Senate Republican conference next term, winning a three-way election to succeed Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in a closed-door vote on Wednesday. The South Dakotan will take over in January at the turn of the new Congress, when Republicans are expected to control the government trifecta: the House, Senate and the presidency. And he’ll have some room to maneuver in his own chamber, with Republicans’ 53-seat majority, as the party considers wide-ranging legislation that would tackle tax cuts, immigration and energy policy. At 63, Thune, current GOP whip, is considered relatively young for leadership. Thune has not committed to imposing a term limit on the role of conference leader, meaning he’s well-positioned to hold the job for years to come.

'It’ll be as smooth as it can get and I very much appreciate that, Joe.' 'You’re welcome,' a smiling Biden said. The meeting, normally a formality between presidents, represented a striking contrast from four years ago, when Biden was poised to take the White House after unseating Trump.

Trump endorses Johnson hours ahead of GOP speaker vote	President-elect Donald Trump appeared to back Mike Johnson's speakership bid during his visit with the House GOP Wednesday morning, hours ahead of an internal party leadership vote, according to five people in the room. 'He said, ‘I am with him all the way,’' according to two people. Trump is meeting with House Republicans hours before an internal leadership election where they are expected to elect Johnson as their speaker nominee. That election will be conducted via secret ballot and only requires a simple majority. It’s a significant boost for Johnson, who has tied himself closely to the incoming president and needs his support in order to win the gavel in a tougher Jan. 3 vote, when Johnson will need near-unanimous support from House Republicans to officially become speaker. But Trump’...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/13/congress/trump-endorses-johnson-00189282	2024-11-13T07:29:50-08:00	
Johnson tells House GOP he has no challengers for leadership race	Speaker Mike Johnson told House Republicans behind closed doors that he doesn’t have any challengers to his candidacy right now, according to four people familiar with the matter. The private comments come after two people familiar with the private discussions told POLITICO on Tuesday night that members of the House Freedom Caucus would not throw in a candidate but instead force an internal vote on the speakership race during a closed-door election set for Wednesday afternoon. The decision by Johnson’s right flank came after the bloc’s members deliberated for days about whether or not to throw in an alternative candidate.

Biden is about to have the meeting he’s been dreading with Trump	Nearly four years after he walked out of the White House in the aftermath of a violent insurrection, President-elect Donald Trump will re-enter the building on Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden in the Oval Office. By inviting Trump, Biden is extending to his predecessor and successor a formal courtesy that Trump didn’t give him four years ago. In many ways, he is hosting a rival who he’d argued was a threat to American democracy to make the point that democracy itself hinges on elections where the losers accept the results. The meeting comes eight days after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris and six days after Biden’s Rose Garden speech, where he sought to <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/07/biden-gives-dems-a-pep-talk-after-voters-repudiation-00188240' tar...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/13/congress/donald-trump-joe-biden-meeting-00189125	2024-11-13T06:05:00-08:00	
State of Congress: Republicans near formal House majority	More than a week after Election Day, there are just a dozen House races left uncalled by The Associated Press. Republicans currently have 216 seats — just two away from formally clinching the majority — while Democrats have 207. In the remaining uncalled contests, Republicans currently lead in six, while Democrats have the advantage in six. Iowa’s 1st: Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R) leads by a razor-thin 731 votes over Democrat Christina Bohannan, but the AP has not yet called the race.

Democrat Dave Min keeps Katie Porter’s House seat blue	Republican Scott Baugh has conceded to Democratic state legislator Dave Min in a heated race to succeed California Rep. Katie Porter, ensuring the toss-up Orange County district remains in the Democratic column. 'I was looking forward to working with Democrats, Republicans and @therealdonaldtrump to solve serious problems like an open border, increasing crime, and runaway federal spending,' Baugh said in a statement Tuesday night, 'but the voters have spoken and this is not what is intended for me.'

Freedom Caucus backs off plan to push a challenger to Johnson	House conservatives are planning to force an internal vote on Mike Johnson’s speakership during Wednesday’s leadership election instead of throwing in an alternate candidate, two people familiar with the discussions told POLITICO. Johnson’s critics in the House Freedom Caucus have been deliberating for days over how to push back against proposed internal rules changes and send a message to the Louisiana Republican. Hours earlier, members of the group still expected to likely put forth a formal challenger against Johnson, though they hadn't publicly announced a name.

House GOP rule proposals spotlight battle between conservatives and leadership allies	House Republicans are primed for a nasty fight over their internal rules this week. A review of the 20 amendments submitted to the current rules, first reported by POLITICO, indicate an ongoing clash between conservatives, who are looking to strip more power from leadership, and other members who want to see disruptive GOP lawmakers punished. The amendments do not include proposed changes to the rules governing how to oust a speaker, known as a motion to vacate, though that doesn’t mean that fight is over. Currently, one member can trigger a vote to boot a speaker, and leadership and many House Republicans want to raise that threshold. Debate over that rule will likely reignite before the full House speakership vote on Jan. 3, when the party is slated to deliberate broader House rules afte...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/12/congress/house-gops-rules-war-00189229	2024-11-12T19:19:59-08:00

GOP Rep. Valadao holds Central Valley, California, swing seat	California Republican Rep. David Valadao will maintain his grip on his swing seat in the Central Valley. Valadao was a top target for Democrats, who were hoping an uptick in voter turnout this year could finally clinch the district they’ve been eyeing for several cycles. He has represented the area for nearly a decade — save for the 2018 race, where he was defeated by former Rep. TJ Cox. After winning back that seat in 2020, Valadao went on to be one of only 10 Republicans to vote to impeach former President Donald Trump following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. He narrowly won reelection the next year.	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/12/david-valadao-wins-california-22-race-00187080	2024-11-12T18:54:49-08:00	https://static.politico.com/41/02/b1ab69894761af2830e6fa84e5e0/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2173454398
Elon Musk to lead ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ in Trump administration	The world’s richest person has a new job. Elon Musk will lead a newly created 'Department of Government Efficiency' that will spearhead efforts to shrink the federal government, President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday.

Then, at 4 a.m. Milwaukee reported approximately 108,000 absentee ballots, with Senator Baldwin receiving nearly 90% of those ballots. Statistically, this outcome seems improbable.'

'It's been the greatest honor of my life to lead you, to serve you, to care for you, to defend you, just as you defended us generation after generation after generation.' Biden was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris, their first joint appearance since last week’s loss. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff, first lady Jill Biden, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough and top military officials also attended. In his speech, the president brought up the withdrawal from Afghanistan, which led to the death of 13 U.S. service members, saying...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/11/congress/bidens-veterans-day-00188820	2024-11-11T11:07:02-08:00	
DOJ says Jack Smith’s delay in Trump case is no reason to do the same for Jan. 6 defendants	Special counsel Jack Smith’s decision to pause his prosecution of President-elect Donald Trump is no reason to do the same for members of the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the Justice Department argued Monday. Several Jan. 6 defendants have used Smith’s call for a three-week breather — quickly endorsed by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan — as proof that all criminal cases connected to the Jan. 6 attack deserve a similar slowdown. 'To deny this motion, in the face of the Justice Department’s official position [in the Trump case], would run contrary to the interests of justice and likely subject the defendant to criminal convictions for no purpose other tha...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/11/congress/department-of-justice-january-6-cases-00188804	2024-11-11T10:31:17-08:00	
Top Senate GOP defense hawk has Pentagon budget boost plan — with sunnier post-Trump-win prospects	Sen. Roger Wicker, one of Capitol Hill’s most vocal defense hawks, will soon get the chance to pursue a larger Pentagon budget — and it stands a much better chance with Donald Trump headed back to the White House. The Mississippi Republican is poised to chair the Armed Services Committee after the GOP romped in Tuesday’s Senate elections. And he brings to the role a plan for tens of billions of dollars in new military spending to expand the Navy and Air Force, modernize the nuclear arsenal and ramp up defense manufacturing. 'We're not where we need to be in our Navy and our Air Force,' Wicker told Mississippi’s WAPT News in an election night interview. 'So that's going to be a...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/11/congress/wickers-pentagon-plans-00188777	2024-11-11T08:32:49-08:00	
Trump's border czar promises ‘hell of a lot more’ deportations than first term	President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to be 'border czar' is ready to execute his boss’ immigration agenda come hell or high water. 'I’ve got to go back and help because every morning I get up, every morning I'm pissed off about what this [Biden] administration did to the most secure border in my lifetime. So I'm going to go back and do what I can to fix it,' incoming Trump administration 'border czar' Thomas Homan said on 'Fox &amp; Friends' Monday morning just a few hours after Trump announced his selection on the Truth Social platform late Sunday nig...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/11/congress/tom-homan-trump-border-czar-00188776	2024-11-11T08:18:19-08:00	
Trump transition figure warns DOJ lawyers: Get on board or get out	A conservative lawyer working on Donald Trump’s transition, Mark Paoletta, offered a stark warning to career Justice Department lawyers Monday that those who refuse to advance Trump’s agenda should resign or face the possibility of being fired. 'Once the decision is made to move forward, career employees are required to implement the President’s plan,' Paoletta wrote in a post on X responding to a POLITICO story detailing widespread fear among DOJ lawyers about being asked to advance or defend policies they consider unethical or illegal. 'If these career DOJ employees won’t implement Preside...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/11/congress/mark-paoletta-justice-department-lawyers-00188772	2024-11-11T08:00:26-08:00

Republicans inch closer to formally locking up House majority	There are more than a dozen House contests — and a Senate race — still uncalled by The Associated Press, but Republicans are inching ever closer to officially retaining the House majority, as western states continue to slowly tally up their ballots. Arizona Senate: Several days of strong vote counting numbers have put Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) on the precipice of holding this Senate seat for his party, even as President-elect Donald Trump carried the state by nearly 6 percentage points. Gallego’s lead over GOP nominee Kari Lake was nearly 67,000 votes — or more than two percentage points — following a Sunday evening drop from Maricopa County. Advantage Gallego. <...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/11/congress/hill-state-of-play-00188743	2024-11-11T06:30:16-08:00	
Jockeying begins for Stefanik’s open House GOP leadership position	Several lawmakers are launching bids for the No. 4 position in House GOP leadership — seemingly the only wide open race after Donald Trump tapped Rep. Elise Stefanik for UN ambassador. Reps. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.), Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) and Erin Houchin (R-Ind.) are officially running for conference chair, according to McClain and people with direct knowledge of Cammack’s and Houchin's plans. McClain is presently serving in House Republican leadership as the conference secretary. Cammack has worked as recruitment chair of the House GOP campaign arm and unsuccessfully ran to lead the Republican Study Committee two years ago. Houchin, a first-term member who usually represents the freshmen class in weekly leadership meetings, formally announced her bid Monday in a letter colleagues.

Schumer withholds Senate orientation invite from McCormick	Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will not allow Sen.-elect Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) to participate in Senate orientation this week because he doesn't consider the race to be resolved yet. Though the Associated Press projected Thursday that McCormick defeated Democrat incumbent Bob Casey in Pennsylvania’s Senate race, Casey has yet to concede, claiming that there are still thousands of ballots left to be counted. 'With over 100,000 ballots left to be counted in Pennsylvania, the race has not been decided. As is custom, we will invite the winner once the votes are counted,' a spokesperson for Schumer wrote in a statement. As of Sunday at 4:30 p.m., McCormick was ahead by ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/10/schumer-casey-mccormick-senate-orientation-00188644	2024-11-10T14:01:54-08:00	https://static.politico.com/c2/8e/dbb8eee246d29fb8d332137690ec/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2161710190
Trump presses next GOP Senate leader to allow ‘recess appointments’	President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday said Senate Republicans’ next leader must embrace so-called 'recess appointments,' temporary appointments when the chamber is out of session that occur without the chamber’s formal seal of approval. 'Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,' Trump wrote in a post to the social media network X. 'Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more. This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again.' Notably, Trump did not endorse any of the three GOP candidates for Wednesday’s upcoming leadership election — Sens. John Thune (S.D.), John Cornyn (Texas) and Ric...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/10/trump-presses-next-republican-senate-leader-recess-appointments-00188640	2024-11-10T13:11:23-08:00	https://static.politico.com/55/79/7bc6542b4fb2aae026fe23172397/useuntil12-04-2024-donald-trump-michigan-020.jpg
After McCarthy ouster, GOP to consider new requirement for House leadership elections	House Republicans are set to consider a variety of new internal rules proposals this week, including some proposals that tie back to the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. While there is a broader push to amend the one-member threshold needed to trigger a motion to vacate, there are also some GOP members aiming to make internal changes to their party’s leadership election moving forward. Republicans from the various corners of the conference have put forward their proposals for the 119th Congress, which will be considered this week when the party votes on its new rules package Thursday. Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.) put forward a rules amendment that would require someone running for any leadership spot ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/10/mast-house-republicans-rules-00188631	2024-11-10T10:38:39-08:00	https://static.politico.com/5d/d0/c8846ea74e64baddbb4ace832350/election-2024-95353.jpg
Dearborn’s Arab Americans feel vindicated by Harris’ loss	DEARBORN, Michigan — Arab American leaders for months warned Vice President Kamala Harris that she needed to separate herself from President Joe Biden’s support of Israel in the war in Gaza — or face an electoral backlash from this influential community in a key battleground. But those pleas went largely ignored. Instead, Harris made strategic errors that deeply insulted Arab American voters reeling from intense grief as the death toll in the Middle East climbed. She refused to host a Palestinian American onstage at the Democratic National Convention. She curtly shut down protesters at campaign rallies who criticized her solidarity with Biden over the conflict. She dispatched pro-Israel surrogates to Michigan. Now, many Arab American residents in Dearborn 'feel like they’ve been redeemed,'...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/10/dearborn-vote-kamala-harris-trump-00188618	2024-11-10T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/4d/c6/86b79b1c4e63b4104aafbea5f94d/election-2024-michigan-84759.jpg
