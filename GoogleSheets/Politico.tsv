Johnson commits to working with Musk, Ramaswamy on spending cuts ahead of speakership vote	Speaker Mike Johnson committed to a number of new steps aimed at reining in the size and scope of the federal government as he seeks to round up the votes to retain his gavel. In a post on the social media site X just minutes before a speakership vote is set to begin, Johnson said he’d create 'a working group comprised of independent experts' to work with the so-called Department Of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy; review existing audits of federal agencies and instruct House committees to 'undertake aggressive authorizations and appropriations reviews.' 'I will lead the House Republicans to reduce the size and scope of the federal government, hold the bureaucracy accountable, a...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/johnsons-spending-promises-00196375	2025-01-03T09:30:19-08:00	
Centrists warn Johnson not to cut deals with conservatives to get the speakership	House centrists are warning Speaker Mike Johnson to not cut side deals with conservatives to win the gavel. The verbal red flag comes as Johnson is heading toward a showdown over keeping his speakership, with a vote set to begin shortly after noon. He doesn’t appear to have the votes to secure it on the first ballot, as one Republican vows to oppose him and about a dozen others are publicly undecided. Johnson’s right flank is making several demands, including seeking commitments on slashing spending. But it’s one significant ask — a bid to give Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) the Rules Committee gavel — that is sparking the biggest heartburn. Unlike most top committee spots, who gets the Rules gavel is up to the speaker alone. That powerful panel controls what party-line legislation heads to the f...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/centrists-warning-to-johnson-00196365	2025-01-03T08:55:54-08:00	
Thune: The filibuster survives under my watch	Soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader John Thune will kick off his tenure atop the chamber by committing, again, to preserving the legislative filibuster, according to excerpts of his prepared remarks obtained by POLITICO. 'One of my priorities as leader will be to ensure that the Senate stays the Senate,' Thune’s prepared remarks read. 'That means preserving the legislative filibuster — the Senate rule that today has perhaps the greatest impact in preserving the Founders’ vision of the Senate.' 'That includes empowering committees, restoring regular order, and engaging in extended debate on the Senate floor, where all members should have a chance to make their voices — and the voices of their constituents — heard,' the remarks add. Holding the filibuster in tact could be a lofty task. Preside...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/senate-filibuster-republicans-keep-00196359	2025-01-03T08:54:16-08:00	
Some of Johnson's detractors think he'll still win	Some potential Republican holdouts are signaling they’re preparing for Mike Johnson to win the speaker’s gavel Friday, in a positive shift for Johnson as his speakership hangs in the balance. Some of the Louisianan's detractors have privately said that they will 'vote for Trump’s agenda,' making clear that they will either support Johnson on the first ballot or at least after the first few rounds of voting, according to three Republicans familiar with the conversations who were granted anonymity to candidly discuss them. However, key holdout Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) has not yet privately expressed that same sentiment, four Republicans similarly granted anonymity said. Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.), another remaining holdout, said Friday at the Capitol that he thinks Johnson will be elected —...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/mike-johnson-vote-count-latest-00196354	2025-01-03T07:46:14-08:00	
House Republican conference staffs up ahead of 119th Congress	The House Republican Conference is staffing up heading into the 119th Congress.

Trump taps more business leaders as ambassadors	President-elect Donald Trump has selected two more wealthy business leaders for ambassadorships. He has tapped health care executive Benjamin Leon Jr. for the post in Spain and chosen entrepreneur Joe Popolo to head to the Netherlands. Both positions will require Senate confirmation, but that should not prove a major hurdle given that Republicans control the upper chamber. Leon has made his fortune in the health care industry. He’s an avid equestrian and philanthropist, according to online biographies. Much of Leon's work and philanthropy has been concentrated in Florida.

Trump’s former air chief may helm EPA landing team	Former acting EPA air chief Anne Idsal Austin is a member of the Trump transition landing team at the agency — and may be leading it, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss the transition. The Texas lawyer, who also served as a regional EPA administrator early in President-elect Donald Trump’s first term, is one of several landing team member names that have been shared with EPA career staff, said the people briefed on the agency’s transition. There’s less clarity about whether she is leading the team charged with readying EPA for Trump’s second term, which begins Jan. 20. Austin’s name has been circulated for months now as a likely transition team member.

Trump digs in on Johnson support as speaker showdown looms	Mike Johnson is heading toward a noon showdown over the fate of his speakership — even as President-elect Donald Trump doubled down on his support Friday morning. The House will kick off the new Congress and move almost immediately to a vote for the speaker’s gavel, with Johnson likely still short of the votes to retain the gavel with just hours to go. 'Good luck today for Speaker Mike Johnson, a fine man of great ability, who is very close to having 100% support. A win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party, and yet another acknowledgment of our 129 year most consequential Presidential Election!! - A BIG AFFIRMATION, INDEED. MAGA!'

Who to watch as Johnson’s speakership hangs in the balance	Mike Johnson can likely only afford to lose a single GOP vote if he wants to remain speaker. He’s already got one Republican promising to oppose him, and about a dozen more who won’t commit to backing him. Many of those publicly undecided lawmakers have indicated they won’t reveal how they plan to vote ahead of time so, for now, it’s impossible to predict if Johnson can succeed. And while Speaker Mike Johnson said Thursday that it was his 'plan' to win on the first ballot that will commence shortly after noon on Friday, even his allies are telegraphing that it might take a few votes before he clinches it. The House is starting the 119th Congress with effectively a 219-215 GOP-led chamber, assuming former Rep. Matt Gaetz doesn’t participate. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has already said he’ll...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/who-to-watch-on-speakership-vote-00196337	2025-01-03T06:06:21-08:00

Johnson tries to avoid McCarthy pitfalls as he preps for a speaker showdown	Mike Johnson is trying to avoid the mistakes of his predecessor as he faces the toughest test of his political career on Friday. With his bid to keep his speakership on the line — despite support from President-elect Donald Trump — the Louisiana Republican is looking to sidestep the kinds of side deals with conservative Republicans that ultimately cost Kevin McCarthy his own political future. But that's a hard tightrope to cross. Fiscal hawks want Johnson to make commitments, including giving them greater control over how bills move to the floor and slashing spending — pledges that could be untenable for Johnson with a razor-thin GOP margin. And while conservatives believe that Johnson is keeping an open mind on some of their demands, they’re also concerned about whether he will keep the t...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/03/mike-johnson-kevin-mccarthy-speaker-fight-00196317	2025-01-03T02:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/85/0e/cd16a11f49628dc5c435df6f4caa/u-s-congress-69809.jpg
Buddy MacKay, a Democrat who briefly served as Florida’s governor, dead at 91	TALLAHASSEE, Florida — Former Florida Gov. Buddy MacKay, who lost to Jeb Bush in 1998 but still served 23 days in office after the sudden death of Gov. Lawton Chiles, has died. He was 91. The former Democratic governor took a nap after lunch at his home in Ocklawaha, Florida, on Tuesday and never woke up, his son Ken MacKay told The Associated Press. All of the governor’s adult children were present at the time, he said. 'It was a very peaceful end to a great life,' said MacKay, who hopes his father is remembered as a defender of Florida’s environment and an advocate for minorities. Floridians honored MacKay not just for his brief service as governor, but his time as a state legislator, congressman and diplomat. 'We mourn the passing of Buddy MacKay,' Gov. Ron DeSantis posted on X.

There’s a big problem with trying to replace Johnson — no clear alternates	Even House Republicans who are skeptical about keeping Mike Johnson on as speaker acknowledge they have a persistent problem: Who could replace him? As Johnson faces potentially a dozen holdouts or more going into the speakership vote on Friday, three familiar alternative candidates have come up in internal GOP conversations: Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan of Ohio and GOP Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota. All three ran for the speakership in October 2023 before Johnson was elected to take the gavel, and all three were forced to drop their bids as it became obvious they couldn’t get the near-unanimous support needed from House Republicans. Their prospects haven’t changed a ton since then — each still has a faction of the conference that would likely oppose...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/02/house-speaker-johnson-alternates-00196311	2025-01-02T15:01:26-08:00	https://static.politico.com/d3/a4/0557cbd64be79dc33442730e49b5/u-s-congress-31602.jpg
House ethics watchdog unfurls campaign finance allegations against two members	The House’s nonpartisan ethics watchdog found 'substantial reason to believe' that two members may have violated campaign finance regulations, according to a pair of reports released Thursday. The Office of Congressional Ethics wrote that Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) may have 'omitted or misrepresented required information in his financial disclosure statements or FEC candidate committee reports' and that his campaign committee 'may have accepted excessive contributions that were reported as personal loans and contributions from the candidate.' Ogles had originally reported a $320,000 loan to his campaign during his 2022 campaign, although it ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/02/congress/house-ethics-violations-allegations-00196307	2025-01-02T14:23:36-08:00	
Trump throws more weight behind Johnson's speakership bid	President-elect Donald Trump is throwing more weight behind Mike Johnson's speakership bid, as a handful of Republicans are weighing whether to block Johnson's attempt to reclaim the gavel in less than 24 hours. Johnson’s team and Trump officials have discussed a list of GOP holdouts for the president-elect to call, according to three Republicans who were granted anonymity to speak candidly. And Johnson has signaled he's willing to make some concessions to keep the gavel, as hardliners make various demands, including top positions on the Rules Committee and commitments on spending. He told reporters Thursday afternoon that he was 'open' to some of the process reforms the hardliners are pushing, though it wasn't immediately clear what he was referring to.

Bernie Sanders: ‘Elon Musk is wrong’ on guest workers	Sen. Bernie Sanders says Elon Musk 'is wrong' when it comes to his support of the H-1B visa program, which allows high-skilled foreigners to legally work in the United States. Musk and fellow Trump adviser Vivek Ramaswamy are 'right' that the U.S. needs a skilled and educated workforce, Sanders said in a statement, but the visa program needs 'major reforms.' 'The answer is to hire qualified American workers first and to make certain that we have an education system that produces the kind of workforce that our country needs for the jobs of the future,' Sanders (I-Vt.), soon-to-be ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said.

Biden admin cedes pivotal air pollution rules to Trump	As the Biden administration enters its final weeks, EPA continues to press forward on some fronts, while relinquishing on others to incoming President-elect Donald Trump.

How a long speaker fight could impact Trump’s ability to start his next term	If Republicans fail to elect a speaker Friday, the ensuing chaos could impact two of the most crucial moments enshrined in the Constitution: the Jan. 6 certification of the 2024 election, and — if things really go haywire — the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has endorsed Speaker Mike Johnson for another stint atop the House and has privately indicated that he doesn’t want Republicans delaying his priorities with a drawn-out speaker fight. But Johnson’s restive right flank is weighing opposing him anyway, and the House is essentially frozen until it elects a speaker. So if the election to lead the House is significantly delayed, it will have a cascading effect that could upend the transfer of power from Joe Biden to Trump in unpredictable ways.

Barrasso criticizes Cheney over the Presidential Citizens Award	President Joe Biden naming former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) as one of 20 recipients of the Presidential Citizens Award is already drawing backlash from her home state senator. GOP Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, in a statement, said Biden 'was either going to pardon Liz Cheney or give her an award. She doesn’t deserve either. She represents partisanship and divisiveness — not Wyoming.' Barrasso is set to become the Senate GOP whip. Biden on Thursday announced he would award Cheney, an outspoken critic of President-elect Donald Trump, and 19 others with the Presidential Citizens Award, which honors people who have performed 'exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens.' In the announcement, Biden highlighted Cheney’s role as chair and vice chair of the House Jan. 6 c...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/02/congress/liz-cheney-biden-award-00196271	2025-01-02T11:50:21-08:00	
Johnson doesn’t have the votes to remain speaker. But his allies insist it’s trending his way.	With less than 24 hours left until the start of the 119th Congress, Mike Johnson doesn’t have the votes yet to remain speaker. The Louisiana Republican has been working diligently over the past few days to lock down the 218 votes he needs, even after spending the holidays working the phones and meeting with incoming President-elect Donald Trump. But even the incoming president’s repeated endorsement earlier this week doesn’t mean Johnson is guaranteed a victory. Roughly a dozen Republicans are still on the fence, as some of them try to get concessions on the rules or commitments from Johnson on spending. There are some positive signs for the speaker. In addition to Trump’s restated backing, Johnson has managed to keep his official 'no' votes to only one so far — Rep.

'Officers took the man into custody.'

But their early treatment of the first openly transgender House member is likely just a preview of how they'll navigate transgender politics and policies for the next two years. Believing voters in the 2024 elections rejected Democrats’ more inclusive positions on transgender rights, Republicans appear ready in 2025 to double down in support of executive orders and provisions in spending bills that would make it harder for transgender individuals to get health care, serve in the military or participate in school activities.

House rules would make it harder to oust speaker in next Congress	Republicans will make it harder to remove the speaker in the 119th Congress under a rules package unveiled Wednesday. The proposed rules package would require nine GOP members to back making a motion to vacate to trigger a vote on ousting the speaker. That’s an increase from the current rule, which allows any single GOP member to force a vote. The deal to increase the threshold was negotiated in November by members of the House Freedom Caucus and the small business-oriented Main Street Caucus last year — an agreement that was first reported by POLITICO. Even after a vote is triggered, it still requires the support of a majority of the House in order for a speaker to be removed.

Chris Sununu still believes the GOP is bigger than Donald Trump	Donald Trump remade the GOP in his image. Chris Sununu doesn’t think it’ll stick. That’s because the outgoing Republican governor of New Hampshire, who routinely oscillates between supporting Trump and criticizing him, believes his party is bigger than both its enduring standard bearer and the political movement he created. 'Trump is extremely unique. There's no ‘Trump lite’ or ‘Trump 2.0’ that can replace or replicate what he's brought to the table, for better or for worse,' Sununu said in an interview. And the GOP, he insists, is still a 'big tent,' ticking off varied constituencies like the Log Cabin Republicans, fiscal hawks, libertarian-leaners and social conservatives.

Trump says he would make calls for Mike Johnson	President-elect Donald Trump said he is willing to make calls to lawmakers to drum up support for Mike Johnson should there be a risk to his speakership ahead of a vote expected Friday on Capitol Hill. Speaking briefly with reporters outside of a New Year’s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect reaffirmed his support for the Louisiana Republican after his formal endorsement on Monday, saying 'he’s the one that can win right now.' The boost of support comes as Johnson’s path to retaining the speakership is tenuous. With the expected makeup of Congress on Friday, he can only have two Republican defections — and Rep.

How they got here: Fields won his return to Congress after defeating Republican Elbert Guillory and Democrat Quentin Anderson. He notched nearly 51 percent of the vote. Inside the campaign: The race for the seat began in earnest when Republican Gov. Jeff Landry agreed to redraw the state’s congressional map to create a second majority-minority district. The resulting seat, which includes much of Baton Rouge, Shreveport and Lafayette, forced out incumbent Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.). The issues he’ll focus on: Fields is no stranger to Washington, having served two terms in the House in the 1990s. He vowed during his latest campaign to prioritize education, health care, expanded broadband and economic growth as part of...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/30/congress/meet-the-new-members-00196125	2024-12-30T09:53:56-08:00	
Elaine Chao's advice for Trump's Labor and Transportation secretaries	Nothing much surprised Elaine Chao when she was named secretary of Labor by former President George W. Bush or secretary of Transportation during Donald Trump’s first term. That’s because she had served in other cabinet positions — and has been vetted five times by the FBI. So she knew the ropes. Chao, whose husband is Sen. Mitch McConnell, isn’t working for Trump this time around, but she has thoughts on what his next administration should be paying attention to. What advice do you have for the next Cabinet secretaries in your positions? No. 1, personnel is policy.

Trump endorses Johnson for speaker	Speaker Mike Johnson picked up a key endorsement from President-elect Donald Trump in his bid to serve another term.

Happy New Year, the debt limit is here. Get ready for an all-out war over it.	GOP leaders are staring down two bad options to solve President-elect Donald Trump's debt-limit problem, after failing to execute his demand to lift the federal borrowing cap in the last government funding bill. One path requires full buy-in from Republican lawmakers to address the issue via budget reconciliation — a huge challenge thanks to the party’s fierce fiscal hawks. The other entails winning over Democrats, who for the most part rejected Trump’s initial debt-limit gambit last week. 'Whoever advised the president that it was even possible needs to better understand how this place works,' Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said about Trump’s latest push to raise the debt limit.

Tributes pour in for Jimmy Carter	Former President Jimmy Carter’s death on Sunday prompted an outpouring of tributes from fellow presidents and politicians. 'Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well,' President Joe Biden said in a statement with first lady Jill Biden. The Bidens celebrated the long and loving marriage between Carter and his wife Rosalynn, writing that it was 'the definition of partnership and their humble leadership is the definition of patriotism.'

Former President Jimmy Carter dead at 100	Jimmy Carter had such confidence in his improbable path to the White House that he bet Americans worn down by Vietnam and Watergate would welcome a new kind of president: a peanut farmer who carried his own bags, worried about the heating bill and told it, more or less, like it was. And for a time, the voters embraced him. Yet just four years later, in the aftermath of a presidency that was widely seen as failed, it sometimes seemed as if all that was left of Carter was the smile — the wide, toothy grin that helped elect him in the first place, then came to be caricatured by countless cartoonists as an emblem of naïveté. But it was Carter’s great fortune to enjoy a post-presidency more than 10 times as long as his tenure in office — in March 2019, he became the longest-lived president ever...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/29/jimmy-carter-former-president-dead-at-100-033324	2024-12-29T13:25:18-08:00	https://static.politico.com/d0/da/4ee6068d421a995375dae1c9c618/carteroverride.jpg
Eric Schmitt, Ro Khanna voice support for H-1B visa reform, as GOP clashes over immigration	A Silicon Valley Democrat and a Republican Senator are calling for reform to the H-1B Visa program, which tech companies use to recruit thousands of high-skilled foreign workers every year. 'So I think the solution here, President Trump has actually articulated this in 2020, is to reform that system and get rid of the abuses, make it merit-based, and make sure that we're not undercutting wages, and having Americans train their foreign replacements,' Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) told 'Fox News Sunday' anchor Shannon Bream.

Is the Democratic brand toxic? A growing number of Dems wonder if going ‘independent’ will help them win	Losing to a twice-impeached convicted felon has left a small, but growing, number of Democrats wondering if their party brand is so toxic that they should shed the label — particularly in battleground and red states. Mike Duggan, the longtime Democratic mayor of Detroit, is pursuing an independent campaign for governor in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory in his state. Democratic strategists are studying this year’s bid by independent Dan Osborn, who as a Senate candidate in Nebraska overperformed the top of the ticket, as a model to win the upper chamber. And a Joe Biden mega-fundraiser is floating a gubernatorial run in Florida on what he calls the 'Capitalist Party' ticket.

Trump, in an interview with the New York Post on Saturday, praised the use of visas to bring skilled foreign workers to the U.S. The topic has become a flashpoint within his conservative base.

'Treasury currently expects to reach the new limit between January 14 and January 23, at which time it will be necessary for Treasury to start taking extraordinary measures,' Yellen wrote in a letter to congressional leadership. The debt limit has been suspended since June 2023 when Congress passed a bipartisan deal reached between then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden.

Republican brawl on immigration erupts as MAGA and tech world clash	An online debate over high-skilled immigration between Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and MAGA evangelists reveals Donald Trump’s Republican Party is grappling with growing pains as it prepares to retake the White House. Days after the powerful allies of Trump in Silicon Valley took to social media to argue for a greater number of high-skilled immigrants, with a side-swipe at American culture for emphasizing 'mediocrity over excellence,' some members of the far-right said such policies would make America 'look like India.'

Roy hails Musk, Ramaswamy influence on spending as Hill GOP looks toward cuts	DOGE co-chairs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will have significant influence in how Congress slashes spending, Rep. Chip Roy said in an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Friday. 'When the DOGE guys came in, Elon and Vivek, I pointed to my Republican colleagues and I said, ‘You know what the problem is, right here in this room,’' Roy said. 'We have Republicans and Democrats who never met a program they didn’t want to promote for some sort of political gain.' Roy, the Freedom Caucus policy chair, added that Musk and Ramaswamy were working to identify spending waste, and the two businessmen could use their platforms to shine a light on the issue. Roy also floated potential examples of spending cuts, including the restricting the use of food stamps and repealing the Inflation Reduction Act.

Former FBI and CIA head prods Senate to reject Patel, Gabbard	A former head of the FBI and CIA is raising objections over whether Kash Patel and Tulsi Gabbard, President-elect Donald Trump's picks to be directors of the FBI and national intelligence, respectively, are qualified to serve in the Cabinet. In a letter to senators on Thursday, William Webster, the only person to lead both the FBI and CIA, wrote that neither nominee meets the demands of top intelligence jobs. Webster, who is 100 years old, praised Patel's patriotism but wrote that his allegiance to Trump was concerning. 'His record of executing the president’s directives suggest a loyalty to individuals rather than the rule of law — a dangerous precedent for an agency tasked with impartial enforcement of justice,' he said.

'We do need to consider whether — if we’re going to advance Mr. Trump’s agenda — whether the current leadership is what we need.'

How Schumer is prepping for Trump 2.0	In less than a month, elected Democrats will find themselves with a lot less power in Washington, with a GOP-controlled House, Senate and White House resulting in a landscape in which their ability to tussle with President-elect Donald Trump will be largely rhetorical. But if Dem leaders have learned one thing from Republicans over the years, it’s that sometimes, the judiciary can be the best bulwark against the opposing party getting what it wants. As our Anthony Adragna reported Friday, Senate Democrats have approved 235 of Biden’s judicial picks, eclipsing Trump's 234 first-term judicial nominations.

Expect a quieter Jan. 6 this time around — as long as Republicans avert a looming speakership crisis	Donald Trump’s victory has made Jan. 6 boring again. Four years after a mob of Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s victory, Republicans and Democrats seem to agree they’ll give Trump the smooth, drama-free transfer of power he denied Democrats in 2020. That’s despite the fact that many Democrats see Trump as an insurrectionist, ineligible to hold the presidency because of his role in creating the conditions that led to the attack four years earlier. Instead, top Democrats say they have no plans to stand in the way of Trump’s victory — and they’re not even sure their rank-and-file colleagues will make the token objections they’ve lodged in years past.

Inside how the Capitol Police has changed since Jan. 6, 2021	As Congress prepares to certify another election on Jan. 6, the U.S. Capitol Police looks like a vastly different agency than it was ahead of the attack on the Capitol four years ago. Security officials on the Hill were widely excoriated for the lack of preparedness ahead of the attempted insurrection, prompting multiple high-level resignations in the following weeks. An oft-repeated criticism was that officials should have requested help prior to the attack, given clear signals that there would be a huge protest coming to the area with the potential to turn violent. Those issues coincided with a steep increase in violent threats made against members of Congress. With that in mind, Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger has sought to shift the agency’s identity as a traditional police force with ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/25/capitol-police-change-since-jan-6-00195947	2024-12-25T11:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/6b/b1/d8692b46487aa4df50c06b903c0b/capitol-buildling-at-night-capitol-hill-92913.jpg

Conservatives hope to enlist Trump in their spending war. It won’t be that easy.	Conservatives who want to slash the federal budget are hoping they can enlist President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk to their side come January. But last week’s meltdown over government funding underscored that Trump doesn't always share their fiscal restraint. Though Trump and Musk helped upend an initial bipartisan appropriations deal loathed by fiscal hardliners, 38 House Republicans later balked at Trump’s big demand in the next bill: a looser limit on Washington’s borrowing authority. That move is a reminder that Trump exploded the deficit and greenlit billions in additional spending during his first term — two overall budget concerns that the House Republicans who opposed last week’s bill say they want to fix. After the debt ceiling battle last week, the fiscal rebels, GOP leader...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/24/conservatives-trump-spending-war-wont-be-easy-00195951	2024-12-24T03:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/3e/51/98475ae04989bc60bf77a281d152/house-members-during-cr-vote-69545.jpg

'I know that some people out there are saying, ‘Well, he's putting pressure on everybody.’ That's nothing new. We get that kind of pressure on a regular basis,' South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said in an interview on today’s POLITICO Tech podcast. Rounds, who serves on the Intelligence and Armed Services committees, and has been a key voice on AI and cybersecurity policy on Capitol Hill, was responding to questions about Musk's influence after the billionaire <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/18/elon-musk-false-claims...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/23/congress/elon-musk-trump-00195882	2024-12-23T07:22:41-08:00

Josh Gottheimer promised an abortion protection bill. Eight months later, he hasn’t moved it.	In April, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer called a press conference in front of a Planned Parenthood office in northern New Jersey to announce new legislation designed to protect women. Gottheimer, who was widely known to be planning a run for governor, said the bill was in response to a push by anti-abortion groups to use the 151-year-old Comstock Act to ban the mailing of mifepristone — a drug used to induce abortions and treat miscarriages. 'Let’s be clear: without access to safe and legal reproductive health care, women will die,' Gottheimer said at the time. But eight months later, the congress...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/23/josh-gottheimer-abortion-protection-bill-00195840	2024-12-23T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/a3/e0/130efaac4d708e46b5a81e33bfb5/house-of-representatives-29195.jpg

Ethics report alleges Gaetz paid 17-year-old for sex	A yearslong House Ethics Committee investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz found 'substantial evidence' that the Florida Republican committed statutory rape, solicited prostitutes and used illegal drugs, according to a copy of the report obtained by POLITICO. The report's most explosive allegation, which Gaetz has long denied, is that he had sex twice with a 17-year-old girl at a party in July 2017, when he was 35 and serving in the House. Ethics Committee investigators found that he later paid the girl — part of a trend laid out in the report of him paying women after sexual encounters. Gaetz has repeatedly denied that he broke any laws. 'These claims would be destroyed in court — which is why they were never made in any court against me,' he told POLITICO Friday morning. But the commit...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/23/matt-gaetz-ethics-report-findings-00195875	2024-12-23T05:41:10-08:00	https://static.politico.com/51/b6/53f628b9446080d44b0fe0d19f38/young-republican-gala-new-york-20131.jpg
Trump’s big Mike Johnson decision	After the House passed a shutdown-averting spending bill Friday, a very relieved Speaker Mike Johnson proclaimed to reporters that President-elect Donald Trump was 'certainly happy about this outcome.' Not by a long shot. Amid the chaos in Washington, I was in Palm Beach talking to people close to the past and future president and called up other confidants afterward. This much became clear to me: Not only is Trump unhappy with the funding deal, he’s unhappy with Johnson, too. He’s unhappy that he didn’t get the debt ceiling hike he made clear he wanted. He felt blindsided by the initial deal Johnson struck with Democrats. And, in the end, he was unimpressed with the entire chaotic process, which left the...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/23/mike-johnson-speaker-trump-limbo-00195854	2024-12-23T03:01:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/d0/aa/d1c77c4b48fab28feb9abf49469c/congress-budget-37097.jpg
In Arizona speech, Trump jokes Musk is ‘not going to be president’	President-elect Donald Trump is setting the record straight: He’s calling the shots, not Elon Musk. 'No, he's not going to be president, that I can tell you,' Trump said with a laugh at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix on Sunday, his first major speech following the November election. 'And I'm safe. You know why? He can’t be. He wasn't born in this country.' The president-elect made the tongue-in-cheek comment while praising South African-born Musk as a 'great guy.' Musk, along with tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, is set to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, an agency with the goal of shrinking the size of government and cutting spending. Trump’s comments came as Democrats have sought to use Musk, the world’s richest person, as a foil, accusing him of undermining th...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/22/trump-musk-arizona-turning-point-00195860	2024-12-22T17:14:25-08:00	https://static.politico.com/8e/60/900aca2342c2b3c0ccfbf64dbd5e/trump-84154.jpg
Trump expected to pick Andrew Peek for NSC post focused on Europe	A top aide for Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fl.) is slated to join the Trump administration National Security Council, two people familiar with the plan confirmed. President-elect Donald Trump plans to name Andrew Peek, a veteran of the first Trump administration, as senior director for Europe and Eurasia at the NSC, the people said, though they cautioned that the appointment wasn’t yet settled. They were granted anonymity to discuss internal transition matters. Peek, if picked, would play an outsized role in crafting the Trump administration’s approach toward Russia, the war in Ukraine and NATO. Trump has vowed to broker peace in Ukraine soon after entering office, but has yet to outline a detailed plan on how to do so.

Fetterman: Patel pledged to not go after political enemies	Kash Patel, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for FBI Director, claimed he would not go after his political enemies to Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), despite Patel’s past claims that he would. In an interview with Jonathan Karl on ABC’s 'This Week,' Fetterman said that Patel told him he would use the FBI to go after Trump’s enemies, despite his comments vowing to go after Trump’s political enemies. 'So I'm not going to go into detail, but he absolutely, — that's never going to happen,' Fetterman said when asked about Patel’s past comments pledging to go after Trump’s enemies. 'That’s not it … that's what he claims.'

Congress clears government shutdown patch following Trump, Musk disruptions	In Congress’ last action of the year, the Senate passed a funding patch early Saturday with more than $110 billion in disaster aid, averting a government shutdown and closing out the 118th Congress. Final passage of the bill, which made it through the House Friday evening, caps off a tumultuous week on Capitol Hill as Speaker Mike Johnson managed the last-minute demands of President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk, along with the ensuing furor of congressional Democrats whose votes are needed to pass funding bills amid conservative opposition. While the speaker abandoned his initial bipartisan deal with Democrats at Trump’s and Musk’s urging, he failed to fulfill the president-elect’s demand for lifting the debt limit. The end result is a spending patch that retains some of the initial bi...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/21/congress-clears-government-shutdown-patch-00195785	2024-12-20T21:38:54-08:00	https://static.politico.com/20/0e/50597aab4596a6a3e02cc09dd56c/u-s-congress-07662.jpg
Social Security measure passes Senate, sending it to Biden	The Senate broadly approved a measure expanding Social Security payments to millions of certain public sector workers, sending the measure to President Joe Biden for his signature. The vote on the Social Security Fairness Act was 76-20. It previously passed the House in an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 327-75 in November after rank-and-file lawmakers used a procedural measure, known as a discharge petition, to force a floor vote without House GOP leaders’ blessing. 'We will vote on taking up the Social Security Fairness Act to repeal flawed policies that eat away at the benefits of those who've worked as teachers, firefighters, postal workers, or public sector workers,' Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said ahead of the vote.

Barbara Lee said Friday she will announce in early January whether she plans to run for mayor of Oakland as the city holds a special election following the recall of its last mayor. Lee, who leaves Congress early next year, tweeted that she is considering running — the first official confirmation that she might vie to lead the turbulent Bay Area city following months of speculation about her intentions.

Dems fight to Trump-proof the federal judiciary	Democrats on Friday hit a major milestone, confirming more judges under President Joe Biden than Republicans did in President-elect Donald Trump’s first term. It deprives Trump of putting a bigger conservative stamp on the judiciary — and Democrats will have leverage to continue fighting next year. Senate Democrats, despite a narrow majority, have approved 235 of Biden’s judicial picks, eclipsing the 234 judicial nominations Trump got through in his first term. Biden has now appointed a range of judges amounting to about a fourth of the overall federal judiciary. In a move that could further dent Trump’s judicial impact even with a GOP Senate majority, Democrats are poised to put pressure on Republicans to maintain a practice that requires sign-off from a state’s two senators for lower-lev...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/20/democrats-judges-trump-proof-00195701	2024-12-20T16:12:13-08:00	https://static.politico.com/d9/60/9dae21d34d68a25ed43a57e13f13/senate-democrat-leadership-elections-30378.jpg
Biden to back eleventh-hour funding bill	The White House has endorsed a revised bill funding the government, pledging to back the stopgap measure even as it blasted Republicans for reneging on an earlier bipartisan deal. 'President Biden supports moving this legislation forward and ensuring that the vital services the government provides for hardworking Americans,' press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Friday evening, 'from issuing Social Security checks to processing benefits for veterans.' The administration’s support came as the bill was poised to sail through the House, after House Democrats agreed to vote for the three-month funding package that includes disaster aid and a one-year farm bill extension. That proposal was trimmed down significantly from an earlier bipartisan agreement, which President-elect Do...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/20/congress/biden-funding-bill-shutdown-00195773	2024-12-20T15:29:45-08:00	
House passes government spending package after Trump, Musk fueled chaos	The House passed a stopgap package Friday evening that pushes the government funding deadline to March, as Congress races to avoid a looming deadline that would shut down the government in six hours. The package passed 366-34, with the support of 196 Democrats and 170 Republicans. It now moves to the Senate, where leaders are hoping to lock in an agreement to fast-track final passage of the measure, racing against the midnight government shutdown deadline. The package’s passage seemingly ends a chaotic 48 hours, after Elon Musk and President-elect Donald Trump worked to spike a previously-negotiated bipartisan funding agreement. The package that passed the House includes more than $110 billion in disaster aid and a one-year farm bill extension but is stripped of Trump’s demand: a debt limi...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/20/congress/house-passes-funding-package-government-shutdown-00195737	2024-12-20T15:03:57-08:00	
Trump’s wake-up call: Republicans are willing to defy him	Donald Trump is getting a rude awakening that his grip on the GOP isn’t absolute. In less than 24 hours, 38 House Republicans rejected the stopgap spending bill that the president-elect publicly threw his weight behind after tanking Speaker Mike Johnson’s original proposal to keep the federal government running past Friday. And their defiance came even as Trump and his allies threatened to field primary challenges against GOP members who didn’t fall in line. It was only the latest example of Trump confronting the limits of his power, especially over his own party. Senate Republicans already dealt Trump a massive blow when a handful of them made clear they wouldn’t support Trump’s first choice for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, leading to him withdrawing. And that was after they chose John T...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/20/trump-shut-down-republicans-00195728	2024-12-20T14:22:09-08:00	https://static.politico.com/1f/c6/ef353f9b4f6681c36768053b6c37/trump-95690.jpg

In recent weeks, Lewandowski has sat in on transition meetings with Noem, Trump’s pick to head DHS, and consulted with her on political appointees for the sprawling agency, said three of the people, who were granted anonymity as a condition of sharing details on the transition. It is not clear if Lewandowski has an official role yet in the transition or is helping in a personal capacity, according to two of the people.

McConnell will exit leadership next term, but remain in the conference as a rank-and-file member. He is not up for reelection until 2026, and is expected to play a mentor role for Senate Republicans next term. He has served as GOP leader for nearly two decades and signaled he intends to stay involved in legislating, insisting the 'arsenal of democracy must be restored' and 'peace through strength must once again actually mean something other than just a slogan.'

House Republicans float a debt limit, spending pact deal — with themselves	House GOP leaders laid out a plan Friday to avert the upcoming debt cliff on their own next year, despite President-elect Donald Trump’s insistence that Congress handle it before he takes office. During a closed-door conference meeting Friday afternoon, House Republican leaders proposed a commitment to raising the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion early in 2025. GOP leaders would pair that with a $2.5 trillion cut in 'mandatory' spending, the category of government funding that largely runs on autopilot and bankrolls benefits programs like Medicaid, Social Security, SNAP nutrition assistance, Medicare and welfare payments to the poorest Americans. Under the proposed plan, hiking the debt limit and cutting spending would be done through the filibuster-skirting process Republicans hope to use ne...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/20/congress/gop-debt-limit-deal-details-00195671	2024-12-20T12:00:31-08:00	
Trump taps critic of Pope Francis for Vatican ambassadorship	President-elect Donald Trump said Friday that he is picking the head of a right-wing Catholic advocacy group and critic of Pope Francis to serve as ambassador to the Holy See, potentially teeing up tensions with the Vatican. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that Brian Burch, head of the group Catholic Vote, 'loves his Church and the United States — He will make us all proud.' Trump also praised Burch for advocating for him and encouraging Catholics to vote for him in 2024. Burch will face a Senate confirmation process, but it is unlikely he will encounter stiff resistance from Republicans, as his views aren’t considered controversial in the party. Burch would be far from the first ambassador to the Holy See with a political background.

House Republicans voted in their closed-door conference meeting on Friday on the strategy, according to more than a dozen Republicans leaving the meeting. In addition to funding the government until March 14, the plan will also include a one-year farm bill extension and the $110 billion disaster aid package Republicans negotiated with Democrats. Republicans expect they will vote on the package on Friday, with less than 12 hours remaining until a shutdown deadline.

'We’re doing everything to ensure a smooth transition, but the choice to allow a transition to move forward is in the hands of Republicans in Congress.'
