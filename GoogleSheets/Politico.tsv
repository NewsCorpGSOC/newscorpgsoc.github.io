Ways and Means eyeing limits to corporate tax deductions	The House Ways and Means Committee is looking at limiting corporate state and local tax deductions as one way to offset the costs of a large party-line tax bill, according to two people familiar with the discussions. The panel, which oversees all tax policy, is considering the limit among other potential offsets for the bill, according to the people, who were granted anonymity to share private deliberations. Companies currently can deduct an unlimited amount of state income, property and sales taxes from their federal tax bill. The discussions signal that a proposal to limit corporate SALT, as the deduction is called, may have enough support among Republicans to make it into a party-line tax bill.

The House GOP budget resolution is in trouble	Speaker Mike Johnson is staring down at least a dozen Republican holdouts on the budget blueprint he wants to put on the House floor in the coming days — and he can only afford to lose one member and still approve the resolution along party lines. Johnson and his whip team are using the current week-long recess to ramp up engagement with undecided Republicans, including seven members — if not more — who have raised serious concerns about deep cuts to Medicaid in the House GOP budget resolution. Several other members are wary of a move to raise the debt limit as part of the pl...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/18/congress/budget-reconciliation-trump-whip-00204735	2025-02-18T13:59:31-08:00

Senate Republicans edge out the House again, planning budget vote this week	Senate Republicans will vote this week on a budget blueprint that would unlock a key part of President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda. 'It’s time to act on the decisive mandate the American people gave to President Trump in November,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune wrote on X Tuesday afternoon. 'Securing the border, rebuilding our defense, and unleashing American energy. That starts this week with passing [Budget Chair Lindsey Graham’s] budget.'

Senator says GOP's hands are tied on DOGE cuts — 'except complain'	Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley said Congress is powerless in the face of cuts from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. 'Congress can’t do anything except complain' about the slashing of the federal government at the hands of Musk and his allies, Grassley said during a press call on Tuesday, according to a report from RadioIowa. The Iowan's comments serve as a stark admission that, despite growing Republican discomfort that Musk's actions are getting the green light from President Donald Trump, there is little the GOP might be able, or willing, to do. Musk and his allies are leading an executive branch-wide effort to dism...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/18/congress/chuck-grassley-musk-doge-trump-00204687	2025-02-18T10:58:19-08:00

Trump is shocking official Washington. Will he leave his mark on the District too?	Donald Trump isn’t just looking to remake the federal government. He has his sights set on the city of Washington, too. In his first few weeks in office, the president has moved to drastically alter the fabric of the nation’s capital. He ordered thousands of Washington-area federal workers to return to the office — some of whom his administration is moving to lay off. He injected himself and his allies onto the board of the John F. Kennedy Center to recast 'woke' performing art culture. And the city's mayor said she has been briefed <a href='https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/16/trump-local-dc-city-politics-018777	2025-02-16T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/92/e6/1a2abd804202b6e1397ebe674b8e/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1574583084
Dems concede Republicans ‘running circles’ around them online as Trump remakes Washington	The Department of Government Efficiency created its own account on X last November, amassing 4 million followers with a stream of news on contract cancellations and other cuts to the bureaucracy. Elon Musk has posted relentlessly on the social media platform he owns, promoting his own voice on an algorithm he controls. The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, started a rapid response account in January with about 121,000 followers, a fraction of DOGE’s reach.

They’re not just suing to stop DOGE. They’re suing Elon Musk himself.	Elon Musk’s efforts to disrupt and dismantle the federal government at the behest of Donald Trump have already sparked a legion of lawsuits. Now the legal challengers are setting their sights on a new target: Musk himself. Two new cases accuse the ultra-wealthy CEO of illegally amassing too much government power without the accountability typically required of high-level executive branch officials. They are seeking court orders that would force Musk to halt the cost-cutting and information-gathering activities he has been spearheading through his U.S. DOGE Service. The lawsuits rest on a provision of the Constitution that says powerful federal officers must be 'established by law,' must be formally appointed by the president and must be confirmed by the Senate. Musk, of course, has not bee...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/14/elon-musk-doge-lawsuits-constitution-00204479	2025-02-14T16:04:32-08:00	https://static.politico.com/cc/59/adfce0824f4e8cf3d6f22040934a/trump-97597.jpg

Senate GOP mulls vote on budget blueprint next week	Senators are bracing for a likely battle next week over the GOP’s budget blueprint that will allow Republicans in the coming weeks to draft and pass a sweeping border, energy and defense bill. Majority Leader John Thune hasn’t made a formal decision yet about whether he’ll bring the Senate’s budget resolution up for a vote on the chamber floor. But several GOP senators view it as increasingly likely that they will act next week after the Senate Budget Committee adopted the measure on Wednesday. Sen.

Now he’s got more jumping to do.

Fiscal hawks tweak House Republicans’ party-line framework	Members of the House Freedom Caucus have succeeded in modifying the budget plan GOP leaders are using to set up their party-line package to deliver on President Donald Trump’s agenda. The House Budget Committee voted 21-16 on Thursday to adopt an amendment that would shrink the amount of tax cuts Republicans can enact if they don’t cut $2 trillion in spending at the same time. House Republican leaders negotiated the amendment with members of the group of fiscal conservatives to lock in support for clearing the budget plan through committee and bolster their chances of adopting it on the floor.

House Republicans advance their budget after appeasing hard-liners	Score one for the backers of 'one big, beautiful bill.' House Republicans launched their budget plan out of committee Thursday night — the first legislative step toward fulfilling President Donald Trump’s policy agenda but at odds with the Senate's continued pursuit of a 'two-track' plan. The House Budget Committee voted to approve a budget resolution along party lines, 21-16, after a marathon markup.

Murkowski introduces bill to rename mountain Denali — countering Trump's executive order	Sen. Lisa Murkowski rolled out legislation on Thursday to formally rename North America’s highest mountain as Denali — officially countering President Donald Trump's executive order to rename it Mount McKinley. The bill, which fellow Republican Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan is co-sponsoring, would require the Alaska mountain to be referred to as Denali in any laws, maps, regulations, documents, papers or other U.S. records. 'In Alaska, it’s Denali. … This isn’t a political issue — Alaskans from every walk of life have long been advocating for this mountain to be recognized by its true name,' Murkowski said in a statement.	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/13/congress/murkowski-pushes-on-denali-00204228	2025-02-13T15:30:38-08:00

It comes after the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee voted last week, 16-12, to advance Lutnick to the floor, with just Sen.

Senate panel votes 'yes' on Trump's pick to lead the FBI	Kash Patel, President Donald Trump’s controversial pick to lead the FBI, was voted out of committee along party lines on Thursday morning. The 12-10 vote from the Senate Judiciary Committee paves the way for Patel to be confirmed by the full Senate in the coming weeks, when he'll take the helm of the federal law enforcement agency amid a massive leadership shakeup. The committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, has accused Patel of helping from the outside to oust some of the Justice Department's top officials in the early days of the Trump administration. If confirmed, Patel would become a key leader in Trump’s broad efforts to root out those deemed disloyal to his cause from the federal government.

The committee’s health subcommittee, led by Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), will hold a hearing on so-called 'PBM reform' for Feb. 26, although that date could change. Democrats and Republicans struck a deal late in the last Congress to place new regulations on pharmacy intermediaries, known as pharmacy benefit managers, in a bid to lower costs for patients and employers. These benefit managers, or PBMs, negotiate drug costs for insurers and employers.

The panel plans to meet Thursday to markup and possibly vote to advance the resolution. It was immediately panned by some hard-liners in the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, who huddled in the basement of the Capitol Wednesday afternoon to discuss it.

Dems fail to land viral moment at DOGE hearing	The highly anticipated first meeting of the House Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency, or DOGE, came and went on Wednesday with scarce political drama. Democrats sought to cast the subcommittee — a complementary effort to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk — as an extension of what they see as a corrupt executive branch plot to destroy the federal bureaucracy. But Republicans largely sidestepped those attacks, arguing they were in the business of eliminating government waste while Democrats had little interest in engaging earnestly on the subject. It was a surprising twist for a panel filled with political firebrands and chaired by Rep.

Tulsi Gabbard confirmed as director of national intelligence	The Senate voted to confirm Tulsi Gabbard to serve as director of national intelligence on Wednesday, with Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the only member of his party to vote against President Donald Trump’s nominee. The vote was 52 to 48. No Democrats voted in support for the former lawmaker. Gabbard has been one of Trump’s most contentious nominees because of her past remarks on foreign adversaries and concerns about whether she has the experience to do the job.

Senate gets moving on two-track budget plan	The Senate Budget Committee is marking up its its signature piece of legislation — the reconciliation-unlocking budget resolution — in its race against House counterparts to identify the best path forward for turning President Donald Trump’s policy ambitions into law. While Congress has skipped a budget resolution in recent years, this year the measure is the centerpiece of Republican policymaking on Capitol Hill as the majorities in both chambers are hungry to uncork the power to bypass Senate filibusters and pass party-line bills to enact Trump's domestic agenda.

House budget draft unveiled ahead of Thursday markup	The House Budget Committee unveiled a fiscal blueprint for Republicans' sweeping domestic policy legislation Wednesday that would allow for at least $4.5 trillion in tax cuts while slashing spending by at least $1.5 trillion over the coming decade. The draft budget resolution also provides for as much as $300 billion in new border and defense spending and would allow Republicans to raise the debt limit by $4 trillion — enough for about a two-year extension.

Federal watchdogs fired by Trump urge court to reinstate them	Eight federal watchdogs, abruptly fired last month by President Donald Trump, are suing to get their jobs back, saying Trump broke the law by failing to give Congress a 30-day heads up and concrete explanation for the dismissals. Trump sent a jolt through Washington when he fired 17 inspectors general on the first Friday night of his term, presaging weeks of extraordinary assertions of power that have at times crossed clear legal boundaries. A 2022 federal law requires Trump to notify Congress 30 days before he terminates an inspector general and to provide detailed reasons.

House GOP budget still not final	House Budget Committee members are still debating key final details of the fiscal blueprint for Republicans’ massive domestic policy bill, with GOP leaders still hoping to release text of a budget resolution in the coming hours. Majority Leader Steve Scalise, arriving at the Capitol Wednesday, told reporters he still expects that text to be released to the public 'this morning.' 'I think we’re going to be on track to have budget markup tomorrow,' Scalise said. But he acknowledged it’s not ready quite yet. Key Budget Committee members continue to debate the final range of spending cuts to target in the plan, according to two people familiar with the ongoing talks. GOP leaders have pushed for around $1.5 trillion in cuts over 10 years, more than what many swing-district Republicans would lik...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/12/congress/house-budget-wait-scalise-00203783	2025-02-12T06:57:50-08:00

The speaker is about to make another big move to get back on track.

But Arrington’s now at risk of being outmaneuvered by fellow chairs, senior leaders and the Senate as frustration gives way to full-blown anger among House Republicans over how he has struggled to advance President Donald Trump’s vast policy agenda.

Marjorie Taylor Greene mum on Musk ahead of first DOGE hearing	Fresh from a White House meeting with Elon Musk, conservative provocateur Marjorie Taylor Greene is preparing to launch her Congressional subcommittee to complement the tech giant’s Department of Government Efficiency — and downplayed the task force’s drastic spending cuts that are putting thousands of federal employees out of work. 'Those are taxpayer-funded jobs. Those only exist because people that pay taxes, their money is being used for grants and all kinds of funding, right?

Senate Republicans think Trump tacitly approves of their two-bill budget plan	Senate Republicans believe they have President Donald Trump’s blessing as they pursue a two-bill strategy for passing his domestic legislative agenda. Trump has repeatedly said that he prefers 'one big, beautiful bill,' but Senate Republicans have been privately checking that he is OK with them moving forward with two bills — one that addresses the border, energy and defense spending quickly, while a second gets into more complicated tax cuts. On Tuesday, OMB Director Russ Vought and Border Czar Tom Homan also said behind closed doors that they need $175 billion in additional border money quickly, further boosting Senate Republicans' confidence in moving immediately.

The plan, which the hard-right HFC wants to take up after a separate bill addressing border and defense initiatives, is a new speed bump in Speaker Mike Johnson's effort to unite fractious House Republicans around leadership’s own plan.

Democrats are divided on government shutdown threats	With just over a month until government funding expires, Democrats remain divided on whether they should use the threat of a government shutdown as a political cudgel as they try to push back on President Donald Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk. Key progressives want to use every point of leverage the minority party has at its disposal to push back against the slashing of federal agencies being undertaken by Trump's budget office and Musk's 'Department of Government Efficiency.' 'It is the Republican majority's responsibility to gather the votes necessary for them to pass their agenda. I do not believe that Democrats should be helping,' said Rep.

Speaker Mike Johnson said in a brief interview that he had 'very productive' conversations Monday night about the new fiscal blueprint he has been circulating among key GOP factions.

Capitol agenda: Johnson's new budget plan, Dems' shutdown dilemma	The Democratic Party's base is demanding that lawmakers do more to counter Donald Trump. But Democrats are signaling they don’t want to use their major leverage point — forcing a government shutdown if the GOP refuses to rein in the president’s war on the federal government. 'My folks don't want to shut down,' said Rep. Sanford Bishop, a senior appropriator. Sen. Richard Blumenthal insisted his party needed to 'use whatever levers and points of power we have' to extract concessions from the Trump administration. But he added: 'I don't think we should seek a shutdown.'

Gabbard clears key Senate hurdle with unanimous GOP support	Senators voted to advance Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination to serve as director of national intelligence in a party-line vote Monday evening, setting the stage for a final confirmation vote later this week. Having secured the support of 52 Senate Republicans, Gabbard, one of President Donald Trump’s most controversial Cabinet nominees, is on track to be confirmed as the nation’s top intelligence official in the coming days. Forty six Democrats in the chamber voted against Gabbard. Two senators were absent from the vote. GOP Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — who had been seen as potential swing votes — voted to advance the nomination of the former Democratic lawmaker.

Scott, chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said his team believes the battleground map will include six states — three offensive targets in Georgia, Michigan and New Hampshire and three defensive ones in Maine, North Carolina and Ohio.

Jim Jordan backs Elon Musk’s authority to cut federal government	Rep.

'It's interesting,' Jordan said on CNN’s 'Inside Politics' on Sunday. 'No one wants to defend the waste, fraud and abuse, so they attack the guy who's exposing all the waste, fraud and ridiculous things we're spending money on.' Over the past few weeks, Musk and the DOGE team have zeroed in on the Trump administration’s mission to overhaul federal agencies and reduce staff.

As Trump steamrolls Washington, courts flex their power to slow him down	President Donald Trump’s 'shock and awe' assertion of executive power has hit a wall in the courtroom — at least for now. At least nine federal judges — from Washington, D.C., to Washington state — have halted aspects of Trump’s early-term blitz, from his effort to rewrite the Constitution’s birthright citizenship guarantee to his sweeping effort to freeze federal spending to his plans to break and remake the federal workforce.

Why Trump was able to pull off such a swift war on diversity	Donald Trump’s move to rapidly eradicate diversity efforts from the federal government marks the culmination of a widespread conservative backlash to the antiracism movement of 2020. Five years ago, as 'END RACISM' was emblazoned on professional football fields and Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima caricatures disappeared from grocery shelves, a growing number of voters bristled at what they saw as a performative attack that went far beyond that police brutality symbolized by the killing of George Floyd. As hiring managers across the country embraced diversity, equity and inclusion programs, Republicans waged a culture war over the 'woke agenda' and rode it to victory, from local school board contests to sweeping Trump back into the White House.

How JD Vance Is Helping Trump Win on Capitol Hill	Sen. Todd Young needed to vent, and a former colleague was ready to listen. One of the key swing votes on President Donald Trump’s troubled nomination for director of national intelligence, the Indiana Republican had told Republican leaders he was leaning no on confirming Tulsi Gabbard. And then Trump’s most powerful ally, Elon Musk, went online Sunday to call him a 'deep state puppet' — unleashing a tide of MAGA fury. He found a sympathetic ear in Vice President JD Vance, who spoke with Young shortly after Musk’s posting, according to two people familiar with the conversation. Vance quickly made it clear to his team, legislative affairs staffers and others in the White House: Time to call off the dogs.

Trump cuts Biden access to security briefings as payback	President Donald Trump took steps Friday to bar his predecessor from accessing sensitive national security information with an order he readily admitted was payback. Trump said former President Joe Biden would no longer receive classified intelligence briefings that were customary for former presidents — until Biden halted Trump's access after the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. 'There is no need for Joe Biden to continue receiving access to classified information,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'He set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the Intelligence Community (IC) to stop the 45th President of the United States (ME!) from accessing details on National Security, a courtesy provided to former Presidents.'

House GOP still has big problems to solve on its budget	House Republicans are still far from finalizing several key details of a budget blueprint that Speaker Mike Johnson is pledging to advance in the House next week, with negotiations expected to continue through the weekend as the Senate races ahead with its own plans. While House GOP leaders trumpeted tremendous progress coming out of a White House meeting with President Donald Trump on Thursday, key holdouts on Trump’s sweeping agenda of tax cuts, border security and energy initiatives indicated Friday that they remained unconvinced about the level of spending cuts in the bill. Separately, Republican tax writers continue to struggle with the ballooning costs of Trump’s wishlist, which includes not only an...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/07/house-gop-leaders-scramble-to-extinguish-tax-cut-fires-00203092	2025-02-07T11:44:24-08:00	https://static.politico.com/56/9f/fd3e196e4927bae446fcf8e2b7d1/u-s-congress-43681.jpg
Trump ousted the top Democratic campaign finance regulator. She says it's illegal.	President Donald Trump moved this week to fire the chair of the Federal Election Commission, Democrat Ellen Weintraub, the latest in a line of ousters of Democratic-aligned regulators across the government. 'Received a letter from POTUS today purporting to remove me as Commissioner &amp; Chair of @FEC. There’s a legal way to replace FEC commissioners-this isn’t it,' Weintraub wrote on X on Thursday. 'I’ve been lucky to serve the American people &amp; stir up some good trouble along the way. That’s not changing anytime soon.' The FEC’s website lists Weintraub’s seat as vacant as of Friday morning. But in an interview Friday, she contended her removal was illegal.

Senate Republicans release budget blueprint ahead of Wednesday markup	Senate Republicans will hold a committee vote next week on a budget blueprint that will unlock their two-bill strategy for enacting the heart of President Donald Trump’s domestic policy agenda. Senate Budget Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced Friday that his panel will meet Wednesday and Thursday to debate and vote on the budget resolution, which paves the way for a border, defense and energy bill.

House GOP tees up hearing on Trump’s foreign aid overhaul	The House Foreign Affairs Committee is holding a hearing next week on the U.S. Agency for International Development amid the Trump administration’s contentious efforts to shrink the institution, according to a notice obtained by POLITICO. The hearing, announced Thursday night to panel members by chair Brian Mast (R-Fla.), is titled 'The USAID Betrayal' and is set to examine concerns over U.S. foreign aid policies. The hearing is set for Thursday at 8:30 a.m., and former Florida Republican Rep. Ted Yoho and Bill Steiger, who served as the agency’s chief of staff during the first Trump administration, are set to testify. The move is unlikely to satisfy Democrats, who have been furious about the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle a federally codified agency, calling it unconstitution...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/07/congress/usaid-hearing-set-00203071	2025-02-07T05:52:11-08:00	
Capitol agenda: Battle of the budgets coming next week	Next week is shaping up to be a battle of the budgets. House Republicans spent hours Thursday reworking their one-bill plan in two separate meetings — one at the White House, with some limited involvement from President Donald Trump. But despite Speaker Mike Johnson’s stated intentions to unveil a framework today, he told reporters late Thursday night that House Republicans would be working on it all weekend.

Fetterman says he'll oppose Gabbard, RFK Jr.	Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), who has been willing to buck his party to confirm some of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks, is ruling out voting for two of the president's most controversial nominees: Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Fetterman said in a post on X Thursday night that he won’t vote to confirm Gabbard as director of national intelligence or Kennedy as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.

Russ Vought confirmed as White House budget chief	The Senate has confirmed President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the White House budget office despite Democrats delivering a marathon of speeches condemning the administration’s vision for slashing the federal government. Lawmakers voted 53-47 Thursday evening to return Russ Vought for a second tour as director of the Office of Management and Budget. Republicans were in lockstep behind the man who could dramatically alter how federal dollars get spent, in part by taking the 'power of the purse' away from members of Congress. Democrats all voted against Vought, but it wasn’t enough. It had been clear for days that the GOP majority was united behind Trump’s pick for OMB director, even as the agency rocked Congress last week with an attempt to freeze congressionally approved funds.

More Dems join with Republicans to pass fentanyl crackdown bill	The Republican-led House passed legislation Thursday with significant Democratic support that would lead to harsher sentences for fentanyl traffickers, leaving it with a good chance of becoming law. The so-called HALT Fentanyl Act got more Democrats on board this year, with 98 voting in favor, compared with the 74 Democrats who backed a similar version when it passed the House last Congress. The bill didn’t receive a Senate vote at that time amid Democratic concerns it leaned too heavily on law enforcement and would result in more mass incarcerations — a worry for some Democrats this time around too. But now, with Republicans controlling the Senate and enough Democratic co-sponsors in that chamber to clear ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/06/congress/fentanyl-house-vote-passage-00202977	2025-02-06T15:10:00-08:00

Committee punts on Kash Patel vote as Democrats keep up the pressure	Democrats took advantage of the rules of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday to delay consideration of Kash Patel's nomination to lead the FBI — but broke some recent precedent in the process. While lawmakers typically do a one-week punt on Judiciary Committee votes for an variety of reasons — from opposing a bill to nominees — rarely if ever does the panel meet in person to formally approve the delay. Democrats' vehement opposition to confirming Patel prompted such an in-person gathering. Democrats had requested a second hearing with Patel to grill him over the recent leadership shakeup at the FBI.

Khanna said he missed the vote and said he was unaware it was happening — but three Democrats familiar with the run-up to the vote who were granted anonymity to describe what ensued said Democrats were given a heads-up about the maneuver to try to catch Republicans by surprise.

It’s not just President Donald Trump’s history of leading the country through a 35-day funding lapse that has lawmakers worried about his appetite for another one in March. It’s also that Trump’s actions in his first two weeks back in office are stifling bipartisan negotiations toward a funding deal as the president — and his 'government efficiency' chief, Elon Musk — work to bulldoze the federal bureaucracy while freezing billions of dollars Congress already enacted and firing federal workers.

Trump provided no details during a press conference on Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about how the United States would acquire the land, but said that the United States will 'own it and be responsible.' Many lawmakers were learning about the remarks in real time as they headed to a vote on confirming Pam Bondi for attorney general Tuesday night. 'There's probably a couple of kinks in that slinky,' Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said after a reporter described the ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/04/congress/trumps-gaza-comments-confuses-gop-00202538	2025-02-04T18:30:40-08:00	
Senate confirms Bondi for Attorney General	President Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Pam Bondi, was confirmed by the Senate Tuesday evening, 54-46. Bondi, a staunch Trump loyalist, will now assume the role of top federal prosecutor. She is poised to be a key figure in efforts to transform the Department of Justice, which the president has said he intends to use to go after his political adversaries. As Bondi awaited Senate confirmation, the new Trump administration, under acting attorney general James McHenry, has already launched its broad effort to root out those deemed disloyal from the Department of Justice. Prosecutors involved in cases tied to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, and the investigation into Trump’s role in spurring the riots, have been terminated. 'When confirmed, Ms. Bondi will take the helm [...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/04/congress/senate-confirms-bondi-for-attorney-general-00202506	2025-02-04T17:01:21-08:00	
House Democrats are sticking with DOGE Caucus	Some Democrats are sticking with a congressional caucus partnered with Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency even as their party rails against its scorched-earth overhaul of federal agencies. Multiple Democratic members of the caucus said they thought it was better to be inside the tent rather than outside, even as they disagree with how Musk is going about his job. 'The caucus is about focusing on rooting out waste, fraud and abuse. I joined in good faith and to make sure that we have a voice at the table to protect my constituents,' said Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nev.), who added: 'The illegal activity we’ll handle through the litigation process.' 'For now, I'm...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/04/congress/democrats-stick-with-doge-caucus-00202505	2025-02-04T16:18:14-08:00	
Grassley eyes next week to move FBI director pick	Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley said in a statement Tuesday his committee plans to take a final vote on FBI director nominee Kash Patel as early as next week. The committee has a business meeting scheduled for Thursday to consider Patel's nomination. Under committee rules, Democrats can delay the full committee vote for one more week, at which point senators are expected to advance the nominee along party lines to the full Senate for confirmation. Senate Judiciary Democrats on Tuesday asked Grassley for another hearing to question Patel on several matters, including the recent personnel shakeup at the FBI. Grassley denied their request.
