Sam Graves gets Steering’s blessing for another term as chair of Transportation	The House Steering Committee voted Thursday to allow Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.) to serve a second term as chair of the Transportation Committee, as has been expected since his lone challenger dropped out of contention for the gavel earlier this week. The decision comes a week after Steering granted Graves a waiver to bypass conference term limits that hold members to a total of three terms. Graves has spent two terms as ranking member and one as chair. Graves had presented a condensed version of the pitch he made for his waiver in which he hammered home the case to the panel that h...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/12/congress/graves-gets-the-nod-for-transportation-00194147	2024-12-12T14:31:35-08:00	
Walberg bests Owens to lead House Education and the Workforce panel	Rep. Tim Walberg is slated to helm the House Education and the Workforce Committee after defeating Rep. Burgess Owens. The Republican Steering Committee voted Thursday afternoon to designate the Michigan Republican as chair after he and Owens, of Utah, gave presentations to the panel, according to Walberg's office and two people with knowledge of the vote. His appointment now heads to the full conference for final approval, which is largely a formality. This will be the eight-term lawmaker's first time wielding a full committee gavel. He has been a member of the committee for more than a decade, and his victory comes nearly two years ago after his loss to Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), who won a rare party waiver to lead the Republicans on the committee for a fourth time. <a href='https://su...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/12/congress/walberg-takes-education-and-workforce-panel-00194120	2024-12-12T14:14:23-08:00	
Hegseth backtracks on criticism of gays in the military	Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump’s embattled pick for Defense secretary, is shifting his stance on LGBTQ+ service members. The former Fox Host has previously labeled policies allowing gay and transgender troops a 'Marxist agenda.' But when asked by reporters on Thursday during a meeting with Sen. Rand PaulRand Paul (R-Ky.) whether he supports gays serving in the military, he said, 'Yes.' The apparent pivot comes after meetings with more moderate Republican senators, including Sen.

‘Now she’s the world’s problem’: Some Arizona Republicans relieved Lake is heading to Washington	President-elect Donald Trump’s pick of longtime loyalist Kari Lake to lead Voice of America has some Arizona Republicans breathing a sigh of relief. Lake has for the last two election cycles dominated Republican politics in Arizona, running and losing back-to-back races for governor and Senate — and earning her the ire of some of her fellow conservatives in the state. Some Arizona Republicans had already been skeptical of her political future in the state, given the losses, though her name had been floated both for state Republican Party chair and Arizona secretary of state. This decision now all but removes her from those conversations, creating space for other Republicans, like Karrin Taylor Robson, who ran against Lake in the Republican gubernatorial primary in 2022 but came in second, ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/12/kari-lake-voa-republicans-00194096	2024-12-12T13:31:37-08:00	https://static.politico.com/4c/a4/11d34dff49a39ee4ecd66021d84a/election-2024-rnc-52916.jpg
‘Weaponized’ agency: Ramaswamy, Musk attack SEC after diversity ruling setback	Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk are joining other Trump allies in slamming the Securities and Exchange Commission after a federal appeals court threw out the regulator’s approval of board diversity rules from the Nasdaq exchange. Less than 24 hours after the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decided in favor of conservative groups that had challenged the rules, Ramaswamy, Musk and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said the decision underscored what they see as underlying issues with Wall Street’s top regulator.

Congress nears deal on disaster aid, funding patch to avert pre-Christmas shutdown	Congressional leaders are closing in on a deal to fund the government into early next year, along with tens of billions of dollars in disaster aid, as they work to avoid a holiday shutdown. The burgeoning agreement comes after weeks of House and Senate leadership negotiations, which included top appropriators, ahead of the Dec. 20 deadline. Text of the funding bill is expected over the weekend or early next week to allow both chambers to pass the measure before lawmakers leave town until January. 'We’re making good progress,' House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said Thursday afternoon.

House Republicans tap French Hill to chair Financial Services	Rep. French Hill, an Arkansas Republican and former banker, is poised to become the next chair of the House Financial Services Committee after winning the endorsement of the GOP’s steering panel, according to three people with knowledge of the vote. Hill, a moderate who has represented the Little Rock area since 2015, beat three other long-time members of the Financial Services panel — Reps. Andy Barr of Kentucky, Bill Huizenga of Michigan and Frank Lucas of Oklahoma — in one of the most closely watched gavel races this year. The four presented their cases to GOP steering committee members Thursday in alphabetical order. Now, the full conference must vote to ratify the selection.

Trump says he’ll pull vaccines if he finds they’re unsafe	President-elect Donald Trump said he’s open to getting rid of vaccines depending on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s review of their safety. Trump’s comments to Time magazine contradict promises previously made by Kennedy, who is Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and has long been skeptical of vaccines widely considered to be safe and effective.

Musk weighs in on Meta after Zuckerberg’s company donates $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund	The tech billionaires are fighting for Donald Trump’s attention. At least, that’s what it looks like. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, donated $1 million to the president-elect’s inaugural fund, the company confirmed to POLITICO on Thursday. And this morning, it seemed like fellow billionaire Elon Musk has taken issue with its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg’s potential involvement in the new administration. 'Concerning,' Musk said on X, responding to a post from conservative commentator Ashley St. Clair claiming — without evidence — that Meta is 'actively censoring conservatives right now.'

House Dems broadly denounce UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting after Warren remarks	Congressional Democrats broadly denounced the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson Friday morning, after Republicans started accusing Sen.

And it was a horrible murder, a tragic loss for his family.' Warren this week condemned the shooting, but added that people 'can be pushed only so far.' 'We'll say it over and over,' Warren said on MSNBC’S 'The ReidOut.' 'Violence is never the answer.

Murkowski: ‘I’m not attached to’ Republican label	Sen. Lisa Murkowski said Thursday she felt 'more comfortable' with no party label than with 'an identity as a Republican,' an escalation of the Alaska senator’s occasional bucking of her party as the chamber readies itself for a slew of confirmation battles over Trump administration nominees. 'I'm not attached to a label, I'd rather be that ‘no label.’ I'd rather be that person that is just known for trying to do right by the state and the people that I serve, regardless of party, and I'm totally good and comfortable with that,' Murkowski said during a discussion hosted by the centrist group No Labels at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington.

House passes bill expanding federal courts — but Biden veto looms	The House passed legislation, largely along party lines, to expand the federal judiciary by more than 60 seats despite a veto threat from the Biden White House. The bill — co-authored by Biden ally Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) — passed the Senate unanimously earlier this year. But Democrats have cried foul about the House taking it up post-election, once it became clear President-elect Donald Trump would have the first opportunity to fill some of the newly created positions. 'Giving [Trump] more power to appoint additional judges would be irresponsible,' said House Judiciary ranking member Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) at a Rules Committee hearing Monday.

The U.S. Agency for Global Media oversees Voice of America. Trump said in the post that Lake and the head of the U.S. Agency for Global Media will work 'to ensure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media.'

He also said he would appoint philanthropist and urgent care network executive Peter Lamelas as ambassador to Argentina and personal injury lawyer and former law enforcement officer Dan Newlin to the role of ambassador to Colombia.

Trump's bringing several billionaires — and their conflicts — to Washington	Donald Trump has reshaped the Republican Party to embrace a brand of populism that prioritizes its working-class base and is at least outwardly skeptical of corporate power. But since his second election last month, Trump has leaned heavily on aides and Cabinet picks who share a distinctive characteristic with him: wealth from complex business entanglements. Trump has appointed a raft of rich business people and investors — including several billionaires and multiple Wall Street executives with complex financial interests — to fill out top roles in his administration, raising a vast array of potential conflicts of interest that could span the federal government and complicate Senate confirmations.

Pritzker questions whether Trump's border czar has the 'authority' to implement massive immigration changes	CHICAGO — Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said he's open to working with President-elect Donald Trump's new border czar — but said he was skeptical the incoming official had the 'authority' to do everything he said. 'Being a border czar is not an official position in the government, and it will be up to the President of the United States and up to the leaders of the Customs and Border Patrol to make decisions about how we'll manage the border,' Pritzker said. Trump's incoming border czar, Tom Homan, visited Chicago on Monday and said both Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson 'suck' for their comments about not working with federal agents on deportations.

In his 'first truth,' Fetterman advocated for Trump to be pardoned from the New York hush money case for which he was found guilty of 34 felony counts, comparing the case to Hunter Biden’s and saying they were 'both bullshit.' 'Weaponizing the judiciary for blatant, partisan gain diminishes the collective faith in our institutions and sows further division,' Fetterman said in the Tuesday evening post.

Capitol Police arrest person in alleged assault on Mace	The United States Capitol Police have arrested 33-year-old James McIntyre for an alleged assault on Rep. Nancy Mace on Tuesday night in the Rayburn Office Building, according to the department. Capitol Police, in a statement, said they responded to an incident reported by a member's office just before 6:00 p.m. on Tuesday. McIntyre is facing a misdemeanor charge for assaulting a government official, according to the department, though charging decisions are ultimately up to the U.S. attorney’s office. The department added that 'McIntyre went through security screening prior to entering the Congressional buildings.'

House Dems formally approve picks for top committee spots	House Democrats formally approved their party’s picks Wednesday for several leaders, including the ranking members of the so-called exclusive committees. These leadership spots — along with several other positions — were all uncontested. All of the lawmakers selected Wednesday also held their positions in the last Congress. The Democratic caucus formally approved: Up next: But the caucus will face contested races next week. Reps. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) are facing off for Natural Resources. Meanwhile, Reps.

Musk pitches weight-loss drugs to lower health care spending	Elon Musk, who is spearheading President-elect Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, is touting GLP-1 drugs to treat obesity. 'Nothing would do more to improve the health, lifespan and quality of life for Americans than making GLP inhibitors [sic] super low cost to the public,' Musk wrote in a post on X Wednesday. 'Nothing else is even close.' Musk’s comments come just two weeks after the Biden administration made an 11th-hour push to require Medicare and state Medicaid programs to cover obesity drugs.

Defense policy bill in House spotlight as Blinken visits Hill on Afghanistan	House lawmakers on Wednesday plan to take up one of the final must-pass bills of President Joe Biden’s presidency: the annual defense policy bill. It’ll hit the House floor with late afternoon votes under a rule, meaning it’ll need a simple majority of the chamber to pass. What to watch: House Armed Services ranking member Adam Smith (D-Wash.) did come out against final passage of the bill he helped negotiate over its inclusion of a provision that could bar health care for transgender children of servicemembers.

GOP Drama: Cotton Seeks Intelligence Chair, Thwarting Cornyn	Senate Republicans have discussed elevating Sen. John Cornyn to chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, according to party officials, a move that would hand Cornyn a prized gavel as consolation for losing his GOP leader bid and could help induce him to run for reelection in two years. The complication, and almost certain deal-breaker: Cornyn would have to leapfrog the Republican next in line to chair the Intelligence Committee, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and Cotton has privately made clear to Cornyn he would claim the position. Likely ensuring Cotton’s ascension to the chair is the raw politics of last month’s Senate Republican leadership race between Cornyn and Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.).

Trump taps diplomat Ronald Johnson for ambassador to Mexico	President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday that he is selecting former U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador Ronald Johnson to be the next U.S. ambassador to Mexico. Johnson, a Green Beret who spent more than 20 years at the Central Intelligence Agency before a diplomatic posting in San Salvador, would bring significant foreign policy expertise to one of the most important bilateral diplomatic portfolios in the U.S. government. Mexico is the United States’ largest trading partner and thorny discussions around bilateral trade, drug trafficking, migration and border security are expected to dominate the agenda between Washington and Mexico City under the Trump administration.

He added that Helberg 'has the knowledge, expertise, and pragmatism to defend America’s Economic interests abroad.' Helberg will face a Senate confirmation process, and his current work for defense contractor Palantir — he is a senior adviser to the company’s chief executive officer — may attract scrutiny from lawmakers concerned about potential conflicts of interest.

Trump lawyers and aide hit with 10 additional charges in Wisconsin over 2020 fake electors	MADISON, Wisconsin — Wisconsin prosecutors filed 10 additional felony charges Tuesday against two attorneys and an aide to President-elect Donald Trump who advised Trump in 2020 as part of a plan to submit paperwork falsely claiming that the Republican had won the battleground state that year. Jim Troupis, who was Trump’s attorney in Wisconsin, Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who advised the campaign, and Mike Roman, Trump’s director of Election Day operations in 2020, all initially faced a single felony forgery charge in Wisconsin. Those charges were filed in June.

'Dan will implement my cost-cutting and deregulatory agenda across all Agencies, and root out the Weaponized Deep State,' Trump said in a Truth Social post. Bishop, a member of the Freedom Caucus, gave up his House seat to unsuccessfully run for attorney general after serving in Congress since 2019. He was previously a state legislator and lawyer.

And, according to more than two dozen House Democratic lawmakers and aides granted anonymity to discuss the matter, Scott is poised to lose the vote if he doesn’t step aside before then.

In a Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump said that Barrack, a California billionaire, is 'a well respected and experienced voice of reason to a wide range of thought leaders in both political and business circles.' Barrack’s relationship with Trump goes back to the 1980s and he has fundraised and supported Trump throughout his political career.

Bernie Sanders, former presidential candidate and leader of the progressive movement in the United States for decades, said this would likely be his last term in an interview with POLITICO.

Cotton blocks federal journalist shield legislation in Senate	Sen. Tom Cotton has blocked a first-of-its-kind federal shield law for journalists against revealing their confidential sources, arguing its passage would represent a threat to national security. 'The liberal media doesn’t deserve more protections,' Cotton (R-Ark.), who will chair the Intelligence Committee next year, said on the Senate floor. 'The press badge doesn’t make you better than the rest of America or put you above the law.' The Protect Reporters from Exploitative State Spying Act — or the PRESS Act — previously passed the House by voice vote in January. Cotton said he was providing the 'sober second thought' to the 'rash, impetuous, hasty, impulsive' action by the House on the legislation.

Those include swing votes like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as well as Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who will chair a committee that could host confirmation hearings for Kennedy. Kennedy can afford to lose only three Republicans during his confirmation if all Senate Democrats vote against him. This group of senators closely resembles those who weren’t sold on former Rep.

'Nor do I think that a pardon is necessary for members of the Jan. 6 committee. We're proud of the work we did on that committee.' Schumer seemed to agree that a pardon wouldn’t be necessary for Schiff: 'He broke no laws whatsoever, and the truth stands for itself.'

The clash over telework is expected to be one of the major battles for the incoming Trump administration as conservatives push for the civil service to return to the office.

OAN promoted the show in a series of graphics on Tuesday and called Gaetz a 'powerhouse' in a release, describing the hire as a 'mega MAGA investment' that will air weeknights at 9 p.m. It is yet another high-profile, public platform for Gaetz, a firebrand Republican who made no shortage of enemies in the House before President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to nominate him to ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/10/congress/the-matt-gaetz-show-oan-00193429	2024-12-10T05:05:59-08:00	
Ron who? How Trump allies brought Hegseth back from the brink	Donald Trump's transition team entered a critical week of nomination meetings on Capitol Hill with a new head of steam, emboldened by a swarm of grassroots support and a pressure campaign that has revived Pete Hegseth's hopes for Defense secretary and given them confidence about other controversial nominees, too. In recent days, allies of Trump adopted an approach that is not novel for the president-elect and his followers: Make life extremely uncomfortable for anyone who dares to oppose him. The swarm of MAGA attacks that Sen. Joni Ernst has experienced is a warning of what's in store for others who express skepticism of his personnel choices. Days after signaling she continued to have serious concerns about confirming Hegseth, Ernst on Monday sounded a different note.

Homan tells Democrats to ‘get the hell out of the way’ on immigration	CHICAGO — Donald Trump’s choice to lead border security efforts promised a hard line on enforcement in a speech Monday to Chicago Republicans, with apparently little room for leniency even for the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. Tom Homan, who has been picked to serve as 'border czar' in the new administration, said the children of non-citizens would be part of the wave of deportations promised by the incoming administration. 'When you have a child, that's on you. I'm not looking to separate families at all. That's not my goal. My goal is to enforce the law,' Homan said. 'But if you put yourself in that position, it may happen.' His remarks showed none of the flexibility that Trump himself seemed to suggest in a weekend interview, when he said that he favored some kind of resolut...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/09/congress/border-czars-tough-talk-00193416	2024-12-09T19:10:33-08:00

Trump picks ex-GOP official in California to lead civil rights division at DOJ	A rare voice for conservative policies in deep blue California has been invited to join the new Trump administration. President-elect Donald Trump said Monday that he will nominate Harmeet K.

Dhillon, who represented California on the Republican National Committee, would have a prominent role in enforcing voting rights if her nomination is confirmed by the Senate.

Gabbard woos GOP defense hawks in first Hill visit	Former Democratic Congressperson Tulsi Gabbard kicked off her bid to win Senate support as America’s new top spy on Monday by wooing a key demographic: Republican defense hawks. The recent MAGA convert and longtime anti-interventionist held one-on-one meetings on Monday with four muscular advocates of American foreign policy. She started the day by having breakfast with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). Later, she met with Sens. Mike Rounds (R-SD), James Lankford (R-OK), and Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) behind closed doors.

Johnson needs Dems to pass a stopgap spending bill. Here's what they want.	Lawmakers only have nine working days left to figure out government funding before the shutdown deadline, and Speaker Mike Johnson will almost certainly need House Democratic votes to pass it. Congress is likely to pass a stopgap government funding measure before Dec. 20, likely to fund the government until March of next year at its current levels. But considering Johnson’s razor-thin margin and a notable conservative faction of his conference that doesn’t generally support stopgap spending bills, known as continuing resolutions, House Democrats will likely be the ones to get the legislation over the finish line. Typically, punting a funding deadline into a new year when Republicans will control every lever of power would make Democrats shudder.

The Iowa Republican, a pivotal swing vote on the Senate Armed Services Committee, struck a positive tone in a statement issued after their meeting — and indicated Hegseth is moving toward her positions.

But the GOP steering committee, which doles out most committee gavels and assignments, picked Mast (R-Fla.) as their recommendation to be the next chair during a closed-door meeting where they heard from each of the candidates for the gavel. Mast faced off against Reps. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.), Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) and Darrell Issa (R-Calif.). Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the current chair, is term-limited.

Gerry Connolly of Virginia to succeed Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, who’s likely to become the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. Democrats increasingly believe she’s entering the race with a sizable bloc of support and could win the Steering and Policy Committee recommendation and the full caucus election.

House Republican leadership convenes to talk reconciliation timing	House Republican leadership met on Friday morning to discuss outstanding disagreements on how to kick off the reconciliation process, according to two senior Republicans, granted anonymity to share the private deliberations. House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) was in Speaker Mike Johnson’s office for at least an hour around Friday morning’s vote series. Johnson’s senior policy adviser, Derek Theurer, who was previously chief tax counsel for the Ways and Means committee, was seen exiting the speaker’s office during that period.

‘Discomfort and anxiety’: Pentagon officials jittery as Hegseth drama plays out	The high-stakes battle on Capitol Hill over Pete Hegseth’s quest to lead the Defense Department is causing no shortage of angst in the Pentagon, where officials are watching nervously to find out who their next boss will be. Hegseth, a former Fox News host and Army veteran, is being dogged by claims involving alleged sexual assault and public drunkenness and has spent the week meeting with Republican senators to ensure he has the votes to pass, even though there are serious doubts he has the numbers.

Ocasio-Cortez set to launch bid for top Dem spot on key panel	As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez prepares to jump into the race to be the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, she’s testing how far her colleagues are willing to go as they shake up their leadership structure. She told reporters Friday that an announcement was coming 'soon' and to keep an eye on her social media. Her official launch would mean challenging Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va), who has already announced he wants to run as the top Democrat of the committee after Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who currently occupies the spot, tossed his hat in for House Judiciary ranking member.

Obama calls political ‘divisiveness’ one of the ‘greatest challenges of our time’	CHICAGO — Former President Barack Obama called out divisiveness and polarization as 'one of the greatest challenges of our time,' as he avoided any specific political references in his first public remarks since the election. In a speech Thursday at his foundation’s Democracy Forum, Obama urged his audience to embrace pluralism and celebrate people’s differences – the closest he came to a political message in his remarks. 'It’s about recognizing that in a democracy, power comes from forging alliances and building coalitions… not only for the woke, but also for the waking,' Obama told the crowd of about 650 participants at the Obama Foundation event on Chicago’s South Side, just a few miles from where Obama’s presidential center is under construction.

Elon Musk was behind mysterious pro-Trump super PAC that invoked Ruth Bader Ginsburg	Elon Musk was the sole funder of a super PAC formed in the final weeks of the election that spent millions on ads claiming Donald Trump’s position on abortion was aligned with that of the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Musk poured $20.5 million into the group on Oct. 24, according to a campaign finance filing submitted to the Federal Election Commission late Thursday. The timing of the donation meant that Musk’s support did not have to be disclosed until after the election. The group, named RBG PAC, spent nearly all of that money on advertising. Its ads claimed that Ginsburg — the liberal longtime justice and staunch women’s rights advocate who died in 2020 — was of 'one mind' with Trump on the issue of abortion. Its website featured photos of Trump and Ginsburg with the c...	https://www.politico.com/elon-musk-trump-donations-super-pac	2024-12-05T17:42:41-08:00	https://static.politico.com/9e/08/913587a54778b5ec49989e640f20/elon-musk-at-madison-square-garden-78022.jpg

House rebuffs Democratic efforts to force release of Gaetz ethics report	The House rejected two Democratic-led efforts to force the release of ethics findings into former Rep.

Lawmakers voted along almost entirely party lines to table an effort from Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) to force the immediate release of the Ethics Committee report on Gaetz. Casten cited multiple examples in his resolution where the House released findings on members even after they left Congress.

Ethics Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.) declined to comment on the meeting but said he’d vote against a last-ditch effort by Democrats to force the release of the report. The panel’s top Democrat, Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania, wasn’t at Thursday’s meeting, though Guest brushed off her absence and said 'it’s not uncommon' for members to not be able to attend.

The Freedom Caucus took an official position this week that any disaster relief needs to be paid for and limited to what is 'absolutely necessary' right now.

Trump to sit down with Kristen Welker on ‘Meet the Press’	President-elect Donald Trump has lined up his first network interview since winning the election. Trump will sit down with NBC’s Kristen Welker for an interview on 'Meet the Press' set to air at 10:30 a.m. ET on Sunday, the network announced Wednesday. The interview will take place on Friday. The president-elect rarely participated in interviews with mainstream media outlets during the campaign, sticking to Fox News and nontraditional forms of media, including a range of podcasters. Welker last sat down with Trump for her debut 'Meet the Press' interview in September 2023, where he spoke about immigration, abortion and his then-Republican primary opponent Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Welker was criticized at the time for not fact-checking Trump during the interview.

Jeffries stays out of the way as Dems mutiny against senior panel leaders	House Democrats are poised to unseat several senior committee leaders, and Hakeem Jeffries is letting it happen. Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, 76, announced this week that he would step down from the top Democratic spot on the Natural Resources Committee. Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, 77, dropped his bid to continue leading Democrats on Judiciary in the face of a tough challenge from 61-year-old Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland. And Rep. David Scott of Georgia, 79, is facing multiple challenges for the top Democratic spot on the Agriculture Committee.

Hegseth’s future as Defense secretary hangs by a thread	How much trouble is Pete Hegseth facing in his bid to lead the Department of Defense? 'A lot,' as one GOP senator put it. Despite Hegseth, a veteran and Fox News personality, zigzagging across the Capitol to meet with Republican lawmakers over his imperiled nomination, there are still significant doubts he’ll have the necessary support to be confirmed. Backup nominees are already being floated, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, raising speculation that President-elect Donald Trump is ready to move on. 'That's definitely how my colleagues are taking it,' said the GOP senator, granted anonymity to speak candidly. 'That’s sending the signal to everybody here that Hegseth’s not likely to survive.'

Detroit mayor launches independent 2026 run for Michigan governor	Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan announced Wednesday that he will run for Michigan governor as an independent, breaking from the Democratic Party.

Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune sparked heartburn across the Capitol this week when he told GOP senators that the package, which under budget reconciliation rules would allow the GOP to bypass a Democratic filibuster, would be split into two parts. The first would focus on border and energy, with a goal to pass it in the first 30 days of the new Trump administration, and the second on tax.

Atkins, if confirmed, would be tasked with steering the SEC as it embarks on what is expected to be a new deregulatory age for Wall Street after nearly four years of aggressive rulemaking by the current chair, Gary Gensler. He would also be thrust into a series of policy fights over the $3 trillion cryptocurrency market, artificial intelligence and the cost of raising capital in the U.S. Atkins previously served as an SEC commissioner in the early-to-mid 2000s before launching his consultancy firm, Patomak Global Partners.

The new tranche of emergency Pentagon funding would go toward furnishing weapons and equipment for Ukraine and refilling U.S. inventories.

FEMA officials worry Trump will divert disaster aid to the border	In 2019, then-President Donald Trump took $155 million from the federal government’s main disaster fund and used it to build immigration facilities near the U.S.-Mexico border. Now senior officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency are expressing concern that Trump could again redirect disaster resources after he takes office, but on a much larger scale. That could limit FEMA’s ability to help people and communities after major disasters, they say.

Trump's transition was supposed to be a show of force. What happened?	Over the last 24 hours, Donald Trump lost his pick to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration. His choice for Defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, is struggling to gain support from Senate Republicans. The president-elect is now even considering his onetime rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis, to lead the Pentagon. And these shake-ups to his not-yet-formed administration come after former Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew from consideration as Trump’s choice for attorney general.

Jeffries calls on Biden to pardon more Americans	House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called on President Joe Biden to pardon more people convicted of nonviolent offenses amid controversy over the president’s pardon of his son, Hunter Biden. 'During his final weeks in office, President Biden should exercise the high level of compassion he has consistently demonstrated throughout his life, including toward his son, and pardon on a case-by-case basis the working-class Americans in the federal prison system whose lives have been ruined by unjustly aggressive prosecutions for nonviolent offenses,' Jeffries said in a statement. Jeffries’ comments echo the calls from some other Democrats who in recent days have asked Biden to use his clemency powers for more Americans in federal custody besides Hunter and to address sentencing disparities.

Sean Casten isn’t giving up on his quest to see the House Ethics Committee’s investigation into Matt Gaetz, despite the former Florida representative withdrawing from consideration for attorney general. Casten took to the floor Tuesday to introduce a new privileged resolution that would force the release of the latest version of the ethics report. House leaders will have two legislative days to schedule a vote, which would only be successful if Casten gets a majority of the House to approve it.

Trump picks billionaire investor as Pentagon deputy	President-elect Donald Trump has selected Stephen Feinberg to be his deputy Defense secretary, two people familiar with the decision told POLITICO, potentially putting a secretive billionaire financier with no experience in the agency into the Pentagon’s No. 2 job. Feinberg, who had a role on Trump’s intelligence advisory board during his first term, is a major donor to the president-elect, but his selection could present some significant conflicts of interest. He is the chief executive of private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, which has investments in military aircraft training and maintenance, and holds a majority stake in Navistar Defense, a manufacturer of military vehicles.

The New Mexico Democrat, who joined the House in 2021, has quietly sounded out her congressional colleagues as she weighs a bid, the three people said.

Thune tells Senate GOP he wants sweeping bill within first 30 days of Trump admin	Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune is pushing for two major partisan bills next term, including one within the first 30 days of the Trump administration, he told Republican senators at a private GOP conference meeting on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his remarks. Thune was broadly outlining priorities for the next Congress during the closed-door meeting. He said the first of the two pieces of legislation, which would pass under a process known as budget reconciliation that can bypass the Senate filibuster, would focus on the border, defense and energy. A subsequent package would focus on taxes and other priorities for the Trump administration. It’d be a significant first swing at legislation for Thune — 30 days is an ambitious timeline, even for a targeted package.

How a potential panel shakeup will test Ocasio-Cortez's influence	Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could face the biggest test of her influence yet if a coveted spot as the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee opens up. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who currently holds the job, is running against Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) for the top Democratic spot on the Judiciary Committee. If Raskin successfully ousts Nadler, that will kick off a scramble to replace him. Although Democrats are reluctant to publicly discuss an Oversight bid before the Judiciary challenges are settled, lawmakers are privately making calls to test the waters, quietly jockeying behind the scenes. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), possible contenders for the top spot include Reps. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.).

Schumer reelected as Senate Democratic leader	Democrats nationally are wrestling over who will lead their party post-election. But in the Senate, they’re largely staying the course. In a closed-door party meeting on Tuesday, Senate Democrats elected leadership for their return to the minority, including tapping Sen. Chuck Schumer for another term as caucus leader, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) was also elected to another term as whip, the No. 2 spot. Two other Democrats rose in the ranks: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) was elected to the No. 3 spot as chair of the Steering and Policy Committee.

Senate confirms stalled promotion for general involved in Afghanistan withdrawal	The promotion of President Joe Biden’s pick to lead U.S. Army forces in Europe and Africa has cleared the Senate after an unexplained delay. The promotion of Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue — who led the 82nd Airborne Division during the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan — to the rank of four-star general was approved quietly before the Senate adjourned. Donahue's promotion was conspicuously left out of a tranche of hundred of routine military nominees confirmed before the Senate's Thanksgiving recess, indicating a senator was holding up his nomination.

A top GOP senator predicts Trump’s picks will get FBI background checks	An impasse over FBI background checks for Trump's Cabinet nominees will likely be resolved 'in the next few days,' a top Republican told reporters Monday. 'I do think there will be FBI background checks,' said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the ranking GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The comments came amid fears the incoming Trump administration plans to bypass the customary step for top appointees, raising concerns about its vetting of candidates.

'Warren has always dreamed of serving the United States full time,' Trump said Monday in a Truth Social post. 'I am thrilled that he will now have that opportunity as the top Diplomat, representing the U.S.A. to one of America’s most cherished and beloved Allies.'

Congress readies another funding punt ahead of pre-Christmas shutdown deadline	Staring down a government shutdown deadline in less than three weeks, congressional leaders have begun serious negotiations toward a funding patch that punts the deadline into President-elect Donald Trump’s second term. A grand deal on final funding bills is highly unlikely before the Dec. 20 deadline, considering Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have yet to strike a 'toplines' agreement on overall spending totals for the military and non-defense programs. So lawmakers must now ready yet another stopgap that keeps federal agencies running on static funding — after they already punted on spending back in September.

Senate Dems set to bump up Klobuchar and Booker in leadership ranks	Sen. Amy Klobuchar is expected to be tapped for Senate Democrats’ No. 3 spot in caucus leadership elections this week, according to two people familiar with the shuffling. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is expected to fill the no. 4 role, which Klobuchar (D-Minn.) currently holds as chair of the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee. The No. 3 spot is currently held by retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who is head of Senate Democrats’ Policy and Communications Committee. Both Booker and Klobuchar — who both ran for president in 2020 and have wide name recognition in the party — had been eyeing the gig, but Booker's apparent acquiescence to instead take the spot one rung lower means the caucus will avoid that intra-party clash.

The most immediate issue: Congress faces a Dec. 20 government funding deadline. While a shutdown isn't atop anyone's holiday wish list, there’s significant disagreement about how long a short-term government funding patch should last into President-elect Donald Trump's new term — and what other priorities, like tens of billions in sought-after disaster aid, might hitch a ride to that bill.
