Dems tap Slotkin to deliver response to Trump's joint address	Hill Democrats on Thursday named Sen. Elissa Slotkin to deliver their response to President Donald Trump’s joint address next week. It’s a high-profile platform for the first-term senator and an early indication that Democrats are looking to emphasize kitchen-table issues after their drubbing in the last election. 'I'm looking forward to speaking directly to the American people next week. The public expects leaders to level with them on what’s actually happening in our country,' Slotkin said in a statement. 'From our economic security to our national security, we’ve got to chart a way forward that actually improves people’s lives in the country we all love, and I’m looking forward to laying that out.' Democratic leaders signaled Slotkin’s speech could focus on economic issues, with House M...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/27/congress/dem-response-to-trump-joint-address-00206478	2025-02-27T10:01:31-08:00	
House Judiciary panel plans discussion on college athlete pay	The House Judiciary Committee is hosting a roundtable on name, image and likeness issues in college athletics in mid-April, according to a person familiar with the planning. Lawmakers have been mulling federal legislation to regulate college athletes' ability to profit off their personal brand for years. In 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the existing NCAA restrictions on compensation amounted to antitrust violations, paving the way for paying college athletes with haphazard government regulations. The NCAA, now led by former Republican Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to lobby Washington in recent years, as Congress considered som...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/27/congress/college-athlete-pay-discussion-00206464	2025-02-27T09:23:07-08:00

Musk to meet with House Republicans	Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Thursday that he’s trying to schedule a meeting of House Republicans with Elon Musk soon to discuss the work of the Department of Government Efficiency. Johnson, who met with Musk at the White House late Tuesday, said the billionaire adviser to President Donald Trump would 'meet with either small groups of members, appropriators or maybe all the House Republicans,' likely next week or shortly thereafter. 'He’s anxious to share what he's finding, and a lot of things he's told me in our private meetings, I said we have to make sure all the members understand the degree of the fraud, waste, abuse, and how egregious it is,' Johnson said.	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/27/congress/musk-to-meet-with-house-republicans-00206431	2025-02-27T07:43:59-08:00	
Senators give Trump’s latest budget nominee his first vote of approval	President Donald Trump’s pick for the No. 2 post at the White House budget office cleared his first hoop toward confirmation Thursday morning. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee voted 8-1 to approve the nomination of Dan Bishop to be deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, with ranking member Gary Peters (D-Mich.) the sole 'no' vote. Another panel, the Senate Budget Committee, is next to hold a hearing with the nominee before Republican senators can vote on the floor to confirm him. Bishop is already serving as a senior adviser to the White House budget office, where Russ Vought is leading the charge to carry out Trump’s orders to freeze billions of dollars in fe...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/27/congress/bishop-trump-budget-vote-approval-00206423	2025-02-27T07:17:10-08:00	
Senate committee advances Chavez-DeRemer's nomination	Former Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer is one step closer to becoming Labor secretary after the Senate HELP Committee advanced her to a full floor vote. She needed at least one Democrat to rescue her nomination. The panel voted 13-9 on Thursday to advance Chavez-DeRemer after Sens. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) joined Republicans in supporting President Donald Trump’s pick to lead DOL. The trio’s support offset a 'no' vote from Sen.

Capitol agenda: Shutdown blame game rages	The shutdown blame game is in full swing on Capitol Hill — a tried-and-true negative sign for stalled government funding talks. State of play: GOP leaders won’t put language in their funding bills to stop President Donald Trump and Elon Musk from clawing back money Congress previously approved — something Democrats have been demanding in exchange for backing a spending deal. That leaves Democrats with a choice: Give in or force a shutdown after March 14. Sen.

Johnson rules out steepest Medicaid cut options	Speaker Mike Johnson has ruled out some of the biggest potential cuts to Medicaid for Republicans’ party-line package to enact President Donald Trump’s agenda. The House has targeted at least $880 billion in savings from the Energy and Commerce Committee, a task that is expected to require significant reductions to Medicaid spending. That has spurred significant concern among centrist Republicans, many of whom have a lot of Medicaid recipients in their districts. In an interview with CNN’s Kaitlin Collins Wednesday night, Johnson ruled out putting per-capita caps on Medicaid in the eventual budget reconciliation bill.

Trump’s nominee for solicitor general won’t rule out ignoring court orders in ‘extreme cases’	President Donald Trump’s nominee to be solicitor general told the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday that presidents might rightfully defy court orders in 'extreme cases.' 'Generally, if there’s a direct court order that binds a federal or state official, they should follow it,' D. John Sauer said at his confirmation hearing, in response to questioning by Sen.

Senate Republicans say House budget won’t fly with them	House Republicans spent weeks in painstaking negotiations before delivering a budget blueprint for 'one big, beautiful bill.' Now Senate Republicans are preparing to tear it apart. Despite a razor-thin 217-215 House vote Tuesday, GOP senators indicated Wednesday they would not accept Speaker Mike Johnson’s fiscal framework as-is — heralding a rough road for President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda on Capitol Hill. That’s not to say they want to start from scratch: Most Senate Republicans said Wednesday that they were prepared to switch to the House’s one-bill approach after spending more than two months pushing a c...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/26/senate-republicans-reject-house-budget-00206244	2025-02-26T10:47:05-08:00	https://static.politico.com/c9/30/787cc212433d86bf0983e2c91f7d/u-s-congress-38280.jpg
Musk meets with Johnson as DOGE tension heats up	Speaker Mike Johnson met with Elon Musk late Tuesday night at the White House, according to two people granted anonymity to discuss a private meeting. It comes as the Department of Government Efficiency's slash-and-burn cuts across the federal government are fueling growing tensions with Republican members of Congress. Musk and DOGE, which the tech billionaire helms, have been targets of recent town hall anger in some Republican-held districts. A growing number of Republican lawmakers, in quiet conversations on Capitol Hill and increasingly in public, have questioned DOGE's tactics and called on the office to operate in a more methodical method.

Progressives tap a rising star to deliver their response to Trump	Progressives are naming California Rep. Lateefah Simon, a rising Democratic star, to deliver their response to President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress next week, according to a statement provided first to POLITICO. 'I’m honored to speak on behalf of the Working Families Party,' Simon said in a statement. 'We need a government that is run by and for working people, not billionaires — and that’s what the WFP is fighting for.' Simon, who is serving her first term and represents a district centered around Oakland, California, is expected to focus on the impact of Trump and Elon Musk’s dramatic overhaul of the federal government, according to a spokesperson.

Quick recap: With GOP Reps. Thomas Massie, Tim Burchett, Warren Davidson and Victoria Spartz firmly opposed, House leaders pulled the budget resolution vote at the last minute Tuesday night, only to reverse course after a wild whip effort and some conversations with President Donald Trump. All but Massie flipped their votes when Republican leaders called members back to the floor. Now that it’s approved, Senate Republicans are largely prepared to switch to the House’s one-bill track, which would link together defense, energy and border security with an ove...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/26/congress/johnson-budget-senate-changes-00206158	2025-02-26T05:00:00-08:00	
Republican leaders seek ‘united’ GOP funding strategy as shutdown looms	Republican leaders from both sides of the Capitol will on Wednesday endeavor to settle on a unified GOP plan for approaching government funding negotiations with Democrats ahead of the March government shutdown deadline. House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole said in an interview late Tuesday night that he and Speaker Mike Johnson are hoping to land an agreement with their Senate counterparts on 'a path forward' on how to fund government programs.

Congressional Republicans start backing away from Musk	Elon Musk is beginning to wear out his welcome with congressional Republicans. In the House, Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday shrugged off Musk’s attempt to interfere with his budget plan. In the Senate, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis pointedly suggested that President Donald Trump’s appointees should stand up to the billionaire’s whims, including his recent demand that all federal workers justify their employment. And a growing number of GOP lawmakers urged the tech mogul to show more compassion for the civil servants he’s already culled.

Dems join Republicans to kill Biden drilling rule	A group of Senate Democrats crossed the aisle Tuesday to blow a hole in former President Joe Biden’s environmental legacy. The Senate voted 54-44 on a resolution that would undo an Interior Department rule affecting offshore drilling. Democratic Sens. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Catherine Cortez-Masto of Nevada and Jacky Rosen of Nevada joined all Republicans present to overturn the rule. It was the Senate's first action this year under the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to kill newly-issued rulemakings by simple majority.

House approves ‘big, beautiful bill’ budget after wild whip effort	House Republicans approved a budget framework for President Donald Trump's sweeping domestic policy agenda Tuesday — a major victory for Speaker Mike Johnson who worked with Trump and fellow leaders in a chaotic last-ditch effort to win over naysayers within the GOP ranks. The vote went almost entirely along party lines, 217-213, with every Democrat voting against the measure and only GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky joining them.

House budget vote back on as GOP leaders try to convince holdouts	Speaker Mike Johnson rescheduled a vote on the House Republican budget plan shortly after deputies announced it was canceled, creating widespread confusion about the next steps for President Donald Trump’s sweeping domestic policy agenda. The decision to scrap and then rescheduled the vote came after several conservative hard-liners made clear they would not support the fiscal blueprint as written. Adopting the budget measure is a key step toward passing the 'big, beautiful bill' that Trump and Johnson have called for — one that includes border security, tax and energy provisions that the president campaigned on. It is unclear when or if House GOP leaders will bring the measure back up.

How Trump is taking a ‘both sides’ approach to his agenda	President Donald Trump is 'playing both sides' in getting his legislative agenda through Congress, according to two people familiar with his conversations about what's happening on Capitol Hill — and he is growing increasingly ambivalent about whether it happens via competing House or Senate approaches. Trump last week appeared to endorse Speaker Mike Johnson's bid for 'one big, beautiful bill,' then later in the week praised Senate Majority Leader John Thune as he advanced an alternative plan that would split Trump's agenda into two pieces. In fact, the two people said Trump just wants to see some movement.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Trump had been 'tremendously' helpful ahead of the critical vote. Speaker Mike Johnson likewise told reporters several House Republicans had called the president as they weighed their votes.

Trump’s latest budget nominee avows funding freeze, pledges to follow Vought	The Senate began its public vetting on Tuesday of President Donald Trump’s pick for the No. 2 post at the White House budget office, a position key to carrying out the president’s funding freeze. Dan Bishop, a former congressmember from North Carolina, testified before senators in his first confirmation hearing to be deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. Pledging to follow the orders of Trump and White House budget director Russell Vought, the OMB nominee vowed to 'fix' a federal bureaucracy he characterized as 'self-absorbed, inefficient, unaccountable and mal-administered.' Bishop skirted a direct question about whether he would follow the law, or Trump, if the president directed him to take action that would break the law.

Prospects dim for reviving deal to grow the federal judiciary	Bipartisan talks to add judges to the federal judiciary are over — at least for now. At a Tuesday morning hearing of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet on Tuesday, Republicans and Democrats blamed the other for the demise of a deal last year to add dozens of new judgeships to U.S. courts. House Republicans failed to bring the agreement, in the form of legislation, up for a vote until after President Donald Trump’s election victory. Following its passage on the House floor, then-President Joe Biden vetoed the legislation in a bid to block Trump from being able to add a host of new conservative judges to the bench.

‘Furious and looking for action’: DOGE is turning into a Democratic candidate recruitment tool	Democrats say sweeping government cuts led by Elon Musk have started to awaken a latent opposition to President Donald Trump — and they’re hoping it will motivate a slew of new down-ballot candidates to run in the years ahead. Early interest in running for office is already beginning to rise — at least one major candidate recruitment organization saw a sharp spike of more than 2,000 new applications pouring in as Musk issued major actions pushing federal workers out. A lot of that web traffic came from Reddit threads of former federal employees considering runs for political office that sprang up last week.

In a letter shared first with POLITICO, Connolly, a Virginia lawmaker, announced he was leading the minority party in a probe against Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. Connolly is requesting materials related to Martin’s inquiries into Democratic officials, arguing that Martin is moving to suppress political expression. One of Martin’s targets is Rep.

Capitol agenda: Big, beautiful budget on life support	Mike Johnson has about 12 hours to get his conference behind his plan for enacting the president’s sweeping agenda. It’s not looking good. The speaker insists he’s not changing the budget resolution, which would set parameters for a sweeping bill to address border security, energy and tax policy. If House Democrats are at full attendance, just two GOP 'no' votes would sink the resolution. He and other GOP leaders held meetings late into the night Monday to try to flip holdouts, who fall into two camps with diametrically opposed demands: centrists who don’t want significant reductions to Medicaid and other safety-net programs, and conservatives who want steeper spendin...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/25/congress/johnson-budget-trouble-houldouts-00205900	2025-02-25T05:00:00-08:00	
The House GOP's Medicaid holdouts are coming around	Some of the House Republicans who have doubted Speaker Mike Johnson's budget plan said Monday night that they’re more inclined to support the blueprint after GOP leaders ruled out certain cuts to Medicaid in a private meeting. GOP leaders provided some generic but reassuring details about how they would protect certain Medicaid services and not cut into the share of federal payments for Medicaid, a joint state-federal program, according to several lawmakers who attended the late night confab in Johnson's office. A group of swing-district Republicans and others representing redder areas were in the meeting, along with House Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.). Those members have demanded more detail from GOP leaders on how they would reach the $2 trillion in spending cuts they a...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/24/congress/house-budget-medicaid-holdouts-come-around-00205886	2025-02-24T18:46:50-08:00	
Musk renews his ‘5 things’ demand with Trump’s apparent support	An emboldened Elon Musk is once again directing federal employees to justify their existence in writing — or face dismissal. Musk made his renewed demand in a social media post Monday after President Donald Trump seemed to contradict other senior administration officials and approve the directive that the billionaire initially sent out to workers over the weekend. 'Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance,' Musk wrote on X. 'Failure to respond a second time will result in termination.' The billionaire’s Department of Government Efficiency on Saturday sent an email to federal agencies with the subject line 'What did you do last week.' It sowed confusion and fear among workers...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/24/musk-5-things-demand-trump-support-00205876	2025-02-24T17:59:36-08:00	https://static.politico.com/5e/9c/78082482436ca31a76b7b119f404/cpac-36820.jpg
Government funding deal ‘very close’ as negotiations hinge on Trump power struggle	The fight over curbing President Donald Trump’s ability to freeze cash is now the make-or-break dispute as leading lawmakers close in on a deal to avert a government shutdown next month. Top appropriators on both sides of the Capitol reported good progress Monday night toward a bipartisan deal on overall spending totals for the military and non-defense programs, with a shutdown deadline looming on March 14. But House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole said Democrats’ insistence on adding conditions to stop Trump from withholding funding that Congress already appropriated could foil a final agreement. 'I think we've moved a long way on the numbers. We're very close. I would say essentially there,' Cole told repor...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/24/congress/government-funding-deal-trump-power-struggle-00205869	2025-02-24T17:41:59-08:00	
Cory Mills continues to refute allegations of assault	Rep. Cory Mills continues to push back against allegations he assaulted a woman last week. In an interview at the Capitol on Monday evening, Mills emphasized that both he and the alleged victim — who POLITICO is declining to name as a possible target of domestic violence — denied that any assault took place. The woman initiated the call to law enforcement, but said in a statement afterwards she did so in a state of being 'severely jet-lagged and sleep-deprived' and that there was, in fact, 'no physical altercation.' 'Both myself and the other individual said that what they’re claiming took place never took place and that’s been reported multiple times,' M...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/24/congress/cory-mills-denies-assault-allegations-00205873	2025-02-24T17:36:13-08:00	
Winning over budget holdouts ‘won't be that difficult,’ Arrington says	House Budget Chair Jodey Arrington said Monday he is not expecting substantial alternations to the fiscal blueprint he muscled through his committee earlier this month as Republicans try to placate holdouts and move it across the floor this week. GOP leaders are hoping to tee up a final vote Tuesday on the budget resolution as moderate Republicans push back against some of the spending cuts the framework prescribes and some hard-line conservatives demand even deeper slashing.

Democrats plot difficult votes for Energy and Commerce Republicans	The House Energy and Commerce Committee will on Tuesday adopt its oversight plans for the new Congress — and Democrats might make it all about Medicaid. Members of the minority party who sit on the powerful panel intend to force their Republican colleagues to take difficult votes on amendments to the majority’s 17-page document that outlines the types of hearings and legislative efforts it will prioritize in the coming months. Some of those amendments could put Republicans on the record about their support for Medicaid on the very same day the full House is scheduled to vote on a budget resolution that would instruct the committee to slash $880 billion from programs under its purview. The spending cuts will be necessary to finance legislation to enact President Donald Trump’s domestic poli...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/24/congress/democrats-plot-difficult-votes-for-energy-and-commerce-republicans-00205781	2025-02-24T14:03:00-08:00	
Jordan uses first subpoena of new Congress to target Biden admin	House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan subpoenaed the FBI for a trove of new materials related to the Biden administration’s activities, including investigations around the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and communications with Big Tech companies. The letter to new FBI Director Kash Patel is the first subpoena request from Jordan this Congress, as the Ohio Republican’s key ally and former staffer assumes the top post at the law enforcement agency. Jordan argued that former FBI Director Christopher Wray failed to produce some materials requested by the committee last Congress — and he likely has a m...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/24/congress/jordan-subpoena-biden-capitol-attack-00205815	2025-02-24T13:37:52-08:00

Still the 'plan' to hold budget plan vote this week, Johnson says	Speaker Mike Johnson said Monday it's still his 'plan' to clear his budget plan on the House floor this week despite mounting skepticism from key holdouts who could foil his wishes. Speaking at an event held by Americans for Prosperity, Johnson stressed the importance of moving the 'one, big beautiful bill' the House is pursuing so that a swath of 2017 tax cuts don't expire without an extension. But the speaker is facing off with GOP members who are still not supportive of the budget blueprint that is an essential first step toward that legislation.

Capitol agenda: Johnson's make-or-break budget week	Speaker Mike Johnson doesn't yet have the votes to get his budget plan approved on the House floor. He’s barreling ahead anyway. Johnson is looking to move the budget resolution through House Rules today and to the floor on Tuesday. The former seems likely, at least — the Rules Committee’s conservative hard-liners, Reps. Chip Roy and Ralph Norman, are on board with Johnson’s framework. But Tuesday’s floor vote is ambitious, even with Trump endorsing Johnson’s one-bill strategy for passing the president’s border, energy and tax agenda. Johnson can likely only afford to lose one or two Republicans if he wants to move forward on his plan, depending on Democratic attendance. Rep.

It amounts to a key inflection point for President Donald Trump’s domestic policy agenda, and GOP senators — who muscled through their own two-bill legislative blueprint early Friday morning — are eagerly watching to see if Johnson can finally unify his fractious conference and move forward with his own plan.

Jordan, citing an article from The Washington Post which led with the firing of a locksmith from Yosemite National Park, said on 'Fox News Sunday': 'That's the best you can do?' The Washington Post article in question last week cited the example of the dismissal of 'the sole employee with the keys and the institutional knowledge needed to rescue visitors from locked restrooms.'

Mark Cuban says he’s not running for president in 2028	Mark Cuban, the billionaire business mogul and 'Shark Tank' star, quashed speculation he will be making a White House run in 2028 — even as he has become a prominent voice against Donald Trump's agenda in Washington. The Dallas Mavericks minority owner was asked if his name would be on a ballot in the near future at the Principles First convention, a gathering of conservatives who feel politically homeless in Trump's MAGA-fied version of the party. 'Hell no. It's not going to happen,' Cuban said, before joking to the crowd gathered at the JW Marriott in Washington, D.C., roughly three blocks from the White House, then quipped: 'Okay, if y'all write in and I don't have [a campaign].'

But inside the gleeful halls of the Conservative Political Action Conference, the vanguard of the Republican Party couldn’t care less. At the annual gathering of conservatives inaugurated by Ronald Reagan, attendees are buying up Musk-related merchandise and the tech mogul is being feted as a chainsaw-wielding warrior taking on the deep state on behalf of Trump.

In comments on Brian Kilmeade’s radio show Friday, Trump openly entertained a notion that the GOP's efforts to extend expiring tax cuts with new policies on border security and energy production may need to be broken up into smaller bills to clear Congress. The Senate approved a budget resolution early in the morning after hours of amendment votes that would pave the way for two bills to accomplish those priorities, while the House is set to muscle through a budget blueprint next week that would set the stage for one piece of legislation encapsulating everything.

For now, it’s the GOP's 'Plan B,' as President Donald Trump's preferred budget may not have the support to move ahead next week in the House. Senators slogged through 25 roll-call votes on amendments as Democrats tried to squeeze the opposing party and lay the groundwork for 2026 attack ads.

Neera Tanden is returning to the Center for American Progress. She thinks Democrats have work to do.	Neera Tanden is reprising her role at the helm of the Center for American Progress, one of the Democratic Party’s most influential think tanks, as the party looks to regain its footing with voters and counter President Donald Trump. It’s a homecoming for Tanden, who was named president and chief executive of CAP Thursday, resuming roles she held before serving in then-President Joe Biden’s administration.

Grassley starts talks with White House on moving judicial nominees	Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley is starting talks with the White House about moving judicial nominees through his committee. 'The only discussion I've had is the process,' the Iowa Republican said in an interview this week. 'Just with the White House Counsel.' The update, however preliminary, signals the start of President Donald Trump’s relaunched efforts to transform the courts. Confirming hundreds of judges — including three Supreme Court justices — was a marquee achievement of Trump's first term that is poised to leave the federal judiciary with a conservative slant for decades. This time around, there aren't many slots for Trump to fill: There are just 43 total vacancies in the federal judiciary, according to <a href='https://www.uscourts.gov/data-news/judicial-vacancies/current...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/20/congress/judges-grassley-white-house-00205308	2025-02-20T14:10:38-08:00	
Welcome to a new era of West Wing Playbook	Donald Trump returned to power exactly one month ago today, and it is hardly possible to overstate the magnitude of the changes he has brought and is seeking to bring to the federal government and to the workings of power in Washington. The modern federal government — and much of the economy that gravitates around government in the nation’s capital — is overwhelmingly the product of a few big historical movements: the New Deal in the 1930s, World War II and the 45 years of Cold War that followed, and the burst of government social and regulatory activism in the 1960s and 1970s. The policies and agencies of government that flowed from those movements shaped national life and the lives of many millions of people for decades. It seems certain that the disruption the Trump administration is pr...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/politico-west-wing-playbook-00205226	2025-02-20T13:30:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/b1/d7/5b89080a4f8283982268e082ace9/politico-cms-shared-graphic-1120x629.jpg
Johnson plays down DOGE checks at CPAC	Speaker Mike Johnson appeared to put the brakes on rising talk from President Donald Trump and Elon Musk about sending checks to American taxpayers with savings from the ongoing cuts from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. 'Politically, that would be great for us, send everyone a check,' Johnson said in an interview at CPAC. 'But if you think about our core principles,' he added, noting the growing national debt: 'I think we need to pay down the credit card.' Johnson again cheered Musk’s efforts to slash the federal government. 'What Elon and the team are doing is what Congress has not had the ability to do,' Johnson said. 'They are exposing this massive fraud, waste and abuse that we have not been unable to uncover because the deep state has hidden it from us.'

Who is considering a run for McConnell's Senate seat?	The shadow primary to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell was already in full swing. Now it’s coming out into the open. The former Senate GOP leader's departure was not unexpected — he spent the opening days of his final term in the Senate shooting down President Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks. But his official upcoming exit poses a question for Kentucky Republicans: Do they want his replacement to be a protege with an independent streak or a loyal foot soldier for Trump and his MAGA movement?

Senate stares down an all-nighter to approve a ‘Plan B’ budget Trump spurned	Senate Republicans are embarking Thursday afternoon on an amendment free-for-all expected to keep lawmakers voting through the night — all to green-light a fiscal blueprint President Donald Trump doesn’t favor. The budget measure the Senate is on track to adopt at the end of an arduous 'vote-a-rama' sets a framework for a party-line package of energy policy, defense spending and border security investments. But Trump wants trillions of dollars in tax cuts rolled in, and so do Republicans on the other side of the Capitol.

Senate confirms Kash Patel to lead FBI	The Senate has confirmed Kash Patel as director of the FBI, launching a new chapter for the nation’s top domestic investigative agency. Lawmakers voted to confirm Patel 51-49, with Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joining with all Democrats in opposition. A longtime Trump loyalist who has in the past expressed his desire to help root out the 'deep state,' Patel has raised questions among critics about whether he’s prepared to insulate the department from undue influence from the White House. President Donald Trump has made clear he is prepared to go after his adversaries in his second administration, and Patel is poised to be a key figure in those efforts.

Trump says federal government should 'take over' local politics in DC	President Donald Trump said he was thinking about taking over local politics in the District of Columbia, a move that’d reignite controversy about the authority of the nation’s capital city to govern itself. 'The federal government should take over the governance of D.C. and run it really, really properly,' Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday. 'We should run it strong, run it with law and order, make it absolutely flawless.' Trump has toyed with the idea of overtaking local politics since his first term, but this desire has intensified in recent years following a massive post-pandemic crime wave that has since cooled.

Patel on cusp of confirmation to run FBI as Collins says she'll oppose	Kash Patel, President Donald Trump's controversial nominee to lead the FBI, is on track to be confirmed in a matter of hours to run the federal law enforcement agency — but at least one Republican will withhold support. The Senate voted 51-47 to end debate on Patel's nomination on Thursday, setting up a final confirmation vote later in the afternoon. As that procedural vote was underway, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced she would vote against him, saying in a statement that his 'recent political profile undermines his ability to serve in the apolitical role of Director of the FBI.' Democrats have echoed those concerns, rallying against Patel's bid to be the next FBI director on grounds that he would put fealty to the president over his responsibilities to lead a department that has t...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/20/congress/kash-patel-fbi-cloture-00205164	2025-02-20T08:53:32-08:00	
McConnell to announce retirement from the Senate	Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the former majority leader and the most consequential Republican senator of his generation, will announce Thursday he will not seek re-election next year. The announcement is in a morning floor speech, did not come as a major surprise in Washington or in his home state: After stepping down as GOP leader last year, he gave few indications he would pursue an eighth term in the Senate. The news of McConnell's retirement was described by three people with direct knowledge of the matter. They were granted anonymity to share the news ahead of a formal announcement. McConnell turned 83 on Thursday. He has recently suffered several health challenges, including a fall taken while leaving the Senate chamber earlier this month that has left him using a wheelchair.

'We've sanitized different language so significantly that, you know, people don't feel like we're talking to them.'

Fresh executive order targets sanctuary cities, federal aid for undocumented migrants	President Donald Trump signed an immigration executive order late Wednesday designed to target sanctuary cities and ensure undocumented immigrants aren’t receiving federal benefits. The order directs federal departments and agencies to identify any federal programs providing financial benefits to undocumented immigrants, while in the same breath acknowledging that under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, undocumented immigrants are already mostly barred from public programs. But the order argues that the Biden administration 'undercut the goal of' temporary parole authority, which allows the government to grant migrants temporary permission to live and work in the U.S., by using it too extensively.

The 6 most urgent policy questions we have for America’s governors	Governors are scrambling to figure out the most effective way to respond to the seismic changes unleashed in the opening weeks of the Trump administration. The basic calculus is clear: Democrats are searching for ways to thwart the White House’s most sweeping actions, while Republicans are desperate to show they’re fully on board with the MAGA agenda. But beneath that crude dynamic, the deliberations happening in state capitals are far more nuanced and politically fraught. Democrats are wary of simply mounting a scorched-earth resistance to President Donald Trump’s policies given the GOP’s sweeping victories on Election Day. That’s especially true on immigration, where the president’s hard-line tactics have resonated even with voters in deep blue swaths of the country.

But Vance didn’t put a stake in the Senate’s competing approach — as a backup. Senate Republicans took the message, delivered during a closed-door lunch, as a sign that they have a green light from the administration to move forward with their two-bill budget plan this week. It would tee up a border, defense and energy bill, saving an overhaul of the tax code for a separate bill later this year.

It usually takes congressional leaders at least a month to finalizing a dozen annual funding bills after top appropriators strike an initial agreement on overall totals for the military and non-defense programs. But Collins (R-Maine) and her fellow top appropriators have yet to strike that 'toplines' agreement to lay the groundwork for negotiating the details of the 12 bills — and the shutdown deadline on March 14 is quickly ticking closer.

But this is not what GOP senators had in mind. Trump’s public call Wednesday for the adoption of a House-drafted budget framework — and the 'one big, beautiful bill' it sketches out — left Senate Republicans flat-footed and uncertain about the path forward. 'As they say, did not see that one coming,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune said after emerging from a morning huddle with his fellow GOP leaders.

GOP privacy hawks brush off concerns about DOGE data dives	Some of the Senate’s most notorious GOP privacy hawks are shrugging off moves by Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency to access Americans’ sensitive taxpayer data. It’s a sharp turn for lawmakers who often carp about intrusions on individual privacy, and just the latest example of how Republicans are willing to forgive an unelected billionaire set on shattering institutional norms. In this case, Musk is seeking to give his team the ability to look up personal information on an IRS system that contains broad individual financial records along with information from the Social Security Administration. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a frequent critic of Big Tech’s use of Americans' personal da...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/18/congress/gop-privacy-hawks-brush-off-concerns-doge-data-dives-00204812	2025-02-18T18:55:00-08:00	
Senate tees up ‘vote-a-rama’ on budget for party-line package	Senate Republicans took their first procedural vote Monday night on the budget plan they hope to use to swiftly enact a border security, energy and defense spending bill — and deliver President Donald Trump a major legislative victory during his first months in office. The 50-47 vote will allow GOP senators to forge ahead later this week with floor debate on that fiscal blueprint, followed by a so-called vote-a-rama — an overnight barrage of amendment votes that precedes adoption of the budget resolution. But the power of that measure to allow lawmakers to skirt Senate filibuster rules to draft and pass a partisan bill won't be unlocked until GOP leaders in the House and Senate get on the same page about the scope of their party-line package. Eventually the House and Senate will need to ad...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/18/congress/senate-procedural-vote-budget-resolution-00204784	2025-02-18T16:48:43-08:00	
Trump's FBI pick one step closer to confirmation	Kash Patel, the controversial nominee to lead the FBI, cleared another key procedural hurdle Tuesday. The Senate voted 48-45 to move forward with Patel’s nomination, setting up his confirmation vote in the coming days to helm the agency for a 10-year term. Patel, if confirmed, is set to be a central figure in President Donald Trump’s efforts to leverage his powers against perceived enemies. A former House staffer who worked to discredit the congressional inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Patel has promised to go after Trump’s adversaries and shut down the FBI’s Washington headquarters on Day 1 of his tenure to create 'a museum' of the 'deep state.' Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats have argued that Patel would put fealty to the president ahead of his duties as FBI ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/18/congress/kash-patel-senate-confirmation-cloture-00204744	2025-02-18T15:27:33-08:00	
Ways and Means eyeing limits to corporate tax deductions	The House Ways and Means Committee is looking at limiting corporate state and local tax deductions as one way to offset the costs of a large party-line tax bill, according to two people familiar with the discussions. The panel, which oversees all tax policy, is considering the limit among other potential offsets for the bill, according to the people, who were granted anonymity to share private deliberations. Companies currently can deduct an unlimited amount of state income, property and sales taxes from their federal tax bill. The discussions signal that a proposal to limit corporate SALT, as the deduction is called, may have enough support among Republicans to make it into a party-line tax bill.

The House GOP budget resolution is in trouble	Speaker Mike Johnson is staring down at least a dozen Republican holdouts on the budget blueprint he wants to put on the House floor in the coming days — and he can only afford to lose one member and still approve the resolution along party lines. Johnson and his whip team are using the current week-long recess to ramp up engagement with undecided Republicans, including seven members — if not more — who have raised serious concerns about deep cuts to Medicaid in the House GOP budget resolution. Several other members are wary of a move to raise the debt limit as part of the pl...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/18/congress/budget-reconciliation-trump-whip-00204735	2025-02-18T13:59:31-08:00

Senate Republicans edge out the House again, planning budget vote this week	Senate Republicans will vote this week on a budget blueprint that would unlock a key part of President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda. 'It’s time to act on the decisive mandate the American people gave to President Trump in November,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune wrote on X Tuesday afternoon. 'Securing the border, rebuilding our defense, and unleashing American energy. That starts this week with passing [Budget Chair Lindsey Graham’s] budget.'

Senator says GOP's hands are tied on DOGE cuts — 'except complain'	Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley said Congress is powerless in the face of cuts from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. 'Congress can’t do anything except complain' about the slashing of the federal government at the hands of Musk and his allies, Grassley said during a press call on Tuesday, according to a report from RadioIowa. The Iowan's comments serve as a stark admission that, despite growing Republican discomfort that Musk's actions are getting the green light from President Donald Trump, there is little the GOP might be able, or willing, to do.

Trump is shocking official Washington. Will he leave his mark on the District too?	Donald Trump isn’t just looking to remake the federal government. He has his sights set on the city of Washington, too. In his first few weeks in office, the president has moved to drastically alter the fabric of the nation’s capital. He ordered thousands of Washington-area federal workers to return to the office — some of whom his administration is moving to lay off. He injected himself and his allies onto the board of the John F. Kennedy Center to recast 'woke' performing art culture. And the city's mayor said she has been briefed <a href='https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/16/trump-local-dc-city-politics-018777	2025-02-16T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/92/e6/1a2abd804202b6e1397ebe674b8e/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1574583084
Dems concede Republicans ‘running circles’ around them online as Trump remakes Washington	The Department of Government Efficiency created its own account on X last November, amassing 4 million followers with a stream of news on contract cancellations and other cuts to the bureaucracy. Elon Musk has posted relentlessly on the social media platform he owns, promoting his own voice on an algorithm he controls. The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, started a rapid response account in January with about 121,000 followers, a fraction of DOGE’s reach. And Democrats held traditional rallies outside the USAID and Treasury buildin...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/16/democrats-losing-trump-doge-information-battle-00204522	2025-02-16T04:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/47/9c/9c06460a45ecbd3e76dc85087ee8/trump-65624.jpg
They’re not just suing to stop DOGE. They’re suing Elon Musk himself.	Elon Musk’s efforts to disrupt and dismantle the federal government at the behest of Donald Trump have already sparked a legion of lawsuits. Now the legal challengers are setting their sights on a new target: Musk himself. Two new cases accuse the ultra-wealthy CEO of illegally amassing too much government power without the accountability typically required of high-level executive branch officials. They are seeking court orders that would force Musk to halt the cost-cutting and information-gathering activities he has been spearheading through his U.S. DOGE Service. The lawsuits rest on a provision of the Constitution that says powerful federal officers must be 'established by law,' must be formally appointed by the president and must be confirmed by the Senate. Musk, of course, has not bee...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/14/elon-musk-doge-lawsuits-constitution-00204479	2025-02-14T16:04:32-08:00	https://static.politico.com/cc/59/adfce0824f4e8cf3d6f22040934a/trump-97597.jpg

Senate GOP mulls vote on budget blueprint next week	Senators are bracing for a likely battle next week over the GOP’s budget blueprint that will allow Republicans in the coming weeks to draft and pass a sweeping border, energy and defense bill. Majority Leader John Thune hasn’t made a formal decision yet about whether he’ll bring the Senate’s budget resolution up for a vote on the chamber floor. But several GOP senators view it as increasingly likely that they will act next week after the Senate Budget Committee adopted the measure on Wednesday. Sen.

Capitol agenda: Johnson's next battles	Speaker Mike Johnson muscled his budget blueprint through committee. That will likely be the easy part. Late Thursday the House Budget Committee approved a resolution in a party-line vote that will allow Republicans in the chamber to move forward on their one-bill strategy to pass President Donald Trump's agenda on the border, energy and tax cuts.

Swing-district Republicans are questioning Mike Johnson's budget	Speaker Mike Johnson has cleared a major hurdle toward unlocking the massive, party-line bill he’s pursuing to enact President Donald Trump’s vast domestic agenda. Now he’s got more jumping to do. On Thursday, as Republican hard-liners celebrated a concession they won from party leaders to force deeper spending cuts as part of the GOP’s sweeping policy push, centrists expressed deep alarm about the trajectory of the massive legislation that will include border security, energy, defense and tax provisions.

Fiscal hawks tweak House Republicans’ party-line framework	Members of the House Freedom Caucus have succeeded in modifying the budget plan GOP leaders are using to set up their party-line package to deliver on President Donald Trump’s agenda. The House Budget Committee voted 21-16 on Thursday to adopt an amendment that would shrink the amount of tax cuts Republicans can enact if they don’t cut $2 trillion in spending at the same time. House Republican leaders negotiated the amendment with members of the group of fiscal conservatives to lock in support for clearing the budget plan through committee and bolster their chances of adopting it on the floor.

House Republicans advance their budget after appeasing hard-liners	Score one for the backers of 'one big, beautiful bill.' House Republicans launched their budget plan out of committee Thursday night — the first legislative step toward fulfilling President Donald Trump’s policy agenda but at odds with the Senate's continued pursuit of a 'two-track' plan.

Murkowski introduces bill to rename mountain Denali — countering Trump's executive order	Sen. Lisa Murkowski rolled out legislation on Thursday to formally rename North America’s highest mountain as Denali — officially countering President Donald Trump's executive order to rename it Mount McKinley. The bill, which fellow Republican Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan is co-sponsoring, would require the Alaska mountain to be referred to as Denali in any laws, maps, regulations, documents, papers or other U.S. records. 'In Alaska, it’s Denali. … This isn’t a political issue — Alaskans from every walk of life have long been advocating for this mountain to be recognized by its true name,' Murkowski said in a statement.	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/13/congress/murkowski-pushes-on-denali-00204228	2025-02-13T15:30:38-08:00
