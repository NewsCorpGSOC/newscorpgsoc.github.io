Trump says Hegseth's ‘support is strong and deep’ amid confirmation fight	President Donald Trump isn’t moving on from embattled pick for Defense secretary Pete Hegseth yet, calling the former Fox News personality’s support 'strong and deep' in a post to his social media site Friday morning. 'Pete Hegseth is doing very well. His support is strong and deep, much more so than the Fake News would have you believe,' Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Trump names ICE chief and makes another round of immigration announcements	President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday night announced a new round of nominees and appointments to tackle his aggressive immigration and homeland security agenda. Trump said he was nominating Rodney Scott as commissioner of Customs and Border Protection.

He helped implement Trump’s Remain in Mexico Policy, Title 42 and Safe Third Country agreements. Trump also announced he was tapping Caleb Vitello, who’s currently the assistant director of the Office of Firearms and Tactical Programs in Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to serve as acting director of ICE.

Trump picks David Perdue to be ambassador to China	Donald Trump has selected former Georgia Sen. David Perdue to serve as ambassador to China. Perdue has significant business experience in Asia, including China, something he ran on during his Senate election in 2014. As the former CEO of Dollar General and a top executive at Sara Lee and Reebok, Perdue was responsible for significant corporate restructuring and global expansion, and has lived in both Singapore and Hong Kong.

Obama calls political ‘divisiveness’ one of the ‘greatest challenges of our time’	CHICAGO — Former President Barack Obama called out divisiveness and polarization as 'one of the greatest challenges of our time,' as he avoided any specific political references in his first public remarks since the election. In a speech Thursday at his foundation’s Democracy Forum, Obama urged his audience to embrace pluralism and celebrate people’s differences – the closest he came to a political message in his remarks. 'It’s about recognizing that in a democracy, power comes from forging alliances and building coalitions… not only for the woke, but also for the waking,' Obama told the crowd of about 650 participants at the Obama Foundation event on Chicago’s South Side, just a few miles from where Obama’s presidential center is under construction.

Elon Musk was behind mysterious pro-Trump super PAC that invoked Ruth Bader Ginsburg	Elon Musk was the sole funder of a super PAC formed in the final weeks of the election that spent millions on ads claiming Donald Trump’s position on abortion was aligned with that of the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Musk poured $20.5 million into the group on Oct. 24, according to a campaign finance filing submitted to the Federal Election Commission late Thursday. The timing of the donation meant that Musk’s support did not have to be disclosed until after the election. The group, named RBG PAC, spent nearly all of that money on advertising. Its ads claimed that Ginsburg — the liberal longtime justice and staunch women’s rights advocate who died in 2020 — was of 'one mind' with Trump on the issue of abortion. Its website featured photos of Trump and Ginsburg with the c...	https://www.politico.com/elon-musk-trump-donations-super-pac	2024-12-05T17:42:41-08:00	https://static.politico.com/9e/08/913587a54778b5ec49989e640f20/elon-musk-at-madison-square-garden-78022.jpg

House rebuffs Democratic efforts to force release of Gaetz ethics report	The House rejected two Democratic-led efforts to force the release of ethics findings into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, with Republicans arguing that the Florida firebrand’s departure from Congress puts him outside their jurisdiction. Lawmakers voted along almost entirely party lines to table an effort from Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) to force the immediate release of the Ethics Committee report on Gaetz. Casten cited multiple examples in his resolution where the House released findings on members even after they left Congress.

Hegseth says he won’t withdraw as he struggles as Trump’s Defense pick	Pete Hegseth spent this week attempting to woo senators — and others — as he fought to remain Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of Defense. He met with wary and supportive lawmakers, his lawyer tried to shoot down misconduct allegations and even his mother went on Fox to defend her son.

House Ethics panel meets on Gaetz, but chair declines to give further details	The House Ethics Committee said the panel met Thursday to discuss former Rep. Matt Gaetz, but declined to release any details. 'The Committee is continuing to discuss the matter,' the panel said, adding there would be 'no further statements.' Ethics Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.) declined to comment on the meeting but said he’d vote against a last-ditch effort by Democrats to force the release of the report. The panel’s top Democrat, Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania, wasn’t at Thursday’s meeting, though Guest brushed off her absence and said 'it’s not uncommon' for members to not be able to attend. Wild expressed frustration with Guest after the panel's last closed-door meeting, saying he had mischaracterized a vote. Guest said the panel would meet again this year.

Republican senator prepares ‘DOGE Act’ targeting agencies	Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn is drafting legislation to stymie growth of the federal workforce and move agencies out of the nation's capital. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to slash government bureaucracy and set up the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, an outside group that will recommend cuts to spending and regulations. Blackburn plans to join that effort, led by tech mogul Elon Musk and 2024 Republican presidential candidate and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, with her own bill.

Former officials urge closed-door Senate hearings on Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s pick for intel chief	Nearly 100 former senior U.S. diplomats and intelligence and national security officials have urged Senate leaders to schedule closed-door hearings to allow for a full review of the government’s files on former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump’s pick to be national intelligence director. The former officials, who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, said they were 'alarmed' by the choice of Gabbard to oversee all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies.

House GOP opposition signals trouble ahead for Johnson on a spending deal	Speaker Mike Johnson is in talks when his own conference about how to fund the government. But he’s got at least two 'no' votes no matter what he does. Reps. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) and Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), two House Freedom Caucus members, told POLITICO they would oppose any short-term government funding bill, known as a continuing resolution or a CR, regardless of whether Johnson attaches disaster aid to it. The Freedom Caucus took an official position this week that any disaster relief needs to be paid for and limited to what is 'absolutely necessary' right now. President Joe Biden requested nearly $100 billion in emergency disaster aid. 'I have never voted for a CR and I don’t intend on concluding my time here by voting for one now.

Trump to sit down with Kristen Welker on ‘Meet the Press’	President-elect Donald Trump has lined up his first network interview since winning the election. Trump will sit down with NBC’s Kristen Welker for an interview on 'Meet the Press' set to air at 10:30 a.m. ET on Sunday, the network announced Wednesday. The interview will take place on Friday. The president-elect rarely participated in interviews with mainstream media outlets during the campaign, sticking to Fox News and nontraditional forms of media, including a range of podcasters. Welker last sat down with Trump for her debut 'Meet the Press' interview in September 2023, where he spoke about immigration, abortion and his then-Republican primary opponent Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Welker was criticized at the time for not fact-checking Trump during the interview.

Jeffries stays out of the way as Dems mutiny against senior panel leaders	House Democrats are poised to unseat several senior committee leaders, and Hakeem Jeffries is letting it happen. Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, 76, announced this week that he would step down from the top Democratic spot on the Natural Resources Committee. Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, 77, dropped his bid to continue leading Democrats on Judiciary in the face of a tough challenge from 61-year-old Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland. And Rep. David Scott of Georgia, 79, is facing multiple challenges for the top Democratic spot on the Agriculture Committee. It's akin to a mutiny, especially given Democrats’ typical deference to seniority in who leads panels. But party lawmakers are increasingly anxious about the incoming Trump administration and full GOP control of Congress.

Nadler drops out of running for top Democratic Judiciary panel spot	Rep. Jerry Nadler has dropped out of the race for ranking member on the powerful House Judiciary Committee, according to his spokesperson. The decision comes after Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) launched his bid to unseat Nadler as the panel's top Democrat. Nadler, a veteran New York Democrat and the dean of the state’s House delegation, has been the top Judiciary Committee Democrat since 2017.

'The RNC’s priorities will remain the same: get out the vote, protect the ballot, and raise the money we need to elect Republicans up and down the ticket,' Whatley said in the post.

Hegseth’s future as Defense secretary hangs by a thread	How much trouble is Pete Hegseth facing in his bid to lead the Department of Defense? 'A lot,' as one GOP senator put it. Despite Hegseth, a veteran and Fox News personality, zigzagging across the Capitol to meet with Republican lawmakers over his imperiled nomination, there are still significant doubts he’ll have the necessary support to be confirmed. Backup nominees are already being floated, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, raising speculation that President-elect Donald Trump is ready to move on. 'That's definitely how my colleagues are taking it,' said the GOP senator, granted anonymity to speak candidly. 'That’s sending the signal to everybody here that Hegseth’s not likely to survive.'

Detroit mayor launches independent 2026 run for Michigan governor	Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan announced Wednesday that he will run for Michigan governor as an independent, breaking from the Democratic Party. 'I’m not running to be the Democrats’ governor or the Republicans’ governor — I’m running to be your governor,' Duggan, a lifelong Democrat, said in a video announcement. The three-term mayor is the first to officially enter what is expected to be a crowded 2026 field vying to replace Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is term-limited from running again.

GOP lawmakers already divided over sweeping Trump policy bill	Congressional Republicans are clashing over sweeping legislation on taxes, energy and immigration that will be the heart of President-elect Donald Trump’s legislative agenda — underscoring the hurdles ahead as the party tries to unify amid thin margins. Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune sparked heartburn across the Capitol this week when he told GOP senators that the package, which under budget reconciliation rules would allow the GOP to bypass a Democratic filibuster, would be split into two parts. The first would focus on border and energy, with a goal to pass it in the first 30 days of the new Trump administration, and the second on tax.

Former SEC commissioner Atkins picked to lead Wall Street regulator	President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday he will nominate former Wall Street regulator Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, turning to one of Washington’s most influential voices on financial policy to lead the U.S. markets watchdog. Atkins, if confirmed, would be tasked with steering the SEC as it embarks on what is expected to be a new deregulatory age for Wall Street after nearly four years of aggressive rulemaking by the current chair, Gary Gensler. He would also be thrust into a series of policy fights over the $3 trillion cryptocurrency market, artificial intelligence and the cost of raising capital in the U.S. Atkins previously served as an SEC commissioner in the early-to-mid 2000s before launching his consultancy firm, Patomak Global Partners.

If confirmed by the Senate, Slater will replace Jonathan Kanter and grapple with the various antitrust lawsuits and investigations against the tech industry and other sectors already underway.

If confirmed, he would be the No. 2 to hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, who has been tapped for the top job at Treasury.

Johnson: No Ukraine aid on year-end spending stopgap	Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday shot down the Biden administration’s request to include $24 billion in Ukraine-related aid as part of an expected short-term spending bill Congress needs to pass by Dec. 20. The Office of Management and Budget included the funding request in a list sent to Congress late last month. The new tranche of emergency Pentagon funding would go toward furnishing weapons and equipment for Ukraine and refilling U.S. inventories. But Johnson, asked if he would attach the Ukraine-related money to what is expected to be a spending stopgap into early next year, told reporters: 'I’m not planning to do that.'

FEMA officials worry Trump will divert disaster aid to the border	In 2019, then-President Donald Trump took $155 million from the federal government’s main disaster fund and used it to build immigration facilities near the U.S.-Mexico border. Now senior officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency are expressing concern that Trump could again redirect disaster resources after he takes office, but on a much larger scale. That could limit FEMA’s ability to help people and communities after major disasters, they say. 'But I am concerned that could happen, or that FEMA is given tasks to do things that are in support of immigration programs, whether it’s deportation or other aspects of immigration,' the agency's chief of staff, Michael Coen, said in a rare interview.

Trump's transition was supposed to be a show of force. What happened?	Over the last 24 hours, Donald Trump lost his pick to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration. His choice for Defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, is struggling to gain support from Senate Republicans. The president-elect is now even considering his onetime rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis, to lead the Pentagon. And these shake-ups to his not-yet-formed administration come after former Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew from consideration as Trump’s choice for attorney general. All told, the setbacks are raising new questions about Trump’s power over his party, whether Republicans would submit to any and all of his demands — and the expectation that his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, would bring order to Trump’s transition and White House.

He is the chief executive of private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, which has investments in military aircraft training and maintenance, and holds a majority stake in Navistar Defense, a manufacturer of military vehicles. Feinberg has yet to accept the offer, though one of the people familiar said he is expected to accept....	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/03/congress/trump-picks-billionaire-investor-pentagon-deputy-00192390	2024-12-03T11:38:36-08:00	
Grijalva ally weighs bid for top Natural Resources Democratic position	Rep. Melanie Stansbury is touting support from top Natural Resources panel Democrat Raúl Grijalva as she tests the waters on a long-shot bid to succeed him, according to three people familiar with the matter. Stansbury’s office told POLITICO on Monday that she is 'taking a serious look' at entering the race against Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), the presumptive favorite who appears to be in a strong position to win. The New Mexico Democrat, who joined the House in 2021, has quietly sounded out her congressional colleagues as she weighs a bid, the three people said. In messages to colleagues, she has stated that Grijalva asked her if she’d consider running with his support after he dropped out. She’s also highlighted a lack of female leadership at the top of the panel in conversations with ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/03/congress/stansbury-weighs-natural-resources-bid-democrats-grijalva-huffman-00192377	2024-12-03T11:04:35-08:00	
Thune tells Senate GOP he wants sweeping bill within first 30 days of Trump admin	Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune is pushing for two major partisan bills next term, including one within the first 30 days of the Trump administration, he told Republican senators at a private GOP conference meeting on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his remarks. Thune was broadly outlining priorities for the next Congress during the closed-door meeting. He said the first of the two pieces of legislation, which would pass under a process known as budget reconciliation that can bypass the Senate filibuster, would focus on the border, defense and energy. A subsequent package would focus on taxes and other priorities for the Trump administration. It’d be a significant first swing at legislation for Thune — 30 days is an ambitious timeline, even for a targeted package.

Trump EPA pick Lee Zeldin begins meeting with senators	Lee Zeldin has begun meeting with senators to smooth his path for confirmation as President-elect Donald Trump's EPA administrator. On Monday, the former New York Republican representative met with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who will soon chair the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Securing Capito's support will be key for Zeldin. Capito said on social media she had 'an excellent meeting' with Zeldin to talk about his vision for the agency. 'Congressman Zeldin understands the need to roll back regulatory overreach, unleash American energy, and allow Americans to build again — all while protecting public health and the environment,' Capito wrote.

Jill Biden, Donald Trump will both attend Notre Dame reopening in Paris	First lady Jill Biden will cross paths with President-elect Donald Trump in Paris on Saturday when both attend the reopening ceremony of the Notre Dame Cathedral. The White House has not yet shared President Joe Biden’s schedule past Thursday, when he returns from a diplomatic trip to Angola. But about 50 heads of state will attend the reopening for the landmark church, according to the Associated Press.

Hegseth starts to branch out to shore up Pentagon bid	Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to be defense secretary, is back on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to continue meeting with Republican senators. This time, the embattled nominee is branching out beyond the Trump-allied GOP senators to some who aren’t yet committed. Hegseth is set to meet with at least three Republicans this afternoon: Sens.

How a potential panel shakeup will test Ocasio-Cortez's influence	Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could face the biggest test of her influence yet if a coveted spot as the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee opens up. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who currently holds the job, is running against Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) for the top Democratic spot on the Judiciary Committee. If Raskin successfully ousts Nadler, that will kick off a scramble to replace him. Although Democrats are reluctant to publicly discuss an Oversight bid before the Judiciary challenges are settled, lawmakers are privately making calls to test the waters, quietly jockeying behind the scenes. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), possible contenders for the top spot include Reps. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.).

Schumer reelected as Senate Democratic leader	Democrats nationally are wrestling over who will lead their party post-election. But in the Senate, they’re largely staying the course. In a closed-door party meeting on Tuesday, Senate Democrats elected leadership for their return to the minority, including tapping Sen. Chuck Schumer for another term as caucus leader, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) was also elected to another term as whip, the No. 2 spot. Two other Democrats rose in the ranks: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) was elected to the No. 3 spot as chair of the Steering and Policy Committee. It’s a step up for Klobuchar, who is currently No. 4 in the Democratic leadership rankings and serves as chair of the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee. And Sen.

Senate confirms stalled promotion for general involved in Afghanistan withdrawal	The promotion of President Joe Biden’s pick to lead U.S. Army forces in Europe and Africa has cleared the Senate after an unexplained delay. The promotion of Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue — who led the 82nd Airborne Division during the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan — to the rank of four-star general was approved quietly before the Senate adjourned. Donahue's promotion was conspicuously left out of a tranche of hundred of routine military nominees confirmed before the Senate's Thanksgiving recess, indicating a senator was holding up his nomination.

A top GOP senator predicts Trump’s picks will get FBI background checks	An impasse over FBI background checks for Trump's Cabinet nominees will likely be resolved 'in the next few days,' a top Republican told reporters Monday. 'I do think there will be FBI background checks,' said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the ranking GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The comments came amid fears the incoming Trump administration plans to bypass the customary step for top appointees, raising concerns about its vetting of candidates.

GOP senators signal they’re open to Patel leading FBI	Few GOP senators are raising early opposition to President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the FBI, Kash Patel. Even Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) — who was outspoken against Rep.

'I had heard his name, but I don't know his background, and I'm going to have to do a lot of work before reaching a decision on him.

Trump to nominate Republican donor to serve as UK ambassador	President-elect Donald Trump has nominated investment banker Warren Stephens to be his ambassador to the United Kingdom. Stephens, a financial backer of Trump’s campaign, would be among at least five other billionaires selected for major roles by the president-elect. 'Warren has always dreamed of serving the United States full time,' Trump said Monday in a Truth Social post. 'I am thrilled that he will now have that opportunity as the top Diplomat, representing the U.S.A. to one of America’s most cherished and beloved Allies.'

Congress readies another funding punt ahead of pre-Christmas shutdown deadline	Staring down a government shutdown deadline in less than three weeks, congressional leaders have begun serious negotiations toward a funding patch that punts the deadline into President-elect Donald Trump’s second term. A grand deal on final funding bills is highly unlikely before the Dec. 20 deadline, considering Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have yet to strike a 'toplines' agreement on overall spending totals for the military and non-defense programs. So lawmakers must now ready yet another stopgap that keeps federal agencies running on static funding — after they already punted on spending back in September.

Senate Dems set to bump up Klobuchar and Booker in leadership ranks	Sen. Amy Klobuchar is expected to be tapped for Senate Democrats’ No. 3 spot in caucus leadership elections this week, according to two people familiar with the shuffling. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is expected to fill the no. 4 role, which Klobuchar (D-Minn.) currently holds as chair of the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee. The No. 3 spot is currently held by retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who is head of Senate Democrats’ Policy and Communications Committee. Both Booker and Klobuchar — who both ran for president in 2020 and have wide name recognition in the party — had been eyeing the gig, but Booker's apparent acquiescence to instead take the spot one rung lower means the caucus will avoid that intra-party clash.

The most immediate issue: Congress faces a Dec. 20 government funding deadline. While a shutdown isn't atop anyone's holiday wish list, there’s significant disagreement about how long a short-term government funding patch should last into President-elect Donald Trump's new term — and what other priorities, like tens of billions in sought-after disaster aid, might hitch a ride to that bill.

And some of his former campaign staffers question whether he’s up for the challenge. Kennedy, who comes from one of the most high-profile families in Democratic politics, has held leadership roles as a lawyer and at nonprofit organizations but has more often been the public face of these operations than an executive manager.

‘Delete CFPB’: Musk calls for elimination of consumer bureau	Elon Musk said Wednesday that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau should be abolished, calling for the elimination of an agency that would potentially regulate the future payments business of the Musk-owned X platform. 'Delete CFPB,' Musk, who is leading an effort on behalf of President-elect Donald Trump to shrink the size of the federal government, wrote in a post on X. 'There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.' Trump on the campaign trail called for easing regulation of the financial industry generally but didn’t explicitly call for the elimination of the CFPB, which Republicans have railed against for years.

Former SEC commissioner Atkins emerges as a top contender for chair	Paul Atkins, a veteran regulator and influential voice on financial policy, is emerging as a leading candidate to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission under President-elect Donald Trump, according to four people familiar with the transition. No final decision has been made, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss the private conversations. But Atkins was recently invited to interview with Trump, one of the people said. Trump is expected to announce his pick for Wall Street's top regulator soon. Others whose names have been floated for SEC chair include Brian Brooks, the one-time acting comptroller of the currency, and former SEC General Counsel Robert Stebbins. Atkins, if picked and confirmed, would rejoin the SEC after a 16-year hiatus from the agency.

Democrat Derek Tran ousts Michelle Steel in CA House battle	Derek Tran, a first-time Democratic candidate, has flipped a toss-up California House seat, narrowly defeating GOP Rep. Michelle Steel, who conceded on Wednesday after a protracted vote count. Tran had declared victory early this week, and currently leads by roughly 600 votes. Steel, a two-term congressmember, had been an elusive target for Democrats, occupying an Orange County district that had backed President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. The race ended up being the most expensive House battle in the country, with at least $46 million spent by the campaigns and an array of outside groups. Democrats hoped Tran was the right candidate to dislodge Steel, given his background as the son of Vietn...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/27/derek-tran-wins-california-45-election-00187118	2024-11-27T12:09:14-08:00	https://static.politico.com/23/c1/26c6f0bd49dfbd3199cc769f97b9/elections-2024-california-house-70698.jpg
Johnson's next margin headache: Manchin-style Republicans	Speaker Mike Johnson is staring down what could be a one-vote majority to enact the House GOP agenda in the first months of the second Trump era. The practical effect will be that every member of his conference has the potential to be the next Sen. Joe Manchin or Kyrsten Sinema, who had outsized power to snarl Democrats’ priorities under President Joe Biden. Who will have the biggest sway in the tiny House GOP majority?

Trump appoints Keith Kellogg as Ukraine peace envoy	President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday named former national security aide and retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg as a special envoy to Russia and Ukraine, commissioning him to lead negotiations to end the war. In a statement, Trump said that Kellogg, who served as national security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence, 'was with me right from the beginning' and 'will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!' The move is not likely to allay anxieties among European allies that Trump will attempt to pursue peace between Russia and Ukraine.

Inside the campaign: Olszewski, the sitting Baltimore County executive, effectively cleared the Democratic primary field once he jumped into the contest following Ruppersberger’s decision to stand aside. He lined up endorsements from statewide Democratic luminaries like Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Sen.-elect Angela Alsobrooks, former Sen. Barbara Mikulski, Rep. Steny Hoyer and Ruppersberger.

Moulton could draw challengers	BOSTON — Rep. Seth Moulton drew swift condemnation from local Democratic leaders and LGBTQ+ advocates for comments he made about transgender youth in sports in the wake of Democrats’ defeats earlier this month. But will the discontent translate to real competition next cycle? It’s early, but some potential challengers are already beginning to stir. Dan Koh, a former Andover selectman who narrowly lost the race for the open seat in the neighboring 3rd District in 2018, has been making — and fielding — calls about a possible campaign against Moulton, according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the conversations.

Musk wants to stop enforcing regulations. Why that’s ‘almost meaningless.’	Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy outlined a plan to help companies avoid environmental regulations: The government could just refuse to enforce its own rules. But some lawyers who specialize in federal regulation expressed doubt that companies would benefit from such a plan — or even want it. 'I don't think it would really reduce the burden on industry for the most part, because companies have a legal obligation to comply with regulatory requirements,' said Jeff Holmstead, a former EPA air chief under President George W. Bush who represents industry clients at Bracewell LLP.

President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that Hassett will be director of the National Economic Council, a role that puts him in charge of executing the higher tariffs and tax cuts promised during the campaign. Hassett, whose appointment was expected, served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers for two years during Trump’s first term.

Now, he would take on an expanded role as the president’s top adviser on economic matters and play a key part in coordinating policies and strategy across the government. One of the main orders of business for the new NEC director will be serving as an emissary in negotiating an extension to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, legislation that Hassett has spent years touting.

Kash Patel and Cliff Sims are jostling for the deputy director gig at the CIA	Two Trump transition insiders, Cliff Sims and Kash Patel, are angling to be deputy director of the CIA — and angering others who feel they're using their roles on the transition to undermine any would-be contenders, according to three people familiar with the matter. The No. 2 position at the powerful spy agency is one of the most sought-after national security posts that remains unfilled. It does not require Senate confirmation — a concern for other roles, like FBI director, Patel is said to be interested in — but wields enormous influence inside the U.S. intelligence community. The frustration toward Sims, the former White House and ODNI communications strategist, and Patel, the firebrand former House Intelligence Committee staffer and Pentagon official, stems from the fact that both are...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/26/congress/kash-patel-cliff-sims-deputy-director-cia-00191715	2024-11-26T11:12:39-08:00

Inside the campaign: McGuire, a state senator, got a big boost in his primary challenge against the sitting Freedom Caucus chair: the endorsement of President-elect Donald Trump, a huge boost in this red-leaning district.

Trump is loading his administration up with Floridians. Is Washington ready?	Donald Trump adopted Florida as his home state. Now his second administration will look to transform the country in its image. His new administration is loaded with politicians and operatives who cut their teeth in the Sunshine State — from incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles; to Marco Rubio, the likely next secretary of State; and Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general Trump tapped to lead the Justice Department after the first Floridian he picked, Matt Gaetz, withdrew.

This is the new progressive strategy for warring with Trump	Progressive Democrats wrestling with how to navigate a second Donald Trump presidency are settling on a new approach: Take his populist, working-class proposals at his word — or at least pretend to. If he succeeds, they can take some credit for bringing him to the table. If he doesn’t, they can bash him for it. It’s a change in strategy, emerging in private conversations among some liberal elected officials and operatives, that comes after years of resisting Trump ended with him returning to the White House. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in an interview that she would likely work with Trump if he pursues antitrust promises he made on the campaign trail...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/25/progressives-against-trump-00191392	2024-11-25T09:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/76/2f/290104fc430387d52df8a7244dd7/u-s-congress-59649.jpg

Fears are growing that Trump could push out dozens of government watchdogs	Two in-house investigators at U.S. intelligence agencies recently quit their jobs. There’s growing fear in Washington that they could be the start of an exodus — or a purge — of government watchdogs. A wave of departures by inspectors general would give President-elect Donald Trump the opportunity to nominate or appoint people of his choice to the watchdog posts — leaving dozens of federal departments, agencies and offices subject to oversight by people who would owe their positions to Trump. In the wake of Trump’s election, CIA Inspector General Robin Ashton and Intelligence Community Inspector General Thomas Monheim revealed they plan to leave government in the coming weeks. Neither cited Trump’s victory as a basis for the decision, but the timing of the announcements troubled some longt...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/25/trump-inspectors-general-watchdogs-00191381	2024-11-25T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/df/7f/10b16fa24963b62d3e61d327acf6/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1345757892

Harris is telling her advisers and allies to keep her political options open	Kamala Harris has been lying low since her defeat in the presidential race, unwinding with family and senior aides in Hawaii before heading back to the nation’s capital. But privately, the vice president has been instructing advisers and allies to keep her options open — whether for a possible 2028 presidential run, or even to run for governor in her home state of California in two years. As Harris has repeated in phone calls, 'I am staying in the fight.' She is expected to explore those and other possible paths forward with family members over the winter holiday season, according to five people in the Harris inner circle, who were granted anonymity to discuss internal dynamics. Her deliberations follow an extraordinary four months in which Harris went from President Joe Biden’s running ma...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/25/kamala-harris-advisers-options-open-00191393	2024-11-25T02:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/50/b0/6cc206d045e8890603b7bd0c1d16/election-2024-harris-68312.jpg

After a Friday night flurry, Trump’s Cabinet is complete	At 6:52 p.m. on Friday, President-elect Donald Trump announced his choice for Treasury secretary. Minutes later, he tapped a director for the Office of Management and Budget. Then came his picks for Labor secretary, deputy national security adviser and surgeon general.

What the Gaetz episode says about Trump’s attempts to control Congress	Donald Trump is making it clear he wants to bend the Republican-led Congress to his will, pushing the limits of what lawmakers will accept on staffing his Cabinet and also on looming questions of federal spending authority. Round one in that fight — the Matt Gaetz saga — went to Senate Republicans. And it gives early hints of how GOP lawmakers may respond on spending and other controversial nominees. 'The Senate also has a responsibility for advice and consent — and in this particular case, I think there was advice offered, rather than consent,' Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said shortly after Gaetz announced he was withdrawing his name from consideration for attorney general.

Blue states race to stymie Trump's mass deportation plans	Democratic attorneys general are preparing a raft of legal actions to prevent Donald Trump from carrying out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, setting the stage for a series of showdowns over one of his central campaign pledges. In interviews with POLITICO, six leading blue-state prosecutors said they are girding to take Trump to court over misusing military troops on domestic soil, attempting to commandeer local or state law enforcement to do the job of the federal government and denying people’s constitutional right to due process. The attorneys general also said they would move to challenge Trump if he tries to federalize the National Guard — or attempts to direct active-duty military units or National Guard troops from red states into blue states.
