Dems believe Raskin has the votes to nab top Judiciary spot	Rep. Jamie Raskin is quickly locking down support to take the top Democratic spot on Judiciary and could beat current ranking member Rep. Jerry Nadler. 'I just don't see how Jerry pulls it out,' said one lawmaker on the House Judiciary Committee, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. Three additional people familiar with Raskin’s (D-Md.) support believe he will beat Nadler (D-N.Y.), though the senior Democrat is staying in the race. 'We’ll see what happens,' Nadler said Wednesday morning. Raskin officially entered the race Monday, and said Tuesday evening that he was 'working to get the votes.'	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/04/congress/dems-raskin-could-nab-judiciary-spot-00192552	2024-12-04T07:04:20-08:00	
Pete Hegseth’s mother defends him, pleas with senators to ‘listen to Pete’	The mother of Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump’s embattled pick for Defense secretary, took to Fox News Wednesday morning to defend her son in her first public comments since it was reported that she once harshly confronted him in an email about his treatment of women. 'We really believe that he is not that man he was seven years ago. I'm not that mother and I hope people will hear that story today and the truth of that story,' Penelope Hegseth told 'Fox &amp; Friends' host Steve Doocy. 'I am here to tell the truth. To tell the truth to the American people and tell the truth to senators on the hill, especially female senators. I really hope that you will not listen to the media and you will listen to Pete.'

Tammy Duckworth urges Trump to endorse expansion of IVF coverage for military	Sen. Tammy Duckworth is taking the unorthodox step of asking Donald Trump to wade into a legislative debate before he becomes president, urging him to support her proposal to expand coverage for in vitro fertilization for military personnel. Duckworth, who serves on the Armed Services Committee, penned a letter to the president-elect, obtained by POLITICO, encouraging him to endorse provisions in the annual defense policy bill that would expand TRICARE coverage for IVF and other fertility services for military families. Access to IVF became a hot-button issue during the 2024 campaign, following a ruling by Alabama's Supreme Court this year that frozen embryos should be considered people.

Top House GOP super PAC taps new president	Chris Winkelman, the top staffer at the House Republican campaign arm, will be the new president of the Congressional Leadership Fund. Winkelman will replace Dan Conston, who has led the super PAC for six years and announced Monday he will be stepping down. CLF, the largest House GOP super PAC, is endorsed by Speaker Mike Johnson. As its leader, Winkelman will court major party donors and direct hundreds of millions of dollars in ad spending to help Republicans grow their narrow majority.

John Duarte from office in the last House race in the country to be called. Gray, a former state legislator, previously lost to Duarte in 2022 by a margin of 564 votes.

Trump's DEA nominee withdraws	President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration abruptly withdrew his name from consideration on Tuesday just days after being chosen. Chad Chronister said in a post on X that he made the decision 'as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in,' but didn’t cite a reason for his withdrawal other than concluding he wanted to continue in his current role as a sheriff in Florida.

Jeffries calls on Biden to pardon more Americans	House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called on President Joe Biden to pardon more people convicted of nonviolent offenses amid controversy over the president’s pardon of his son, Hunter Biden. 'During his final weeks in office, President Biden should exercise the high level of compassion he has consistently demonstrated throughout his life, including toward his son, and pardon on a case-by-case basis the working-class Americans in the federal prison system whose lives have been ruined by unjustly aggressive prosecutions for nonviolent offenses,' Jeffries said in a statement.

Trump picks billionaire investor as Pentagon deputy	President-elect Donald Trump has selected Stephen Feinberg to be his deputy Defense secretary, two people familiar with the decision told POLITICO, potentially putting a secretive billionaire financier with no experience in the agency into the Pentagon’s No. 2 job. Feinberg, who had a role on Trump’s intelligence advisory board during his first term, is a major donor to the president-elect, but his selection could present some significant conflicts of interest. He is the chief executive of private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, which has investments in military aircraft training and maintenance, and holds a majority stake in Navistar Defense, a manufacturer of military vehicles.

Thune tells Senate GOP he wants sweeping bill within first 30 days of Trump admin	Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune is pushing for two major partisan bills next term, including one within the first 30 days of the Trump administration, he told Republican senators at a private GOP conference meeting on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his remarks. Thune was broadly outlining priorities for the next Congress during the closed-door meeting. He said the first of the two pieces of legislation, which would pass under a process known as budget reconciliation that can bypass the Senate filibuster, would focus on the border, defense and energy. A subsequent package would focus on taxes and other priorities for the Trump administration. It’d be a significant first swing at legislation for Thune — 30 days is an ambitious timeline, even for a targeted package.

If Raskin successfully ousts Nadler, that will kick off a scramble to replace him. Although Democrats are reluctant to publicly discuss an Oversight bid before the Judiciary challenges are settled, lawmakers are privately making calls to test the waters, quietly jockeying behind the scenes.

Congress readies another funding punt ahead of pre-Christmas shutdown deadline	Staring down a government shutdown deadline in less than three weeks, congressional leaders have begun serious negotiations toward a funding patch that punts the deadline into President-elect Donald Trump’s second term. A grand deal on final funding bills is highly unlikely before the Dec. 20 deadline, considering Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have yet to strike a 'toplines' agreement on overall spending totals for the military and non-defense programs. So lawmakers must now ready yet another stopgap that keeps federal agencies running on static funding — after they already punted on spending back in September.

Senate Dems set to bump up Klobuchar and Booker in leadership ranks	Sen. Amy Klobuchar is expected to be tapped for Senate Democrats’ No. 3 spot in caucus leadership elections this week, according to two people familiar with the shuffling. Sen.

The No. 3 spot is currently held by retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who is head of Senate Democrats’ Policy and Communications Committee. Both Booker and Klobuchar — who both ran for president in 2020 and have wide name recognition in the party — had been eyeing the gig, but Booker's apparent acquiescence to instead take the spot one rung lower means the caucus will avoid that intra-party clash.

Swalwell tells Trump supporters to ‘sit out’ criticizing Biden pardon	At least one Democrat is responding to President Joe Biden’s Sunday pardon of his son Hunter with a reminder about President-elect Donald Trump: He’s a convicted criminal, too. 'If you defended the 34x felon, who committed sexual assault, stole national security documents, and tried running a coup on his country…you can sit out the Hunter Biden pardon discussion,' Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) posted on X overnight. Other Democrats have stayed mum or defended the president’s decision to give his son a 'full and unconditional' pardon, though Rep. Greg Landsman toed a finer line. The Ohio Democrat wrote on X Monday that whil...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/02/congress/dem-to-trump-backers-sit-out-hunter-talk-00192123	2024-12-02T06:25:20-08:00	
Congress preps for spending sprint amid Biden pardon fallout	Lawmakers are back for the annual legislative end-of-year sprint, in what should be a busy three weeks in the waning days of Joe Biden’s presidency. The most immediate issue: Congress faces a Dec. 20 government funding deadline. While a shutdown isn't atop anyone's holiday wish list, there’s significant disagreement about how long a short-term government funding patch should last into President-elect Donald Trump's new term — and what other priorities, like tens of billions in sought-after disaster aid, might hitch a ride to that bill. With lawmakers now back in Washington post-Thanksgiving, look for some decisions to start being made on the way forward. Some other pressing questions: The Senate returns Monday while the House comes back Tuesday.

Schumer to Thune: Fully vet all Trump nominees	Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has a message for his forthcoming successor, Sen.

'President Biden insisted many times he would never pardon his own son for his serious crimes,' Johnson said on X.

How a Trump sign could pave the way to Congress	ALBANY, New York — A 42-year-old boxer in upstate New York is leveraging the 100-foot sign he built to support Donald Trump — and allies like Roger Stone and the president-elect’s son — into a bid to succeed Rep. Elise Stefanik. The man behind the sign, Anthony Constantino, wants Stefanik’s House seat and has been meeting GOP leaders with the power to select a nominee to replace her. Constantino, who founded the printing company Sticker Mule, has ties to the Trump family. He told POLITICO he ate dinner with Donald Trump Jr. earlier this year and visited Mar-a-Lago in November. He’s also received support and unpaid advice from Stone, a longtime Trump ally.

The brief but busy reign of Sen. George Helmy is coming to an end	Sen. George Helmy, a New Jersey Democrat, is making his brief tenure at the Capitol a busy one. Last Monday, Helmy was on the Senate floor to give a complex speech about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The remarks were based on a trip to the Middle East he took during the roughly 12 weeks he’ll be in office after Gov. Phil Murphy picked him to fill disgraced Sen. Bob Menendez’s vacant seat.

‘He's not a manager’: Former RFK Jr. staffers on how he'd run HHS	If Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gets confirmed as secretary for President-elect Donald Trump's Department of Health and Human Services, it will be the biggest job he's ever had. And some of his former campaign staffers question whether he’s up for the challenge. Kennedy, who comes from one of the most high-profile families in Democratic politics, has held leadership roles as a lawyer and at nonprofit organizations but has more often been the public face of these operations than an executive manager. His presidential campaign was similarly run with Kennedy not closely involved in its daily management, according to interviews with a half dozen former campaign staffers.

Mexico's president and Trump had an upbeat call despite dust-up over tariffs	President-elect Donald Trump said his conversation Wednesday with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was 'wonderful' and 'very productive.' She, in turn, described their phone call as 'excellent.' Their upbeat readouts on the call marked a contrast from earlier in the week, when Trump warned he would impose a 25 percent tariff on all goods from Mexico if it doesn’t stop the flow of migrants and drugs across their shared border – and Sheinbaum fired back by warning that her country could retaliate with tariffs of its own. 'Just had a wonderful conversation with the new President of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo,' Trump said in a Truth Social post.

On Fox News, Trump deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller confirmed POLITICO’s reporting that Zuckerberg was there, saying he 'has made it very clear about his desire to be a supporter of and a participant in this change that we’re seeing all around America, all around the world, this reform movement that Donald Trump is leading.'

'Delete CFPB,' Musk, who is leading an effort on behalf of President-elect Donald Trump to shrink the size of the federal government, wrote in a post on X. 'There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.'

Trump is expected to announce his pick for Wall Street's top regulator soon.

Democrat Derek Tran ousts Michelle Steel in CA House battle	Derek Tran, a first-time Democratic candidate, has flipped a toss-up California House seat, narrowly defeating GOP Rep. Michelle Steel, who conceded on Wednesday after a protracted vote count. Tran had declared victory early this week, and currently leads by roughly 600 votes. Steel, a two-term congressmember, had been an elusive target for Democrats, occupying an Orange County district that had backed President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. The race ended up being the most expensive House battle in the country, with at least $46 million spent by the campaigns and an array of outside groups. Democrats hoped Tran was the right candidate to dislodge Steel, given his background as the son of Vietn...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/27/derek-tran-wins-california-45-election-00187118	2024-11-27T12:09:14-08:00	https://static.politico.com/23/c1/26c6f0bd49dfbd3199cc769f97b9/elections-2024-california-house-70698.jpg

Trump appoints Keith Kellogg as Ukraine peace envoy	President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday named former national security aide and retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg as a special envoy to Russia and Ukraine, commissioning him to lead negotiations to end the war. In a statement, Trump said that Kellogg, who served as national security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence, 'was with me right from the beginning' and 'will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!' The move is not likely to allay anxieties among European allies that Trump will attempt to pursue peace between Russia and Ukraine.

Musk wants to stop enforcing regulations. Why that’s ‘almost meaningless.’	Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy outlined a plan to help companies avoid environmental regulations: The government could just refuse to enforce its own rules. But some lawyers who specialize in federal regulation expressed doubt that companies would benefit from such a plan — or even want it.

The No. 2 position at the powerful spy agency is one of the most sought-after national security posts that remains unfilled. It does not require Senate confirmation — a concern for other roles, like FBI director, Patel is said to be interested in — but wields enormous influence inside the U.S. intelligence community.

'This is highly inappropriate: they’re accelerating spending ahead of the transition of power,' Ramaswamy said, linking to a POLITICO interview with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo where she discussed her remaining work to implement the CHIPS and Science Act. 'I’d like to have really almost all of the money obligated by the time we leave,' Raimondo told POLITICO last week.

Grassley: Trump’s new tariff threats are just ‘negotiating tool’ — for now	Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Tuesday downplayed President-elect Donald Trump’s threats of broad tariffs against major U.S. trading partners as a 'negotiating tool' — though he acknowledged he was concerned about the 'potential' for another trade war. Trump threatened a wave of blanket tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China Monday evening via a social media post, unless the countries stop the flow of drugs and immigrants into the U.S. 'I think you got to see it as a negotiating tool,' Grassley told reporters Tuesday morning.

Trudeau says he spoke to Trump in wake of tariff threat	OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he spoke to Donald Trump Monday night after the president-elect shared plans to use his first day in office to slap 25 percent tariffs on Canada. 'It was a good call,' Trudeau said this morning on Parliament Hill. 'We obviously talked about laying out the facts, talking about how the intense and effective connections between our two countries flow back and forth.' Last night on Truth Social, Trump shared his first-day priorities. 'As everyone is aware, thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before,' Trump wrote.

Trump is loading his administration up with Floridians. Is Washington ready?	Donald Trump adopted Florida as his home state. Now his second administration will look to transform the country in its image. His new administration is loaded with politicians and operatives who cut their teeth in the Sunshine State — from incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles; to Marco Rubio, the likely next secretary of State; and Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general Trump tapped to lead the Justice Department after the first Floridian he picked, Matt Gaetz, withdrew. Trump filling his team with Floridians — with Mar-a-Lago serving as his home base — shows how his second term will be different than the first: one that values loyalty above all else, casting aside the need to win over...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/22/trump-florida-administration-00191285	2024-11-26T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/fb/3c/3ef3c15a4b7f9d61cfa8ec711c97/election-2024-trump-37571.jpg
US membership in the World Health Organization is on the line with Trump’s return	The United States’ future in the World Health Organization is again in flux with President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House. If the U.S. withdraws from the global health body, as Trump attempted to do in his first term, the WHO could lose its top government donor and hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions. In exchange, America could lose access to the global network that sets the flu vaccine’s composition every year, and U.S. drugmakers could lose the WHO’s help in selling their products, current and former U.S. government officials say.

Musk targets Trump’s favorite fighter jet	Elon Musk is tearing into the F-35, the most expensive weapons program in history and a favorite of his new best friend, President-elect Donald Trump. In a series of posts on X, the world’s richest man and proponent of driverless cars targeted the tri-service fighter jet program while coming out in favor of uncrewed aircraft. 'Manned fighter jets are obsolete in the age of drones,' he wrote on Monday.

His appointment was announced alongside that of Matt Brasseaux to serve as director of the Office of Political Affairs and Alex Latcham as director of the Office of Public Liaison. Trump has filled nearly all of the members of his Cabinet in the three weeks since he won reelection.

Hill GOP leaders meet to talk reconciliation	Congressional Republican leaders met Monday afternoon in Washington to start hammering out plans for partisan spending legislation that would allow them to bypass Democrats while enacting President-elect Donald Trump’s economic agenda, including massive tax cuts, a House leadership aide said. House Speaker Mike Johnson huddled with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and McConnell’s successor, Sen. John Thune, according to the aide, who was granted anonymity to discuss a private conversation.

Trump backs Florida's chief financial officer as successor to Gaetz in Congress	TALLAHASSEE, Florida — President-elect Donald Trump is throwing his support behind Florida’s chief financial officer as his choice to succeed former Rep. Matt Gaetz in Congress, a move that could increase pressure on Gov. Ron DeSantis to pick allies to the president-elect for other posts. Trump on Monday said on social media that he would support Republican Jimmy Patronis for the now-vacant northwest Florida congressional seat that Gaetz gave up during his truncated bid for attorney general. Gaetz withdrew from consideration amid an outcry over investigations into his conduct even though he has denied any wrongdoing.

Joni Ernst is pitching President-elect Donald Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency on more than $2 trillion proposed cuts or savings— the latest example of GOP lawmakers embracing the commission. Ernst (R-Iowa) sent a letter on Monday to Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump tapped to lead the out-of-government panel tasked with coordinating with the White House and Office of Management and Budget. 'Thank you for stepping up to take on the challenge of saving taxpayers from Washington’s out- of-control spending that put our nation $36 trillion in debt.

This is the new progressive strategy for warring with Trump	Progressive Democrats wrestling with how to navigate a second Donald Trump presidency are settling on a new approach: Take his populist, working-class proposals at his word — or at least pretend to. If he succeeds, they can take some credit for bringing him to the table. If he doesn’t, they can bash him for it. It’s a change in strategy, emerging in private conversations among some liberal elected officials and operatives, that comes after years of resisting Trump ended with him returning to the White House.

Fears are growing that Trump could push out dozens of government watchdogs	Two in-house investigators at U.S. intelligence agencies recently quit their jobs. There’s growing fear in Washington that they could be the start of an exodus — or a purge — of government watchdogs. A wave of departures by inspectors general would give President-elect Donald Trump the opportunity to nominate or appoint people of his choice to the watchdog posts — leaving dozens of federal departments, agencies and offices subject to oversight by people who would owe their positions to Trump. In the wake of Trump’s election, CIA Inspector General Robin Ashton and Intelligence Community Inspector General Thomas Monheim revealed they plan to leave government in the coming weeks.

Mike Rogers is not under consideration to lead FBI, top Trump aide says	An incoming top White House aide to President-elect Donald Trump on Friday shut down speculation that former Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan would lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 'It’s not happening,' Dan Scavino Jr., Trump’s incoming deputy chief of staff, wrote on X.

Democrats find hope in state legislative races	As Democrats regroup after the 2024 election, some are finding cautious optimism in an unlikely place: state legislatures. While the party faced disappointing results such as losing the Michigan state House, it did not face the kind of devastating wreckage down-ballot that often accompanies other national elections. The state legislative results were far from a triumph for Democrats. But they stand apart from the presidential race, in which Vice President Kamala Harris lost every single swing state — including states where Democrats made gains in state government or preserved their majorities. Democrats held onto a one-seat majority in the Pennsylvania House, flipped 14 seats in Wisconsin under new electoral maps, and broke the GOP supermajority in North Carolina, giving weight to Democrat...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/22/democrat-state-legislature-races-00191073	2024-11-22T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/e6/d2/999468324bb98b1a765d2c89208e/election-2024-wisconsin-legislature-81226.jpg

5 things you need to know about Pam Bondi	One of Donald Trump’s most loyal supporters just got picked for one of the most important roles in his second administration. Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida, was chosen Thursday to be the nation’s top law enforcement official by Trump just hours after Matt Gaetz withdrew from consideration in the face of Senate opposition. Bondi is a partner at Ballard Partners, the lobbying firm that had been run by Trump's incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles and whose founder, Brian Ballard, is a top Trump fundraiser. She is co-chair of the law and justice division at the pro-Trump America First Policy Institute, which has been likened to a <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/29/trump-transition-plan-...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/21/5-things-pam-bondi-00191199	2024-11-21T18:17:32-08:00	https://static.politico.com/ee/a3/a3552165412ab39080acceac66c7/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2026271834
Matt Gaetz praises Trump's AG replacement pick Pam Bondi	Former Rep. Matt Gaetz is praising Donald Trump's choice of fellow Floridian Pam Bondi to replace him as the attorney general nominee. Gaetz said Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida, is a 'stellar choice' to serve as the nation's top law enforcement officer. The two worked together when Gaetz served in Florida's legislature. 'She’s a proven litigator, an inspiring leader and a champion for all Americans,' Gaetz said in a post on X. 'She will bring the needed reforms to DOJ.' His endorsement came hours after he withdrew his nomination for AG in the face of opposition in the Senate.	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/gaetz-on-his-replacement-00191139	2024-11-21T16:43:37-08:00	
Promotion delayed for general who oversaw Afghanistan pullout	A top general who oversaw the 82nd Airborne Division during the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was conspicuously left out of a large batch of military promotions approved Thursday by the Senate before it left town until December. The apparent delay for Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue — President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Army in Europe and Africa and set for promotion to four-star general — suggests a senator is holding the nomination. Donahue was one of nearly 1,000 promotions the Senate Armed Services Committee approved on Tuesday, and senators in the full chamber typically clear the decks of uniform nominees before an extended recess. It’s unclear which senator might be delaying Donahue’s promotion and why. Such holds can be done anonymously and can still be bypassed by the fu...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/politics-and-promotions-00191098	2024-11-21T16:07:25-08:00

But that job as Donald Trump’s congressional whisperer just became more complicated, as Matt Gaetz withdrew from attorney general consideration — and new details came out about Hegseth. California authoritieslate Wednesday night released a 2017 police report detailing a woman’s account of how Hegseth allegedly sexually assaulted her in a hotel room.

'I am grateful to the thousands of people who worked to make sure every eligible vote cast could be counted, including election officials in all 67 counties.'

Trump once shunned Project 2025 as ‘ridiculous.’ Now he's staffing up with them.	Donald Trump spent his presidential campaign running from Project 2025. Now, he’s using it to stock his White House and administration. In recent days, Trump has tapped nearly a half-dozen Project 2025 authors and contributors, including Brendan Carr, who Trump picked this week to lead the FCC; former Rep. Pete Hoekstra, who got the nod for ambassador to Canada; and John Ratcliffe, who was tapped for director of the CIA. One of Trump’s first selections — Tom Homan as 'border czar' — was also a Project 2025 contributor.

The Florida Republican resigned both from his current term and preemptively from his term in the next Congress, which he just won in the November election. 'I do not intend to take the oath of office for the same office in the 119th Congress,' he wrote in a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson that was also transmitted to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

With Gaetz gone, Trump’s troubled Pentagon nominee is in the hot seat	Former Rep. Matt Gaetz’s abrupt withdrawal of his bid to be attorney general on Thursday could be bad news for another of President-elect Donald Trump’s picks: Pete Hegseth. Hegseth’s nomination for Defense secretary is facing headwinds over seven-year-old allegations of sexual assault, although he was never charged. But Hegseth so far had been overshadowed by Gaetz, a flame-throwing congressional ally with numerous foes in both parties who faced his own misconduct allegations, including that he engaged in sex with a minor. With Gaetz stepping out of contention, scrutiny could quickly shift to Hegseth after revelations that the Army veteran and former Fox News personality ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/21/congress/hegseth-gaetz-pentagon-00191051	2024-11-21T13:31:10-08:00

Schumer explains reported GOP deal on judges	The office of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is defending a reported deal where Democrats ceded four appeals court nominations in favor of confirming more of President Joe Biden’s lower-level federal judicial appointees. 'The trade was four circuit nominees — all lacking the votes to get confirmed — for more than triple the number of additional judges moving forward,' a spokesperson for Schumer said Thursday. Democrats have confirmed 221 of Biden’s picks for the federal courts after the Senate overwhelmingly approved Sharad Desai for a federal judicial post in Arizona on Thursday.

Gaetz announced Thursday he was withdrawing, saying in a social media post his nomination had become a distraction. When the president-elect announced he tapped Gaetz to be his next attorney general last week, Fetterman called it 'god-tier-level trolling.'

House Democrats vowed to press forward with their plan to force the release of a long-awaited report into Matt Gaetz even after he withdrew from consideration as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Attorney General. But there are early signs that House Republicans, some of whom had indicated prior to Gaetz’s withdrawal that they supported the Democratic-led effort, are no longer on board. And Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.) the top Republican on the Ethics panel, told CBS Thursday that Gaetz's withdrawal 'should end the discussion of whether or not the Ethics Committee should continue to move forward in this matter.'

SEC Chair Gary Gensler to step down Jan. 20	Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who pursued a sweeping and controversial agenda as Wall Street’s chief overseer over the last three-plus years, plans to step down on Jan. 20, the agency said Thursday. His departure will clear the way for President-elect Donald Trump to install his yet-to-be-named pick to lead the top U.S. financial markets regulator. Gensler's exit will cap one of the most memorable periods in the SEC's history, as the 67-year-old veteran regulator sought to enact a slate of ambitious rules and pursue lawsuits that led to high-profile clashes with both the traditional financial world and the cryptocurrency industry.

Rather than showcasing Trump’s absolute power over his GOP allies, it revealed his limits.

In a bid to force the release of the Ethics report, which is expected to cover several allegations, including that Gaetz had sex with a minor, Democratic Reps. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) and Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) are offering motions that would open up the decision to the full House. Conservative allies of Trump and Gaetz are threatening retribution over such a move, but several Republi...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/20/house-ethics-punt-gaetz-report-chaos-00190801	2024-11-20T16:56:57-08:00	https://static.politico.com/f2/96/ea8707914578a2db033d33b53cdf/house-ethics-meeting-rep-michael-guest-67391.jpg
Mark Milley disagrees with Trump pick on women in combat	Retired Army Gen. Mark Milley, the former chair of the joint chiefs of staff, is defending the role of women in combat — clashing with the views of Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Pentagon. Milley, who served as the top U.S. military officer under Trump and President Joe Biden until his retirement in 2023, said at an event Wednesday that women have served in battle throughout history. And he pointedly recalled the service of an Army nurse who braved minefields to save fellow service members and was killed in action. 'Don’t lecture me about women in combat,' Milley said at a national security innovation event hosted by the Pallas Foundation. 'Women have been in combat, and it doesn't matter if that 7.62 [caliber round] hits you in the chest. No one gives a shit if it's a woman or a guy to...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/women-in-combat-00190790	2024-11-20T16:00:56-08:00	
Nikki Haley has thoughts on RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard	Nikki Haley has a blunt assessment of Donald Trump’s choices of Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for high-profile roles in his administration. Haley, who was Trump’s most significant Republican primary opponent, argued Wednesday on her radio show against confirming Gabbard as director of national intelligence and Kennedy to lead Health and Human Services. Haley first went after Gabbard, a former Democratic member of Congress and 2020 presidential candidate who endorsed Trump this year before announcing she was a Republican. The nomination has also raised concerns from some traditional GOP foreign policy thinkers. 'She opposed ending the Iran nuclear deal. She opposed sanctions on Iran. She opposed designating the Iran military as terrorists who say death to America every single day,...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/nikki-haleys-view-00190765	2024-11-20T14:52:04-08:00	
Musk, Ramaswamy publish plan to slash workforce	Civil service protections can’t stop large-scale firings of federal workers, the leaders of President-elect Donald Trump’s effort to downsize the government wrote Wednesday in an op-ed. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the co-leaders of Trump’s planned effort to cut federal rules and workers, authored a Wall Street Journal op-ed offering the most comprehensive plan sketched out so far for the new Trump endeavor. They plan to serve as 'outside volunteers' and will work with the Trump transition team to 'identify and hire a lean team of small-government crusaders,' t...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-trump-doge-00190739	2024-11-20T13:37:02-08:00

Employers' group tees off on Chavez-DeRemer amid Labor secretary chatter	An employer group is sounding the alarm about the possibility that President-elect Donald Trump will nominate Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer for Labor secretary, zeroing in on the Oregon Republican's support for legislation that has been a top priority for unions. 'The PRO Act would deprive employees of their right to a secret ballot and their privacy in union representation elections,' Kristen Swearingen, president of the Coalition for a Democratic Workplace, said in a statement. 'It would also impose overly broad liability for ‘joint employment,’ limiting opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs, and create rigid standards for independent contractors, undermining workers’ ability to work independently.' Chavez-DeRemer emerged as a possible pick to head the Labor Department after sh...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/employers-group-no-fan-of-chavez-deremer-for-labor-post-00190710	2024-11-20T12:50:47-08:00	
House Ethics panel did not agree to release the Gaetz report — yet	The House Ethics Committee on Wednesday did not agree to release the long-anticipated report into Matt Gaetz. 'There was not an agreement by the committee to release the report,' Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.) told reporters after the meeting ended. Other members declined to comment. The committee did not agree on releasing the report and a vote was held, according to ranking member Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.) — with agreement to meet again next month. 'We did agree that we would reconvene as a committee on Dec. 5 to further consider this matter,' Wild said. Guest 'betrayed the process by disclosing our deliberations within moments after walking out of the committee,' Wild, who lost her reelection bid earlier this month, told reporters. Gaetz abruptly resigned from Congress last week, hours aft...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/ethics-panel-does-not-agree-to-release-gaetz-report-00190655	2024-11-20T12:32:53-08:00	
House Democrat pledges to force a vote to release the Gaetz report	Illinois Democrat Sean Casten is trying to force a vote on the House floor about releasing the House Ethics Committee’s report on Matt Gaetz, who is President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Justice Department. If the House Ethics Committee does not vote to release the Gaetz report Wednesday, Casten plans to introduce a privileged resolution forcing a vote of the full House to require the panel to release the investigation into alleged misconduct by the Florida Republican, who left office last week. 'The allegations against Matt Gaetz are serious. They are credible. The House Ethics Committee has spent years conducting a thorough investigation to get to the bottom of it,' Casten said in a statement.

Republicans plot rule-busting plans for next year	Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell declared Tuesday that Republicans are plotting to use the Congressional Review Act to kill Biden administration rules. The Kentucky Republican, who's stepping down from his leadership post at the end of the year, said the incoming Senate majority was preparing to use the CRA 'to rein in Washington bureaucrats' expensive interpretation of the powers over working Americans.' 'Under the Biden administration, Democrats have worked relentlessly to resurrect the Obama administration's regulatory regime,' he said, 'from student loan socialism to job-killing energy policies to blatant infringements on property rights.' The CRA allows Congress to undo rules issued within a certain amount of time. Only simple majority votes are required in the House and Senate,...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/congressional-review-act-mitch-mcconnell-00190689	2024-11-20T11:37:38-08:00	
Costa will challenge Scott for job leading Democrats on House Agriculture Committee	Senior House Agriculture Committee member Jim Costa (D-Calif.) will challenge ailing ranking member David Scott (D-Ga.) as the leader of the House Agriculture Committee, he told colleagues Wednesday. Costa informed a group of fellow California Democrats of his plans to challenge Scott during the state delegation lunch, according to three people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting. And he has invited some Democrats to a meeting Thursday to discuss the farm bill — which has been stalled in Congress for over a year.

Luna: Johnson blocked proxy voting for new moms	Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) said Wednesday that Speaker Mike Johnson has blocked her proposal to allow new mothers to vote by proxy for several months from being included in the rules package for the next Congress. 'Today, after speaking with @SpeakerJohnson about this for months, I was told, He will not support allowing female members to vote if they give birth,' she wrote in a thread on X. 'Among other things, this is something that I fundamentally disagree with him on.' Johnson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but he has backup from other corners of the Republican conference. 'I don’t give a crap who you are or whether you just had a baby in the last six weeks,' Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said on 'CR...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/house-proxy-voting-blocked-00190692	2024-11-20T11:32:20-08:00	
Steve Bannon ally reuses Vance’s ‘mouth breathing imbeciles’ quip	Grace Chong, chief financial officer and chief operating officer for MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon’s 'War Room,' called Republicans who missed the vote to confirm a judicial nominee Wednesday 'mouth breathing imbeciles!!!' on X — a clapback to JD Vance’s recent pointed remarks at her. Chong was commenting directly on the Senate confirming Rebecca Pennell as District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Washington by a vote of 50-48 on Wednesday. If GOP Sens. Mike Braun and Ted Cruz had been present and voted no, their two votes would have led to a tie that Vice President Kamala Harris would have to break. Chong reused the colorful phrase 'mouth breathing imbeciles' just one day after <a href='https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/19/congress/jd-vance-grace-chong-bannon-00190484' t...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/mouth-breathing-imbeciles-00190688	2024-11-20T11:16:37-08:00	
Trump's plan to let Lutnick oversee trade office needs Congress' buy-in	In announcing his Commerce secretary pick Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump also suggested he wants to dramatically reorder how trade policy is made in Washington. Congress will likely have something to say about that. Trump tapped Howard Lutnick for the role, saying in a statement that his transition co-chair and Wall Street billionaire will 'lead his tariff and trade agenda' and will have 'direct responsibility for the Office of the United States Trade Representative.' But as numerous trade policy experts immediately pointed out, the move could set off a battle with Congress over who controls trade policy in the next Trump administration. 'I think keeping the independence of USTR is very important, but also it is an offshoot of congressional authority,' said Rep. <a href='https://dir...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/trumps-trade-00190687	2024-11-20T11:16:07-08:00	
The Vance-Gaetz message to senators: Get him to a hearing	Senators exiting closed-door meetings with Matt Gaetz on Wednesday had a message: Just get the man to a hearing. Gaetz, Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, and Vice President-elect JD Vance (R-Ohio) met with GOP senators on Wednesday to discuss the congressman’s embattled nomination. Swaths of Senate Republicans have not yet committed to supporting Gaetz, and at least two senators — Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) — have cast serious doubts on Gaetz getting confirmed to the top position at the Justice Department. Gaetz faces a litany of allegations, including that he had sex with a minor and paid for sex, though he has denied any wrongdoing. The House Ethics Committee is currently weighing whether to share a report they have been assembling on those accusations ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/20/congress/readout-from-vance-gaetz-meetings-00190682	2024-11-20T10:53:40-08:00	
Powerful GOP steering committee comes together	House Republicans named the members of their steering committee Wednesday, locking in a new group that holds power to set most committee assignments and committee chairs, significantly influencing how the conference as a whole operates. The 30 person body includes regional representation and members of leadership — whose votes have more weight than other members. But the rank-and-file members are usually allies of leadership, which helps concentrate the power of committee slots to leadership. Speaker Mike Johnson’s vote counts as four and Majority Leader Steve Scalise’s counts as two, with the rest of leadership and rank and file members weighted equally at one vote. Louisiana, in particular, is going to be a powerful voting bloc for members.

Gaetz recess appointment could be unconstitutional, former DOJ official who wrote torture memos warns	The former Justice Department official who authored the post-9/11 'torture memos' cautioned that President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of former Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general 'would plunge the DOJ into a political and legal quagmire' — and that a recess appointment could even be 'unconstitutional.' 'Gaetz would serve the returning president better by withdrawing,' wrote John Yoo, who has served in all three branches of government, in an op-ed published Wednesday and co-written with the legal scholar Robert J. Delahunty.

Rand Paul breaks with Trump on using military for mass deportations: ‘Huge mistake’	GOP Sen. Rand Paul denounced President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to deploy the military to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants upon his return to office, saying it would be a 'huge mistake' and a misuse of military personnel. 'I’m not in favor of sending the Army in uniforms into our cities to collect people,' Paul (R-Ky.) told Newsmax host Rob Schmitt on Tuesday.

In a letter obtained by POLITICO sent to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Democratic members of Judiciary Committee requested the evidentiary file from law enforcement’s probe into whether Gaetz engaged in child sex trafficking. The former Florida lawmaker, who resigned last week after President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to nominate him as attorney general, has denied all wrongdoing.

Johnson announces policy barring transgender women from women's bathrooms on House side of Capitol	Speaker Mike Johnson has banned transgender women from using women’s bathrooms in the House portion of the Capitol building, enacting into policy a push led by Rep.

Trump appoints former acting AG Matthew Whitaker as ambassador to NATO	President-elect Donald Trump announced on Wednesday he will name former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, a close ally, to serve as the U.S. ambassador to NATO. In a statement, Trump said that 'Matt is a strong warrior and loyal Patriot, who will ensure the United States’ interests are advanced and defended.' Trump added: 'Matt will strengthen relationships with our NATO Allies, and stand firm in the face of threats to Peace and Stability - He will put AMERICA FIRST.' Whitaker’s foreign policy views are largely unknown.
