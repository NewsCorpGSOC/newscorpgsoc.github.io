Conservatives fall in line behind Mike Johnson ahead of speaker race	Mike Johnson‚Äôs speakership appeared to be on life support seven months ago. Now, even his biggest antagonists are preparing to back him as the party enters the second Trump era. It didn‚Äôt happen by accident ‚Äî Johnson‚Äôs been working diligently behind the scenes to solidify support.

How big business is making its relationship with Republicans great again	Donald Trump‚Äôs Washington is going to be packed with heavyweights from big business such as Elon Musk, Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick. They all have the inside track. Then, there‚Äôs the traditional, powerful industries represented by another major heavyweight: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which, for much of its 100-plus year history, has been a reliable ally of the Republican Party. But it‚Äôs no secret that in recent years, the Chamber‚Äôs partnership with the GOP has come to grief. Part of it is political. Part of it is policy. But in its totality, the Chamber is now facing a massive challenge: In January, Trump ‚Äî a populist president vowing new tariffs and pro-union policies ‚Äî will be sworn into office riding a mandate for change.

Chip Roy makes bid for House Rules chair	Rep. Chip Roy is making a bid to lead the House Rules Committee next year, which would give him and the chamber‚Äôs right flank an influential perch for shaping legislation.

'A number of my colleagues, I‚Äôm proud to have their support. ‚Ä¶ I think I would add some value to that position because of my expertise on the rules and because I think I can figure out how to bring the conference together,' Roy added.

GOP Drama: Cotton Seeks Intelligence Chair, Thwarting Cornyn	Senate Republicans have discussed elevating Sen. John Cornyn to chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, according to party officials, a move that would hand Cornyn a prized gavel as consolation for losing his GOP leader bid and could help induce him to run for reelection in two years. The complication, and almost certain deal-breaker: Cornyn would have to leapfrog the Republican next in line to chair the Intelligence Committee, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and Cotton has privately made clear to Cornyn he would claim the position. Likely ensuring Cotton‚Äôs ascension to the chair is the raw politics of last month‚Äôs Senate Republican leadership race between Cornyn and Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.).

House Democrats reappoint heads of key committees	The House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, the leadership group that chooses caucus members for the top panel spots, named their choices Tuesday for the so-called exclusive committees. These leadership spots for Democrats on the powerful committees were all uncontested, despite generational upheaval elsewhere in the caucus. All of the lawmakers selected Tuesday served as ranking member in this Congress. The steering panel‚Äôs recommendations will now go to the full Democratic caucus for approval, though those votes are expected to be perfunctory.

Trump wants to end birthright citizenship. Can that really happen?	President-elect Donald Trump said he wants to end birthright citizenship on his first day in office next month. But he‚Äôll likely run into trouble. Trump has suggested, without offering details, that he could enact his plan through an executive order. Birthright citizenship, which gives U.S. citizenship to anyone born on the country‚Äôs soil, is built into law through the Constitution ‚Äî and any attempt to remove it would likely face immediate legal action.

Ron who? How Trump allies brought Hegseth back from the brink	Donald Trump's transition team entered a critical week of nomination meetings on Capitol Hill with a new head of steam, emboldened by a swarm of grassroots support and a pressure campaign that has revived Pete Hegseth's hopes for Defense secretary and given them confidence about other controversial nominees, too. In recent days, allies of Trump adopted an approach that is not novel for the president-elect and his followers: Make life extremely uncomfortable for anyone who dares to oppose him. The swarm of MAGA attacks that Sen. Joni Ernst has experienced is a warning of what's in store for others who express skepticism of his personnel choices.

'When you have a child, that's on you. I'm not looking to separate families at all. That's not my goal. My goal is to enforce the law,' Homan said.

Johnson needs Dems to pass a stopgap spending bill. Here's what they want.	Lawmakers only have nine working days left to figure out government funding before the shutdown deadline, and Speaker Mike Johnson will almost certainly need House Democratic votes to pass it. Congress is likely to pass a stopgap government funding measure before Dec. 20, likely to fund the government until March of next year at its current levels. But considering Johnson‚Äôs razor-thin margin and a notable conservative faction of his conference that doesn‚Äôt generally support stopgap spending bills, known as continuing resolutions, House Democrats will likely be the ones to get the legislation over the finish line.

Tammy Duckworth urges Trump to endorse expansion of IVF coverage for military	Sen. Tammy Duckworth is taking the unorthodox step of asking Donald Trump to wade into a legislative debate before he becomes president, urging him to support her proposal to expand coverage for in vitro fertilization for military personnel.
