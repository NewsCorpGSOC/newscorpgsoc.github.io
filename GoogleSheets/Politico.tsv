Vance keeps Senate budget plan alive	Vice President JD Vance told Senate Republicans on Wednesday that Donald Trump prefers the House’s one-bill approach to his legislative agenda. But Vance didn’t put a stake in the Senate’s competing approach — as a backup. Senate Republicans took the message, delivered during a closed-door lunch, as a sign that they have a green light from the administration to move forward with their two-bill budget plan this week. It would tee up a border, defense and energy bill, saving an overhaul of the tax code for a separate bill later this year. 'We’re moving forward tomorrow,' Senate Budget Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said after the lunch. 'The president prefers one big, beautiful bill — so do I — but you always need a Plan B around here.' Senate Republicans made the point about needing a backup...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/19/congress/vote-a-rama-lives-00204947	2025-02-19T12:10:05-08:00	
Collins: Spending negotiations ‘not going well’ ahead of March shutdown cliff	Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins told reporters Wednesday afternoon that funding negotiations with Democrats 'are not going well' as lawmakers stare down a government shutdown deadline in just over three weeks. It usually takes congressional leaders at least a month to finalizing a dozen annual funding bills after top appropriators strike an initial agreement on overall totals for the military and non-defense programs. But Collins (R-Maine) and her fellow top appropriators have yet to strike that 'toplines' agreement to lay the groundwork for negotiating the details of the 12 bills — and the shutdown deadline on March 14 is quickly ticking closer. Given the time crunch, lawmakers are likely to fall...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/19/congress/spending-negotiations-not-going-well-00204943	2025-02-19T11:58:04-08:00	
Trump stuns Senate GOP with House budget endorsement	Republicans on Capitol Hill have long wanted President Donald Trump to weigh in on the strategic disputes that have divided the two chambers over how to pass his legislative agenda. But this is not what GOP senators had in mind. Trump’s public call Wednesday for the adoption of a House-drafted budget framework — and the 'one big, beautiful bill' it sketches out — left Senate Republicans flat-footed and uncertain about the path forward. 'As they say, did not see that one coming,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune said after emerging from a morning huddle with his fellow GOP leaders. Trump, he confirmed, gave him no heads up that his Truth Social missive backing the House was coming. It came less than a day after Thune moved to put the Senate’s two-bill blueprint on the floor — teeing up hou...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/19/donald-trump-senate-gop-house-budget-00204906	2025-02-19T09:59:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/3c/c5/0a864d024b4fa45381afed9b23f5/u-s-congress-73537.jpg
Senate still moving forward with budget, Thune says	Senate Majority Leader John Thune said that Republicans are moving ahead — for now — with their budget blueprint, even after President Donald Trump endorsed the House’s competing plan on Wednesday. 'We're planning to proceed. But, you know, obviously we are interested in and hoping to hear with more clarity where the White House is coming from,' Thune told reporters after meeting with fellow GOP leaders. The Senate voted to start debate on their budget plan Tuesday, with a marathon 'vote-a-rama' on amendments and final adoption expected to start Thursday. Senate Republicans will discuss the path forward with Vice President JD Vance at a conference lunch Wednesday.

Trump backs House budget plan, calls on Senate to stand down	President Donald Trump threw his support on Wednesday behind the House's budget blueprint — throwing a curveball into the Senate's plan to vote on a competing version this week. Trump, in a Truth Social post, said both chambers are 'doing a SPECTACULAR job of working together' but added that the House budget was preferable because it would fold all of his priorities together instead of separating them into two bills like the Senate GOP plan would. 'We need both Chambers to pass the House Budget to 'kickstart' the Reconciliation process, and move all of our priorities to the concept of, 'ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL.' It will, without question, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' Trump said in the post.

Capitol agenda: Senate's budget slog begins	Senate Republicans have begun the arduous process of adopting their budget blueprint and are now set to take a major step forward on President Donald Trump’s agenda later this week. GOP leaders face some objections that will slow them down, mostly from Democrats, but for now they’re on track. Contrast that with the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson is struggling to corral his conference, and it’s unclear whether he’ll have the votes to move forward with his own budget next week. The state of play: Sen. Rand Paul appears to be the only Republican planning to vote against the resolution, and Democrats can’t tank Majority Leader John Thune’s budget plan if ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/19/congress/senate-budget-slog-thune-00204826	2025-02-19T05:00:00-08:00	
GOP privacy hawks brush off concerns about DOGE data dives	Some of the Senate’s most notorious GOP privacy hawks are shrugging off moves by Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency to access Americans’ sensitive taxpayer data. It’s a sharp turn for lawmakers who often carp about intrusions on individual privacy, and just the latest example of how Republicans are willing to forgive an unelected billionaire set on shattering institutional norms. In this case, Musk is seeking to give his team the ability to look up personal information on an IRS system that contains broad individual financial records along with information from the Social Security Administration. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a frequent critic of Big Tech’s use of Americans' personal da...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/18/congress/gop-privacy-hawks-brush-off-concerns-doge-data-dives-00204812	2025-02-18T18:55:00-08:00	
Senate tees up ‘vote-a-rama’ on budget for party-line package	Senate Republicans took their first procedural vote Monday night on the budget plan they hope to use to swiftly enact a border security, energy and defense spending bill — and deliver President Donald Trump a major legislative victory during his first months in office. The 50-47 vote will allow GOP senators to forge ahead later this week with floor debate on that fiscal blueprint, followed by a so-called vote-a-rama — an overnight barrage of amendment votes that precedes adoption of the budget resolution. But the power of that measure to allow lawmakers to skirt Senate filibuster rules to draft and pass a partisan bill won't be unlocked until GOP leaders in the House and Senate get on the same page about the scope of their party-line package. Eventually the House and Senate will need to ad...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/18/congress/senate-procedural-vote-budget-resolution-00204784	2025-02-18T16:48:43-08:00	
Trump's FBI pick one step closer to confirmation	Kash Patel, the controversial nominee to lead the FBI, cleared another key procedural hurdle Tuesday. The Senate voted 48-45 to move forward with Patel’s nomination, setting up his confirmation vote in the coming days to helm the agency for a 10-year term. Patel, if confirmed, is set to be a central figure in President Donald Trump’s efforts to leverage his powers against perceived enemies. A former House staffer who worked to discredit the congressional inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Patel has promised to go after Trump’s adversaries and shut down the FBI’s Washington headquarters on Day 1 of his tenure to create 'a museum' of the 'deep state.' Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats have argued that Patel would put fealty to the president ahead of his duties as FBI ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/18/congress/kash-patel-senate-confirmation-cloture-00204744	2025-02-18T15:27:33-08:00	
Ways and Means eyeing limits to corporate tax deductions	The House Ways and Means Committee is looking at limiting corporate state and local tax deductions as one way to offset the costs of a large party-line tax bill, according to two people familiar with the discussions. The panel, which oversees all tax policy, is considering the limit among other potential offsets for the bill, according to the people, who were granted anonymity to share private deliberations. Companies currently can deduct an unlimited amount of state income, property and sales taxes from their federal tax bill. The discussions signal that a proposal to limit corporate SALT, as the deduction is called, may have enough support among Republicans to make it into a party-line tax bill.

The House GOP budget resolution is in trouble	Speaker Mike Johnson is staring down at least a dozen Republican holdouts on the budget blueprint he wants to put on the House floor in the coming days — and he can only afford to lose one member and still approve the resolution along party lines. Johnson and his whip team are using the current week-long recess to ramp up engagement with undecided Republicans, including seven members — if not more — who have raised serious concerns about deep cuts to Medicaid in the House GOP budget resolution. Several other members are wary of a move to raise the debt limit as part of the pl...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/18/congress/budget-reconciliation-trump-whip-00204735	2025-02-18T13:59:31-08:00

Senate Republicans edge out the House again, planning budget vote this week	Senate Republicans will vote this week on a budget blueprint that would unlock a key part of President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda. 'It’s time to act on the decisive mandate the American people gave to President Trump in November,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune wrote on X Tuesday afternoon. 'Securing the border, rebuilding our defense, and unleashing American energy. That starts this week with passing [Budget Chair Lindsey Graham’s] budget.'

Senator says GOP's hands are tied on DOGE cuts — 'except complain'	Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley said Congress is powerless in the face of cuts from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. 'Congress can’t do anything except complain' about the slashing of the federal government at the hands of Musk and his allies, Grassley said during a press call on Tuesday, according to a report from RadioIowa. The Iowan's comments serve as a stark admission that, despite growing Republican discomfort that Musk's actions are getting the green light from President Donald Trump, there is little the GOP might be able, or willing, to do.

Trump is shocking official Washington. Will he leave his mark on the District too?	Donald Trump isn’t just looking to remake the federal government. He has his sights set on the city of Washington, too. In his first few weeks in office, the president has moved to drastically alter the fabric of the nation’s capital. He ordered thousands of Washington-area federal workers to return to the office — some of whom his administration is moving to lay off. He injected himself and his allies onto the board of the John F. Kennedy Center to recast 'woke' performing art culture. And the city's mayor said she has been briefed <a href='https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/16/trump-local-dc-city-politics-018777	2025-02-16T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/92/e6/1a2abd804202b6e1397ebe674b8e/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1574583084
Dems concede Republicans ‘running circles’ around them online as Trump remakes Washington	The Department of Government Efficiency created its own account on X last November, amassing 4 million followers with a stream of news on contract cancellations and other cuts to the bureaucracy.

They’re not just suing to stop DOGE. They’re suing Elon Musk himself.	Elon Musk’s efforts to disrupt and dismantle the federal government at the behest of Donald Trump have already sparked a legion of lawsuits. Now the legal challengers are setting their sights on a new target: Musk himself. Two new cases accuse the ultra-wealthy CEO of illegally amassing too much government power without the accountability typically required of high-level executive branch officials. They are seeking court orders that would force Musk to halt the cost-cutting and information-gathering activities he has been spearheading through his U.S. DOGE Service. The lawsuits rest on a provision of the Constitution that says powerful federal officers must be 'established by law,' must be formally appointed by the president and must be confirmed by the Senate.

The House Budget Committee voted 21-16 on Thursday to adopt an amendment that would shrink the amount of tax cuts Republicans can enact if they don’t cut $2 trillion in spending at the same time.

Senate panel votes 'yes' on Trump's pick to lead the FBI	Kash Patel, President Donald Trump’s controversial pick to lead the FBI, was voted out of committee along party lines on Thursday morning. The 12-10 vote from the Senate Judiciary Committee paves the way for Patel to be confirmed by the full Senate in the coming weeks, when he'll take the helm of the federal law enforcement agency amid a massive leadership shakeup. The committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, has accused Patel of helping from the outside to oust some of the Justice Department's top officials in the early days of the Trump administration.

Speaker Johnson bullish on budget blueprint's prospects	Speaker Mike Johnson said the House GOP budget resolution will advance out of the Budget Committee today with no Republican defections, despite protests from key hard-liners. 'I expect it to pass — unanimously,' Johnson told reporters as he entered the Capitol on Thursday. After weeks of delays, the Budget panel is meeting later this morning to debate and vote on a budget blueprint necessary for unlocking the massive Trump agenda bill they’re trying to pass this year along party lines.

Capitol agenda: Johnson's budget dare, RFK Jr. confirmation vote	Speaker Mike Johnson is daring conservatives to sink his budget resolution, setting up a make-or-break moment in the House Budget Committee later today. The speaker emerged from hours of talks Wednesday with two hard-liner holdouts — Reps. Chip Roy and Ralph Norman, both House Freedom Caucus members who also serve on the Budget Committee — saying he would not change his budget blueprint to meet their demands for deeper spending cuts and other adjustments.

Key committee could advance stalled health policy overhaul	The House Energy and Commerce Committee is giving a significant platform to revived, bipartisan talks on legislation to lower prescription drug costs, according to a staff memo reviewed by POLITICO. The committee’s health subcommittee, led by Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), will hold a hearing on so-called 'PBM reform' for Feb. 26, although that date could change. Democrats and Republicans struck a deal late in the last Congress to place new regulations on pharmacy intermediaries, known as pharmacy benefit managers, in a bid to lower costs for patients and employers. These benefit managers, or PBMs, negotiate drug costs for insurers and employers. Carter and his counterpart on the health subcommittee, Rep. <a ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/12/congress/energy-and-commerce-plots-pbm-hearing-00203968	2025-02-12T18:00:00-08:00	
Top House appropriator says spending talks still on track	The top appropriators of the House and Senate are still pursuing a bipartisan spending agreement ahead of the March 14 deadline to avoid a government shutdown — barely a month away. House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said the so-called 'four corners' spending leaders are getting closer to agreement, but are still 'not there,' following a Tuesday night meeting. 'We've been negotiating, we're working hard, and we've closed some of the gap,' Cole told reporters Wednesday. 'We have some knotty issues between us. Are we as far apart as we were? No, we're not. We've made considerable progress.'

Energy and Commerce Committee's Medicaid problem just got tougher	It was always going to be tough for House Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie to rally his members around cuts to Medicaid; his job could soon get even harder. The House GOP budget blueprint unveiled Wednesday would direct several congressional committees to achieve at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts across programs under their panels’ purviews — necessary to offset a party-line, budget reconciliation bill to enact President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda. The Energy and Commerce Committee has been told to find at least $880 billion in savings, or more than half of that total amount, to pay for a massive package that would extend expiring tax cuts, beef up border security and expand American energy...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/12/congress/energy-commerce-medicaid-guthrie-00203919	2025-02-12T14:15:50-08:00

Two of those familiar confirmed Vance and Miller’s positions, which prioritize quickly passing immigration-related funding and dealing with tax cuts in separate legislation later, while one of those and a third person confirmed Vought also supports the strategy.

House budget resolution in limbo as conservatives push deeper spending cuts and work requirements	A planned markup on House GOP leaders' budget plan is less than 24 hours away — and they currently don't have the votes to pass it. The House Budget Committee released text of their one-bill proposal to tackle the border, energy and taxes Wednesday morning, which includes $1.5 trillion in minimum spending cuts. The panel plans to meet Thursday to markup and possibly vote to advance the resolution. It was immediately panned by some hard-liners in the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, who huddled in the basement of the Capitol Wednesday afternoon to discuss it. They're pushing for at least $500 billion in additional spending cuts, as well as work requirements for Medicaid, food aid benefits and another safety net program to be guaranteed in the resolution.

Dems fail to land viral moment at DOGE hearing	The highly anticipated first meeting of the House Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency, or DOGE, came and went on Wednesday with scarce political drama. Democrats sought to cast the subcommittee — a complementary effort to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk — as an extension of what they see as a corrupt executive branch plot to destroy the federal bureaucracy. But Republicans largely sidestepped those attacks, arguing they were in the business of eliminating government waste while Democrats had little interest in engaging earnestly on the subject. It was a surprising twist for a panel filled with political firebrands and chaired by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who just a few years ago was <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/12/congress/doge-subcommittee-mtg-musk-00203870	2025-02-12T11:05:50-08:00	
Tulsi Gabbard confirmed as director of national intelligence	The Senate voted to confirm Tulsi Gabbard to serve as director of national intelligence on Wednesday, with Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the only member of his party to vote against President Donald Trump’s nominee. The vote was 52 to 48. No Democrats voted in support for the former lawmaker. Gabbard has been one of Trump’s most contentious nominees because of her past remarks on foreign adversaries and concerns about whether she has the experience to do the job. But Republican senators — many of whom had expressed reservations about Gabbard as DNI — overwhelmingly backed her nomination. While McConnell’s office did not immediately release a statement explaining his vote, it is in keeping with...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/12/tulsi-gabbard-confirmed-as-director-of-national-intelligence-00203829	2025-02-12T08:59:43-08:00	https://static.politico.com/ba/05/5d4f97664ca096809b9d631f056c/u-s-congress-70033.jpg
Senate gets moving on two-track budget plan	The Senate Budget Committee is marking up its its signature piece of legislation — the reconciliation-unlocking budget resolution — in its race against House counterparts to identify the best path forward for turning President Donald Trump’s policy ambitions into law. While Congress has skipped a budget resolution in recent years, this year the measure is the centerpiece of Republican policymaking on Capitol Hill as the majorities in both chambers are hungry to uncork the power to bypass Senate filibusters and pass party-line bills to enact Trump's domestic agenda.

House budget draft unveiled ahead of Thursday markup	The House Budget Committee unveiled a fiscal blueprint for Republicans' sweeping domestic policy legislation Wednesday that would allow for at least $4.5 trillion in tax cuts while slashing spending by at least $1.5 trillion over the coming decade.

Federal watchdogs fired by Trump urge court to reinstate them	Eight federal watchdogs, abruptly fired last month by President Donald Trump, are suing to get their jobs back, saying Trump broke the law by failing to give Congress a 30-day heads up and concrete explanation for the dismissals. Trump sent a jolt through Washington when he fired 17 inspectors general on the first Friday night of his term, presaging weeks of extraordinary assertions of power that have at times crossed clear legal boundaries.

'I think we’re going to be on track to have budget markup tomorrow,' Scalise said. But he acknowledged it’s not ready quite yet. Key Budget Committee members continue to debate the final range of spending cuts to target in the plan, according to two people familiar with the ongoing talks.

Senate Republicans think Trump tacitly approves of their two-bill budget plan	Senate Republicans believe they have President Donald Trump’s blessing as they pursue a two-bill strategy for passing his domestic legislative agenda. Trump has repeatedly said that he prefers 'one big, beautiful bill,' but Senate Republicans have been privately checking that he is OK with them moving forward with two bills — one that addresses the border, energy and defense spending quickly, while a second gets into more complicated tax cuts. On Tuesday, OMB Director Russ Vought and Border Czar Tom Homan also said behind closed doors that they need $175 billion in additional border money quickly, further boosting Senate Republicans' confidence in moving immediately.

Forty six Democrats in the chamber voted against Gabbard. Two senators were absent from the vote. GOP Sens.

Budget Chair Jodey Arrington and committee member Chip Royare at odds with Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith and other senior Republicans on how to proceed. The budget hawks are pushing for additional and highly controversial spending cuts. They’re also looking to put a strict limit in the budget resolution on how much the reconciliation bill can...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/10/congress/johnson-reconciliation-battle-gabbard-rfk-00203323	2025-02-10T05:00:00-08:00	
House GOP continues to squabble over tax cuts as lawmakers enter a critical week	Prominent House Republicans are privately warring over how to advance tax cuts that are expiring and President Donald Trump’s long list of other tax demands — with Budget Chair Jodey Arrington and deficit hard-liner Rep. Chip Roy locked in a struggle against Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith and other senior Republicans. The dispute is hindering Speaker Mike Johnson’s plan to advance a budget blueprint this week, as different GOP factions continue to squabble over the costs of the tax plan, how to offset them to reduce their deficit i...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/09/house-gop-continues-squabble-budget-costs-critical-week-00203302	2025-02-09T17:57:26-08:00	https://static.politico.com/3e/5e/20ff469344cb905f98898134675e/congress-debt-52041.jpg
Jim Jordan backs Elon Musk’s authority to cut federal government	Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) vehemently defended Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s campaign to slash federal spending — and declined to endorse the idea that Musk was stepping on Congress' power of the purse. 'It's interesting,' Jordan said on CNN’s 'Inside Politics' on Sunday. 'No one wants to defend the waste, fraud and abuse, so they attack the guy who's exposing all the waste, fraud and ridiculous things we're spending money on.' Over the past few weeks, Musk and the DOGE team have zeroed in on the Trump administration’s mission to overhaul federal agencies and reduce staff. Entities like the United States Agency for International Development and Department of Education have been DOGE’s main targets, with Musk referring to USAID as a <a href='https://x.com/e...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/09/jim-jordan-backs-elon-musk-authority-00203273	2025-02-09T10:32:46-08:00	https://static.politico.com/32/92/8a0722774e0fb0797909c818990b/musk-twitter-doge-25082.jpg
As Trump steamrolls Washington, courts flex their power to slow him down	President Donald Trump’s 'shock and awe' assertion of executive power has hit a wall in the courtroom — at least for now. At least nine federal judges — from Washington, D.C., to Washington state — have halted aspects of Trump’s early-term blitz, from his effort to rewrite the Constitution’s birthright citizenship guarantee to his sweeping effort to freeze federal spending to his plans to break and remake the federal workforce. That trend reached a crescendo Friday when U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols — a Trump appointee — blocked a plan by Trump and Elon Musk to put 2,200 USAID employees on leave, part of a rapid-fire effort to dismantle the foreign a...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/09/trump-courts-block-early-agenda-00203230	2025-02-09T04:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/ff/7a/413b709f4eaaab1e8d6b2044bfc7/trump-40784.jpg
Why Trump was able to pull off such a swift war on diversity	Donald Trump’s move to rapidly eradicate diversity efforts from the federal government marks the culmination of a widespread conservative backlash to the antiracism movement of 2020. Five years ago, as 'END RACISM' was emblazoned on professional football fields and Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima caricatures disappeared from grocery shelves, a growing number of voters bristled at what they saw as a performative attack that went far beyond that police brutality symbolized by the killing of George Floyd. As hiring managers across the country embraced diversity, equity and inclusion programs, Republicans waged a culture war over the 'woke agenda' and rode it to victory, from local school board contests to sweeping Trump back into the White House. The politics of race has changed in just a few years...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/08/trump-dei-diversity-federal-workers-00203254	2025-02-08T11:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/99/06/21060f4747a0af9f0ed574769754/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2196277511
How JD Vance Is Helping Trump Win on Capitol Hill	Sen. Todd Young needed to vent, and a former colleague was ready to listen. One of the key swing votes on President Donald Trump’s troubled nomination for director of national intelligence, the Indiana Republican had told Republican leaders he was leaning no on confirming Tulsi Gabbard. And then Trump’s most powerful ally, Elon Musk, went online Sunday to call him a 'deep state puppet' — unleashing a tide of MAGA fury. He found a sympathetic ear in Vice President JD Vance, who spoke with Young shortly after Musk’s posting, according to two people familiar with the conversation. Vance quickly made it clear to his team, legislative affairs staffers and others in the White House: Time to call off the dogs. Those aides proceeded to contact a range of GOP influencers who had been pummeling Youn...	https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/02/08/jd-vance-house-gop-column-00203240	2025-02-08T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/00/bb/66031703497b9fc1500d2acb14ca/trump-cabinet-hegseth-74978.jpg
Trump cuts Biden access to security briefings as payback	President Donald Trump took steps Friday to bar his predecessor from accessing sensitive national security information with an order he readily admitted was payback. Trump said former President Joe Biden would no longer receive classified intelligence briefings that were customary for former presidents — until Biden halted Trump's access after the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. 'There is no need for Joe Biden to continue receiving access to classified information,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'He set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the Intelligence Community (IC) to stop the 45th President of the United States (ME!) from accessing details on National Security, a courtesy provided to former Presidents.' Trump also cited special counsel Robert Hur’s <a href='https://www.po...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/07/trump-biden-security-briefings-00203232	2025-02-07T16:14:23-08:00	https://static.politico.com/ec/ec/07f75b174c9f813862d16a12e748/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2194374975
Leaders squabble, appropriators stoic as shutdown deadline approaches	Five weeks away from a government funding deadline, tensions are spiking among lawmakers and shutdown fears are rising. Top-level relations soured Friday, with Speaker Mike Johnson accusing Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of 'trying to set up some sort of a government shutdown' and saying Democrats were 'unresponsive.' Jeffries then shot back, telling reporters Johnson’s comments were 'projection' as Democrats remain at the negotiating table.

House GOP still has big problems to solve on its budget	House Republicans are still far from finalizing several key details of a budget blueprint that Speaker Mike Johnson is pledging to advance in the House next week, with negotiations expected to continue through the weekend as the Senate races ahead with its own plans. While House GOP leaders trumpeted tremendous progress coming out of a White House meeting with President Donald Trump on Thursday, key holdouts on Trump’s sweeping agenda of tax cuts, border security and energy initiatives indicated Friday that they remained unconvinced about the level of spending cuts in the bill. Separately, Republican tax writers continue to struggle with the ballooning costs of Trump’s wishlist, which includes not only an...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/07/house-gop-leaders-scramble-to-extinguish-tax-cut-fires-00203092	2025-02-07T11:44:24-08:00	https://static.politico.com/56/9f/fd3e196e4927bae446fcf8e2b7d1/u-s-congress-43681.jpg
Trump ousted the top Democratic campaign finance regulator. She says it's illegal.	President Donald Trump moved this week to fire the chair of the Federal Election Commission, Democrat Ellen Weintraub, the latest in a line of ousters of Democratic-aligned regulators across the government. 'Received a letter from POTUS today purporting to remove me as Commissioner &amp; Chair of @FEC. There’s a legal way to replace FEC commissioners-this isn’t it,' Weintraub wrote on X on Thursday. 'I’ve been lucky to serve the American people &amp; stir up some good trouble along the way. That’s not changing anytime soon.' The FEC’s website lists Weintraub’s seat as vacant as of Friday morning. But in an interview Friday, she contended her removal was illegal.

House GOP tees up hearing on Trump’s foreign aid overhaul	The House Foreign Affairs Committee is holding a hearing next week on the U.S. Agency for International Development amid the Trump administration’s contentious efforts to shrink the institution, according to a notice obtained by POLITICO. The hearing, announced Thursday night to panel members by chair Brian Mast (R-Fla.), is titled 'The USAID Betrayal' and is set to examine concerns over U.S. foreign aid policies. The hearing is set for Thursday at 8:30 a.m., and former Florida Republican Rep. Ted Yoho and Bill Steiger, who served as the agency’s chief of staff during the first Trump administration, are set to testify. The move is unlikely to satisfy Democrats, who have been furious about the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle a federally codified agency, calling it unconstitution...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/07/congress/usaid-hearing-set-00203071	2025-02-07T05:52:11-08:00	
Capitol agenda: Battle of the budgets coming next week	Next week is shaping up to be a battle of the budgets. House Republicans spent hours Thursday reworking their one-bill plan in two separate meetings — one at the White House, with some limited involvement from President Donald Trump. But despite Speaker Mike Johnson’s stated intentions to unveil a framework today, he told reporters late Thursday night that House Republicans would be working on it all weekend. GOP leadership is starting to tell some members that full details won’t be available until Monday. Majority Leader Steve Scalise said after the late-night meeting they still hadn’t agreed on a topline.

Fetterman says he'll oppose Gabbard, RFK Jr.	Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), who has been willing to buck his party to confirm some of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks, is ruling out voting for two of the president's most controversial nominees: Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Fetterman said in a post on X Thursday night that he won’t vote to confirm Gabbard as director of national intelligence or Kennedy as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Both are now expected to be confirmed after their nominations had been seen to be in jeopardy. 'I have met with most of the cabinet nominees and have carefully watched their confirmation hearings,' Fetterman wrote.

Russ Vought confirmed as White House budget chief	The Senate has confirmed President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the White House budget office despite Democrats delivering a marathon of speeches condemning the administration’s vision for slashing the federal government. Lawmakers voted 53-47 Thursday evening to return Russ Vought for a second tour as director of the Office of Management and Budget. Republicans were in lockstep behind the man who could dramatically alter how federal dollars get spent, in part by taking the 'power of the purse' away from members of Congress. Democrats all voted against Vought, but it wasn’t enough. It had been clear for days that the GOP majority was united behind Trump’s pick for OMB director, even as the agency rocked Congress last week with an attempt to freeze congressionally approved funds. But even wi...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/06/russ-vought-trump-omb-spending-00203006	2025-02-06T16:46:44-08:00	https://static.politico.com/8f/1b/3b417b9f4460b506f922c13a6052/senate-democrats-62119.jpg
More Dems join with Republicans to pass fentanyl crackdown bill	The Republican-led House passed legislation Thursday with significant Democratic support that would lead to harsher sentences for fentanyl traffickers, leaving it with a good chance of becoming law. The so-called HALT Fentanyl Act got more Democrats on board this year, with 98 voting in favor, compared with the 74 Democrats who backed a similar version when it passed the House last Congress. The bill didn’t receive a Senate vote at that time amid Democratic concerns it leaned too heavily on law enforcement and would result in more mass incarcerations — a worry for some Democrats this time around too. But now, with Republicans controlling the Senate and enough Democratic co-sponsors in that chamber to clear ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/06/congress/fentanyl-house-vote-passage-00202977	2025-02-06T15:10:00-08:00

Committee punts on Kash Patel vote as Democrats keep up the pressure	Democrats took advantage of the rules of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday to delay consideration of Kash Patel's nomination to lead the FBI — but broke some recent precedent in the process. While lawmakers typically do a one-week punt on Judiciary Committee votes for an variety of reasons — from opposing a bill to nominees — rarely if ever does the panel meet in person to formally approve the delay. Democrats' vehement opposition to confirming Patel prompted such an in-person gathering. Democrats had requested a second hearing with Patel to grill him over the recent leadership shakeup at the FBI.
