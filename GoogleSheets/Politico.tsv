Chicago lawmaker joins the anti-Schumer pile on by House members	A progressive House member from Chicago is calling on Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to step down from his leadership position, joining a growing list of fellow Democrats to air that view after he allowed a vote on a Republican spending plan to avoid a government shutdown. Rep. Delia Ramirez said Wednesday that Schumer should have used the leverage of a potential shutdown to push back against President Donald Trump and a spending plan that would make additional cuts to programs and a government workforce already reeling from the work of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. 'This is a moment for Democrats to do more than just talk about fighting or obstructing Donald Trump’s agenda of destroying Social Security and Medicaid, but actually using every legislative authority to...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/19/chicago-lawmaker-joins-the-anti-schumer-pile-on-by-house-members-026677	2025-03-19T16:17:28-07:00	https://static.politico.com/26/ef/c5a7bbf94b219da9a20b81f02745/u-s-congress-30333.jpg
‘You’re not fighting!’: Dems run into angry crowds at town halls	Congressional Democrats — who were hoping to blast Republicans over budget cuts — instead took incoming from their exasperated constituents when they traveled home to host town halls. In Arizona, Sens. Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly were confronted at a joint forum Monday by an attendee demanding to know if they 'would support removing' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. In Oregon, an audience member told Sen. Ron Wyden and Rep. Janelle Bynum on Sunday that he is 'so pissed off right now at the leadership in the United States Senate that they are not willing to step up and fight.'

Trump wants House to ‘get on board’ with Washington budget fix	President Donald Trump wants Congress to repair a significant cut to the District of Columbia’s budget and is happy to leave the procedural details to Speaker Mike Johnson, according to two White House officials. But the president is prepared to work the phones — or, if needed, fire off a social media post — to correct legislative language that could have major repercussions for the capital city if left unaddressed. Last Friday, the Senate passed a Trump-endorsed bill that would restore as much as $1.1 billion in local funding, according to District officials, that was — inadvertently, by some accounts — slashed by the government spending measure signed into law the next day. The president has confidence the speaker will bring the bipartisan measure up for a vote, said a White House offici...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/19/trump-wants-the-dc-budget-fix-approved-and-is-willing-to-apply-pressure-if-needed-00239545	2025-03-19T15:11:08-07:00	https://static.politico.com/c2/ff/9ba460194d0fbf341b09be6eca21/friends-of-ireland-luncheon-11621.jpg
Jordan vows hearings on judicial rulings after Trump calls for impeachments	House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan said he plans to hold hearings on recent judicial rulings against the Trump administration's agenda, after President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and conservatives have called for impeaching federal judges. James Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, D.C., had ruled that Trump must stop the deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants, a move that prompted swift backlash from the president’s base. Shortly after Trump called for the House to start proceedings to remove Boasberg on Tuesday, Texas Rep. Brandon Gill filed articles of impeachment against him.

House Democrat puts Schumer on notice: 'Get right' or get out	A normally even-keeled Democratic congressman wants Chuck Schumer to feel the heat. If the Senate minority leader doesn't adopt a tougher line in the next big Washington negotiation, Rep. Glenn Ivey said, 'maybe he needs to go.' Ivey spoke to POLITICO Wednesday morning, hours after facing a raucous town hall in his suburban Washington district, where he first suggested that Schumer should consider stepping aside. Ivey expanded on his view of the top Senate Democrat — and delivered an ultimatum amid the widespread frustration with the party leadership’s approach to opposing President Donald Trump. 'If he can get himself together and come — you know, get right on this vote and we get another shot at it, okay,' Ivey said. 'But if he’s going to do the same thing again when this bill comes up s...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/19/glenn-ivey-chuck-schumer-step-aside-00238529	2025-03-19T09:33:40-07:00	https://static.politico.com/6c/cb/1408470c4627a26013f18a2551b6/house-rules-committee-meeting-57373.jpg
Schumer bashing has gone mainstream	The Senate Democratic leader said it himself on cable news on Tuesday night. By siding with Republicans on the government funding bill, Chuck Schumer knew members of his own party would come out against him. But what may have not have been expected was how quickly the criticism spread beyond the left flank. Just this week, Rep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland told constituents 'it may be time for the Senate Democrats to get a new leader,' Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz aired frustrations, and one of Schumer’s longtime allies...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/19/schumer-bashing-has-gone-mainstream-00237901	2025-03-19T06:59:09-07:00	https://static.politico.com/97/10/413521dc4dc5a1d583beb8e163de/u-s-congress-50611.jpg
Another House Democrat piles on embattled Chuck Schumer	Add another member of Congress to the list of angry Democrats saying it might be time Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to call it quits. Rep. Glenn Ivey, who represents a deep-blue Maryland district just outside Washington, faced voters at a town hall Tuesday and said he shares their frustration with President Donald Trump’s cuts to the government — and with Schumer for allowing a vote on a Republican spending plan. 'I respect Chuck Schumer. I think he had a great, long-standing career,' Ivey told an audience that included many government workers. 'But I’m afraid that it may be time for the Senate Democrats to get a new leader.' His criticism reflects what appears to be growing division among Democrats over how to resist the sweeping cuts imposed by Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/glenn-ivey-chuck-schumer-00237829	2025-03-18T19:57:25-07:00	https://static.politico.com/b3/4c/d03d555a48d391ffd72453623d30/federal-workers-rally-73286.jpg
Pelosi shivs Schumer: ‘Don't give away anything for nothing’	SAN FRANCISCO — Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered a sharp critique of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday, suggesting he had forfeited a crucial bargaining chip by allowing a vote on Republicans’ government funding bill. 'I myself don't give away anything for nothing,' Pelosi told reporters during a news conference at a children’s hospital in San Francisco. 'I think that's what happened the other day.' Pelosi — who spoke during an event to oppose House Republicans’ proposed cuts to Medicaid — said she still supports Schumer, her longtime ally who’s come under fire from with...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/pelosi-shivs-schumer-dont-give-away-anything-for-nothing-00237661	2025-03-18T15:35:26-07:00	https://static.politico.com/eb/c7/28cc7d5f4421b882c44b0bb196ca/190402-nancy-pelosi-773.jpg

Dem-leaning WestExec Advisors lost big-name clients since the election	WestExec Advisors has long operated as an exclusive Washington consulting firm known for its meteoric rise and lineup of heavy-hitter Democrats and former national security officials. But its business is something of a black box. Because it technically doesn’t directly advocate on behalf of clients — i.e., lobby — WestExec doesn’t have to disclose who is paying them and for what. POLITICO, however, has gotten a peek at some clients that previously worked with WestExec in recent years before departing. They include software giant Palantir Technologies, Japanese investment company SoftBank Group, semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries and South Korean conglomerate Samsung, according to six people directly familiar with the matter.

JB Pritzker on Chuck Schumer's spending vote: 'I disagree with what he did'	JB Pritzker criticized Chuck Schumer and declined to say whether he should continue leading Senate Democrats amid an escalating internal crisis over the party’s strategy in the second Trump presidency. Schumer joined Republicans in voting to avert a government shutdown last week, infuriating broad swaths of the left — and leading to calls for him to step down as Senate Democratic leader — for declining to use leverage in the spending fight to oppose Donald Trump’s agenda. Pritzker, a high-profile governor and Democratic operator, chose not to publicly extend a life raft to Schumer when asked about the senator’s future. 'Look, he's the elected leader,' Pritzker told reporters after a sit-down at the Center for American Progress in Washington.

Walz knocks Schumer over government funding blowup	Tim Walz took a jab at Chuck Schumer over his decision to avert a government shutdown, accusing the party of ceding to Republicans. 'I believe that Chuck 100 percent believes that he made a decision that reduced the pain and the risk to Americans,' the Minnesota governor said in the latest episode of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s podcast released on Tuesday. 'I see it now that we're in a point where … that pain is coming anyway and I think we gave up our leverage.'

Trump calls for impeachment of judge who tried to halt deportations	President Donald Trump on Tuesday called for the impeachment of the federal judge who ordered a two-week halt to his efforts to remove Venezuelan migrants using extraordinary war powers that haven’t been invoked for decades. Trump’s call to remove U.S. District Judge James Boasberg — the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, D.C. — is the first time since taking office for his second term that he’s asked Congress to seek a judge’s removal, joining increasingly pointed calls by his top donor and adviser Elon Musk and a segment of his MAGA base. Trump also suggested that 'many' of the judges who have ruled against him in other cases should be impeached as well. ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/trump-impeachment-judge-deportations-00235173	2025-03-18T06:58:54-07:00	https://static.politico.com/88/01/02e042684f58bcfd4a6b44babbc2/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2205096901
Centrist Democrats are having their moment	Moderate Democrats are on a tear. Democrats are overperforming at the state level, with centrist candidates flipping one seat and coming close in another in special elections in deep red parts of Iowa. Rahm Emanuel, who once orchestrated a takeover of the House by recruiting Blue Dog Democrats, is eying a 2028 bid for president. And leading Democrats like Gavin Newsom and Chuck Schumer are rebuffing the left — the California governor siding against trans players in women’s sports and the Senate minority leader veering away from progressive demands to shut down the government.

How Matt Gaetz poisoned the House Ethics Committee	Scandal-ridden former Rep. Matt Gaetz is gone from Congress, but the wounds he inflicted on the House Ethics Committee that investigated him remain fresh. After the longest delay in recent history, the panel finally recruited enough members to perform its grim mandate of governing fellow lawmakers’ conduct in the 119th Congress. And they’ll have their work cut out for them: The committee is still regrouping from its crisis late last year over whether to break with recent precedent and release the results of an investigation into their former Florida GOP colleague, who was being considered for attorney general. The Ethics Committee rarely releases findings of investigations into lawmakers who resign before those investigations can conclude.

‘Full of despair’: Senate Dems look to regroup after losing shutdown fight	Senate Democrats are bracing for a painful post-mortem as they try to avoid a September rerun of their latest government funding defeat. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, and nine of his members helped get a House GOP-authored government funding bill to the finish line, saying a vote to advance legislation they loathed was the least bad option. The alternative, they argued, was allowing a shutdown that could empower Trump and Elon Musk to accelerate their slashing of the federal bureaucracy. This was the first time since the start of Trump’s second administration that the party had real leverage to fight the president, as Republicans needed Democratic votes to overcome a filibuster.

The Congress Issue	After nearly three decades on Capitol Hill, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) reached the apex of his career as the new Senate majority leader and head of the Republican caucus. But he’s also reached a personal crossroads — and how he navigates it will determine his legacy and the future of the American experiment. There’s no question that Thune is a conservative who supports President Donald Trump’s agenda, despite his previous opposition to Trump becoming the GOP nominee. But temperamentally, he’d seem to be at odds with Trump’s aggressive, norm-breaking approach to the presidency. 'In a move-fast-and-break-things era of anti-government ardor, he’s virtually a public-sector lifer, an easy-does-it institutionalist,' <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/03/14/john-thune-south-da...	https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-weekend/2025/03/15/weekend-newsletter-congress-issue-00231668	2025-03-15T07:13:00-07:00	
‘Uniting anger’: Democrats fume over Schumer’s handling of funding fight	Chuck Schumer is facing one of the most perilous moments of his Senate leadership career. The Senate minority leader came under heavy fire for the second straight day from Democrats enraged at him for backing a Republican bill to avoid a government shutdown, and fallout appears likely to last well past Friday’s vote. A handful of House lawmakers, including some in battleground districts, are floating supporting a primary challenge against him. Activists are organizing efforts to punish him financially. Schumer is facing questions within his own caucus about whether he made strategic errors in handling the high-stakes moment and failed to outline a clear plan about how to deal with the complex politics of a shutdown, according to interviews with six lawmakers or their aides.

That all exploded in dramatic fashion this week, culminating Friday at a news conference unlike any I have seen in my career covering Congress, where the No. 1 House Democrat repeatedly dodged questions about whether the No. 1 Senate Democrat was fit to lead.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stressed to reporters Thursday, after he announced his decision to help advance the bill, that he was letting each member come to their own decision — an indication that he wasn’t going to try to squeeze anyone to oppose or support the bill.

Jeffries stays silent on Schumer's future as Senate leader	House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries sidestepped a question about the leadership of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — a stunning demonstration of the breach that has emerged between the two New York Democrats over a looming government shutdown. 'Next question,' Jeffries told reporters when asked if there should be new leadership in the Senate. He also declined to answer a question on whether he had confidence in Schumer and said that while he'd been in touch with his fellow leader, their conversations would 'remain private.'

Trump lauds Schumer's 'guts' in backing bill to avoid shutdown	President Donald Trump on Friday congratulated Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for 'doing the right thing' by backing the Republican-led bill to avert a government shutdown, a choice that's put the New York Democrat at odds with many in his party. 'A non pass would be a Country destroyer, approval will lead us to new heights,' wrote the president Friday morning on Truth Social. 'Again, really good and smart move by Senator Schumer,' wrote the president on Truth Social. 'Took 'guts' and courage!' Trump added. Schumer is facing an onslaught of criticism from his left flank, with some progressive activists now referring to the lawmaker's decision to vote for the House GOP-passed, seven-month funding measure as the 'Schumer surrender.' Trump, in that social media post, also said he wants ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/14/congress/trump-congratulates-schumer-00230577	2025-03-14T06:58:39-07:00	
Dems ask Trump admin to explain Khalil’s arrest, calling it ‘playbook of authoritarians’	More than 100 House Democrats on Friday sent a letter to top Trump officials, decrying the arrest of a former Columbia graduate student as an attack on the First Amendment and questioning the murky legal authority invoked by the administration. The lawmakers, including authors Reps. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania, addressed the letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The letter, first obtained by POLITICO, slams the use of a Cold War-era section of the Immigration and Nationality Act to deport Mahmoud Khalil as the 'playbook of authoritarians.'

Capitol agenda: Schumer stops a shutdown	Chuck Schumer has given Senate Democrats an out — drastically lowering the chances of a government shutdown Saturday. The Senate minority leader, both privately to his caucus Thursday and in a floor speech shortly after, said he would vote to advance a GOP-written stopgap to fund the government through September. He said Republicans’ spending bill is 'very bad.' But he argued the 'potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse' and would empower President Donald Trump and Elon Musk to further gut federal agencies</a...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/14/congress/what-were-watching-00230418	2025-03-14T05:00:00-07:00

Andy Beshear hits Newsom for hosting Bannon on his new podcast	Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear took a swipe Thursday at a fellow leading Democrat, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, for hosting one of the most prominent figures in the MAGA movement on his new podcast. Beshear, whose popularity in a heavily Republican state has turned him into a potential presidential candidate, told reporters that Newsom shouldn’t have opened his platform to Steve Bannon, an outspoken advocate of the 'America first' agenda of President Donald Trump.

House Democrats stew over Schumer's capitulation on GOP funding bill	LEESBURG, Virginia — House Democrats privately and publicly steamed Thursday evening about Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s decision to back passage of a GOP spending patch they had fiercely opposed. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said he was 'extremely disappointed,' while Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) called it a 'gut punch.' Some Democrats attending the yearly Democratic policy retreat here went so far as to privately hope that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) would launch a primary challenge against Schumer — though he’s not up for reelection until 2028. Some centrist lawmakers even quipped about cutting checks to Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign.

The left seethes at the ‘Schumer surrender’	The Democratic base wants a fight. Chuck Schumer won’t give it to them. The Senate minority leader on Thursday backed away from the shutdown confrontation that many liberal voters and activist leaders had been pushing for — arguing that closing the government would only empower President Donald Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk in their bureaucracy-slashing campaign. That decision sent shockwaves through the left and had many in their ranks seething at a top party leader who had sought to win them over in recent years.

The announcement late Thursday by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that he would support the House GOP’s seven-month stopgap measure was an acknowledgment that Democrats have little choice if they want to avoid empowering Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative to unilaterally halt more federal programs under the cover of a shutdown.

Trump backs key Senate tax plan strategy in struggle with House	President Donald Trump indicated to GOP senators during a White House meeting Thursday that he supports using an accounting method that would treat trillions of dollars in tax cuts in a massive GOP package as costing nothing, according to three senators who attended the meeting and three other people familiar with the conversation. 'If you are going to make the tax code permanent, by definition it’s going to be with current policy,' said Sen.

Democrats should back away from shutdown, Schumer says	Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stepped Democrats away from the edge of a shutdown on Thursday — warning that repercussions of closing the federal government would be worse than the only viable alternative, passing the House GOP funding bill that many in Schumer's party loathe. Schumer’s remarks — made first during a closed-door lunch with his colleagues Thursday and then from the Senate floor in a lengthy speech — are a significant indication that enough Senate Democrats will vote to advance the House GOP bill and avoid a shutdown that would start after midnight Friday.

Senate confirms Pulte as top housing regulator, with market's future at stake	The Senate on Thursday voted 56-43 to confirm Bill Pulte as the nation's top housing regulator, putting him at the center of a fight over the future of two government-controlled companies that prop up half the residential mortgage market. As the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Pulte will have oversight of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been in government conservatorship for more than 16 years. The Trump administration is widely expected to seek to release Fannie and Freddie from government control — a complicated process that will rekindle debate about the role of the federal government in housing at a time when affordability has emerged as a major political concern.

Trump’s Capitol Hill agenda in limbo	Congressional Republicans notched a major victory by muscling a funding bill through the House, but GOP lawmakers are still struggling to make headway on President Donald Trump’s biggest legislative priorities. House and Senate Republicans have yet to reach a deal on a budget plan that would set the framework for Trump’s legislative agenda — a source of tension ahead of a meeting Thursday between GOP senators and Trump at the White House. Republicans need to agree on how much spending to cut to offset the cost of their massive bill to fund tax cuts, border security, defense and energy policy. And they also don’t agree on when or how they’ll try to raise the debt ceiling to avoid a global economic catastrophe.

Chuck Schumer is in a real shutdown mess. Can he lead Democrats out of it?	Two days out from a government shutdown, Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats find themselves in a serious jam. But some of them are starting to hint at how they might get out of it. Publicly, the Senate minority leader and many of his fellow Democrats are vowing they won’t provide the votes to allow a House GOP funding bill to pass, while demanding a vote on a Plan B. Privately, though, Senate Democrats appear to be moving toward that potential offramp: Securing a vote on their preferred 30-day stopgap bill in exchange for helping the House bill, which funds government through September, clear the 60-vote filibuster hurdle — even if they ultimately oppose it on final passage.

The New Hampshire Democrat announced her retirement Wednesday, forcing the Democrats to defend a third Senate seat in 2026, in addition to retiring Sens.

That’s according to critics of a fiscal tactic that congressional Republicans are now seriously considering as they struggle to figure out how to deliver on all of President Donald Trump’s policy demands. Adopting the 'current policy baseline,' as it’s called, could be the only way for the GOP to make Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent and avoid painful cuts to federal programs, as well as pile on new income tax exemptions for tips, overtime and Social Security.

Paul wants the Senate to vote on an amendment that would cut foreign aid grant funding by 83 percent, which would enact the reductions Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the president’s Department of Government Efficiency are already making.

Senate Democrats take stock of their shutdown pickle	Senate Democrats are grappling with whether or not to support a House GOP funding patch less than three days before a possible government shutdown. With 52 Republicans expected to back the House-passed stopgap, eight Democrats would need to help advance it to a final Senate vote. So far only one — Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania — has indicated he'll support it. Other key swing voters are on the fence. Sen.

'Congress will investigate the sources of these attacks and help the DOJ &amp; FBI ensure those responsible are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,' Johnson said in a post on X.

Jeanne Shaheen won’t seek reelection	New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen will not seek reelection, she announced Wednesday, becoming the third Senate Democrat to announce their retirement ahead of the midterms. Shaheen, who is 78 and was first elected to the Senate in 2008, said she made the 'difficult' decision to step aside: 'It’s just time.' 'There are urgent challenges ahead, both here at home and around the world, and while I’m not seeking reelection, believe me, I am not retiring,' Shaheen said in a video. New Hampshire will be a critical battleground in the fight over control for the Senate, but it was already a challenging map for Democrats to retake the majority even before the retirements.	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/12/new-hampshire-senate-jeanne-shaheen-00225975	2025-03-12T07:04:26-07:00	https://static.politico.com/a3/44/33f2575f45ecb7d378af01c6dcbf/ap24296719313805.jpg
Pro-Palestinian groups have more demands for Democrats	Democrats still have a Gaza problem four months after Kamala Harris' loss. A quartet of progressive advocacy groups are asking the Demcocratic National Committee in a new letter to better engage with pro-Palestinian voters, according to a copy shared with POLITICO — a sign that the party’s rift over the Israel-Hamas war could stretch into the midterms.

Capitol agenda: Johnson puts Senate Dems in a corner	House Republicans passed their stopgap funding bill Tuesday evening, which means Senate Democrats can now no longer delay their long-dreaded decision: Do they give up a chance to stand up to Donald Trump or let the government shut down in three days? Democrats plan to huddle around lunchtime to try and hash out their strategy for confronting the government funding fight. They have already held one 'vigorous discussion,' and even the chattiest senators emerged from their Tuesday meeting tight-lipped about their strategy.

Mike Johnson gets candid about Elon Musk	Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday gave his most candid assessment yet of billionaire Elon Musk's influence in Congress and the potential threat he poses to legislative dealmaking: 'He can blow the whole thing up.' Johnson, during a fireside chat at Georgetown University's Psaros Center, described his work as speaker as managing a 'giant control panel' with dials for his GOP members, one for President Donald Trump and one for Musk.

Democrats divided over the arrest of Palestinian student for his role in Columbia protests	Democrats are deeply conflicted over the Trump administration’s arrest of a Palestinian graduate student at Columbia University who faces deportation for his prominent role in campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war. Senate and House Democrats have condemned the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil as a violation of his First Amendment rights to protest — but have tempered their criticism to avoid supporting campus protests that at times featured harassment and assault of Jewish students. They are also being careful to condemn Hamas, which attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250, and prompting an Israeli response that has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths in Gaza, including many civilians.

Johnson and Thune hash out future of GOP agenda	Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune met on Tuesday and discussed the sweeping domestic policy legislation at the top of their 2025 agenda. The closed-door conversation came as the House and Senate struggle to quickly get on the same page as they try to pass President Donald Trump's tax, energy and border priorities into law. Thune separately convened a meeting of GOP senators Tuesday to discuss the legislation. 'Both of us understand we've got to get this done. We're trying to figure out the best way to do that,' Thune said after the meeting with Johnson, part of a regular series of meetings between the two leaders.

Why Thomas Massie isn’t worried about Trump’s primary threats	President Donald Trump has long been able to bend Republican lawmakers to his will with a single online post. The mere hint of a threat that he might announce a member 'SHOULD BE PRIMARIED' is enough to bring most GOP members into line. Not Rep. Thomas Massie. The 54-year-old former robotics engineer brushed aside that precise threat from Trump Monday night, even with the president vowing to 'lead the charge' against him after Massie made clear that he would not vote for the Trump-blessed spending bill pushed by House Republican leaders. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Massie met the threat with a bemused shrug and a well-practiced joke about the situation: 'He’s going after Canada and me today. ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/11/thomas-massie-trump-primary-spending-00225423	2025-03-11T15:57:06-07:00	https://static.politico.com/f4/13/b843f25840218d6cb2bae34d0e4a/u-s-congress-89509.jpg
With push from Trump, Republicans finally unite on spending	One principle has long underpinned funding negotiations on Capitol Hill: House Republicans can’t pass a spending bill without Democratic votes. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson finally quashed that assumption. It took an all-out lobbying blitz that involved promises of future spending cuts, a scattering of presidential threats and 11th-hour policy concessions involving tariffs and visas for Afghan refugees. But in a 217-213 vote, the House passed a seven-month funding patch without needing a single Democrat.

Trump taps Eric Ueland for key role at OMB	President Donald Trump has tapped Eric Ueland, a veteran Senate and White House aide, to a key post at the Office of Management and Budget. Ueland has been nominated to serve as deputy director for management at the White House budget office, a high ranking role that would have him serving directly under OMB Director Russ Vought. He is already a familiar face to many lawmakers and staffers on Capitol Hill in his former capacity as legislative affairs director during the first Trump administration. Ueland also was a key fixture in the Senate during negotiations on the massive, $2 trillion pandemic relief package enacted in March 2020. That was a major legislative effort under budget reconciliation, a process he’d likely be deeply involved with again in the coming months if confirmed at OMB....	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/11/congress/trump-taps-eric-ueland-for-key-role-at-omb-00224628	2025-03-11T12:57:49-07:00

In a Truth Social post Tuesday, Trump labels Massie as a 'Congressman' and a grandstander. It follows a message Monday where Trump suggested Massie should be primaried — saying he would 'lead the charge' against Massie in the upcoming midterm election and comparing the Kentucky Republican to former Rep. Liz Cheney. 'He additionally voted to delay the current Budget Disaster from the Biden Administration to the Trump Administration.

House GOP one step closer to passing stopgap funding bill	The House GOP’s seven-month stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown is one step closer to passage. Republicans stayed mostly united on a test vote on the measure Tuesday afternoon, paving the way for a vote on final passage later in the day — just three days before the deadline to prevent a lapse in federal funding. The 216-214 vote bodes well for Speaker Mike Johnson, who can’t, in his razor-thin majority, afford more than a couple GOP defections on a bill that isn’t expected to garner much, if any, Democratic support.

House Republicans move to block vote on Trump’s tariffs	House Republicans are moving to block Democrats from forcing a vote on President Donald Trump’s controversial tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. GOP leadership slipped language into a House rule on their stopgap funding bill that would prevent any member of Congress from bringing up a resolution terminating Trump’s declaration of a national emergency over fentanyl and undocumented immigrants entering the U.S. The president has used that emergency declaration to justify his tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.

Vance emphasized that Republicans had little room for dissent given the tight margin in the House. Government funding is set to expire at midnight Friday, and a handful of GOP members have yet to commit to the stopgap put forward by Speaker Mike Johnson and endorsed by President Donald Trump.

Tony Gonzales, Tim Burchett, Cory Mills, Rich McCormick, Beth Van Duyne, Kat Cammack, Andy Ogles and Brian Fitzpatrick. This group seems more open than Massie to backing the funding patch that would avert a shutdown that could kick in Saturday. Gonzales has repeated he will make a 'game-time decision.'

The tax writers were for the most part tight-lipped on what they discussed as they exited the all-day session at the Jefferson building of the Library of Congress. But committee members indicated that it was a productive discussion about the framework for a large bill that would enact President Donald Trump’s tax agenda, which would include an extension of trillions of dollars in expiring tax cuts.

But GOP leaders have so far shown no interest in the bipartisan talks and are now seeking to push through a seven-month extension.

House Republicans are pushing a not-so-clean spending patch through September that would add billions of dollars for deportations, veterans’ health care and the military — and cut $13 billion in funding for non-defense programs. The speaker is planning to put the stopgap, known as a continuing resolution or a CR, on the floor Tuesday, and then send members home for recess before the Senate can send back any changes. Johnson is hoping to get the CR through the House with...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/10/congress/johnson-shutdown-schumer-congress-00220158	2025-03-10T05:00:00-07:00	
Frustrated Dems unleash the F-bombs	When Rep. Jasmine Crockett reacted to President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress on Tuesday evening, profanity leaped effortlessly from her lips: 'Somebody slap me and wake me the fuck up because I’m ready to get on with it.' Just a few days earlier, when asked of her message to Elon Musk, she told him to 'Fuck off.' Ken Martin, the new chair of the Democratic National Committee, took a more Midwestern approach: 'Go to hell,' he said, adding later on X: 'I said what I said.'

Funding bill skips measure to avert physician pay cuts, a blow to GOP Doctors Caucus	The funding bill House Republican leaders released on Saturday does not avert cuts for doctors who treat Medicare patients — a blow to Republicans who had pushed for the changes that also could risk alienating members whose support will be needed to pass the legislation. Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.), who co-chairs the GOP Doctors’ Caucus, said in recent months that Republican leadership was open to including the policy in the bill to keep the government funded through September, and that Trump administration officials had assured it would be addressed. Five health industry lobbyists, granted anonymity to share d...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/08/funding-bill-skips-doctor-pay-fix-00219862	2025-03-08T12:31:56-08:00	https://static.politico.com/34/10/f4802ba147fab72b7a40588c4ea2/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1733699760
GOP funding patch boosts defense and deportations, cuts other programs	A seven-month funding patch released by House Republicans Saturday would add billions of dollars in spending for deportations, veterans’ health care and the military while cutting an even greater amount of funding for non-defense programs. The measure, crafted by Speaker Mike Johnson in coordination with the White House, reflects President Donald Trump’s top policy priorities and heightens a confrontation with Democrats ahead of a Friday midnight shutdown deadline. House Democratic leaders have already declared themselves firmly opposed to the GOP-written stopgap. They spent weeks trading offers with Republicans to clinch a bipartisan government funding deal before House GOP leaders decided to...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/08/gop-funding-patch-boosts-defense-and-deportations-cuts-other-programs-00219797	2025-03-08T09:20:21-08:00	https://static.politico.com/8e/84/d582d2bc43db84feaf5fd316aa81/u-s-congress-14376.jpg

Johnson defends Musk, says essential veteran jobs ‘will come back’	Speaker Mike Johnson is throwing his support behind Elon Musk following President Donald Trump’s tense closed-door meeting with his Cabinet, saying that the role of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is going through a 'recalibration' and that Musk will correct his mistakes along the way. 'I think the president kind of did a recalibration yesterday. He brought in Elon and he brought in the Cabinet secretaries, and they had a dialogue about the process, to formalize more of this,' Johnson said in an interview Friday on Fox News. When asked about his message to fired veterans across the country growing angry at Republicans over DOGE’s move fast and break things approach, Johnson said 'we ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/07/congress/mike-johnson-elon-musk-doge-00218308	2025-03-07T11:31:33-08:00	
NRCC deletes post calling Espaillat an 'illegal immigrant'	The House GOP's campaign arm deleted a post on X calling Rep. Adriano Espaillat of New York an 'illegal immigrant,' following a backlash on social media and strong condemnation from Espaillat's fellow Democrats. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which Espaillat chairs, said the quiet deletion wasn't enough, writing on X: 'You can't sweep this under the rug. We demand a retraction and an apology, not a mulligan.' 'Reminder: Even if they pulled down the tweet, Republicans said it loud and clear. No matter what you do, no matter what the laws of the United States of America dictate, to them you are and will always be just another 'illegal immigrant,'' the post added.

Johnson ‘looking at’ taking Green off committee	Speaker Mike Johnson stopped short of supporting a hard-right push to remove Rep. Al Green from his committee assignment over the Texas Democrat's singing protest following his censure Thursday. After the House voted to censure Green over his outburst during President Donald Trump’s address to Congress on Tuesday, Green and several other House Democrats sang 'We Shall Overcome' in the well of the House, forcing Johnson to recess the House and skip the traditional reading of the reprimand.

Capitol agenda: Senate Dems' shutdown test	Senate Democrats are running out of time to decide whether fighting President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s funding freezes is worth forcing a government shutdown. Assuming House Republicans can successfully pass the six-month spending patch they plan to put on the floor next week, GOP senators will need help from at least eight Democrats to get a House-passed stopgap bill through the other chamber. And they could need more if other Republicans join Sen. Rand Paul in opposition. Right now, Republicans have one Democrat committed: Sen. John Fetterman, who said Thursday that he’ll 'never' be part of shutting the government down. He said it was 'bullshit' that Democrats 'would even rattle those sabers.' Sen. Dick Durbin, the chamber’s No. 2 Democrat, said Thursday that he didn’t believe enough...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/07/congress/senate-democrats-shutdown-test-00217202	2025-03-07T05:00:00-08:00	
Kamala Harris gets serious about whether to run for California governor	Former Vice President Kamala Harris is seriously considering a run for governor of California — and has given herself a deadline to decide. At a pre-Oscars party last weekend, Harris was asked by another partygoer when she would make a decision about jumping into the California governor’s race. She gave a definitive answer, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation: the end of the summer. And in calls to supporters, allies and trusted aides in recent weeks, Harris has made clear that she plans to make a decision in a few months. Harris’ timeline, reported here first, is the clearest indication to date that she may enter the race to succeed the termed-out Gavin Newsom in the Golden State. And, allies said, a win would almost certainly take a 2028 presidential run — which Ha...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/07/kamala-harris-california-governor-decision-deadline-00216737	2025-03-07T02:55:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/f4/e4/7e5cdafb4752a1df59eb141b6f31/56th-naacp-image-awards-show-31383.jpg

Senate Democrats' impending choice: Shutdown or surrender	Senate Democrats have a fast-approaching dilemma: Vote for a spending bill unilaterally drafted by House Republicans or engage in the kind of shutdown brinkmanship they’ve long opposed. It isn’t a decision they’ll be able to put off for much longer. House GOP leaders are poised early next week to send a bill to the floor that would largely hold current spending levels in place through the end of September. Democrats don’t like this approach, arguing it would only further empower President Donald Trump and Elon Musk to continue to act beyond their authority in clawing back congressionally approved dollars. In the House, Democrats are vowing to hold back support, arguing tha...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/07/senate-democrats-shutdown-decision-00217178	2025-03-07T01:45:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/c2/44/98d60ea94f2a9ecb2307ccbb7c6a/u-s-congress-63409.jpg
House GOP stopgap funding bill expected to avert pay cuts to doctors, extend telehealth access	A stopgap measure to keep the government funded through the end of September is expected to include measures to avert cuts in pay for doctors treating Medicare patients and extend eased Medicare telehealth rules, according to five industry lobbyists granted anonymity to share details of private negotiations. The health measures to be incorporated into the spending patch next week — necessary to avoid a shutdown after March 14 — are expected to be relatively narrow. Still, Speaker Mike Johnson has been promising to move a 'clean' continuing resolution that would fund government programs at current levels through the end of the current fiscal year. Any new provisions could be viewed with scrutiny by members of the razor-thin House GOP majority. Rep.

Veterans cuts spark GOP backlash on Capitol Hill	As President Donald Trump and Elon Musk lay waste to scores of federal programs and the careers of thousands of government workers, Republicans on Capitol Hill have mostly kept their objections to themselves — with one big exception. Military veterans have been disproportionately affected by the administration’s early cuts, and GOP lawmakers have unleashed a rare tide of public pushback. That reached a crescendo this week as the Trump administration raises the possibility of large-scale dismissals of Veterans Administration employees. Mass firings at the VA began weeks ago, spurring a flurry of panicked calls from GOP lawmakers to the White House. But a new memo outlines the potentia...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/06/veterans-cuts-backlash-republicans-doge-00216726	2025-03-06T14:09:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/fa/57/d386748546d6b21ce3e7b71bc428/congress-ukraine-74978.jpg

Within hours of the California governor condemning trans athletes playing in female sports — shocking his party in his home state — some Democrats unloaded on the likely presidential contender. 'It’s disgusting,' said Lori Lightfoot, the former Chicago mayor. 'There are kids waking up today in California with this news thinking that their governor hates them, and rightly so.' Rep.

Chavez-DeRemer on verge of confirmation to run Labor Department	Lori Chavez-DeRemer’s bid to lead the Labor Department cleared a key procedural hurdle on Thursday — the last major step before a confirmation vote on the Senate floor. The Senate voted 66-30 to end debate on the former GOP representative's nomination to serve as President Donald Trump’s Labor secretary, one week after she advanced out of the Senate HELP Committee with bipartisan support. Though her confirmation has not been as contentious as other high-profile Trump administration officials, Chavez-DeRemer will be the last Cabinet secretary to arrive. Still, she's already attended a recent Cabinet meeting at the White House and Trump’s joint address to Congress this week.

Jim Jordan continues subpoena spree of social media platforms	House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan sent a subpoena to Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, on Thursday, requesting communications between the company and the executive branch as well as internal company communications. The move to go after Alphabet is the next step in Jordan's yearslong crusade to go after social media platforms for what he says constitutes suppression of conservative speech. After Meta adjusted its own policies in January to respond to concerns from conservatives, Jordan has set his sights on a new target, accusing Alphabet of coordinating with the Biden administration to censure users.

Al Green censured for joint session outburst	The House voted 224-198 Thursday to censure Rep. Al Green for disrupting President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress this week. Green shouted at Trump during the Tuesday night address and was ordered removed from the House chamber by Speaker Mike Johnson, prompting a flurry of GOP efforts to punish him for the disruption. The censure measure was introduced and called up by Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) through a fast-track process allowing for quick consideration on the House floor. Democratic leaders didn’t formally whip against the measure, and 10 Democrats voted with all Republicans in support of the censure. Typically a censured member is immediately made to stand in the well of the House to formally receive punishment. But Green and more than a dozen colleagues stood in the well ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/06/congress/al-green-censured-sotu-00215582	2025-03-06T07:46:05-08:00
