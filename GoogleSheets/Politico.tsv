House Ethics Committee closes investigations into 4 members	The House Ethics Committee closed investigations into at least four members Monday for violating campaign finance rules. The investigations involved Reps. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.), Wesley Hunt (R-Tex.), Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.), Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.) and 'other confidential matters that have been under review.' The committee declined to disclose further details on those cases. The House panel found that, in at least some of those cases, 'evidence that the Member‚Äôs campaign did not fully comply with the applicable standards relating to personal use of campaign funds, as well as reporting or recordkeeping requirements for campaign expenditures.' But the Ethics Committee did not find that misuse was intentional and unanimously decided to close the cases, declining to take further action.

Whitehouse calls for ‚Äòwar machine‚Äô to spar against GOP as DNC chair election looms	Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is calling for DNC delegates to consider how the Democratic Party‚Äôs infrastructure can support a 'war machine' to lead attacks against Republicans. The letter to state party chairs ahead of the DNC chair election, shared first with POLITICO, comes as Democrats scramble to figure out how to move forward after nationwide losses at the polls in November. Party leaders have bemoaned Democrats‚Äô inability to define their own identity and push back against Republican attacks. Whitehouse argued that Democrats have no institutional and centralized setup to attack the GOP, writing Republicans 'rapidly and effectively deploy false narratives, while we struggle to bring true ones to bear.'

Carter to lie in state at the Capitol	Former President Jimmy Carter will lie in state in the U.S. Capitol's rotunda at the invitation of congressional leaders, the Carter Center announced Monday. The memorial services and honors for the former president are expected to span several days and include public events in Atlanta and Washington, followed by a private burial ceremony in his hometown of Plains, Georgia. Days for public viewing of Carter‚Äôs casket at the Capitol have not been announced, but the Carter Center confirmed that plans are underway. President Joe Biden has already announced a proclamation declaring a national day of mourning on Jan. 9, which could coincide with lying in state or the large public funeral service expected in Washi...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/30/congress/jimmy-carter-capitol-honor-lying-in-state-funeral-00196127	2024-12-30T10:34:45-08:00	
Meet new the members: Back to Washington ‚Äî nearly 30 years later	The new member: Rep.-elect Cleo Fields (D-La.) How they got here: Fields won his return to Congress after defeating Republican Elbert Guillory and Democrat Quentin Anderson. He notched nearly 51 percent of the vote. Inside the campaign: The race for the seat began in earnest when Republican Gov. Jeff Landry agreed to redraw the state‚Äôs congressional map to create a second majority-minority district. The resulting seat, which includes much of Baton Rouge, Shreveport and Lafayette, forced out incumbent Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.). The issues he‚Äôll focus on: Fields is no stranger to Washington, having served two terms in the House in the 1990s.

Happy New Year, the debt limit is here. Get ready for an all-out war over it.	GOP leaders are staring down two bad options to solve President-elect Donald Trump's debt-limit problem, after failing to execute his demand to lift the federal borrowing cap in the last government funding bill. One path requires full buy-in from Republican lawmakers to address the issue via budget reconciliation ‚Äî a huge challenge thanks to the party‚Äôs fierce fiscal hawks. The other entails winning over Democrats, who for the most part rejected Trump‚Äôs initial debt-limit gambit last week.

Tributes pour in for Jimmy Carter	Former President Jimmy Carter‚Äôs death on Sunday prompted an outpouring of tributes from fellow presidents and politicians. 'Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what‚Äôs extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well,' President Joe Biden said in a statement with first lady Jill Biden.

Former President Jimmy Carter dead at 100	Jimmy Carter had such confidence in his improbable path to the White House that he bet Americans worn down by Vietnam and Watergate would welcome a new kind of president: a peanut farmer who carried his own bags, worried about the heating bill and told it, more or less, like it was. And for a time, the voters embraced him. Yet just four years later, in the aftermath of a presidency that was widely seen as failed, it sometimes seemed as if all that was left of Carter was the smile ‚Äî the wide, toothy grin that helped elect him in the first place, then came to be caricatured by countless cartoonists as an emblem of na√Øvet√©.

Eric Schmitt, Ro Khanna voice support for H-1B visa reform, as GOP clashes over immigration	A Silicon Valley Democrat and a Republican Senator are calling for reform to the H-1B Visa program, which tech companies use to recruit thousands of high-skilled foreign workers every year. 'So I think the solution here, President Trump has actually articulated this in 2020, is to reform that system and get rid of the abuses, make it merit-based, and make sure that we're not undercutting wages, and having Americans train their foreign replacements,' Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) told 'Fox News Sunday' anchor Shannon Bream.

Mike Duggan, the longtime Democratic mayor of Detroit, is pursuing an independent campaign for governor in the wake of Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in his state. Democratic strategists are studying this year‚Äôs bid by independent Dan Osborn, who as a Senate candidate in Nebraska overperformed the top of the ticket, as a model to win the upper chamber.

'Treasury currently expects to reach the new limit between January 14 and January 23, at which time it will be necessary for Treasury to start taking extraordinary measures,' Yellen wrote in a letter to congressional leadership.

Former FBI and CIA head prods Senate to reject Patel, Gabbard	A former head of the FBI and CIA is raising objections over whether Kash Patel and Tulsi Gabbard, President-elect Donald Trump's picks to be directors of the FBI and national intelligence, respectively, are qualified to serve in the Cabinet. In a letter to senators on Thursday, William Webster, the only person to lead both the FBI and CIA, wrote that neither nominee meets the demands of top intelligence jobs. Webster, who is 100 years old, praised Patel's patriotism but wrote that his allegiance to Trump was concerning.

Inside how the Capitol Police has changed since Jan. 6, 2021	As Congress prepares to certify another election on Jan. 6, the U.S. Capitol Police looks like a vastly different agency than it was ahead of the attack on the Capitol four years ago. Security officials on the Hill were widely excoriated for the lack of preparedness ahead of the attempted insurrection, prompting multiple high-level resignations in the following weeks. An oft-repeated criticism was that officials should have requested help prior to the attack, given clear signals that there would be a huge protest coming to the area with the potential to turn violent. Those issues coincided with a steep increase in violent threats made against members of Congress.

Conservatives hope to enlist Trump in their spending war. It won‚Äôt be that easy.	Conservatives who want to slash the federal budget are hoping they can enlist President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk to their side come January. But last week‚Äôs meltdown over government funding underscored that Trump doesn't always share their fiscal restraint. Though Trump and Musk helped upend an initial bipartisan appropriations deal loathed by fiscal hardliners, 38 House Republicans later balked at Trump‚Äôs big demand in the next bill: a looser limit on Washington‚Äôs borrowing authority.

Ethics report alleges Gaetz paid 17-year-old for sex	A yearslong House Ethics Committee investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz found 'substantial evidence' that the Florida Republican committed statutory rape, solicited prostitutes and used illegal drugs, according to a copy of the report obtained by POLITICO. The report's most explosive allegation, which Gaetz has long denied, is that he had sex twice with a 17-year-old girl at a party in July 2017, when he was 35 and serving in the House. Ethics Committee investigators found that he later paid the girl ‚Äî part of a trend laid out in the report of him paying women after sexual encounters.

Musk vows to fund ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô Democratic primary challengers	Elon Musk said he‚Äôll be funding moderate primary challengers to incumbent Democrats in deep-blue seats around the country, as he continues to try to influence a wide swath of government. 'Forgot to mention that I‚Äôm also going to be funding moderate candidates in heavily Democrat districts, so that the country can get rid of those who don‚Äôt represent them, like this jackass,' the billionaire tech mogul said in a post on X in response to a video clip of Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee. Neal is an odd choice for Musk ‚Äî a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump ‚Äî to single out.

Johnson moves forward on spending Plan C: Breaking up the bills	Speaker Mike Johnson has moved on to a Plan C to avert a government shutdown: Breaking up each piece to pass them separately. Under the House GOP‚Äôs latest plan, Republicans will try to pass three separate bills: stopgap funding legislation with a one-year farm bill extension, money for recent natural disasters and aid for farmers, according to two people with direct knowledge of negotiations. A shutdown deadline is now about 12 hours away. The new plan will test his ability to wrangle his conference. Members believe Johnson is taking the proposal through the Rules Committee, trying to pass it through regular order so it only requires a simple majority on the House floor. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), who is on the panel, said that he will back the plan, meaning it should have enough support ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/20/congress/third-spending-plan-attempt-00195611	2024-12-20T08:35:39-08:00

Trump transfers $4B stake in Truth Social parent company into a trust	President-elect Donald Trump has put his $4 billion stake in the parent company of his social media platform Truth Social into a trust controlled by one of his sons, according to a regulatory filing late Thursday. The billionaire's nearly 115 million shares in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group were transferred to the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust on Dec. 17 as 'a bona fide gift,' the filing said.

Dozens of Republicans broke with Trump. Are primary challenges next?	Republicans broke with Donald Trump. Now primary threats could be in the offing. Dozens of House Republicans voted against a bill pushed by the president-elect to temporarily fund the government Thursday night, even after Trump promised retribution to those who crossed him. The list of 38 Republicans opposed to the measure ranged from conservatives called out by name by the president-elect ‚Äî like Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) ‚Äî to less visible agitators like Republican Reps. Aaron Bean (Fla.), Russ Fulcher (Idaho) and Wesley Hunt (Texas). 'I‚Äôm happy to take the fire,' Roy told POLITICO Thursday evening. 'I understand why the president wants the debt ceiling off the table, I support him.

Trump says any shutdown ‚Äòis a Biden problem to solve‚Äô	President-elect Donald Trump worked Friday morning to foist the blame for any potential government shutdown onto the current White House, insisting that the funding fight on Capitol Hill 'is a Biden problem to solve.' Lawmakers had seemed on track earlier this week to fund the government with time to spare, settling on a bipartisan stopgap spending bill, known as a continuing resolution or CR, that would extend government spending into March and included a lot of add-ons to appease Democrats and others. But that plan quickly drew the ire of Trump ally Elon Musk, followed by the president-elect and Vice President-elect JD Vance, tanking that bill. Still, with government funding set to run out at midnight on Friday, Trump insisted that it is President Joe Biden who should be held responsible...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/20/trump-shutdown-biden-problem-00195574	2024-12-20T06:23:36-08:00	https://static.politico.com/5e/02/0597ce5f4dda9f7557b0540db599/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2179648755

Johnson prepares to put forward another spending plan	Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that the House will vote on a government funding bill on Friday morning. 'We‚Äôre expecting votes this morning. So y‚Äôall stay tuned. We‚Äôve got a plan,' he said. Asked if they had reached a new agreement, he added: 'We‚Äôll see.' While no decision has been made, multiple members say there are discussions about passing a short-term stopgap that would only punt funding into mid-January. That would avert a shutdown and allow lawmakers to go home for the holidays, though they'd return to the same problems in the new year. The discussions around a short-term funding patch option include moving a separate disaster aid package, similar if not the exact same, as the $110 billion one Republicans negotiated with Democrats in the original stopgap agreement, according to...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/20/congress/johnson-says-house-will-vote-soon-00195572	2024-12-20T05:18:00-08:00

Johnson on shaky ground with Trump after spending fiasco	The collapse of Speaker Mike Johnson‚Äôs spending plan illustrates a painful lesson that other politicians have already learned: Absolute loyalty to Donald Trump is a one-way street. As the U.S. teeters on the edge of a government shutdown, bitterly divided Republicans are struggling to find a way forward and Johnson‚Äôs hold on his job is in Trump‚Äôs mercurial hands. Multiple House conservatives, as well as Trump advisers and other people close to the incoming president, indicate Johnson‚Äôs hold on the speakership is far from stable just as Republicans are about to take control of the House, Senate and White House. One Trump adviser, granted anonymity to speak candidly, said Johnson could salvage the relationship by 'doing what Trump wants.'

Typically a little noticed and relatively drama-free affair, hiring at the National Republican Senatorial Committee and its allied GOP super PAC Senate Leadership Fund has devolved in recent weeks into bickering over whether prospective new leaders are sufficiently loyal to Trump and the movement he created.

Trump-backed funding bill fails as government shutdown looms	A bill to avert a government shutdown failed on the House floor Thursday night, after Democrats and conservatives rebelled against Speaker Mike Johnson‚Äôs new Donald Trump-backed spending plan. The measure went down decisively, 174-235, failing to meet a two-thirds bar for passage under a fast-track procedure, as 38 Republicans joined 197 Democrats to tank the bill. Two Democrats voted for the bill, and one voted present. With government funding set to expire at midnight Friday, Elon Musk and Trump lured Congress into a power struggle, demanding that Johnson abandon the bipartisan accord he struck with top Democrats this week and instead craft a bill favored by Republicans. By defeating that Trump-backed alternative, Democrats demonstrated that they won‚Äôt help him pass bills if they don‚Äôt h...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/19/congress/government-shutdown-house-vote-00195479	2024-12-19T16:00:31-08:00	
Top GOP pollster fired after financial mismanagement allegations	Chris Wilson, the founder and CEO of top Republican polling firm WPA Intelligence, was fired after company audits found he likely used firm money to pay for personal expenses, according to two people directly familiar with the matter.

The Trump-Musk governing duo is clearly a work in progress	As Elon Musk unleashed a volley of X posts demanding that Republicans back away from a deal to avert a government shutdown, Donald Trump was publicly silent. Instead, the president-elect holed up in his office Wednesday in a ballroom above Mar-a-Lago. While Musk riled up the MAGA masses, Trump was holding a series of conversations with top aides ‚Äî including Susie Wiles and Stephen Miller ‚Äî as Vice President-elect JD Vance privately expressed Trump‚Äôs concerns about the bill on Capitol Hill, according to two people granted anonymity to discuss the matter freely.

Shutdown blame game engulfs Capitol as hopes to avert shutdown fade	The shutdown blame game has already begun on Capitol Hill, a telltale sign that lawmakers don‚Äôt expect they can clear a funding plan before the Friday night deadline. Republicans‚Äô revamped attempt at a stopgap spending bill is headed to the House floor Thursday evening but it‚Äôs almost certainly doomed, given it needs to meet a two-thirds threshold to pass the chamber and Democrats have vocally opposed it. Democrats have already dubbed it the Elon Musk shutdown, given the billionaire publicly excoriated the original bipartisan spending deal and helped tank it on Wednesday.

The complaint? That Uncle Sam was spending like a drunken sailor and needed to tighten the purse strings quickly. But then Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance dumped gasoline on the fire.

Johnson has 3 main options to avert a shutdown. None of them are looking good.	Mike Johnson‚Äôs in a terrible spot, with a government shutdown deadline looming in less than 48 hours and no obvious way out. Conservatives are furious, rank-and-file members are exasperated, and President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to primary his members and taking blatant shots at his speakership. After spending weeks negotiating a stopgap spending bill with several add-ons, Trump and others all but killed Johnson‚Äôs deal on Wednesday.

Top lawmakers unveil ‚ÄòChristmas-tree‚Äô funding bill with $100B for disasters	Congressional leaders released bill text Tuesday night that would fund the federal government into March, hitched to more than $100 billion in disaster aid and a slew of last-ditch policy bills as lawmakers prepare to leave town for the holidays. Racing to avert a government shutdown Friday night before fleeing the Capitol until January, lawmakers have again turned their year-end funding bill into the proverbial 'Christmas tree' measure, ornamented with a variety of unrelated legislation they want to clear in the final days of the current session of Congress. That includes a bill to renew expiring health care programs, a measure to restrict U.S. investments in China and a one-year extension of the annual 'fa...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/17/congress/stopgap-spending-bill-text-out-00194959	2024-12-17T15:41:08-08:00	
House Dems solidify their anti-Trump policy chiefs	House Democrats have largely set their team for countering President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs agenda next year. While the caucus is still making other Democratic committee heads official, they decided several contested panel leader elections Tuesday morning, with uncontested elections for leadership recommendations later in the day. House Democrats largely saw the contested races to lead Democrats on the Oversight, Agriculture and Natural Resources Committees as a check on seniority in the caucus ‚Äî and a way to instill fresher talent from the ranks. On the Natural Resources panel, Rep. Jared Huffman (Calif.) is replacing Rep. Ra√∫l...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/17/congress/house-dems-anti-trump-team-00194948	2024-12-17T14:06:36-08:00

Generational change meets its limits with Connolly's win over AOC	Rep. Gerry Connolly‚Äôs triumph over Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for the top Democratic spot on the Oversight Committee illustrates the limits of the party‚Äôs demand for generational change, with a well-established centrist beating out a progressive standard-bearer. While the victory went beyond ideology, there were simmering fears among centrists about how elevating Ocasio-Cortez, an outspoken liberal who has gone viral for her moments on the panel before, would turn out. There was also a sense that it was Connolly‚Äôs turn, after he had previously run for the Oversight spot twice and served on the panel for 15 years, according to interviews with eight Democratic lawmakers. Connolly also used his strong relationships in the centrist New Democrat Coalition, considered the largest ideological ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/17/connollys-aoc-house-democrats-generational-change-00194932	2024-12-17T13:25:58-08:00	https://static.politico.com/4d/74/9f43356c4858b283e67b7d7b367f/u-s-congress-38419.jpg
Trump eyes donor for Air Force chief	Trump donor Andrew McKenna is a leading contender for secretary of the Air Force, according to three people close to the transition.

Bush administration before jumping into the private sector, according to a biography on his firm‚Äôs website. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk about pending personnel moves.

Trump taps Brooks to lead HHS landing team	President-elect Donald Trump has tapped John Brooks to lead his HHS landing team, three people familiar with the selection granted anonymity to discuss government transition efforts told POLITICO. The elevation of Brooks, a former senior Medicare official during Trump‚Äôs first term who went on to advise former HHS Secretary Alex Azar on drug pricing policy, lends policy heft to a Trump health team that has faced scrutiny over its top nominees' lack of government experience. The landing team ‚Äî which is tasked with preparing the incoming administration to hit the ground running ‚Äî consists of several Trump allies led by Brooks, though the identities of those enlisted has been closely held within the health department, according to one of the people granted anonymity.

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) launched a bid to become the top Judiciary Committee Democrat. Connolly had shored up support among key Democratic blocs like the centrist New Democrat Coalition and had built strong relationships across the caucus during his tenure in Congress, in...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/17/congress/connolly-wins-oversight-ranking-race-democrats-house-aoc-00194795	2024-12-17T09:06:21-08:00
