Johnson tells House Republicans that Trump wants one ‘big beautiful’ reconciliation package	Speaker Mike Johnson told Republicans on Saturday that President-elect Donald Trump wants one reconciliation package, instead of the planned two that Republican leadership has been pushing, three people in the room told POLITICO. Johnson’s message came as Republicans are meeting behind closed doors at Fort McNair to map out their strategy for passing a sweeping border, tax and energy package that will be the heart of their legislative agenda. Trump wants 'one big beautiful bill,' Johnson told Republicans at the retreat, per two lawmakers. Trump’s decision is a break from Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s pitch for a two-...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/04/johnson-trump-reconciliation-package-00196487	2025-01-04T09:41:36-08:00	https://static.politico.com/0e/79/b157986a4a7f8fb06872b62a14b6/u-s-congress-90179.jpg
Schumer presses Thune for briefings on recent attacks	Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is pressing Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) for an all-senators briefing on recent dangerous events in New Orleans and Las Vegas. 'Given the severity of these incidents and the risk of further attacks and copycat actors, it is essential for the Senate to remain actively engaged in understanding the scope of the attacks and to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to address any threat posed by domestic or international terrorism,' Schumer wrote in the letter addressed to Thun...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/04/schumer-presses-thune-for-briefings-on-recent-attacks-00196480	2025-01-04T08:46:42-08:00	https://static.politico.com/b2/cd/aebc8ee9424bba43e018aee25531/u-s-congress-28737.jpg
Trump chooses Estonia-born lawyer as ambassador to the Baltic nation	President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Estonian-born lawyer Roman Pipko as his nominee for America’s next ambassador to the tiny Baltic country. The position requires Senate confirmation, and Republican control of the upper chamber should make such approval relatively easy to obtain. Still, the role could get more attention than normal because Estonia shares a border with Russia and is among the European countries most vocal about the need to defend Ukraine as it fights off a Russian invasion. Pipko has represented U.S. interests at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Russian American Enterprise Fund, according to Trump’s announcement Friday night. He’s also represented U.S. companies and negotiated projects from Europe to Africa, according to the announcement...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/trumps-estonia-pick-00196468	2025-01-03T16:37:50-08:00	
Johnson prevailed in the speakership race. His problems are just beginning.	Mike Johnson managed to avoid a drawn-out battle for the speakership on Friday. His headaches are just getting started. While Johnson ultimately secured enough votes to remain speaker on the first ballot — after two members switched their votes after further lobbying from Johnson and phone calls with President-elect Donald Trump — the aftermath of his victory made it clear that conservatives see this as a tentative truce. Hardliners said they have certain expectations for the speaker going forward, and signaled that forcing a vote to oust him is on the table if Johnson doesn’t meet them. The newly adopted rules package requires the support of nine GOP members, up from the current threshold of one, to trigger an ouster vote. 'It's always going to be there. I think our founders wanted it the...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/03/johnson-speakership-problems-beginning-00196467	2025-01-03T16:19:42-08:00	https://static.politico.com/91/1f/1983b7c143488e95498d24bf9423/u-s-congress-89872.jpg
House adopts rules package expanding Johnson’s protections	The narrowly divided House has adopted a rules package, with a vote of 215-209, that most notably will see a significantly raised threshold for members to trigger an effort to oust the speaker. Under the section-by-section analysis of the rules, it would now take nine members of the Republican conference to trigger a motion to vacate the speakership, a threshold that was just a single member when the GOP opted to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last Congress. The package’s adoption was not without its GOP critics: Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) previously objected to the inclusion of language that w...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/house-adopts-rules-johnson-protections-gop-00196461	2025-01-03T15:13:35-08:00

Trump picks a former State Department official to be deputy Middle East envoy	Donald Trump has invited former State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus to join his new administration — but he doesn't seem thrilled about it. The president-elect said Friday that he would appoint Ortagus, who was the public face of the State Department for three years in his first administration, to be deputy special presidential envoy for Middle East Peace. Trump noted in a post on Truth Social that 'early on Morgan fought me for three years, but hopefully has learned her lesson.' He didn’t provide any specifics about their disagreement. In 2016, Ortagus criticized Trump’s isolationist views, but became a vocal Trump supporter when he won the Republican nomination at the time. In a note that might not install a lot of confidence in his pick, Trump also wrote that 'these things usua...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/trumps-less-than-glowing-endorsement-00196458	2025-01-03T14:19:18-08:00	
Thune: There's not yet ‘clarity’ on whether some Trump noms have votes for confirmation	Senate Majority Leader John Thune said it's not yet clear whether President-elect Donald Trump's most contentious Cabinet nominees will have the necessary support for confirmation. When asked on CBS News' 'Face the Nation' whether Republican support may fall short for some of Trump's more debated picks, Thune replied, 'We don't have, at this point, I don't think, clarity on that.' 'We don't know all the information about some of these nominees,' Thune added. 'I think we know a lot about them, but they deserve a fair process. And that's what we've committed to and promised.' Thune noted that Trump's nominees' meetings with senators are going...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/thune-nominees-trump-senate-confirmation-00196449	2025-01-03T13:54:35-08:00	
Freedom Caucus leaders send warning to Johnson	Eleven members of the House Freedom Caucus sent a letter to their GOP colleagues outlining what they want to see from Mike Johnson after he retained the speaker's gavel Friday. The 11 members, who are on the group’s board, made clear they still have reservations about Johnson, despite ultimately supporting him after a dramatic first ballot that initially seemed to leave Johnson short of the votes needed to win the gavel. 'Speaker Johnson must prove he will not fail to enact President Trump’s bold agenda,' the group wrote in the letter. They added that they want to see Johnson put forward legislation that hits on a range of policy goals including securing the border, lowering inflation and endi...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/freedom-caucus-warning-to-johnson-00196439	2025-01-03T13:02:11-08:00	
Trump's inside-the-box pick to run tax at Treasury	President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for his point man on tax at the Treasury Department is an experienced insider whose nomination signals business will have a strong ally in the administration as it pushes through major tax legislation. Ken Kies, a leading tax lobbyist who has advocated for big corporations such as Microsoft and Hess, is widely seen as extremely knowledgeable about both the tax code and the ways of Washington, though he has also developed a reputation among some for sharp elbows and a prickly, suffer-no-fools personality. If confirmed to be assistant secretary for tax policy, Kies would have a big voice in the fight over Republicans’ expiring tax cuts, not to mention a panoply of regulatory issues — from the fate of Democrats’ 'Direct File' initiative at the IRS to the sh...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/trumps-inside-the-box-pick-to-run-tax-at-treasury-00196438	2025-01-03T13:01:03-08:00	
Trump blasts ‘giddy’ Democrats for celebrating half-staff flags at his inauguration	President-elect Donald Trump on Friday slammed Democrats for being 'giddy' that American flags are set to fly at half-mast during his inauguration in honor of the late former President Jimmy Carter. Following Carter’s death last week, President Joe Biden issued a proclamation that all U.S. flags be displayed at half-staff at the White House and public buildings for 30 days — customary for a president’s death since 1954 — which overlaps with Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. 'Nobody wants to see this, and no American can be happy about it,' Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Why two GOP holdouts flipped their votes on Johnson	Reps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self received phone calls from President-elect Donald Trump between their initial votes against Speaker Mike Johnson and their eventual flips to support him, according to two Republicans who were granted anonymity to speak candidly. But most notably, the pair and other holdouts secured general commitments from Johnson and other Republicans about the GOP conference working more collaboratively, the two Republicans said. 'His one-on-one calls weren’t what got it done,' one of the Republicans said, referring to the Trump calls. A handful of Republicans repeated the same sentiment. Self confirmed that he spoke to Trump multiple times, calling it 'lively.' But he added that they have the same agenda. He also said that he and Norman wanted transparency on the budget ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/why-norman-and-self-flipped-00196423	2025-01-03T12:12:08-08:00	
House GOP aims to start setting budget targets for tax and other policies Saturday	House Republicans are hoping to start work on the budget targets for critical committees on Saturday — the first step in kicking off their ambitious legislative agenda involving energy, border and tax policy. 'The Ways and Means Committee is just going to be able to draft tax legislation according to what the budget reconciliation instructions are,' said House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.), who will be leading the charge on extensions of President-elect Donald Trump’s tax cuts. 'And so when the conference figures out what they want in those instructions, we’ll be able to deliver according to those parameters,' said Smith, when asked about the primary goal of a GOP conference meeting tentatively scheduled for Saturday at Fort McNair, an Army post in Southwest Washington.

Initial Norman holdout on speaker vote leads to GOP ire	Before the Freedom Caucus member switched his vote, conservatives lined up to criticize Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) after he originally opposed Mike Johnson on the first ballot for speaker. 'I have a team of 90 political operatives i’m ready to put to work to take out Ralph Norman and I know every inch of the district like the back of my hand. He doesn’t support MAGA and he’s an embarrassment to South Carolina,' wrote Wesley Donehue, a veteran South Carolina GOP strategist, in an X post. That prompted Mick Mulvaney, a former chief of staff to President-elect Donald Trump who represented the district before Norman, to reply: 'I might know a little about SC5. How can I help?' Norman, along with GOP Reps. Tho...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/norman-ire-speaker-vote-johnson-gop-00196418	2025-01-03T11:45:23-08:00	
Johnson reclaims speakership	In a surprising move, Mike Johnson managed to tamp down a conservative rebellion and secured the support to remain speaker on the first ballot Friday, after two Republicans who initially opposed him flipped their votes. After a long break, Reps. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) and Keith Self (R-Texas) switched their votes to Johnson after initially backing others for the top House job. It’s a major boon for Republican vows to swiftly implement President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda. Trump weighed in repeatedly in Johnson’s favor as the contest pla...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/03/mike-johnson-elected-house-speaker-00196411	2025-01-03T11:39:21-08:00	https://static.politico.com/8c/1c/64cce670407da135f6d5b7b24a97/u-s-congress-52109.jpg
Johnson fails to reclaim speakership on first ballot	Mike Johnson came up short in his bid to remain speaker on the first ballot, but his allies are optimistic they can flip some of the three GOP votes against him in subsequent ballots. 'I’m confident when you go to bed tonight, we will know who the next speaker is, and I'm confident that that speaker will be Mike Johnson,' said Rep. Mike Flood (R-Neb.). 'There’s an active effort to get this wrapped up today,' he added. Reps. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Keith Self (R-Texas) voted against Johnson in the alphabetical roll call vote. Johnson can only afford to have one Republican vote for someone else and still reclaim the gavel, meaning he needs to flip at least two of those members in su...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/03/mike-johnson-to-fail-first-house-speaker-vote-00196387	2025-01-03T10:25:35-08:00	https://static.politico.com/54/5c/2c263c3a49b6b50766e439fea1d4/u-s-congress-34226.jpg
Johnson commits to working with Musk, Ramaswamy on spending cuts ahead of speakership vote	Speaker Mike Johnson committed to a number of new steps aimed at reining in the size and scope of the federal government as he seeks to round up the votes to retain his gavel. In a post on the social media site X just minutes before a speakership vote is set to begin, Johnson said he’d create 'a working group comprised of independent experts' to work with the so-called Department Of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy; review existing audits of federal agencies and instruct House committees to 'undertake aggressive authorizations and appropriations reviews.'

Centrists warn Johnson not to cut deals with conservatives to get the speakership	House centrists are warning Speaker Mike Johnson to not cut side deals with conservatives to win the gavel. The verbal red flag comes as Johnson is heading toward a showdown over keeping his speakership, with a vote set to begin shortly after noon. He doesn’t appear to have the votes to secure it on the first ballot, as one Republican vows to oppose him and about a dozen others are publicly undecided. Johnson’s right flank is making several demands, including seeking commitments on slashing spending. But it’s one significant ask — a bid to give Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) the Rules Committee gavel — that is sparking the biggest heartburn. Unlike most top committee spots, who gets the Rules gavel is up to the speaker alone. That powerful panel controls what party-line legislation heads to the f...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/centrists-warning-to-johnson-00196365	2025-01-03T08:55:54-08:00	
Thune: The filibuster survives under my watch	Soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader John Thune will kick off his tenure atop the chamber by committing, again, to preserving the legislative filibuster, according to excerpts of his prepared remarks obtained by POLITICO. 'One of my priorities as leader will be to ensure that the Senate stays the Senate,' Thune’s prepared remarks read. 'That means preserving the legislative filibuster — the Senate rule that today has perhaps the greatest impact in preserving the Founders’ vision of the Senate.' 'That includes empowering committees, restoring regular order, and engaging in extended debate on the Senate floor, where all members should have a chance to make their voices — and the voices of their constituents — heard,' the remarks add.

Some of Johnson's detractors think he'll still win	Some potential Republican holdouts are signaling they’re preparing for Mike Johnson to win the speaker’s gavel Friday, in a positive shift for Johnson as his speakership hangs in the balance. Some of the Louisianan's detractors have privately said that they will 'vote for Trump’s agenda,' making clear that they will either support Johnson on the first ballot or at least after the first few rounds of voting, according to three Republicans familiar with the conversations who were granted anonymity to candidly discuss them. However, key holdout Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) has not yet privately expressed that same sentiment, four Republicans similarly granted anonymity said. Rep.

Trump taps more business leaders as ambassadors	President-elect Donald Trump has selected two more wealthy business leaders for ambassadorships. He has tapped health care executive Benjamin Leon Jr. for the post in Spain and chosen entrepreneur Joe Popolo to head to the Netherlands. Both positions will require Senate confirmation, but that should not prove a major hurdle given that Republicans control the upper chamber. Leon has made his fortune in the health care industry.

Trump’s former air chief may helm EPA landing team	Former acting EPA air chief Anne Idsal Austin is a member of the Trump transition landing team at the agency — and may be leading it, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss the transition. The Texas lawyer, who also served as a regional EPA administrator early in President-elect Donald Trump’s first term, is one of several landing team member names that have been shared with EPA career staff, said the people briefed on the agency’s transition. There’s less clarity about whether she is leading the team charged with readying EPA for Trump’s second term, which begins Jan. 20. Austin’s name has been circulated for months now as a likely transition team member.

'Good luck today for Speaker Mike Johnson, a fine man of great ability, who is very close to having 100% support.

Who to watch as Johnson’s speakership hangs in the balance	Mike Johnson can likely only afford to lose a single GOP vote if he wants to remain speaker. He’s already got one Republican promising to oppose him, and about a dozen more who won’t commit to backing him. Many of those publicly undecided lawmakers have indicated they won’t reveal how they plan to vote ahead of time so, for now, it’s impossible to predict if Johnson can succeed. And while Speaker Mike Johnson said Thursday that it was his 'plan' to win on the first ballot that will commence shortly after noon on Friday, even his allies are telegraphing that it might take a few votes before he clinches it.

Johnson tries to avoid McCarthy pitfalls as he preps for a speaker showdown	Mike Johnson is trying to avoid the mistakes of his predecessor as he faces the toughest test of his political career on Friday. With his bid to keep his speakership on the line — despite support from President-elect Donald Trump — the Louisiana Republican is looking to sidestep the kinds of side deals with conservative Republicans that ultimately cost Kevin McCarthy his own political future. But that's a hard tightrope to cross. Fiscal hawks want Johnson to make commitments, including giving them greater control over how bills move to the floor and slashing spending — pledges that could be untenable for Johnson with a razor-thin GOP margin.

Buddy MacKay, a Democrat who briefly served as Florida’s governor, dead at 91	TALLAHASSEE, Florida — Former Florida Gov. Buddy MacKay, who lost to Jeb Bush in 1998 but still served 23 days in office after the sudden death of Gov. Lawton Chiles, has died. He was 91. The former Democratic governor took a nap after lunch at his home in Ocklawaha, Florida, on Tuesday and never woke up, his son Ken MacKay told The Associated Press. All of the governor’s adult children were present at the time, he said. 'It was a very peaceful end to a great life,' said MacKay, who hopes his father is remembered as a defender of Florida’s environment and an advocate for minorities. Floridians honored MacKay not just for his brief service as governor, but his time as a state legislator, congressman and diplomat. 'We mourn the passing of Buddy MacKay,' Gov.

There’s a big problem with trying to replace Johnson — no clear alternates	Even House Republicans who are skeptical about keeping Mike Johnson on as speaker acknowledge they have a persistent problem: Who could replace him? As Johnson faces potentially a dozen holdouts or more going into the speakership vote on Friday, three familiar alternative candidates have come up in internal GOP conversations: Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan of Ohio and GOP Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota. All three ran for the speakership in October 2023 before Johnson was elected to take the gavel, and all three were forced to drop their bids as it became obvious they couldn’t get the near-unanimous support needed from House Republicans.

And Johnson has signaled he's willing to make some concessions to keep the gavel, as hardliners make various demands, including top positions on the Rules Committee and commitments on spending.

How a long speaker fight could impact Trump’s ability to start his next term	If Republicans fail to elect a speaker Friday, the ensuing chaos could impact two of the most crucial moments enshrined in the Constitution: the Jan. 6 certification of the 2024 election, and — if things really go haywire — the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has endorsed Speaker Mike Johnson for another stint atop the House and has privately indicated that he doesn’t want Republicans delaying his priorities with a drawn-out speaker fight. But Johnson’s restive right flank is weighing opposing him anyway, and the House is essentially frozen until it elects a speaker. So if the election to lead the House is significantly delayed, it will have a cascading effect that could upend the transfer of power from Joe Biden to Trump in unpredictable ways. 'I don’t think Tr...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/02/congress/donald-trump-inaugurated-speaker-fight-00196284	2025-01-02T12:27:41-08:00	
Barrasso criticizes Cheney over the Presidential Citizens Award	President Joe Biden naming former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) as one of 20 recipients of the Presidential Citizens Award is already drawing backlash from her home state senator. GOP Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, in a statement, said Biden 'was either going to pardon Liz Cheney or give her an award. She doesn’t deserve either. She represents partisanship and divisiveness — not Wyoming.' Barrasso is set to become the Senate GOP whip. Biden on Thursday announced he would award Cheney, an outspoken critic of President-elect Donald Trump, and 19 others with the Presidential Citizens Award, which honors people who have performed 'exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens.' In the announcement, Biden highlighted Cheney’s role as chair and vice chair of the House Jan. 6 c...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/02/congress/liz-cheney-biden-award-00196271	2025-01-02T11:50:21-08:00	
Johnson doesn’t have the votes to remain speaker. But his allies insist it’s trending his way.	With less than 24 hours left until the start of the 119th Congress, Mike Johnson doesn’t have the votes yet to remain speaker. The Louisiana Republican has been working diligently over the past few days to lock down the 218 votes he needs, even after spending the holidays working the phones and meeting with incoming President-elect Donald Trump. But even the incoming president’s repeated endorsement earlier this week doesn’t mean Johnson is guaranteed a victory. Roughly a dozen Republicans are still on the fence, as some of them try to get concessions on the rules or commitments from Johnson on spending. There are some positive signs for the speaker. In addition to Trump’s restated backing, Johnson has managed to keep his official 'no' votes to only one so far — Rep.

House Democrats are expecting full attendance ahead of the speaker vote	House Democrats are expecting full attendance at Friday's speaker vote, as lawmakers who have faced recent health issues return to Washington for the start of the new Congress. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi posted a video on social media Thursday from her flight back to Washington, ahead of what will be her first public appearance in the Capitol since she underwent hip replacement surgery after being hospitalized last month for an injury while traveling in Luxembourg.

Man arrested after driving on grass near Capitol amid heightened concerns over vehicle attacks	The U.S. Capitol Police arrested a man who was found driving a vehicle on a sidewalk near the Capitol, according to a Thursday social media post. 'Before 10 a.m., our officers spotted a car that had been driving along the sidewalk, near Peace Circle, and into the grassy area near Third Street, NW, &amp; Constitution Avenue,' the department said in the post. 'Officers took the man into custody.' The arrest comes on the heels of a terrorist attack involving a vehicle in New Orleans that killed at least 15 people and an explosion outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas involving a Cybertruck that killed a person.

Trans rights to be marquee fight for House Republicans	Republicans’ first response to Sarah McBride's election to Congress was to ban her from using women's restrooms throughout the Capitol. But their early treatment of the first openly transgender House member is likely just a preview of how they'll navigate transgender politics and policies for the next two years. Believing voters in the 2024 elections rejected Democrats’ more inclusive positions on transgender rights, Republicans appear ready in 2025 to double down in support of executive orders and provisions in spending bills that would make it harder for transgender individuals to get health care, serve in the military or participate in school activities.

House rules would make it harder to oust speaker in next Congress	Republicans will make it harder to remove the speaker in the 119th Congress under a rules package unveiled Wednesday. The proposed rules package would require nine GOP members to back making a motion to vacate to trigger a vote on ousting the speaker. That’s an increase from the current rule, which allows any single GOP member to force a vote. The deal to increase the threshold was negotiated in November by members of the House Freedom Caucus and the small business-oriented Main Street Caucus last year — an agreement that was first reported by POLITICO. Even after a vote is triggered, it still requires the support of a majority of the House in order for a speaker to be removed.

Chris Sununu still believes the GOP is bigger than Donald Trump	Donald Trump remade the GOP in his image. Chris Sununu doesn’t think it’ll stick. That’s because the outgoing Republican governor of New Hampshire, who routinely oscillates between supporting Trump and criticizing him, believes his party is bigger than both its enduring standard bearer and the political movement he created. 'Trump is extremely unique. There's no ‘Trump lite’ or ‘Trump 2.0’ that can replace or replicate what he's brought to the table, for better or for worse,' Sununu said in an interview. And the GOP, he insists, is still a 'big tent,' ticking off varied constituencies like the Log Cabin Republicans, fiscal hawks, libertarian-leaners and social conservatives.

Trump says he would make calls for Mike Johnson	President-elect Donald Trump said he is willing to make calls to lawmakers to drum up support for Mike Johnson should there be a risk to his speakership ahead of a vote expected Friday on Capitol Hill. Speaking briefly with reporters outside of a New Year’s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect reaffirmed his support for the Louisiana Republican after his formal endorsement on Monday, saying 'he’s the one that can win right now.' The boost of support comes as Johnson’s path to retaining the speakership is tenuous. With the expected makeup of Congress on Friday, he can only have two Republican defections — and Rep.

The committee declined to disclose further details on those cases. The House panel found that, in at least some of those cases, 'evidence that the Member’s campaign did not fully comply with the applicable standards relating to personal use of campaign funds, as well as reporting or recordkeeping requirements for campaign expenditures.'

Party leaders have bemoaned Democrats’ inability to define their own identity and push back against Republican attacks.

Days for public viewing of Carter’s casket at the Capitol have not been announced, but the Carter Center confirmed that plans are underway.

Happy New Year, the debt limit is here. Get ready for an all-out war over it.	GOP leaders are staring down two bad options to solve President-elect Donald Trump's debt-limit problem, after failing to execute his demand to lift the federal borrowing cap in the last government funding bill. One path requires full buy-in from Republican lawmakers to address the issue via budget reconciliation — a huge challenge thanks to the party’s fierce fiscal hawks. The other entails winning over Democrats, who for the most part rejected Trump’s initial debt-limit gambit last week.

Former President Jimmy Carter dead at 100	Jimmy Carter had such confidence in his improbable path to the White House that he bet Americans worn down by Vietnam and Watergate would welcome a new kind of president: a peanut farmer who carried his own bags, worried about the heating bill and told it, more or less, like it was. And for a time, the voters embraced him. Yet just four years later, in the aftermath of a presidency that was widely seen as failed, it sometimes seemed as if all that was left of Carter was the smile — the wide, toothy grin that helped elect him in the first place, then came to be caricatured by countless cartoonists as an emblem of naïveté. But it was Carter’s great fortune to enjoy a post-presidency more than 10 times as long as his tenure in office — in March 2019, he became the longest-lived president ever...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/29/jimmy-carter-former-president-dead-at-100-033324	2024-12-29T13:25:18-08:00	https://static.politico.com/d0/da/4ee6068d421a995375dae1c9c618/carteroverride.jpg

Roy, the Freedom Caucus policy chair, added that Musk and Ramaswamy were working to identify spending waste, and the two businessmen could use their platforms to shine a light on the issue.

Former Freedom Caucus chair on Johnson: ‘I'm going to keep my options open’	Rep. Scott Perry said Thursday that he’s not committing to voting for Mike Johnson for speaker, adding a former Freedom Caucus chair to the conservative crowd sowing doubt over Johnson’s prospects to retake the gavel. 'I think that Mike has done an admirable job under tough conditions, but I'm going to keep my options open,' Perry (R-Pa.) said Friday morning on Fox Business. 'I want to have a conversation with Mike.' Perry’s comments come after current HFC Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) said Thursday that Republicans need to consider if current leadership 'is what we need' going into unified GOP government next year, adding that he is 'undecided...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/27/congress/perrys-take-on-johnson-speaker-gop-house-trump-harris-freedom-caucus-00196064	2024-12-27T06:36:38-08:00

Former FBI and CIA head prods Senate to reject Patel, Gabbard	A former head of the FBI and CIA is raising objections over whether Kash Patel and Tulsi Gabbard, President-elect Donald Trump's picks to be directors of the FBI and national intelligence, respectively, are qualified to serve in the Cabinet. In a letter to senators on Thursday, William Webster, the only person to lead both the FBI and CIA, wrote that neither nominee meets the demands of top intelligence jobs. Webster, who is 100 years old, praised Patel's patriotism but wrote that his allegiance to Trump was concerning. 'His record of executing the president’s directives suggest a loyalty to individuals rather than the rule of law — a dangerous precedent for an agency tasked with impartial enforcement of justice,' he said. When it came to Gabbard, Webster wrote that her 'profound lack' of ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/26/congress/tulsi-gabbard-kash-patel-fbi-cia-trump-00196055	2024-12-26T15:11:17-08:00	
Freedom Caucus chair: House GOP needs to consider if ‘current leadership is what we need’	House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris told Fox Business on Thursday that the chamber’s Republicans need to consider if current leadership 'is what we need' going into unified GOP government next year. 'Before the last couple of weeks, I was in his corner, but now we should consider what’s the best path forward,' Harris (R-Md.) said of Speaker Mike Johnson. 'We do need to consider whether — if we’re going to advance Mr. Trump’s agenda — whether the current leadership is what we need.' Harris’ comments come after he signaled last week that he was on the fence about whether or not to support Johnson during the Jan. 3 speaker vote, <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/20/johnson-unsteady-speakership-time-0...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/26/congress/freedom-caucus-chair-on-johnson-house-gop-harris-trump-00196049	2024-12-26T12:49:20-08:00	
Meet the new members: From governor to rank-and-file senator	The new member: Sen.-elect Jim Justice (R-W.Va.) How they got here: Justice, West Virginia’s sitting governor, easily defeated Democrat Glenn Elliott by more than 40 percentage points to flip control of this Senate seat for Republicans. Inside the campaign: Since announcing his Senate bid in April 2023, Justice was the heavy favorite for this key GOP flip opportunity. He easily dispatched Rep. Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.) in the GOP primary by more than 35 percentage points. Justice is termed out as governor, making the Senate a tempting opportunity. His push got even easier when longtime Sen. Joe Manchin (I) announced he would not run for reelection.

How Schumer is prepping for Trump 2.0	In less than a month, elected Democrats will find themselves with a lot less power in Washington, with a GOP-controlled House, Senate and White House resulting in a landscape in which their ability to tussle with President-elect Donald Trump will be largely rhetorical. But if Dem leaders have learned one thing from Republicans over the years, it’s that sometimes, the judiciary can be the best bulwark against the opposing party getting what it wants. As our Anthony Adragna reported Friday, Senate Democrats have approved 235 of Biden’s judicial picks, eclipsing Trump's 234 first-term judicial nominations. 'I don’t know exactly what [Trump will] do. But I can tell you this: The judicia...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/26/congress/schumers-trump-2-0-00196038	2024-12-26T07:17:07-08:00	
Expect a quieter Jan. 6 this time around — as long as Republicans avert a looming speakership crisis	Donald Trump’s victory has made Jan. 6 boring again. Four years after a mob of Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s victory, Republicans and Democrats seem to agree they’ll give Trump the smooth, drama-free transfer of power he denied Democrats in 2020. That’s despite the fact that many Democrats see Trump as an insurrectionist, ineligible to hold the presidency because of his role in creating the conditions that led to the attack four years earlier. Instead, top Democrats say they have no plans to stand in the way of Trump’s victory — and they’re not even sure their rank-and-file colleagues will make the token objections they’ve lodged in years past. They also anticipate that Vice President Kamala Harris will lead the joint session of Cong...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/26/january-6-donald-trump-001733	2024-12-26T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/20/fa/aa9ba6c241c6956d95f2088bd57c/trump-indictment-democracy-72395.jpg

Inside how the Capitol Police has changed since Jan. 6, 2021	As Congress prepares to certify another election on Jan. 6, the U.S. Capitol Police looks like a vastly different agency than it was ahead of the attack on the Capitol four years ago. Security officials on the Hill were widely excoriated for the lack of preparedness ahead of the attempted insurrection, prompting multiple high-level resignations in the following weeks. An oft-repeated criticism was that officials should have requested help prior to the attack, given clear signals that there would be a huge protest coming to the area with the potential to turn violent. Those issues coincided with a steep increase in violent threats made against members of Congress. With that in mind, Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger has sought to shift the agency’s identity as a traditional police force with ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/25/capitol-police-change-since-jan-6-00195947	2024-12-25T11:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/6b/b1/d8692b46487aa4df50c06b903c0b/capitol-buildling-at-night-capitol-hill-92913.jpg

Trump says he plans to seek death penalty for violent offenders	President-elect Donald Trump is re-upping a campaign promise after President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of nearly every prisoner on the federal government’s death row. Trump said Tuesday he plans to direct the Justice Department to pursue the death penalty for violent offenders, a promise he made on the campaign trail if he won. Thirteen federal inmates were put to death during Trump’s first term. 'As soon as I am inaugurated, I will direct the Justice Department to vigorously pursue the death penalty to protect American families and children from violent rapists, murderers, and monsters,' Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

Conservatives hope to enlist Trump in their spending war. It won’t be that easy.	Conservatives who want to slash the federal budget are hoping they can enlist President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk to their side come January. But last week’s meltdown over government funding underscored that Trump doesn't always share their fiscal restraint. Though Trump and Musk helped upend an initial bipartisan appropriations deal loathed by fiscal hardliners, 38 House Republicans later balked at Trump’s big demand in the next bill: a looser limit on Washington’s borrowing authority. That move is a reminder that Trump exploded the deficit and greenlit billions in additional spending during his first term — two overall budget concerns that the House Republicans who opposed last week’s bill say they want to fix. After the debt ceiling battle last week, the fiscal rebels, GOP leader...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/24/conservatives-trump-spending-war-wont-be-easy-00195951	2024-12-24T03:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/3e/51/98475ae04989bc60bf77a281d152/house-members-during-cr-vote-69545.jpg

Trump allies to Gaetz: Don't back down	The release of a House ethics report that alleges former Rep. Matt Gaetz had sex with a minor makes his return to elected office more precarious — yet several allies of President-elect Donald Trump urged him to stay in the game. 'Gaetz has to come back,' Steve Bannon, the onetime Trump adviser, said Monday on his 'War Room' podcast. 'Gaetz must return like Trump returned. Don’t back down — double down.'

Michael Guest (R-Miss.), who indicated again he would not have released the findings since Gaetz (R-Fla.) had already left Congress. Guest said the release 'breaks from the Committee’s long-standing practice, opens the Committee to undue criticism, and will be viewed by some as an attempt to weaponize the Committee’s process.'

Josh Gottheimer promised an abortion protection bill. Eight months later, he hasn’t moved it.	In April, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer called a press conference in front of a Planned Parenthood office in northern New Jersey to announce new legislation designed to protect women. Gottheimer, who was widely known to be planning a run for governor, said the bill was in response to a push by anti-abortion groups to use the 151-year-old Comstock Act to ban the mailing of mifepristone — a drug used to induce abortions and treat miscarriages. 'Let’s be clear: without access to safe and legal reproductive health care, women will die,' Gottheimer said at the time.

Ethics report alleges Gaetz paid 17-year-old for sex	A yearslong House Ethics Committee investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz found 'substantial evidence' that the Florida Republican committed statutory rape, solicited prostitutes and used illegal drugs, according to a copy of the report obtained by POLITICO. The report's most explosive allegation, which Gaetz has long denied, is that he had sex twice with a 17-year-old girl at a party in July 2017, when he was 35 and serving in the House. Ethics Committee investigators found that he later paid the girl — part of a trend laid out in the report of him paying women after sexual encounters. Gaetz has repeatedly denied that he broke any laws. 'These claims would be destroyed in court — which is why they were never made in any court against me,' he told POLITICO Friday morning. But the commit...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/23/matt-gaetz-ethics-report-findings-00195875	2024-12-23T05:41:10-08:00	https://static.politico.com/51/b6/53f628b9446080d44b0fe0d19f38/young-republican-gala-new-york-20131.jpg
Trump’s big Mike Johnson decision	After the House passed a shutdown-averting spending bill Friday, a very relieved Speaker Mike Johnson proclaimed to reporters that President-elect Donald Trump was 'certainly happy about this outcome.' Not by a long shot. Amid the chaos in Washington, I was in Palm Beach talking to people close to the past and future president and called up other confidants afterward. This much became clear to me: Not only is Trump unhappy with the funding deal, he’s unhappy with Johnson, too. He’s unhappy that he didn’t get the debt ceiling hike he made clear he wanted. He felt blindsided by the initial deal Johnson struck with Democrats.

In Arizona speech, Trump jokes Musk is ‘not going to be president’	President-elect Donald Trump is setting the record straight: He’s calling the shots, not Elon Musk. 'No, he's not going to be president, that I can tell you,' Trump said with a laugh at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix on Sunday, his first major speech following the November election. 'And I'm safe. You know why? He can’t be. He wasn't born in this country.' The president-elect made the tongue-in-cheek comment while praising South African-born Musk as a 'great guy.' Musk, along with tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, is set to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, an agency with the goal of shrinking the size of government and cutting spending. Trump’s comments came as Democrats have sought to use Musk, the world’s richest person, as a foil, accusing him of undermining th...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/22/trump-musk-arizona-turning-point-00195860	2024-12-22T17:14:25-08:00	https://static.politico.com/8e/60/900aca2342c2b3c0ccfbf64dbd5e/trump-84154.jpg
