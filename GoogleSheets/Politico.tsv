House rules would make it harder to oust speaker in next Congress	Republicans will make it harder to remove the speaker in the 119th Congress under a rules package unveiled Wednesday. The proposed rules package would require nine GOP members to back making a motion to vacate to trigger a vote on ousting the speaker. That’s an increase from the current rule, which allows any single GOP member to force a vote. The deal to increase the threshold was negotiated in November by members of the House Freedom Caucus and the small business-oriented Main Street Caucus last year — an agreement that was first reported by POLITICO. Even after a vote is triggered, it still requires the support of a majority of the House in order for a speaker to be removed.

Chris Sununu still believes the GOP is bigger than Donald Trump	Donald Trump remade the GOP in his image. Chris Sununu doesn’t think it’ll stick. That’s because the outgoing Republican governor of New Hampshire, who routinely oscillates between supporting Trump and criticizing him, believes his party is bigger than both its enduring standard bearer and the political movement he created. 'Trump is extremely unique. There's no ‘Trump lite’ or ‘Trump 2.0’ that can replace or replicate what he's brought to the table, for better or for worse,' Sununu said in an interview. And the GOP, he insists, is still a 'big tent,' ticking off varied constituencies like the Log Cabin Republicans, fiscal hawks, libertarian-leaners and social conservatives. Sununu needs this to be true, at least if he wants a future in politics beyond punditry.

Trump says he would make calls for Mike Johnson	President-elect Donald Trump said he is willing to make calls to lawmakers to drum up support for Mike Johnson should there be a risk to his speakership ahead of a vote expected Friday on Capitol Hill. Speaking briefly with reporters outside of a New Year’s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect reaffirmed his support for the Louisiana Republican after his formal endorsement on Monday, saying 'he’s the one that can win right now.' The boost of support comes as Johnson’s path to retaining the speakership is tenuous. With the expected makeup of Congress on Friday, he can only have two Republican defections — and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has already indicated he would oppose Johnson. Trump also said he would attend former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral.

House Ethics Committee closes investigations into 4 members	The House Ethics Committee closed investigations into at least four members Monday for violating campaign finance rules. The investigations involved Reps. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.), Wesley Hunt (R-Tex.), Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.), Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.) and 'other confidential matters that have been under review.' The committee declined to disclose further details on those cases. The House panel found that, in at least some of those cases, 'evidence that the Member’s campaign did not fully comply with the applicable standards relating to personal use of campaign funds, as well as reporting or recordkeeping requirements for campaign expenditures.' But the Ethics Committee did not find that misuse was intentional and unanimously decided to close the cases, declining to take further action.

Whitehouse calls for ‘war machine’ to spar against GOP as DNC chair election looms	Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is calling for DNC delegates to consider how the Democratic Party’s infrastructure can support a 'war machine' to lead attacks against Republicans. The letter to state party chairs ahead of the DNC chair election, shared first with POLITICO, comes as Democrats scramble to figure out how to move forward after nationwide losses at the polls in November. Party leaders have bemoaned Democrats’ inability to define their own identity and push back against Republican attacks. Whitehouse argued that Democrats have no institutional and centralized setup to attack the GOP, writing Republicans 'rapidly and effectively deploy false narratives, while we struggle to bring true ones to bear.'

Carter to lie in state at the Capitol	Former President Jimmy Carter will lie in state in the U.S. Capitol's rotunda at the invitation of congressional leaders, the Carter Center announced Monday. The memorial services and honors for the former president are expected to span several days and include public events in Atlanta and Washington, followed by a private burial ceremony in his hometown of Plains, Georgia. Days for public viewing of Carter’s casket at the Capitol have not been announced, but the Carter Center confirmed that plans are underway. President Joe Biden has already announced a proclamation declaring a national day of mourning on Jan. 9, which could coincide with lying in state or the large public funeral service expected in Washi...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/30/congress/jimmy-carter-capitol-honor-lying-in-state-funeral-00196127	2024-12-30T10:34:45-08:00	
Meet new the members: Back to Washington — nearly 30 years later	The new member: Rep.-elect Cleo Fields (D-La.) How they got here: Fields won his return to Congress after defeating Republican Elbert Guillory and Democrat Quentin Anderson. He notched nearly 51 percent of the vote. Inside the campaign: The race for the seat began in earnest when Republican Gov. Jeff Landry agreed to redraw the state’s congressional map to create a second majority-minority district. The resulting seat, which includes much of Baton Rouge, Shreveport and Lafayette, forced out incumbent Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.).

Elaine Chao's advice for Trump's Labor and Transportation secretaries	Nothing much surprised Elaine Chao when she was named secretary of Labor by former President George W. Bush or secretary of Transportation during Donald Trump’s first term. That’s because she had served in other cabinet positions — and has been vetted five times by the FBI. So she knew the ropes. Chao, whose husband is Sen. Mitch McConnell, isn’t working for Trump this time around, but she has thoughts on what his next administration should be paying attention to.

Happy New Year, the debt limit is here. Get ready for an all-out war over it.	GOP leaders are staring down two bad options to solve President-elect Donald Trump's debt-limit problem, after failing to execute his demand to lift the federal borrowing cap in the last government funding bill. One path requires full buy-in from Republican lawmakers to address the issue via budget reconciliation — a huge challenge thanks to the party’s fierce fiscal hawks. The other entails winning over Democrats, who for the most part rejected Trump’s initial debt-limit gambit last week. 'Whoever advised the president that it was even possible needs to better understand how this place works,' Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said about Trump’s latest push to raise the debt limit.

Tributes pour in for Jimmy Carter	Former President Jimmy Carter’s death on Sunday prompted an outpouring of tributes from fellow presidents and politicians. 'Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well,' President Joe Biden said in a statement with first lady Jill Biden. The Bidens celebrated the long and loving marriage between Carter and his wife Rosalynn, writing that it was 'the definition of partnership and their humble leadership is the definition of patriotism.'

Former President Jimmy Carter dead at 100	Jimmy Carter had such confidence in his improbable path to the White House that he bet Americans worn down by Vietnam and Watergate would welcome a new kind of president: a peanut farmer who carried his own bags, worried about the heating bill and told it, more or less, like it was. And for a time, the voters embraced him. Yet just four years later, in the aftermath of a presidency that was widely seen as failed, it sometimes seemed as if all that was left of Carter was the smile — the wide, toothy grin that helped elect him in the first place, then came to be caricatured by countless cartoonists as an emblem of naïveté. But it was Carter’s great fortune to enjoy a post-presidency more than 10 times as long as his tenure in office — in March 2019, he became the longest-lived president ever...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/29/jimmy-carter-former-president-dead-at-100-033324	2024-12-29T13:25:18-08:00	https://static.politico.com/d0/da/4ee6068d421a995375dae1c9c618/carteroverride.jpg
Eric Schmitt, Ro Khanna voice support for H-1B visa reform, as GOP clashes over immigration	A Silicon Valley Democrat and a Republican Senator are calling for reform to the H-1B Visa program, which tech companies use to recruit thousands of high-skilled foreign workers every year. 'So I think the solution here, President Trump has actually articulated this in 2020, is to reform that system and get rid of the abuses, make it merit-based, and make sure that we're not undercutting wages, and having Americans train their foreign replacements,' Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) told 'Fox News Sunday' anchor Shannon Bream.

Is the Democratic brand toxic? A growing number of Dems wonder if going ‘independent’ will help them win	Losing to a twice-impeached convicted felon has left a small, but growing, number of Democrats wondering if their party brand is so toxic that they should shed the label — particularly in battleground and red states. Mike Duggan, the longtime Democratic mayor of Detroit, is pursuing an independent campaign for governor in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory in his state. Democratic strategists are studying this year’s bid by independent Dan Osborn, who as a Senate candidate in Nebraska overperformed the top of the ticket, as a model to win the upper chamber. And a Joe Biden mega-fundraiser is floating a gubernatorial run in Florida on what he calls the 'Capitalist Party' ticket.

'Treasury currently expects to reach the new limit between January 14 and January 23, at which time it will be necessary for Treasury to start taking extraordinary measures,' Yellen wrote in a letter to congressional leadership.

Republican brawl on immigration erupts as MAGA and tech world clash	An online debate over high-skilled immigration between Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and MAGA evangelists reveals Donald Trump’s Republican Party is grappling with growing pains as it prepares to retake the White House. Days after the powerful allies of Trump in Silicon Valley took to social media to argue for a greater number of high-skilled immigrants, with a side-swipe at American culture for emphasizing 'mediocrity over excellence,' some members of the far-right said such policies would make America 'look like India.'

Roy hails Musk, Ramaswamy influence on spending as Hill GOP looks toward cuts	DOGE co-chairs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will have significant influence in how Congress slashes spending, Rep. Chip Roy said in an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Friday. 'When the DOGE guys came in, Elon and Vivek, I pointed to my Republican colleagues and I said, ‘You know what the problem is, right here in this room,’' Roy said. 'We have Republicans and Democrats who never met a program they didn’t want to promote for some sort of political gain.' Roy, the Freedom Caucus policy chair, added that Musk and Ramaswamy were working to identify spending waste, and the two businessmen could use their platforms to shine a light on the issue. Roy also floated potential examples of spending cuts, including the restricting the use of food stamps and repealing the Inflation Reduction Act.

Former FBI and CIA head prods Senate to reject Patel, Gabbard	A former head of the FBI and CIA is raising objections over whether Kash Patel and Tulsi Gabbard, President-elect Donald Trump's picks to be directors of the FBI and national intelligence, respectively, are qualified to serve in the Cabinet. In a letter to senators on Thursday, William Webster, the only person to lead both the FBI and CIA, wrote that neither nominee meets the demands of top intelligence jobs. Webster, who is 100 years old, praised Patel's patriotism but wrote that his allegiance to Trump was concerning. 'His record of executing the president’s directives suggest a loyalty to individuals rather than the rule of law — a dangerous precedent for an agency tasked with impartial enforcement of justice,' he said.

'We do need to consider whether — if we’re going to advance Mr. Trump’s agenda — whether the current leadership is what we need.'

How Schumer is prepping for Trump 2.0	In less than a month, elected Democrats will find themselves with a lot less power in Washington, with a GOP-controlled House, Senate and White House resulting in a landscape in which their ability to tussle with President-elect Donald Trump will be largely rhetorical. But if Dem leaders have learned one thing from Republicans over the years, it’s that sometimes, the judiciary can be the best bulwark against the opposing party getting what it wants. As our Anthony Adragna reported Friday, Senate Democrats have approved 235 of Biden’s judicial picks, eclipsing Trump's 234 first-term judicial nominations.

Expect a quieter Jan. 6 this time around — as long as Republicans avert a looming speakership crisis	Donald Trump’s victory has made Jan. 6 boring again. Four years after a mob of Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s victory, Republicans and Democrats seem to agree they’ll give Trump the smooth, drama-free transfer of power he denied Democrats in 2020. That’s despite the fact that many Democrats see Trump as an insurrectionist, ineligible to hold the presidency because of his role in creating the conditions that led to the attack four years earlier. Instead, top Democrats say they have no plans to stand in the way of Trump’s victory — and they’re not even sure their rank-and-file colleagues will make the token objections they’ve lodged in years past. They also anticipate that Vice President Kamala Harris will lead the joint session of Cong...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/26/january-6-donald-trump-001733	2024-12-26T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/20/fa/aa9ba6c241c6956d95f2088bd57c/trump-indictment-democracy-72395.jpg

Inside how the Capitol Police has changed since Jan. 6, 2021	As Congress prepares to certify another election on Jan. 6, the U.S. Capitol Police looks like a vastly different agency than it was ahead of the attack on the Capitol four years ago. Security officials on the Hill were widely excoriated for the lack of preparedness ahead of the attempted insurrection, prompting multiple high-level resignations in the following weeks. An oft-repeated criticism was that officials should have requested help prior to the attack, given clear signals that there would be a huge protest coming to the area with the potential to turn violent.

Trump says he plans to seek death penalty for violent offenders	President-elect Donald Trump is re-upping a campaign promise after President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of nearly every prisoner on the federal government’s death row. Trump said Tuesday he plans to direct the Justice Department to pursue the death penalty for violent offenders, a promise he made on the campaign trail if he won. Thirteen federal inmates were put to death during Trump’s first term.

Conservatives hope to enlist Trump in their spending war. It won’t be that easy.	Conservatives who want to slash the federal budget are hoping they can enlist President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk to their side come January. But last week’s meltdown over government funding underscored that Trump doesn't always share their fiscal restraint. Though Trump and Musk helped upend an initial bipartisan appropriations deal loathed by fiscal hardliners, 38 House Republicans later balked at Trump’s big demand in the next bill: a looser limit on Washington’s borrowing authority. That move is a reminder that Trump exploded the deficit and greenlit billions in additional spending during his first term — two overall budget concerns that the House Republicans who opposed last week’s bill say they want to fix. After the debt ceiling battle last week, the fiscal rebels, GOP leader...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/24/conservatives-trump-spending-war-wont-be-easy-00195951	2024-12-24T03:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/3e/51/98475ae04989bc60bf77a281d152/house-members-during-cr-vote-69545.jpg

Trump allies to Gaetz: Don't back down	The release of a House ethics report that alleges former Rep.

Josh Gottheimer promised an abortion protection bill. Eight months later, he hasn’t moved it.	In April, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer called a press conference in front of a Planned Parenthood office in northern New Jersey to announce new legislation designed to protect women. Gottheimer, who was widely known to be planning a run for governor, said the bill was in response to a push by anti-abortion groups to use the 151-year-old Comstock Act to ban the mailing of mifepristone — a drug used to induce abortions and treat miscarriages. 'Let’s be clear: without access to safe and legal reproductive health care, women will die,' Gottheimer said at the time.

Ethics report alleges Gaetz paid 17-year-old for sex	A yearslong House Ethics Committee investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz found 'substantial evidence' that the Florida Republican committed statutory rape, solicited prostitutes and used illegal drugs, according to a copy of the report obtained by POLITICO. The report's most explosive allegation, which Gaetz has long denied, is that he had sex twice with a 17-year-old girl at a party in July 2017, when he was 35 and serving in the House. Ethics Committee investigators found that he later paid the girl — part of a trend laid out in the report of him paying women after sexual encounters. Gaetz has repeatedly denied that he broke any laws. 'These claims would be destroyed in court — which is why they were never made in any court against me,' he told POLITICO Friday morning.

Trump’s big Mike Johnson decision	After the House passed a shutdown-averting spending bill Friday, a very relieved Speaker Mike Johnson proclaimed to reporters that President-elect Donald Trump was 'certainly happy about this outcome.' Not by a long shot. Amid the chaos in Washington, I was in Palm Beach talking to people close to the past and future president and called up other confidants afterward. This much became clear to me: Not only is Trump unhappy with the funding deal, he’s unhappy with Johnson, too. He’s unhappy that he didn’t get the debt ceiling hike he made clear he wanted. He felt blindsided by the initial deal Johnson struck with Democrats.

In Arizona speech, Trump jokes Musk is ‘not going to be president’	President-elect Donald Trump is setting the record straight: He’s calling the shots, not Elon Musk. 'No, he's not going to be president, that I can tell you,' Trump said with a laugh at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix on Sunday, his first major speech following the November election. 'And I'm safe. You know why? He can’t be. He wasn't born in this country.' The president-elect made the tongue-in-cheek comment while praising South African-born Musk as a 'great guy.' Musk, along with tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, is set to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, an agency with the goal of shrinking the size of government and cutting spending. Trump’s comments came as Democrats have sought to use Musk, the world’s richest person, as a foil, accusing him of undermining th...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/22/trump-musk-arizona-turning-point-00195860	2024-12-22T17:14:25-08:00	https://static.politico.com/8e/60/900aca2342c2b3c0ccfbf64dbd5e/trump-84154.jpg

Congress clears government shutdown patch following Trump, Musk disruptions	In Congress’ last action of the year, the Senate passed a funding patch early Saturday with more than $110 billion in disaster aid, averting a government shutdown and closing out the 118th Congress. Final passage of the bill, which made it through the House Friday evening, caps off a tumultuous week on Capitol Hill as Speaker Mike Johnson managed the last-minute demands of President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk, along with the ensuing furor of congressional Democrats whose votes are needed to pass funding bills amid conservative opposition.

Dems fight to Trump-proof the federal judiciary	Democrats on Friday hit a major milestone, confirming more judges under President Joe Biden than Republicans did in President-elect Donald Trump’s first term. It deprives Trump of putting a bigger conservative stamp on the judiciary — and Democrats will have leverage to continue fighting next year. Senate Democrats, despite a narrow majority, have approved 235 of Biden’s judicial picks, eclipsing the 234 judicial nominations Trump got through in his first term. Biden has now appointed a range of judges amounting to about a fourth of the overall federal judiciary.

'President Biden supports moving this legislation forward and ensuring that the vital services the government provides for hardworking Americans,' press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Friday evening, 'from issuing Social Security checks to processing benefits for veterans.' The administration’s support came as the bill was poised to sail through the House, after House Democrats agreed to vote for the three-month funding package that includes disaster aid and a one-year farm bill extension.

House passes government spending package after Trump, Musk fueled chaos	The House passed a stopgap package Friday evening that pushes the government funding deadline to March, as Congress races to avoid a looming deadline that would shut down the government in six hours. The package passed 366-34, with the support of 196 Democrats and 170 Republicans. It now moves to the Senate, where leaders are hoping to lock in an agreement to fast-track final passage of the measure, racing against the midnight government shutdown deadline. The package’s passage seemingly ends a chaotic 48 hours, after Elon Musk and President-elect Donald Trump worked to spike a previously-negotiated bipartisan funding agreement.

In less than 24 hours, 38 House Republicans rejected the stopgap spending bill that the president-elect publicly threw his weight behind after tanking Speaker Mike Johnson’s original proposal to keep the federal government running past Friday. And their defiance came even as Trump and his allies threatened to field primary challenges against GOP members who didn’t fall in line. It was only the latest example of Trump confronting the limits of his power, especially over his own party.

House Republicans float a debt limit, spending pact deal — with themselves	House GOP leaders laid out a plan Friday to avert the upcoming debt cliff on their own next year, despite President-elect Donald Trump’s insistence that Congress handle it before he takes office. During a closed-door conference meeting Friday afternoon, House Republican leaders proposed a commitment to raising the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion early in 2025. GOP leaders would pair that with a $2.5 trillion cut in 'mandatory' spending, the category of government funding that largely runs on autopilot and bankrolls benefits programs like Medicaid, Social Security, SNAP nutrition assistance, Medicare and welfare payments to the poorest Americans.

Trump also praised Burch for advocating for him and encouraging Catholics to vote for him in 2024.

House GOP picks new funding plan that will need wide Democratic support	House Republicans have landed on their fourth plan to fund the government: Relying on Democrats to pass a bill that doesn’t include a debt limit measure pushed by Donald Trump. House Republicans voted in their closed-door conference meeting on Friday on the strategy, according to more than a dozen Republicans leaving the meeting. In addition to funding the government until March 14, the plan will also include a one-year farm bill extension and the $110 billion disaster aid package Republicans negotiated with Democrats. Republicans expect they will vote on the package on Friday, with less than 12 hours remaining until a shutdown deadline.

Transition would be ‘restricted’ during a shutdown	Hours ahead of the expiration of government funding, the White House warned that a shutdown would disrupt the presidential transition process, hampering preparations for next month’s handoff to President-elect Donald Trump. 'Transition activities will be restricted,' press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Friday during a White House briefing. 'We’re doing everything to ensure a smooth transition, but the choice to allow a transition to move forward is in the hands of Republicans in Congress.' Jean-Pierre did not offer specifics on those restrictions. But she said the only transition efforts that would be left untouched by a potential shutdown are those needed to 'prevent imminent threats to the safety of human life or the protection of property.' Congressional Republicans are sc...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/20/congress/restricted-transition-00195647	2024-12-20T10:53:16-08:00	
Johnson lays out two spending paths in House GOP meeting	Speaker Mike Johnson laid out two potential paths to avert a government shutdown in a closed-door meeting with the House GOP Friday morning, according to a slide presented in the closed-door House GOP conference and shared with POLITICO. There's less than 12 hours left before a shutdown deadline. Option one was moving a stopgap bill that funds the government through March that largely matches the package endorsed by Donald Trump that failed in the House on Thursday evening, except it wouldn't include raising the debt limit. Johnson said that package would pass via suspension, meaning it would need a two-thirds majority to pass and therefore a lot of Democratic votes. The second plan he laid out would involve three separate votes on a stopgap funding bill into March, money for natural disas...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/20/congress/johnson-lays-out-two-spending-paths-00195638	2024-12-20T10:13:55-08:00	
Senators continue to wait for House lawmakers to ‘sort it themselves’ on spending	A week into the House’s chaotic attempt to pass a government funding deal, senators are signaling they're open to near anything — except moving on their own government-funding deal first. Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said 'the House needs to do its job' when asked whether the Senate needs to get moving on its own bill. Asked what happens if the House is unable to pass something before a government shutdown deadline in less than 12 hours, Tester replied: 'It's what the people elected.' Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), another Senate appropriator, said House members have to 'sort it themselves.' Rep. Rosa DeLauro, leading Democrat for the House Appropriations Committee, also said: 'We’re going to move in the House. We have to move in the House.'

Musk vows to fund ‘moderate’ Democratic primary challengers	Elon Musk said he’ll be funding moderate primary challengers to incumbent Democrats in deep-blue seats around the country, as he continues to try to influence a wide swath of government. 'Forgot to mention that I’m also going to be funding moderate candidates in heavily Democrat districts, so that the country can get rid of those who don’t represent them, like this jackass,' the billionaire tech mogul said in a post on X in response to a video clip of Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee. Neal is an odd choice for Musk — a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump — to single out.

Johnson moves forward on spending Plan C: Breaking up the bills	Speaker Mike Johnson has moved on to a Plan C to avert a government shutdown: Breaking up each piece to pass them separately. Under the House GOP’s latest plan, Republicans will try to pass three separate bills: stopgap funding legislation with a one-year farm bill extension, money for recent natural disasters and aid for farmers, according to two people with direct knowledge of negotiations. A shutdown deadline is now about 12 hours away. The new plan will test his ability to wrangle his conference. Members believe Johnson is taking the proposal through the Rules Committee, trying to pass it through regular order so it only requires a simple majority on the House floor. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), who is on the panel, said that he will back the plan, meaning it should have enough support ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/20/congress/third-spending-plan-attempt-00195611	2024-12-20T08:35:39-08:00

'Because of our display of unity, the lines of communication have been reopened,' Jeffries said, according to the people in the room.

Trump transfers $4B stake in Truth Social parent company into a trust	President-elect Donald Trump has put his $4 billion stake in the parent company of his social media platform Truth Social into a trust controlled by one of his sons, according to a regulatory filing late Thursday. The billionaire's nearly 115 million shares in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group were transferred to the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust on Dec. 17 as 'a bona fide gift,' the filing said. Trump did not sell any stock in the process.

Dozens of Republicans broke with Trump. Are primary challenges next?	Republicans broke with Donald Trump. Now primary threats could be in the offing. Dozens of House Republicans voted against a bill pushed by the president-elect to temporarily fund the government Thursday night, even after Trump promised retribution to those who crossed him. The list of 38 Republicans opposed to the measure ranged from conservatives called out by name by the president-elect — like Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) — to less visible agitators like Republican Reps. Aaron Bean (Fla.), Russ Fulcher (Idaho) and Wesley Hunt (Texas). 'I’m happy to take the fire,' Roy told POLITICO Thursday evening.

Trump says any shutdown ‘is a Biden problem to solve’	President-elect Donald Trump worked Friday morning to foist the blame for any potential government shutdown onto the current White House, insisting that the funding fight on Capitol Hill 'is a Biden problem to solve.' Lawmakers had seemed on track earlier this week to fund the government with time to spare, settling on a bipartisan stopgap spending bill, known as a continuing resolution or CR, that would extend government spending into March and included a lot of add-ons to appease Democrats and others. But that plan quickly drew the ire of Trump ally Elon Musk, followed by the president-elect and Vice President-elect JD Vance, tanking that bill. Still, with government funding set to run out at midnight on Friday, Trump insisted that it is President Joe Biden who should be held responsible...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/20/trump-shutdown-biden-problem-00195574	2024-12-20T06:23:36-08:00	https://static.politico.com/5e/02/0597ce5f4dda9f7557b0540db599/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2179648755

Johnson prepares to put forward another spending plan	Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that the House will vote on a government funding bill on Friday morning. 'We’re expecting votes this morning. So y’all stay tuned. We’ve got a plan,' he said. Asked if they had reached a new agreement, he added: 'We’ll see.' While no decision has been made, multiple members say there are discussions about passing a short-term stopgap that would only punt funding into mid-January. That would avert a shutdown and allow lawmakers to go home for the holidays, though they'd return to the same problems in the new year. The discussions around a short-term funding patch option include moving a separate disaster aid package, similar if not the exact same, as the $110 billion one Republicans negotiated with Democrats in the original stopgap agreement, according to...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/20/congress/johnson-says-house-will-vote-soon-00195572	2024-12-20T05:18:00-08:00

Johnson on shaky ground with Trump after spending fiasco	The collapse of Speaker Mike Johnson’s spending plan illustrates a painful lesson that other politicians have already learned: Absolute loyalty to Donald Trump is a one-way street. As the U.S. teeters on the edge of a government shutdown, bitterly divided Republicans are struggling to find a way forward and Johnson’s hold on his job is in Trump’s mercurial hands. Multiple House conservatives, as well as Trump advisers and other people close to the incoming president, indicate Johnson’s hold on the speakership is far from stable just as Republicans are about to take control of the House, Senate and White House. One Trump adviser, granted anonymity to speak candidly, said Johnson could salvage the relationship by 'doing what Trump wants.' But another said that Trump wasn’t 'protecting him' a...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/19/johnson-shaky-ground-trump-spending-fiasco-00195512	2024-12-19T18:25:23-08:00	https://static.politico.com/c3/fc/75793d08456698679761068cdf7d/u-s-congress-00120.jpg
Republicans scramble for a path forward after spending plan collapse	House Republican leaders planned to work through the night and into Friday on a Plan C for funding the government, after abandoning their deal with Democrats and failing to pass an alternative backed by President-elect Donald Trump. Facing a government shutdown deadline at midnight Friday, Speaker Mike Johnson is under pressure to patch together a third proposal to avert a shutdown — while enacting other priorities that include more than $100 billion in disaster aid, retaining support from Trump along with a majority of House Republicans and enough Democrats to secure passage. After last-minute objections from Trump and Elon Musk, Johnson is now forced to balance those conflicting interests ahead of a January vote to secure his speakership.

A MAGA power play roils Senate GOP campaign groups	President-elect Donald Trump’s allies are opening a new front in MAGA’s war with traditionalist Republicans — feuding over the leadership of top Senate campaign groups. Typically a little noticed and relatively drama-free affair, hiring at the National Republican Senatorial Committee and its allied GOP super PAC Senate Leadership Fund has devolved in recent weeks into bickering over whether prospective new leaders are sufficiently loyal to Trump and the movement he created. And after initially targeting the highest positions, MAGA Republicans’ objections are now extending even to less senior hires. The latest gripe is aimed at Brendan Jaspers, who was just tapped as the NRSC’s political director for the 2026 midterms. The campaign against him has included private efforts to undermine his c...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/19/maga-senate-gop-campaign-groups-00195476	2024-12-19T16:02:25-08:00	https://static.politico.com/22/f0/af4c9b8e4be98da9a6bf989aa276/election-2024-trump-03695.jpg
Trump-backed funding bill fails as government shutdown looms	A bill to avert a government shutdown failed on the House floor Thursday night, after Democrats and conservatives rebelled against Speaker Mike Johnson’s new Donald Trump-backed spending plan. The measure went down decisively, 174-235, failing to meet a two-thirds bar for passage under a fast-track procedure, as 38 Republicans joined 197 Democrats to tank the bill. Two Democrats voted for the bill, and one voted present. With government funding set to expire at midnight Friday, Elon Musk and Trump lured Congress into a power struggle, demanding that Johnson abandon the bipartisan accord he struck with top Democrats this week and instead craft a bill favored by Republicans. By defeating that Trump-backed alternative, Democrats demonstrated that they won’t help him pass bills if they don’t h...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/19/congress/government-shutdown-house-vote-00195479	2024-12-19T16:00:31-08:00	
Top GOP pollster fired after financial mismanagement allegations	Chris Wilson, the founder and CEO of top Republican polling firm WPA Intelligence, was fired after company audits found he likely used firm money to pay for personal expenses, according to two people directly familiar with the matter. It comes after his firm’s CFO was fired and charged with embezzlement earlier this year, a charge that she denies. That led people on WPAi’s leadership team to start looking into how Wilson had spent company money, according to the people. Two outside auditing firms were hired to conduct investigations, and two business consultants were later brought on to restructure the company and restore its profitability, according to the people. Wilson, who has worked on behalf of presidential efforts for Ron DeSantis and Ted Cruz, was fired on Dec. 5, according to the ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/19/chris-wilson-wpa-00195416	2024-12-19T16:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/a6/47/584de9de49e4a778188526b673dc/chriswilson.jpg
The Trump-Musk governing duo is clearly a work in progress	As Elon Musk unleashed a volley of X posts demanding that Republicans back away from a deal to avert a government shutdown, Donald Trump was publicly silent. Instead, the president-elect holed up in his office Wednesday in a ballroom above Mar-a-Lago. While Musk riled up the MAGA masses, Trump was holding a series of conversations with top aides — including Susie Wiles and Stephen Miller — as Vice President-elect JD Vance privately expressed Trump’s concerns about the bill on Capitol Hill, according to two people granted anonymity to discuss the matter freely. By the time Trump and Vance finally chimed in several hours later in a joint statement, the measure was already tanked and Speaker Mike Johnson’s future was in jeopardy.

Shutdown blame game engulfs Capitol as hopes to avert shutdown fade	The shutdown blame game has already begun on Capitol Hill, a telltale sign that lawmakers don’t expect they can clear a funding plan before the Friday night deadline. Republicans’ revamped attempt at a stopgap spending bill is headed to the House floor Thursday evening but it’s almost certainly doomed, given it needs to meet a two-thirds threshold to pass the chamber and Democrats have vocally opposed it. Democrats have already dubbed it the Elon Musk shutdown, given the billionaire publicly excoriated the original bipartisan spending deal and helped tank it on Wednesday. And Republicans are coming out swinging against Democrats after House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries urged his fellow Democrats to vote against the hastily assembled package.

Democrats dodge a debt ceiling deal	House Democrats are finding themselves in uncharted waters after President-elect Donald Trump and House Republican leaders proposed raising the federal debt limit, potentially taking a default off the table for the first half of Trump's second term. The provision embedded in the newly revised continuing resolution set for a House vote Thursday evening looks a lot like what Democrats wanted Republicans to support when presidents of their own party were in power: It suspends the debt ceiling through Jan. 30, 2027, without any corresponding spending cuts.

'The Musk-Johnson proposal is not serious. It’s laughable. Extreme MAGA Republicans are driving us to a government shutdown,' House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said to reporters as he walked into the meeting. Speaking privately to members of his caucus minutes later, Jeffries told lawmakers: 'I’m not simply a no.

The plan Johnson is expected to put on the House floor later Thursday includes, according to three Republicans familiar with the deal, a stopgap measure that funds the government through mid-March, a clean farm bill extension, the $110 billion disaster aid package previously negotiated with Democrats, clean health care provision extenders and a two-year suspension of the debt limit, kicking a new d...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/19/congress/gop-strikes-a-new-spending-deal-00195410	2024-12-19T12:31:28-08:00

US economic growth beats expectations in final snapshot of Biden presidency	High prices may have cost Democrats the election, but the U.S. economy has powered through 2024 with better-than-expected growth. And now President-elect Donald Trump is poised to inherit it. GDP rose at a 3.1 percent annualized pace in the third quarter of the year, according to Commerce Department data released Thursday, after growing at a 3 percent rate in the second quarter — a rapid clip for an economy of the U.S.’s size. That growth, fed by steady consumer spending, comes alongside a still-low unemployment rate of 4.2 percent and much-improved inflation, which has fallen below 3 percent. It’s the final big-picture snapshot of the economy that President Joe Biden is leaving to his successor.

Thune added that he has not yet talked to Johnson on Thursday morning, though he expects he will, and is 'hoping that they make some headway.' When asked about Trump's proposal to include an increase to the debt limit in the year-end funding package, Thune reiterated 'they're trying to sort that out in the House.' And Sen.

Johnson and Trump team floating stopgap plan with disaster aid, debt limit, farm bill	Speaker Mike Johnson and Donald Trump’s team are circling a new federal funding stopgap plan that includes disaster aid, pushing off a debt limit fight for two years and a one-year farm bill extension, according to two Republicans familiar with the discussions. The closed-door talks between the speaker and Trump’s team, including incoming Vice President JD Vance, are still ongoing and the plans could change, according to the two lawmakers. Other options are also being floated. It's unclear if Democrats would support this plan. Trump had made an 11th hour public demand that any stopgap bill should deal with the debt limit. Trump's team is pushing for at least a commitment to lift the debt limit before Jan. 20.

'Department officials showed them to dedicated office space in the building that had been set aside for them as they conduct ongoing internal briefings over the next few weeks,' the spokesperson said. The transition meetings come as the Trump team prepares to take over the executive branch in January. Trump’s transition team formally signed off on a memorandum of understanding with the Biden administration in late Nov...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/19/congress/trump-transition-energy-department-00195309	2024-12-19T06:40:35-08:00	
Musk and Trump put House GOP in a bind	Just two days before a planned Christmas break, Speaker Mike Johnson is facing down the threat of a government shutdown and demands from an incoming president that he cannot easily deliver on. Yesterday, Trump ally Elon Musk banded with conservatives in the House and outside influencers to effectively tank a bipartisan government funding deal that included disaster aid and billions in farm assistance. The complaint? That Uncle Sam was spending like a drunken sailor and needed to tighten the purse strings quickly. But then Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance dumped gasoline on the fire. In a lengthy post on X, they criticized Johnson’s continuing resolution deal as 'a betrayal of our country,' and demanded th...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/19/elon-musk-speaker-johnson-cr-government-shutdown-00195305	2024-12-19T06:35:56-08:00	https://static.politico.com/cf/84/2ed55f2a4256a977746057063438/u-s-congress-05057.jpg
Johnson has 3 main options to avert a shutdown. None of them are looking good.	Mike Johnson’s in a terrible spot, with a government shutdown deadline looming in less than 48 hours and no obvious way out. Conservatives are furious, rank-and-file members are exasperated, and President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to primary his members and taking blatant shots at his speakership. After spending weeks negotiating a stopgap spending bill with several add-ons, Trump and others all but killed Johnson’s deal on Wednesday. Now, he has to figure out if he’ll try to stick with it, passing it using a lot of Democratic support, or come up with another last-minute escape hatch. And time is quickly running out. All of his options have downsides. Let’s lay them out: Stick to the status quo: This appears to be the least likely, as both Donald Trump and Elon Musk have com...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/19/congress/johnsons-possible-escape-hatches-00195307	2024-12-19T06:26:49-08:00

Rand Paul floats Musk for speaker	Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is floating the ultimate Washington outsider to be speaker: Elon Musk. 'The Speaker of the House need not be a member of Congress,' Paul wrote in a post on Musk’s X platform. 'Nothing would disrupt the swamp more than electing Elon Musk . . . think about it . . . nothing’s impossible. (not to mention the joy at seeing the collective establishment, aka ‘uniparty,’ lose their ever-lovin’ minds).' The unconventional suggestion from one of the least conventional senators comes as Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) works to tamp down an outright conservative rebellion <a href='https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/18/congress/trumps-spending-demands-meet-rea...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/19/congress/speaker-musk-00195302	2024-12-19T05:38:08-08:00	
Ernst rolls out next DOGE-inspired bill	Sen. Joni Ernst is rolling out her next step on Thursday to overhaul the federal workforce as she embraces President-elect Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency. The bill from Ernst, known as the DRAIN THE SWAMP Act, would require each executive agency to relocate at least 30 percent of employees currently working at a Washington, D.C., headquarters to an office located outside of the metro area, according to a copy of the legislation obtained by POLITICO. For employees remaining at a Washington, D.C. headquarters, the bill would restrict their ability to telework full-time. And it would require the Office of Management and Budget to issue a memorandum directing for the office space of executive agency headquarters located within Washington, D.C., to be reduced by at least 30 ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/19/congress/ernsts-doge-like-bill-00195301	2024-12-19T05:11:33-08:00

DOGE Can’t Do It All. Here’s What It Can Do.	Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have grand ambitions for their supercharged government consultancy. The so-called Department of Government Efficiency is going to solve the U.S.’s debt problem. It’s going to dramatically reduce the government’s power and slash the size of its workforce. And it’s going to crack down on that perpetual, easily named enemy: waste, fraud and abuse in federal spending. Or, so they say. Here’s the thing: those are completely different objectives that can be in conflict. Each poses its own political and legal obstacles. It’s not clear how — or if — DOGE intends to pick its battles. DOGE could have real value if it zeroes in on things that should be dealt with, like federal buildings sitting unused, outdated technology systems or <a href='https://www.gao.gov/products/...	https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/12/19/doge-cant-do-it-all-heres-what-it-can-do-00195190	2024-12-19T02:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/22/12/1115b504486296c4d77074d043b0/trump-spacex-49643.jpg

Veteran Trump hands a part of Labor Dept. landing team	President-elect Donald Trump’s landing team for the Labor Department includes a pair of high-ranking agency officials from his first term and a former chair of the federal agency that adjudicates labor disputes within the federal workforce. Trump’s transition operation recently informed the Biden administration that Virginia Secretary of Labor Bryan Slater, former Equal Employment Opportunity Commission member Keith Sonderling and health care executive Thomas Beck would be helping to lead the handover at the Frances Perkins Building, according to two people familiar with the transition who were not authorized to speak publicly. Slater served as DOL’s assistant secretary for administration and management under Trump and Sonderling was the acting head of the Wage and Hour Division before bei...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/18/congress/labor-department-landing-team-set-00195279	2024-12-18T20:25:57-08:00	
White House blasts Republicans for collapse of short-term funding bill	The White House slammed President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans for the unraveling of a spending agreement that could lead to a government shutdown by the weekend. 'Republicans need to stop playing politics with this bipartisan agreement or they will hurt hard-working Americans and create instability across the country,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance told Republicans not to support the stopgap spending measure that was negotiated in the House. Instead, they urged GOP members to support a stripped-down resolution that would also raise the debt ceiling before the new administration has to deal with the issue in 2025.
