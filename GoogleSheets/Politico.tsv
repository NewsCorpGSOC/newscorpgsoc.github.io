Anti-abortion groups like what they heard from RFK Jr.	Anti-abortion groups were nervous when President Donald Trump tapped former Democrat and onetime abortion-rights supporter Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to run the nation’s health agencies. After two days of hearings, many now feel confident he will carry out their agenda. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said Thursday the group will not score Kennedy’s confirmation vote — either at the committee or floor level. And its leaders said they are 'encouraged' by promises Kennedy made to hire anti-abortion staff at HHS, scrutinize regulations around abortion pills, halt support for medical research using fetal tissue and cut funding to organizations that provide or refer for the procedure. 'When Kennedy...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/30/congress/anti-abortion-groups-rfk-jr-00201675	2025-01-30T15:11:43-08:00	
Tragedy hits home for Reagan National’s powerful frequent flyers	America’s worst air disaster in a generation happened at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and its powerful frequent flyers are watching the aftermath intently. Members of Congress have an intimate relationship with the airport, which is a 10-minute drive from Capitol Hill and is used by hundreds of lawmakers as a commuter hub. They’ve also taken an unusually active role in managing it, and lawmakers were quick to offer condolences, share observations, assert oversight authority and otherwise insert themselves after the deadly crash. 'It is the American airport,' said Rep. Norma Torres<...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/30/washington-plane-crash-congress-connections-009292	2025-01-30T14:39:38-08:00	https://static.politico.com/54/bc/4d3b2c3d4e65a66bb30cadaf260f/aptopix-aircraft-down-44412.jpg

Bill Cassidy offered RFK Jr. an out. He didn't take it.	Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s bid to lead the Department of Health and Human Services could come down to one senator. That senator, Bill Cassidy (R-La.), said he was deeply torn about his vote during a hearing of the Senate committee in charge of health policy on Thursday. Cassidy, the panel’s chair and a gastroenterologist before entering politics, spoke of his own experience with life-saving vaccines and repeatedly asked Kennedy to disavow his past anti-vaccine advocacy. Kennedy said he’d review the evidence and 'apologize for any statement that misled people' if proven wrong, but also indicated he didn’t think he was wrong when he spent years linking vaccines to rising autism and chaired an anti-vaccine advoca...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/08/congress/bill-cassidy-offered-rfk-jr-an-out-he-didnt-take-it-00201618	2025-01-30T11:59:28-08:00	
Democrats denounce Gabbard for Snowden sympathy	Democratic senators on Thursday tore into Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump’s nominee for director of national intelligence, over her past support of leaker Edward Snowden. Senate Intelligence Committee ranking member Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and other panel Democrats condemned Gabbard during her confirmation hearing for sympathizing with Snowden, an intelligence contractor who leaked numerous highly classified programs in 2013 and then fled to Russia. Warner called Snowden, who is accused of violating the Espionage Act, a 'traitor.' 'Until you got chosen by President Trump, you celebrated this guy a...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/08/congress/democrats-gabbard-snowden-sympathy-00201600	2025-01-30T11:11:25-08:00	
Trump's FBI pick dodges on 2020 election results	Kash Patel, Donald Trump’s nominee to run the FBI, repeatedly refused to say that Joe Biden won the 2020 election — following similar refusals by Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, Pam Bondi. 'What’s so hard about saying Biden won the 2020 election?' said Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee convening Patel's confirmation hearing Thursday. 'President Biden was certified and sworn in. I don’t know how else to say it,' Patel said. 'The other way to say it is, he won,' Welch replied. 'I can say Trump won. I didn’t vote for him, but he won … You’re so skillful. You understand what I’m asking. Can you say the words, ‘Joe Biden won?’' 'Joe Biden was the president of the United States,' Patel replied. Democrats have hammered Trump nominees over their refusal t...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/30/congress/patel-wont-say-biden-won-2020-election-00201594	2025-01-30T10:37:15-08:00	
Kash Patel declines to detail his grand jury testimony in Trump documents case	Kash Patel, Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the FBI, declined to tell senators what he testified about when he appeared before a grand jury investigating Trump’s handling of classified records after his first term ended. Patel, in late 2022, initially pleaded the fifth when called to appear but was later compelled to testify after the Justice Department granted him testimonial immunity. 'I did not commit a crime,' Patel said under questioning from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) during his confirmation hearing. 'I utilized my constitutional rights during that process with the advice and consent of counsel.' Patel’s lawyer at the time, Stanley Woodward, was among the attorneys Trump tapped to join the White House as a senior adviser. But Patel repeatedly declined to say what he testified about and...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/30/congress/kash-patel-grand-jury-testimony-00201585	2025-01-30T10:13:05-08:00	
Budget Committee advances OMB nominee	Russ Vought is one step closer to returning to the helm of the Office of Management and Budget, which threw Washington into confusion this week with sweeping orders to freeze federal grants and loans.President Donald Trump’s pick to run the powerful White House budget office will head to the Senate floor soon for a confirmation vote, after the Senate Budget Committee advanced Vought’s nomination along party lines on Thursday. The panel voted 11-0 to move Vought’s nomination to the floor – a vote made up entirely of Republicans, as Democrats less than an hour before the scheduled markup announced they would be boycotting the meeting. Instead of attending the markup, Democratic senators gathered at a press conference elsewhere in the Capitol to deride Vought as 'dangerously unfit.'

Kash Patel says warrant requirement for Section 702 searches isn’t practical	Get a warrant' has become a battle cry for many conservative and liberal critics of federal government surveillance programs — but President Donald Trump’s pick for FBI director said Thursday he opposes such a requirement. 'Having a warrant requirement to go through that information in real time is just not comported with the requirement to protect American citizens,' Kash Patel said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. 'It’s almost impossible to make that function and serve the national, no-fail mission.' The U.S. government uses a provision called Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to collect a vast amount data from social media sites, email platforms and other companies. The collection, which doesn’t require a case-by-case warrant...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/30/congress/kash-patel-section-702-fisa-00201550	2025-01-30T08:36:19-08:00	
Democrats to boycott committee vote on OMB nominee	Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee say they will boycott Thursday’s scheduled vote on Russ Vought’s nomination to lead the Office of Management and Budget. It won't affect the panel's ability to send Vought's nomination to the Senate floor, as Budget Committee rules only require 11 members to be present and voting, according to a committee aide for Republicans. But Democrats are nonetheless sending a strong message about their displeasure with the Trump administration's decision to freeze federal funding across the government — and fears that Vought, who led OMB during President Donald Trump's first term, will be a cheerleader in that effort. The committee vote is scheduled for Thursday at noon. Democrats have scheduled a press conference at the same time as counterprogramming the pa...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/30/congress/democrats-vought-omb-funding-freeze-00201526	2025-01-30T08:28:53-08:00	
Cassidy to RFK Jr.: Can I trust you?	Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) put Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the spot about his history of anti-vaccine activism at a hearing of the health panel Cassidy chairs on Thursday, prompting Kennedy to say he would 'apologize for any statement that misled people' about vaccine safety. Cassidy, seen as a crucial vote in determining whether Kennedy will win confirmation as secretary of Health and Human Services, repeatedly pressed Kennedy about whether he would discourage vaccination at HHS or make unfounded claims about vaccines' risks. Cassidy, who treated liver disease as a gastroenterologist before entering politics, began his questioning by recounting the 'worst day' in his medical career, transporting a young woman ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/30/congress/cassidy-to-rfk-jr-can-i-trust-you-00201529	2025-01-30T08:12:35-08:00	
Kash Patel distances himself from Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons and ‘J6 choir’	Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the FBI said Thursday that he disagreed with the president’s decision to end the criminal sentences of Jan. 6 defendants who committed violence against police. 'I do not agree with the commutation of any sentence of any individual who committed violence against law enforcement,' Kash Patel said during questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee. He added that 'I have always advocated for imprisoning those' who cause 'harm to our law enforcement and civilian communities.' Patel also claimed he was unaware of the members of the 'J6 Choir,' a group of Jan. 6 offenders incarcerated for violence against police, despite promoting their recorded rendition of the national anthem.

Kash Patel makes opening pitch for FBI job	President Donald Trump’s controversial FBI director nominee, Kash Patel, is appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee now. In his opening remarks, Patel laid out his vision for the FBI, telling senators that the agency must return to tackling violent crime and committing to transparency for the law enforcement organization. Anticipating questions over his qualifications for the job, Patel told the panel about his years as a public defender, a federal terrorism prosecutor, a senior director for counterterrorism on the National Security Council and a staffer to the director of national intelligence during the first Trump administration. 'If confirmed as the next FBI director, I will remain focused on the FBI’s core mission: that is to investigate fully wherever there is a constitutiona...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/30/congress/kash-patel-fbi-fuchs-00201521	2025-01-30T07:43:22-08:00

Here’s a rundown of what we’re watching. Tulsi Gabbard: Trump’s pick to serve as director of national intelligence will appear before Senate Intel at 10 a.m. At least three Republicans on the panel are undecided: Sens.

Dems launch group to hit Trump on tax cuts	Democrats are launching a tax-focused group as their newest messaging megaphone in an attempt to counter President Donald Trump on one of his signature issues. Organizers said the nonprofit group, Families Over Billionaires, will be backed by an eight-figure funding campaign, which will include advertising, rapid response and surrogate operations. They said the campaign will serve as a centralized war room to attack Trump and Republicans during the looming tax debate in Congress. The details of the group were shared first with POLITICO. The campaign’s launch marks one of the first outside efforts to push back on Trump’s agenda in his second term, as Democrats look to regain ground with voters on economic issues — a major weakness for the party last year.

Democrats prep for Patel in the hot seat	Kash Patel, President Donald Trump’s controversial pick for FBI director, will have his day before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday — and Senate Democrats have been battle-testing their message in hopes it might break through. It started a few weeks ago, when Democrats turned attorney general nominee Pam Bondi’s confirmation hearing into a practice round for Patel’s grilling. There, Democrats brought up the FBI nominee repeatedly, asking Bondi to respond to a variety of incendiary statements Patel had made over the years, including about his plans to go after members of the 'Executive Branch Deep State.' Now, it’s Patel’s turn in the hot seat. 'There's immense am...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/29/congress/kash-patel-fbi-confirmation-trump-00201410	2025-01-29T15:13:15-08:00	
Senate tees up Burgum for confirmation vote for Interior	The Senate voted 78-20 Wednesday to invoke cloture on the nomination of former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to lead the Interior Department. The Senate is expected to vote tomorrow whether to confirm Burgum's nomination. It would put the former governor in the department's top chair as the Trump administration is pushing for spending freezes that would halt Interior's payments to tribal communities and certain energy programs. A federal judge blocked the freeze until 5 p.m. Feb. 3 and two dozen states have filed their own lawsuit to stop the move.

Republicans brace for a messy slog on Capitol Hill	DORAL, Florida — House Republicans came here to President Donald Trump’s resort to map out what’s ahead for their legislative agenda. The big takeaway: It’s looking treacherous. Despite progress on the stated goal of the three-day retreat — coalescing around a fiscal blueprint for their vast party-line agenda — what they saw wasn’t pretty: Key strategic disputes continued to fester inside the GOP ranks, and the uproar from Trump’s federal spending freeze gave vulnerable members a taste of the backlash that could result if they follow through on promised cuts to key programs.

Zeldin has a mandate from Trump to carry out an aggressive deregulatory agenda aimed at boosting domestic energy production and bolstering the increasingly power-hungry data center and artificial intelligence sectors.

Billionaire Howard Lutnick, the pick to lead the Commerce Department, had his turn on Wednesday. Democratic senators on the typically bipartisan Committee on Commerce, Science and Technology had a nearly singular focus on the issue, asking Lutnick if he’d obey orders that defy the law. The freeze caused widespread backlash and was seemingly rescinded by the White House during Lutnick’s confirmation hearing. Sen.

Jack Schlossberg launches hours-long X rant during RFK Jr.’s confirmation hearing	We’re hours into Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s hearing now, and there’s one person who is ALL over it online: Jack Schlossberg. Schlossberg, the chronically online sensation and the only grandson of former president John F. Kennedy, has some choice words on his cousin’s Senate hearing, sharing MSNBC videos and adding his own commentary. Schlossberg and Kennedy have butted heads on politics before. (Schlossberg is notably more liberal-leaning than the would-be secretary of Health and Human Services.) In all caps, Schlossberg is responding in real time to Kennedy's views on abortion and chronic diseases, and is calling out Kennedy for being a 'liar' and a 'guru shaman figure' who runs a cult.

'When was it that you decided to sell out the values you've had your whole life in order to be given power by President Trump?' Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) asked.

Kennedy tells senators he’s not against vaccination, despite past statements	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. opened his confirmation hearings to lead the Department of Health and Human Services by going on the offense, saying he is not anti-vaccine, despite years of sowing doubt about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. 'News reports have claimed that I’m anti-vaccine or anti-industry,' he said. 'I am neither.' When Kennedy said he was not opposed to vaccines, a woman in the hearing room stood up and screamed 'You lie … do no harm,' before she was removed.

Supporters and opponents of RFK Jr. pack hearing room	Supporters and opponents of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. packed the halls of the Senate building where the Finance Committee is vetting him this morning to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. In the long line of people vying to get into the room was Brandon Matlock, a Pennsylvania resident who previously volunteered for Kennedy’s presidential campaign. Kennedy, who first ran as a Democrat then as an independent, dropped out in August and endorsed Donald Trump. Wearing a 'Jail Fauci' shirt, Matlock said he was unconcerned that Kennedy could face questions about his past anti-vaccine rhetoric. 'He’s been defending his views for so long. You’re not going to ruffle his feathers,' he said. Kennedy supporters wore 'Confirm RFK Jr.' shirts and hats, and others bearing Kennedy’s 'Make Ameri...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/29/congress/supporters-and-opponents-of-rfk-jr-pack-hearing-room-00201208	2025-01-29T07:48:21-08:00	
Fetterman lone Democrat so far to attend immigration bill signing	Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman is the first Democrat committed to attending President Donald Trump's signing of the Laken Riley Act, a bill mandating the detention of more undocumented immigrants charged with crimes. 'I believe a secure border creates a more secure nation and it’s just common sense,' Fetterman said in a statement. 'I believe a stronger border is fully compatible with my commitment to immigration.' He also said, 'I also believe our nation should protect our Dreamers,' referring to young people who were brought into the U.S. as children by undocumented immigrants and who many conservatives believe should be deported. The news comes after Sen.

Watchdog group to lend Hill Dems a hand on oversight	A left-leaning watchdog group is working to gather materials that could feed Congressional investigations into the Trump administration. The nonprofit group American Oversight, which shared its plans first with POLITICO, is preparing for a scenario where Democrats reclaim the majority in either the House or Senate in the 2026 midterms, which will give the party the ability to issue subpoenas, schedule committee hearings and launch agency probes. Dubbed the 'Parallel Investigations Initiative,' it will look similar to what American Oversight did during the first Trump administration, when Republicans also enjoyed a governing trifecta. The group used the Freedom of Information Act, litigation and judicial enforcement to force the Trump administration to turn over critical documents, in antic...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/29/congress/democrats-oversight-trump-congress-00201194	2025-01-29T07:23:42-08:00	
Senate committee advances Trump's pick for AG	Donald Trump’s attorney general nominee Pam Bondi, who represented the president during his first impeachment trial, was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday morning in a party-line, 12-10 vote. The former Florida attorney general is expected to be confirmed on the Senate floor. Her confirmation hearing earlier this month went fairly smoothly — so much so that Democrats repeatedly attacked Trump’s pick to run the FBI Kash Patel, who was not even in the room and will have his own confirmation hearing Thursday morning. Democrats have acknowledged Bondi's qualifications, even as they questioned her role in the effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election and her staunch loyalty to the new president.

Capitol agenda: GOP lacks a Trump line, RFK confirmation hearing, last day in Doral	Donald Trump’s federal funding freeze is on ice after an eleventh-hour court order delayed implementation until Feb. 3 — but not before it became crystal clear Republicans don't appear to have any red lines when it comes to the president. First, congressional GOP leaders didn't condemn Trump’s threats to circumvent the Senate’s advise-and-consent role on his nominees. Then, Republican lawmakers caved to the president's push to delay the ban on TikTok — undermining legislation they passed last year.

GOP steps aside as Trump assaults Congress’ power	President Donald Trump has declared an all-out war on congressional power. And his allies on Capitol Hill aren’t doing much to fend off the invasion. From firing a slate of inspectors general to changing citizenship qualifications to delaying a ban on the TikTok app, the president is running roughshod over Congress in his first week back in office. The effort culminated Monday night with a budget office memo freezing 'all federal financial assistance' pending a review by administration political appointees.

Work requirements gain favor with House Republicans	DORAL, Florida — As they work through a sweeping 'menu' of potential spending cuts, House Republicans are facing growing anxiety in their ranks about slashing away at key safety-net programs. But there is one proposal that enjoys broad support inside the GOP: instituting new and expanded work requirements for some of those programs. According to three Republicans who attended a closed-door session at the House GOP retreat Tuesday, members there appeared to coalesce around the work requirements idea — which would generate less savings than other, more far-reaching proposals but is seen as more politically palatable in swing districts.

Vance advises House GOP: Keep it simple	DORAL, Florida — Vice President JD Vance told House Republicans in a closed-door meeting Tuesday that President Donald Trump still prefers to address the approaching debt limit in the GOP's big party-line reconciliation package.

Vance, speaking at the House GOP retreat in Florida, said that way Republicans don't need to negotiate with Democrats to lift the debt ceiling, according to two Republicans in the room who were granted anonymity to describe the private remarks.

Democrats, worried that the bill was too broad and could lead to sanctions against U.S. allies that are ICC member states and U.S. tech companies that provide support to the court, have been trying to negotiate language to address those concerns. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Democrats’ lead negotiator, told reporters those discussions were 'ongoing' about two hours before the procedural vote.

White House defends dramatic federal funding freeze	White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt vehemently defended the administration’s sweeping freeze on federal aid, arguing Tuesday in her first press briefing that it was critical to scrutinize the scope of the government’s spending. 'The reason for this is to ensure that every penny going out the door is not conflicting with the executive orders and action that this president has taken,' Leavitt said. 'This is a very responsible measure.' Leavitt insisted that the freeze would not affect federal assistance that goes directly to individuals, such as Social Security benefits and food aid. But she would not directly answer whether other social service programs that serve people indirectly — such as Meals on Wheels and Medicaid — would be affected.

The son of a Cuban refugee, Acosta said he learned an important lesson: 'It is never a good time to bow down to a tyrant.'

Emhoff will advise the global firm’s corporate clients on crises such as 'sensitive investigations' and 'complex litigation,' the firm said, and will split his time between Los Angeles and New York. Willkie employs over 1,200 attorneys worldwide and is one of the country’s 50 highest grossing law firms, with $1.5 billion in revenue in 2023, according to the American Lawyer.

Some GOP senators want open committee vote on Gabbard	Some Republican senators are pushing for the unusual step of making public a key vote on Tulsi Gabbard's nomination in the Senate Intelligence Committee, in an attempt to exert pressure on the members of a panel that typically does business behind closed doors. Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton is being prodded to make the change by senators allied with President Donald Trump, according to two Senate GOP officials granted anonymity to speak about private conversations. Gabbard is set to face the Senate Intelligence Committee in open and closed sessions on Thursday. Typically, aside from certain public hearings, the panel deliberates and votes in private.

Democrats move to condemn Trump pardons of violent Jan. 6 defendants	Senate Democrats offered a resolution Monday to condemn President Donald Trump’s decision to pardon Jan. 6 defendants who assaulted Capitol Police officers, saying the move invites future political violence. All Democrats but one — Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) — signed onto the resolution. His office did not immediately respond to an inquiry. The one-line resolution indicates that 'the Senate disapproves of any pardons for individuals who were found guilty of assaulting Capitol Police officers.' Though many Trump allies anticipated that he would not pardon or commute sentences for people convicted of assaulting police on Jan. 6, Trump pardoned or ordered the dismissal of charges for ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/27/congress/senate-dems-jan-6-pardons-00200696	2025-01-27T06:19:56-08:00	
Capitol agenda: Johnson's GOP retreat plans, ICC bill, controversial Trump nominees ahead	Speaker Mike Johnson will confront an increasingly anxious House GOP today at Donald Trump’s Doral resort, where they’re holding their annual policy retreat through Wednesday. The big complication: Republicans need to decide which of Trump’s priorities need to be included in their party-line budget reconciliation plan, which is set to touch everything from energy to border security to tax policy, versus the separate, bipartisan spending bill that Republicans have to pass before mid-March.

Cotton: ‘I hope no one would impugn Ms. Gabbard's patriotism’	Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's pick to serve as director of national intelligence, will have a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. In the meantime, committee Chair Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) has a message for her doubters. 'I do hope though that we won’t see anyone questioning her patriotism,' Cotton told host Shannon Bream on 'Fox News Sunday.' 'You know, Hillary Clinton has basically called her a traitor in the past.

House Intel committee must remain focused, Mike Turner says	Rep. Mike Turner, recently displaced as chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday he's concerned about the direction the panel make now take. Speaking on CBS' 'Face the Nation,' Turner (R-Ohio) expressed concerns that the panel might, with encouragement from President Donald Trump, focus too much on internal enemies at the expense of powerful countries than can do America harm. 'The one thing that he has said is that he wanted to take the committee in a different direction. I'm a little concerned, because his different direction indicates pursuing the elusive deep state,' he said. Turner said there are reasons at times to pursue internal enemies, but seemed to worry that could be a dangerous distraction.

Johnson invites Trump to address joint session on March 4	Speaker Mike Johnson on Saturday extended an invitation for President Donald Trump to address a joint session of Congress on March 4, the first in Trump's second presidency. In a letter to the president, Johnson invited Trump to 'share your America First vision for our legislative future,' thanking him for his 'strong leadership and bold action' in the first days of his presidency and asserting that 'America’s Golden Age has begun.'

‘I am terrified’: Workers describe the dark mood inside federal agencies	President Donald Trump’s executive orders targeting the federal workforce have injected a fresh wave of anxiety among employees across the bureaucracy — stoking fears the president is coming for their jobs. Just a few days into Trump’s second term, some federal workers are contemplating quitting. Others are preparing to file grievances with their unions or moving communications with each other to secure platforms like Signal. Some, fearing they’ll be caught up in the White House’s purge of diversity programs, are leaving their names off of memos and documents they worry could be labeled as DEI-adjacent.

Kristi Noem confirmed as DHS secretary	The Senate confirmed Kristi Noem as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security on Saturday, voting to give President Donald Trump another Cabinet official who has pledged to help carry out his aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration. The bipartisan vote was 59-34. No Republicans opposed Noem's nomination. Noem’s final vote follows the Senate’s confirmation of Marco Rubio, who Trump tapped as secretary of State and Pete Hegseth, who will lead the Department of Defense. Republican leaders are working to make good on their promise to press ahead with confirming the president’s Cabinet nominees even as some Democrats raise objections, slowing down the process.

McConnell sends a message	Mitch McConnell might not run the Senate anymore. But he made clear on Friday night that he still knows how to wield power. After days of meeting with silence a steady stream of questions about whether he would support Pete Hegseth’s Defense secretary nomination, McConnell became the third Senate Republican to vote against Hegseth. The move forced Vice President JD Vance to break a tie to get him through, making him the first Cabinet nominee since 2017 to need help from the vice president. And it made clear to Donald Trump that McConnell, a longtime party man, is willing to buck the president even after stepping down from leadership, especially on national security issues.

Hegseth will be Defense secretary. Here's how he plans to upend the Pentagon.	The Senate on Friday confirmed Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary, a triumphant moment for the former Fox News host who overcame allegations of sexual misconduct, alcohol abuse and inexperience to attain one of the country’s most crucial positions. Republicans largely rebuffed those accusations and approved Hegseth with the help of Vice President JD Vance, who broke a rare 50-50 tie, in the first big nomination fight for President Donald Trump’s Cabinet. Hegseth’s confirmation could smooth the way for other controversial Trump administration picks. He will enter the Pentagon with a stated desire — and a mandate from the president — to upend traditional practices, from the role of top generals to where U.S. forces are stationed overseas.

Not gonna fly:' Senate Republicans cool on recess appointments	Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) pitched Senate Republicans on Friday about allowing President Donald Trump to make recess appointments. By his own admission, it didn’t gain traction. Johnson made his case to his Senate GOP colleagues during a closed-door lunch meeting as the chamber is staring down the possibility of a rare weekend session as it slogs through Trump’s Cabinet picks amid Democratic slow-walking. Asked afterward if his colleagues were interested in the idea, Johnson said, 'No, not at this point in time.' Johnson added that, 'if we can grind through this process,' Republicans can get close to reaching the pace of confirmations during the Obama years and his Senate GOP colleagues would be 'OK just maintaining the process' rather than allowing recess appointments.

House Democrats worry a repeat loser will ruin their chances in a Michigan battleground	Some Democrats are worried the third time will not be the charm for a failed congressional candidate. Carl Marlinga, a septuagenarian former judge and attorney, is telling Michigan Democrats that he plans to run again against GOP Rep. John James, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations who were granted anonymity to reveal private discussions. That's sparked concerns among Democrats in Michigan and in Washington who believe he will once again tank their chances in the crucial battleground district. Marlinga ran in the 2022 midterms, coming within a fraction of a point of besting James in what was then a newly created southeastern Michigan seat.

'I was very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that,' Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Friday.

But unless Democrats are willing to flirt with a government shutdown or a potential debt default, they’re likely stuck with the deal, or one similar to it. One House Democrat says his party isn’t willing to make those threats. 'The one thing that has united Democrats, in my entire career here, is a commitment to do what's necessary to govern, to keep the government open and to work to improve the lives of the people we all represent, whether that's lowering costs or helping them in a time of crisis,' said Rep.

'Giving him a window of opportunity to make significant progress — I support that,' said the Kentucky Republican in his first public comments on Trump’s actions. 'I also understand the confines that we have in the law.' Guthrie’s comments are notable in that his panel, then chaired by retired Rep.

'I don't understand what the president is doing,' said Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Senate confirms Ratcliffe as new CIA director	The Senate voted by a wide margin Thursday to confirm John Ratcliffe as the next CIA director. The former Republican congressman and director of national intelligence was confirmed by a 74-25 vote. He faced only modest resistance from Senate Democrats, who had stalled Ratcliffe's nomination for days over concerns that he would politicize the agency’s work — as President Donald Trump has called for overhauls in the nation’s intelligence community. Ratcliffe is only the second Trump Cabinet nominee to get confirmed since the new president was sworn in Monday, as Republicans have prioritized national security picks.

Murkowski announces she’ll oppose Hegseth	Sen. Lisa Murkowski will oppose Pete Hegseth's nomination for Defense secretary, making her the first Republican to come out against President Donald Trump's Pentagon pick. Murkowski announced her decision Thursday on social media ahead of a pivotal vote to advance Hegseth's confirmation. The Alaska Republican cited 'significant concerns' with the nominee. 'After thorough evaluation, I must conclude that I cannot in good conscience support his nomination for Secretary of Defense,' Murkowski posted on X. 'I did not make this decision lightly.'

Tulsi Gabbard gets Jan. 30 Intelligence hearing	The Senate Intelligence Committee will hold a hearing on Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination to be director of national intelligence on Thursday, Jan. 30. Gabbard is one of President Donald Trump’s most controversial nominees — with open speculation over whether she can be confirmed. At least two Republican members of the Intelligence Committee remain on the fence, raising the prospect that she could be at risk of not even advancing out of the panel. Republicans are watching closely to see how she does in the hearing, as well as a closed-door session that will immediately follow the public grilling. The scheduling of Gabbard’s hearing follows days of delay as the committee waited for a background check.

Jeffries draws red line on debt-for-aid deal: 'Nonstarter'	Top House Democrats are pouring cold water on a Republican proposal to trade a debt limit increase for California wildfire aid, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries telling reporters it was a 'nonstarter.' He did not address whether Democrats would be willing to parlay on a more expansive deal that would include government funding ahead of a March 14 deadline, as some Republicans are starting to discuss. But he did set some red lines for those potential talks.

Senate panel advances Turner for HUD on party-line vote	The Senate Banking Committee voted 13-11, along party lines, on Thursday to advance Scott Turner’s nomination to be secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, with Democrats voting no over concerns about Turner’s unfinished FBI background check. If confirmed by the full Senate, the NFL veteran and former developer would run a department with a $70 billion budget and roughly 8,000 employees at a time when housing has risen to the forefront politically after costs soared in the wake of the pandemic. Turner told the committee during his confirmation hearing last week that 'HUD is failing at its most basic mission,' pointing to the high cost of housing and a recent surge in homelessness.

Majority Leader John Thune appears to be making good on his threat to keep senators in town to confirm a trio of President Donald Trump’s nominees, after Democrats delayed CIA pick John Ratcliffe and continue to raise concerns about Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary. And Republicans are responding to Trump's renewed talk of recess appointments by saying they're not going to have a recess until all of his Cabinet nominees are confirmed. That could take a while.

Lutnick will appear before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on Jan. 29, Chair Ted Cruz’s office announced Wednesday. Like several other of Trump’s Cabinet picks, Lutnick’s hearing was delayed due to paperwork issues, Cruz said in an interview last week.

GOP leaders mull a big debt-and-funding deal with Democrats	House and Senate GOP leaders are internally debating a possible deal with Democrats that would include government funding, California wildfire aid, a debt-limit hike and border security money, according to two Republicans with direct knowledge of the matter. Senior Republicans have been privately mulling a bipartisan government funding deal for weeks now, wary that they may not be able to add a debt-limit hike to their party-line reconciliation package given internal GOP divisions over the matter. But conversations around the potential larger deal have heated up in recent days as GOP leaders try to figure out how to lift the approaching debt ceiling while also advancing a massive, party-line reconciliation bill and avoiding a March 15 government shutdown.

Senate Dems block GOP's first abortion bill	A GOP-led abortion bill failed in the Senate due to Democratic opposition on Wednesday, a sign of where the party is drawing the line on bipartisan cooperation. After a week marked by Senate Democrats' willingness to work with their Republican counterparts on both an immigration bill and confirming former Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of State, every Democrat voted against legislation that would 'prohibit a health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion.'

Trump’s budget pick is famous for defying Congress. GOP senators want to confirm him anyway.	Senate Republicans are eager to seat the man who could undercut their funding power. As President Donald Trump boldly defies the will of Congress by issuing executive orders freezing billions of dollars in federal cash that lawmakers have approved in recent years, Senate Republicans are still speaking accolades of Russ Vought, the president’s pick for White House budget director and the man famous for withholding government money during Trump’s first administration. Key committee chairs are predicting that the Senate will confirm Vought without issue to head the Office of Management and Budget again, even as some GOP senators raise concern about protecting Congress’ 'power of the purse' — granted under Article I of the Constitution — from presidential overreach.

'While that’s your right, in working together on a bipartisan basis, we can achieve the best outcome for the American people.

New York, New Jersey and California Republicans made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago recently to reiterate their demands to lift the so-called SALT cap, which limits the deduction to $10,000, in negotiations over a large tax bill. The lawmakers say the cap is harming constituents in their politically competitive, high-tax districts.

'The math is in our favor. We’re on offense,' Hudson told House Republicans during their closed-door meeting Wednesday morning at the Capitol Hill Club, according to two people in the room.

The Reluctant Steamroller in the White House	Just hours into his second presidency, Donald Trump was already bulldozing congressional Republicans. He granted clemency to some 1,500 Jan. 6 offenders, some of them convicted of violent assaults. He flouted a bipartisan TikTok ban, ordering it to remain unenforced. And he moved to cancel some of his predecessor’s energy programs over the pleadings of some in the GOP who wanted him to wait — to name just a few of the ways he undercut members of his own party. A day later, it was as if a switch had been flipped.

Jules Feiffer, Pulitzer-winning cartoonist and writer known for lacerating wit, dies at 95	NEW YORK — Jules Feiffer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist and writer whose prolific output ranged from a long-running comic strip to plays, screenplays and children’s books, died Friday. He was 95 and, true to his seemingly tireless form, published his last book just four months ago. Feiffer’s wife, writer JZ Holden, said Tuesday that he died of congestive heart failure at their home in Richfield Springs, New York, and was surrounded by friends, the couple’s two cats and his recent artwork. Holden said her husband had been ill for a couple of years, 'but he was sharp and strong up until the very end. And funny.'

CIA director pick John Ratcliffe is expected to get a relatively smooth bipartisan confirmation on Tuesday. But after that, more controversial nominees await, and cooperation could be hard to come by.

It’s unclear which of Trump’s executive actions will have immediate impact or are merely symbolic. But they’re already facing challenges.

'The idea is that peaceful protesters should not be detained and anybody who committed violent offenses — that was something they talked about,' Johnson said, trailing off. 'I haven't seen the list. I haven't had a chance to evaluate it.'

Senate panel advances Bessent nomination	Scott Bessent, President Donald Trump’s pick for Treasury secretary, won bipartisan support Tuesday as his nomination cleared a Senate committee. The Senate Finance Committee voted 16-11 to advance Bessent’s nomination, clearing the way for a Senate floor vote in the coming days. Two Democrats — Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) — joined with the committee’s Republicans in supporting Bessent for the top economic job in Trump’s Cabinet.	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/21/scott-bessent-senate-committee-vote-00199639	2025-01-21T07:31:51-08:00	https://static.politico.com/7c/8e/e70cfbc341ed84e8405e81573cc0/scott-bessent-trumps-cabinet-hearings-16578.jpg
GOP leaders' White House summit takes shape	A broad group of House and Senate GOP leaders will meet with President Donald Trump at the White House today at 3 p.m., according to two people familiar with the plans. Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune are expected to meet with Trump first before the larger group joins. It's their first business meeting since Trump took the oath of office Monday, and GOP leaders are hoping to hammer out more details there on how exactly they’re expected to accomplish his ambitious legislative agenda. After the top leaders meet with Trump, the expanded group will join. That includes, from the House, Majority Leader Steve Scalise (La.), Whip Tom Emmer (Minn.), Conference Chair Lisa McClain (Mich.) and Policy Committee Chair Kevin Hern (Okla.). From the Senate, Whip John Barrasso (Wy...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/21/congress/white-house-meeting-details-00199631	2025-01-21T07:16:18-08:00	
The Capitol agenda: Trump meeting, nominees and TikTok drama	After signing a flurry of executive orders, President Donald Trump will shift to his Capitol Hill agenda Tuesday in a White House meeting with Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune. The new Republican trifecta has much to discuss. GOP lawmakers want more guidance on whether they’ll be expected to cram Trump’s priorities on the border, energy and taxes into one bill or two. They also want directions on spending limits needed to pass government funding legislation by mid-March and clarity on how to handle the debt limit, as the U.S. faces a potential default in the months ahead.

Trump repeals rule allowing transgender troops to serve in military	President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday night that repeals a provision allowing transgender troops to serve in the military, part of a wide-ranging effort to end Biden-era policies his first day in office. Trump issued a ban during his first administration that prevented transgender troops from serving, which former President Joe Biden eliminated. While Trump did not institute a new ban, the repeal of the Biden-era executive order clears the way for one.

Trump: ‘We don’t need’ Latin America	President Donald Trump issued a stark message Monday to would-be economic and strategic partners in Latin America: The U.S. doesn’t need you. Speaking from the Oval Office after signing a spate of executive orders, Trump was asked about relations with Latin America and Brazil and said the relationship 'should be great.' But he made it clear who needs who more in the relationship. 'They need us much more than we need them. We don't need them,' he said. 'They need us. Everybody needs us.' Those comments seem poised to deflate hopes of some in Latin America that Trump would refocus resources on shoring up ties with countries in the Americas.

Senate unanimously confirms Rubio as secretary of State	Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was confirmed Monday as secretary of State, the first of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks to take office. In becoming secretary of State, Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, also makes history as the highest-ranking U.S. politician of Latino and Hispanic descent to date. Rubio experienced a relatively easy and trouble-free confirmation process. The third-term Florida lawmaker was the top Republican member of the selective Senate Intelligence Committee and served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Not a single senator opposed his nomination on the Senate floor and he faced no opposition in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee markup that preceded it. But there’s been debate around Washington as to how long Rubio will remain in the role, given that...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/17/congress/its-official-for-rubio-00199519	2025-01-20T15:52:27-08:00

Trump airs 2020 election grievances after being sworn into a second term	Four years after President Donald Trump helped incite a mob to storm the Capitol to block the certification of the 2020 election he lost, he took aim at his political enemies — including the select panel that investigated the violent event. Trump promised the crowd in the inauguration’s 'overflow room' in the Capitol Visitors Center, following his formal inaugural remarks in the Rotunda: 'You’re going to see a lot of action on J6 hostages.' He has floated pardoning the rioters, many of whom are facing formal criminal charges. Trump also took aim at the last-minute pardons and commutations President Joe Biden issued in his final hours in office, including those who served on a select committee tasked with looking into the role Trump played in circumventing the 2020 election results that cul...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/17/congress/trump-inauguration-speech-overflow-00199390	2025-01-20T11:02:24-08:00	
Top Republican blasts Raskin for Biden pardon	House Oversight and Government Reform Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) delivered a blistering statement against his former Democratic counterpart on the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who received a preemptive pardon from outgoing President Joe Biden on Monday. 'Jamie Raskin will be remembered for his abuse of power, hypocrisy, consistent dishonesty, and unwavering loyalty to Joe Biden, despite evidence showing that Biden and his family were involved in peddling influence for tens of millions of dollars with our adversaries around the world,' said Comer. 'Jamie Raskin once claimed that ‘the seeking of pardons is a powerful demonstration of the consciousness of guilt, or at least the consciousness that you may be in trouble.’ It’s clear that the chickens have come home to roost for Jamie Ra...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/17/congress/jamie-raskin-pardon-j6-00199291	2025-01-20T07:54:27-08:00

We're running out of time': GOP already antsy on Trump’s Hill agenda	Welcome to the Washington trifecta, Republicans. Now get ready to wait. Even as the GOP takes unified control of the House, Senate and White House on Monday, congressional leaders are facing doubts about just how quickly they will be able to deliver major wins for Donald Trump. Their legislative plans are highly unsettled, and the clock is ticking toward distracting fights over federal spending and the debt limit. And when it comes to the heart of Trump’s agenda — a sprawling party-line effort encompassing border, energy and tax policy — key strategic questions remain in flux. Once they agree on the general direction of travel, leaders will then have to navigate a thicket of nasty intraparty disputes on the policies themselves.

Why Trump supporters see sunshine in Trump’s dark and foreboding speeches	The first time Donald Trump gave an inaugural address, official Washington winced. It was a scorching and dystopian assessment of what he cast as a country in ruins — this 'American carnage,' Trump said. And it was, as George W. Bush reportedly called it, 'some weird shit.' But that’s not how much of Trump’s MAGA base remembers it. Like Trump, they, too, saw a hollowed-out nation in 2017. But what Trump’s supporters mostly recalled in the president-elect — and the repeat performance they are preparing for on Monday — is redemption.

‘Not enough room’: Lawmakers fret about indoor inauguration	The last-minute move to bring President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration indoors could leave some members of Congress out in the cold. Perhaps not literally: No one is expected to be seated outside in 25-degree bluster. But the possibility that not all lawmakers might get seats in the Rotunda for the oath-of-office ceremony has cast a chill over the occasion in some congressional offices, according to four lawmakers and aides. 'Simply put, there’s not enough room,' one senior Republican aide said. 'It’s a shitshow.' The initial guidance from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies after Trump’s team decided to move things indoors on Friday was that 't...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/19/trump-inauguration-rotunda-congress-004800	2025-01-19T13:43:05-08:00	https://static.politico.com/57/15/f0dca855496ab92debba3ab5e268/inauguration-57288.jpg

Trump hires fed-firing mastermind	President-elect Donald Trump is bringing back a senior White House official who led his first-term push to make it easier to fire civil servants. James Sherk, who served as a special assistant on domestic policy during Trump’s first term, will return to serve in the White House Domestic Policy Council, Trump announced Saturday. Sherk has worked at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute during the Biden administration. Sherk was central to the Trump administration’s efforts to make it easier to fire some federal employees using a classification called Schedule F. That effort generated an outcry from civil servants, and the Biden administration moved quickly to reverse course. But the effort 'could — and should — be reissued by another president,' Sherk wrote in a 2022 Wall Stre...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/18/trump-hires-fed-firing-mastermind-00199154	2025-01-18T11:36:44-08:00	https://static.politico.com/76/68/ac5fbe53477a92f06e69e390f343/1594391562082.jpg

Actually, it was about power — not the incoming president’s, but Johnson’s.

Barely more than 2,000 people will pack into the Capitol Rotunda for a cold-weather inaugural ceremony backup plan not seen since Ronald Reagan. The call to move the swearing in and inaugural address indoors was made by the Trump team, but the pivot will have to be executed by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and hundreds of workers across Capitol Hill — who have less than 72 hours to pull off a huge pivot.

That’s because two jury trials launched this week by President Joe Biden’s DOJ have not yet reached verdicts and are slated to continue into the first days of the Trump administration. Unless Trump pulls the plug on trials that are already reaching their final phase, it will be his DOJ that sees them through, perhaps as early as Tuesday. Trump could extend blanket pardons to all Jan. 6 defendants, which would short-circuit ongoing trials.

DeWine passes over Ramaswamy, will select Jon Husted for Senate	Gov. Mike DeWine has selected his own Lt. Gov.

Two sources, granted anonymity to speak freely about the appointment, confirmed that DeWine will pick Husted. DeWine is expected to make the announcement at 1p.m. Husted, a Republican more in DeWine’s institutionalist mold, had long planned to run for governor in 2026 to succeed DeWine. His ascent to the Senate will likely scramble the field in that race.
