‘I am terrified’: Workers describe the dark mood inside federal agencies	President Donald Trump’s executive orders targeting the federal workforce have injected a fresh wave of anxiety among employees across the bureaucracy — stoking fears the president is coming for their jobs. Just a few days into Trump’s second term, some federal workers are contemplating quitting. Others are preparing to file grievances with their unions or moving communications with each other to secure platforms like Signal. Some, fearing they’ll be caught up in the White House’s purge of diversity programs, are leaving their names off of memos and documents they worry could be labeled as DEI-adjacent. As federal employees searched this week for clues within the orders to see how they’ll be affected, a staffer with the Environmental Protection Agency said they were cleaning out their inbo...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/25/federal-workers-trump-dei-00200588	2025-01-25T13:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/14/ec/781e5ef94fa99b698cfdc2988583/justice-department-22716.jpg
Kristi Noem confirmed as DHS secretary	The Senate confirmed Kristi Noem as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security on Saturday, voting to give President Donald Trump another Cabinet official who has pledged to help carry out his aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration. The bipartisan vote was 59-34. No Republicans opposed Noem's nomination. Noem’s final vote follows the Senate’s confirmation of Marco Rubio, who Trump tapped as secretary of State and Pete Hegseth, who will lead the Department of Defense. Republican leaders are working to make good on their promise to press ahead with confirming the president’s Cabinet nominees even as some Democrats raise objections, slowing down the process. The South Dakota governor’s ascension to DHS came as a surprise in some quarters. She doesn’t have a law enforcement backgrou...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/25/kristi-noem-confirmed-homeland-security-00002088	2025-01-25T09:02:16-08:00	https://static.politico.com/5c/9e/f3c5b23a4a3e93964ca4a51e5580/kristi-noem-hearing-trump-cabinet-picks-43294.jpg
McConnell sends a message	Mitch McConnell might not run the Senate anymore. But he made clear on Friday night that he still knows how to wield power. After days of meeting with silence a steady stream of questions about whether he would support Pete Hegseth’s Defense secretary nomination, McConnell became the third Senate Republican to vote against Hegseth. The move forced Vice President JD Vance to break a tie to get him through, making him the first Cabinet nominee since 2017 to need help from the vice president. And it made clear to Donald Trump that McConnell, a longtime party man, is willing to buck the president even after stepping down from leadership, especially on national security issues. McConnell, in a lengthy statement, warned that whoever leads the Pentagon faces a 'daily test with staggering conseque...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/24/pete-hegseth-vote-mcconnell-006649	2025-01-24T20:02:31-08:00	https://static.politico.com/15/70/47676b554717943e691b60a4da32/brooke-rollins-confirmation-hearing-95054.jpg
Hegseth will be Defense secretary. Here's how he plans to upend the Pentagon.	The Senate on Friday confirmed Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary, a triumphant moment for the former Fox News host who overcame allegations of sexual misconduct, alcohol abuse and inexperience to attain one of the country’s most crucial positions. Republicans largely rebuffed those accusations and approved Hegseth with the help of Vice President JD Vance, who broke a rare 50-50 tie, in the first big nomination fight for President Donald Trump’s Cabinet. Hegseth’s confirmation could smooth the way for other controversial Trump administration picks. He will enter the Pentagon with a stated desire — and a mandate from the president — to upend traditional practices, from the role of top generals to where U.S. forces are stationed overseas. The new Pentagon leader embodies Trump’s grievances, ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/24/hegseth-confirmed-defense-secretary-senate-00200603	2025-01-24T18:53:19-08:00	https://static.politico.com/8c/b1/6316e952438e9182658058429642/pete-hegseth-trumps-cabinet-hearings-89710.jpg
Florida Republican says deportation effort should spare some migrants	A South Florida Republican is urging President Donald Trump to spare hundreds of thousands of people from Latin America and the Caribbean from his immigration crackdown. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar called on the Department of Homeland Security in a letter Friday not to remove people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who were allowed to enter the U.S. by President Joe Biden’s administration under a humanitarian parole program. 'Although President Biden originally created this program on dubious legal grounds and brought individuals here without a plan for their future, they were still enrolled under programs offered to them.

Republicans plan slew of reconciliation meetings at their Florida retreat	House Republicans are eager to hear a game plan from GOP leaders about their massive legislative agenda during their conference retreat next week in Florida. One thing is certain — they’ll have a raft of meetings to attend, if they choose. The conference is set to kickoff at 3:30 p.m. Monday at President Donald Trump’s Doral resort, with Trump expected to join Speaker Mike Johnson and his conference for a 7 p.m. dinner and reception.

Not gonna fly:' Senate Republicans cool on recess appointments	Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) pitched Senate Republicans on Friday about allowing President Donald Trump to make recess appointments. By his own admission, it didn’t gain traction. Johnson made his case to his Senate GOP colleagues during a closed-door lunch meeting as the chamber is staring down the possibility of a rare weekend session as it slogs through Trump’s Cabinet picks amid Democratic slow-walking. Asked afterward if his colleagues were interested in the idea, Johnson said, 'No, not at this point in time.' Johnson added that, 'if we can grind through this process,' Republicans can get close to reaching the pace of confirmations during the Obama years and his Senate GOP colleagues would be 'OK just maintaining the process' rather than allowing recess appointments.

Trump’s Commerce nominee Lutnick details extent of wealth	Howard Lutnick, President Donald Trump’s pick to run the Department of Commerce, revealed hundreds of millions of dollars in assets and income in a new financial disclosure form and ethics agreement released Friday — including more than $200 million in income and distributions from his Wall Street firm over the past two years alone. Lutnick also formally reiterated his promise to resign from his position at his financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald and divest from a variety of business interests if he’s confirmed, according to the ethics agreement.

House Democrats worry a repeat loser will ruin their chances in a Michigan battleground	Some Democrats are worried the third time will not be the charm for a failed congressional candidate. Carl Marlinga, a septuagenarian former judge and attorney, is telling Michigan Democrats that he plans to run again against GOP Rep. John James, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations who were granted anonymity to reveal private discussions. That's sparked concerns among Democrats in Michigan and in Washington who believe he will once again tank their chances in the crucial battleground district. Marlinga ran in the 2022 midterms, coming within a fraction of a point of besting James in what was then a newly created southeastern Michigan seat. He tried again two years later and lost by 6 points. (He also ran in 2002.)

Trump ‘very surprised’ at Collins, Murkowski over Hegseth vote	President Donald Trump took notice on Friday of two old sparring partners — Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who voted against advancing Pete Hegseth’s Defense secretary nomination Thursday. 'I was very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that,' Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Friday. The two moderate Republicans vote with their party most of the time, but came under intense scrutiny during the first Trump administration because of their willingness to break ranks on some high-profile votes, including Cabinet and judicial nominees and a high-stakes GOP health care plan. Thursday’s vote suggested Collins and Murkowski...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/24/congress/trump-collins-murkowski-00200462	2025-01-24T08:31:21-08:00	
Capitol agenda: Spending heats up, Hegseth up in the Senate, House GOP retreat	Democrats are widely opposed to pairing the debt limit and wildfire aid — two key parts of a spending proposal GOP leaders are circling behind closed doors. But unless Democrats are willing to flirt with a government shutdown or a potential debt default, they’re likely stuck with the deal, or one similar to it. One House Democrat says his party isn’t willing to make those threats. 'The one thing that has united Democrats, in my entire career here, is a commitment to do what's necessary to govern, to keep the government open and to work to improve the lives of the people we all represent, whether that's lowering costs or helping them in a time of crisis,' said Rep.

Bipartisan funding negotiations begin in Congress ahead of March shutdown cliff	Republican funding leaders have made an opening offer to Democrats as the two parties launch negotiations toward a deal to fund the government before the mid-March shutdown deadline. Congress’ top appropriators gathered privately Thursday evening in the Capitol for an hour-long 'four corners' meeting — the first concrete step toward a bipartisan funding agreement as Republican leaders begin to embrace the idea of a cross-party accord that funds the government and raises the debt limit, while also potentially boosting disaster aid and border security funding. The beginning of negotiations follows months of inaction on a bipartisan government funding plan, after lawmakers first pun...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/23/bipartisan-funding-negotiations-begin-in-congress-ahead-of-march-shutdown-cliff-00200393	2025-01-23T16:41:30-08:00	https://static.politico.com/b6/d9/2378f2c24e2e8cc99b6daf498116/congress-budget-29447.jpg
E&C Chair Guthrie talks TikTok, AI, privacy	House Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie said Thursday he's in favor of President Donald Trump’s decision to extend the deadline for TikTok to divest from Chinese ownership. 'Giving him a window of opportunity to make significant progress — I support that,' said the Kentucky Republican in his first public comments on Trump’s actions. 'I also understand the confines that we have in the law.' Guthrie’s comments are notable in that his panel, then chaired by retired Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), led the charge last year to pass legislation, 50-0, to force TikTok to find a new buyer by a certain deadline or shut down. The bill included language allowing for a 90-day extension if 'significant progr...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/23/congress/e-c-chair-guthrie-talks-tiktok-ai-privacy-00200367	2025-01-23T16:20:00-08:00	
Congress finds Trump's TikTok sale scheme confusing, possibly illegal	Members of Congress are declaring themselves bewildered by Donald Trump’s latest proposal to save TikTok by brokering a joint-ownership deal. 'I don’t know what he means by that,' said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), of Trump’s suggestion to broker a 'joint venture' in which 'the U.S. should be entitled to get half of TikTok.' 'I don't understand what the president is doing,' said Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Trump has promised to hash out a deal to keep TikTok in business, despite a law that ordered its parent company to divest by last Sunday. His solution is a split-ownership arrangement that may involve the U.S. itself owning a share of the company.

Kamala Harris provides a big signal about her next move	Kamala Harris hasn’t made any public decisions about what her political future is going to be — but she has already created the organization that will help fuel it. The former vice president established an LLC called Pioneer49 last month in her home state of California, according to her presidential campaign's final financial disclosure that was filed last week and confirmed by a person familiar with the organization's plans. The disclosure form described the organization as an 'entity to assist the former vice president' and is likely to help fuel Harris’ next political move. 'Pioneer' is Harris’ code name used by the Secret Service, and her LLC takes on the same naming convention used by former President Barack Obama in creating the organization Renegade44 when he left office.

Johnson noted the House Budget Committee, which handles writing instructions on the bill, is set to meet the week following the retreat. 'So now's the time for us to finalize the plans and have a blueprint for that.

The Senate voted 51-49 to cut off debate on Hegseth’s nomination, setting up a final vote that could come as late as this weekend. All Democrats opposed moving forward with his confirmation. Two Republicans, Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine also came out in opposition to Hegseth.

Senate confirms Ratcliffe as new CIA director	The Senate voted by a wide margin Thursday to confirm John Ratcliffe as the next CIA director. The former Republican congressman and director of national intelligence was confirmed by a 74-25 vote. He faced only modest resistance from Senate Democrats, who had stalled Ratcliffe's nomination for days over concerns that he would politicize the agency’s work — as President Donald Trump has called for overhauls in the nation’s intelligence community. Ratcliffe is only the second Trump Cabinet nominee to get confirmed since the new president was sworn in Monday, as Republicans have prioritized national security picks. Democrats have resisted attempts to speed up the process, only greenlighting former Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) as secretary of State on Monday.

Tulsi Gabbard gets Jan. 30 Intelligence hearing	The Senate Intelligence Committee will hold a hearing on Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination to be director of national intelligence on Thursday, Jan. 30. Gabbard is one of President Donald Trump’s most controversial nominees — with open speculation over whether she can be confirmed. At least two Republican members of the Intelligence Committee remain on the fence, raising the prospect that she could be at risk of not even advancing out of the panel. Republicans are watching closely to see how she does in the hearing, as well as a closed-door session that will immediately follow the public grilling.

If confirmed by the full Senate, the NFL veteran and former developer would run a department with a $70 billion budget and roughly 8,000 employees at a time when housing has risen to the forefront politically after costs soared in the wake of the pandemic. Turner told the committee during his confirmation hearing last week that 'HUD is failing at its most basic mission,' pointing to the high cost of housing and a recent surge in homelessness.

Senior Republicans have been privately mulling a bipartisan government funding deal for weeks now, wary that they may not be able to add a debt-limit hike to their party-line reconciliation package given internal GOP divisions over the matter. But conversations around the potential larger deal have heated up in recent days as GOP leaders try to figure out how to lift the approaching debt ceiling while also advancing a massive, party-line reconciliation bill and avoiding a March 15 government shutdown.

Senate Dems block GOP's first abortion bill	A GOP-led abortion bill failed in the Senate due to Democratic opposition on Wednesday, a sign of where the party is drawing the line on bipartisan cooperation. After a week marked by Senate Democrats' willingness to work with their Republican counterparts on both an immigration bill and confirming former Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of State, every Democrat voted against legislation that would 'prohibit a health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion.' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had come out against the bill ahead of the vote, and other Democrats who opposed it say the law already requires doctors to give children appropriate medical care.

Trump’s budget pick is famous for defying Congress. GOP senators want to confirm him anyway.	Senate Republicans are eager to seat the man who could undercut their funding power. As President Donald Trump boldly defies the will of Congress by issuing executive orders freezing billions of dollars in federal cash that lawmakers have approved in recent years, Senate Republicans are still speaking accolades of Russ Vought, the president’s pick for White House budget director and the man famous for withholding government money during Trump’s first administration. Key committee chairs are predicting that the Senate will confirm Vought without issue to head the Office of Management and Budget again, even as some GOP senators raise concern about protecting Congress’ 'power of the purse' — granted under Article I of the Constitution — from presidential overreach.

Democrats' immigration debate plays out inside Hispanic Caucus	With Democrats poised to deliver an early immigration victory to President Donald Trump, members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus split over how to approach the issue in a closed-door meeting Wednesday morning. Some discussed using Democrats' limited political leverage under unified GOP rule: Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) floated conditioning Democratic support for a debt-limit increase on protections for Dreamers — undocumented migrants brought to the U.S. as children. Reps.

Democratic senators ask for bipartisan immigration talks	A group of 12 Democratic senators, led by Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, asked Majority Leader John Thune Wednesday to pursue bipartisan immigration-related legislation instead of the party-line approach Republicans are currently planning for. 'We understand that Senate Republicans have discussed using the budget reconciliation process to advance border security budget measures without any Democratic input,' the senators wrote in the letter. 'While that’s your right, in working together on a bipartisan basis, we can achieve the best outcome for the American people. They added: 'There are also limitations to what can be done under budget reconciliation, and as we’ve seen time and time again, no party has all the solutions on this or any issue.'

Trump to meet with Republican key to tax negotiations	Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), a leader in the effort to lift the limit on a state and local tax deduction some key House Republicans are demanding, said at a POLITICO Playbook event on Wednesday morning that he will be meeting with President Donald Trump on Wednesday. New York, New Jersey and California Republicans made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago recently to reiterate their demands to lift the so-called SALT cap, which limits the deduction to $10,000, in negotiations over a large tax bill. The lawmakers say the cap is harming constituents in their politically competitive, high-tax districts. Their votes will be crucial to passing a major tax bill GOP lawmakers are assembling.	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/22/trump-meeting-salt-republicans-00199887	2025-01-22T07:10:23-08:00	https://static.politico.com/2d/65/1907ddc94886b7ffb26097cbb6f8/0t1a0511.jpg
NRCC chief digs in for midterms: ’The math is in our favor’	NRCC Chair Richard Hudson on Wednesday tried to rally House Republicans ahead of their tough battle to keep their majority in the upcoming midterms, with many GOP lawmakers wary they’ll lose a swath of seats in 2026. 'The math is in our favor. We’re on offense,' Hudson told House Republicans during their closed-door meeting Wednesday morning at the Capitol Hill Club, according to two people in the room. He did acknowledge a big challenge will be turning out Trump voters who are less engaged in nonpresidential election years, the people said. The current House Republican majority is razor-thin after GOP candidates won fewer seats than many expected last year despite President Donald Trump’s win.

The Reluctant Steamroller in the White House	Just hours into his second presidency, Donald Trump was already bulldozing congressional Republicans. He granted clemency to some 1,500 Jan. 6 offenders, some of them convicted of violent assaults. He flouted a bipartisan TikTok ban, ordering it to remain unenforced. And he moved to cancel some of his predecessor’s energy programs over the pleadings of some in the GOP who wanted him to wait — to name just a few of the ways he undercut members of his own party. A day later, it was as if a switch had been flipped. In a meeting Tuesday with top GOP leaders, he didn’t move to settle key strategic disputes over raising the debt limit and passing the party’s big domestic policy package.

Jules Feiffer, Pulitzer-winning cartoonist and writer known for lacerating wit, dies at 95	NEW YORK — Jules Feiffer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist and writer whose prolific output ranged from a long-running comic strip to plays, screenplays and children’s books, died Friday. He was 95 and, true to his seemingly tireless form, published his last book just four months ago. Feiffer’s wife, writer JZ Holden, said Tuesday that he died of congestive heart failure at their home in Richfield Springs, New York, and was surrounded by friends, the couple’s two cats and his recent artwork. Holden said her husband had been ill for a couple of years, 'but he was sharp and strong up until the very end. And funny.' Artistically limber, Feiffer hopscotched among numerous forms of expression, chronicling the curiosity of childhood, urban angst and other societal currents.

Democrats plot strategy for fighting Trump on funding freeze	Less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump’s Day One blitz of executive actions, Democrats on Capitol Hill mobilized Tuesday to fight his move to freeze a broad range of federal cash. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and other top House Democrats held a private call on Tuesday with more than 100 people, including leaders of outside groups, to discuss government funding strategy and how to stop Trump from violating so-called impoundment law by usurping Congress’ 'power of the purse,' according to three people familiar with the call.

Judiciary Committee eyes next week for FBI nominee's confirmation hearing	The Senate Judiciary Committee intends to hold a confirmation hearing for President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the FBI, Kash Patel, on Jan. 29, committee ranking member Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters on Tuesday. If that date stands, it would coincide with the panel's scheduled vote the same day to report out the nomination of Pam Bondi, Trump's selection for attorney general. Durbin, along with Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), said he has now received Patel’s background investigation materials, which are required for every Cabinet nomination in advance of a confirmation hearing. Durbin emphasized, however, that he would not be supporting Patel’s confirmation, pointing to the 'trail of grievances' in his book 'Government Gangsters,' which the senator said he read before meeting with Pat...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/21/congress/kash-patel-confirmation-trump-00199795	2025-01-21T14:43:29-08:00

Trump pushes Hill GOP on recess appointments, debt limit	President Donald Trump prodded congressional leaders to consider recess appointments for his top nominees and expressed interest in trading California wildfire aid for a debt limit increase in a White House meeting Tuesday — resurfacing two controversial proposals floated during the returning president’s transition. The discussions, which were described by two people granted anonymity to describe the private talks, also touched on his proposal to exempt at least some tip income from federal taxes and his efforts more generally to extend tax cuts.

The Senate readies for a nominee siege	Democrats let Secretary of State Marco Rubio blitz to Senate confirmation Monday. Now it’s time for trench warfare. With Donald Trump’s nominees slowly emerging from Senate committees, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are preparing for a weekslong slog as Democrats force Republicans to work through procedural obstacles to fill out the new president’s Cabinet. CIA director pick John Ratcliffe is expected to get a relatively smooth bipartisan confirmation on Tuesday. But after that, more controversial nominees await, and cooperation could be hard to come by. Accelerating any confirmation will require unanimous agreement from senators, and after letting Rubio through, Democrats are not eager to ease the way for many other Trump picks.

A running list of Trump's planned executive orders, actions, proclamations and legislation	Donald Trump is promising a 'golden age of America' in his second term, and he’s issuing a raft of executive orders to try and make it happen. The president signed a slew of orders and directives that aim to end birthright citizenship and crack down on illegal crossings at the southern border, increase domestic energy production and transform a federal government he views as both too bloated and too 'woke.' It’s unclear which of Trump’s executive actions will have immediate impact or are merely symbolic. But they’re already facing challenges.

Susan Collins (R-Maine) echoed that sentiment, saying there was a difference between those 'caught up in the crowd who did not commit a violent act' and those who committed violent crimes, like destroying property or assaulting officers, who should not be pardoned.

But she argued the U.N. isn’t irredeemable and pledged that she’d help usher 'strong American leadership' at the multilateral body. Before a generally cordial panel of senators on the Foreign Relations Committee, the New York Republican said Washington could still thwart growing Chinese influence on the international stage by increasing its presence at the global forum.

But he appeared to reference other Trump officials like Vice President JD Vance who suggested violent offenders wouldn’t receive blanket pardons but would instead be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Speaking from the Oval Office after signing a spate of executive orders, Trump was asked about relations with Latin America and Brazil and said the relationship 'should be great.' But he made it clear who needs who more in the relationship. 'They need us much more than we need them. We don't need them,' he said. 'They need us. Everybody needs us.'

Trump promised the crowd in the inauguration’s 'overflow room' in the Capitol Visitors Center, following his formal inaugural remarks in the Rotunda: 'You’re going to see a lot of action on J6 hostages.' He has floated pardoning the rioters, many of whom are facing formal criminal charges.

TikTok celebrates Trump inauguration, over and over	With TikTok back online after shutting off for less than a day, the company embarked on an inaugural weekend goodwill tour aimed at incoming President Donald Trump, the person the video-sharing app is counting on to save it in the long term. On Sunday, TikTok contributed $50,000 to a party in honor of Gen Z Trump supporters and his biggest social media allies. TikTok’s lobbyist Mac Abrams made his rounds, and guests including Trump campaign adviser Alex Bruesewitz and Republican political activist Scott Presler rubbed elbows with former British Prime Minister Liz Truss and boxer Scott McGregor.

We're running out of time': GOP already antsy on Trump’s Hill agenda	Welcome to the Washington trifecta, Republicans. Now get ready to wait. Even as the GOP takes unified control of the House, Senate and White House on Monday, congressional leaders are facing doubts about just how quickly they will be able to deliver major wins for Donald Trump. Their legislative plans are highly unsettled, and the clock is ticking toward distracting fights over federal spending and the debt limit. And when it comes to the heart of Trump’s agenda — a sprawling party-line effort encompassing border, energy and tax policy — key strategic questions remain in flux. Once they agree on the general direction of travel, leaders will then have to navigate a thicket of nasty intraparty disputes on the policies themselves.

Why Trump supporters see sunshine in Trump’s dark and foreboding speeches	The first time Donald Trump gave an inaugural address, official Washington winced. It was a scorching and dystopian assessment of what he cast as a country in ruins — this 'American carnage,' Trump said. And it was, as George W. Bush reportedly called it, 'some weird shit.' But that’s not how much of Trump’s MAGA base remembers it. Like Trump, they, too, saw a hollowed-out nation in 2017. But what Trump’s supporters mostly recalled in the president-elect — and the repeat performance they are preparing for on Monday — is redemption.

‘Not enough room’: Lawmakers fret about indoor inauguration	The last-minute move to bring President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration indoors could leave some members of Congress out in the cold. Perhaps not literally: No one is expected to be seated outside in 25-degree bluster. But the possibility that not all lawmakers might get seats in the Rotunda for the oath-of-office ceremony has cast a chill over the occasion in some congressional offices, according to four lawmakers and aides. 'Simply put, there’s not enough room,' one senior Republican aide said. 'It’s a shitshow.' The initial guidance from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies after Trump’s team decided to move things indoors on Friday was that 't...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/19/trump-inauguration-rotunda-congress-004800	2025-01-19T13:43:05-08:00	https://static.politico.com/57/15/f0dca855496ab92debba3ab5e268/inauguration-57288.jpg
Tim Kaine explains strategy on Pete Hegseth	Sen. Tim Kaine said he pushed Defense Secretary-nominee Pete Hegseth about infidelity and sexual misconduct in a hearing last week because he believed it was the only way to get Republicans to consider voting against him. Speaking Sunday on CBS' 'Face the Nation,' Kaine (D-Va.) said: 'My observation of my Republican colleagues is the only reason they ever vote no on a nominee is either a belief of gross incompetence in terms of qualifications or serious character deficit.' As an example, Kaine cited the case of then-Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), whose chances to be President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general were quickly scuttled by personal scandal.

Trump says he will ‘probably’ travel to California next week after LA fires	President-elect Donald Trump will 'probably' travel to Southern California next week, he told NBC News, making the likely first trip of his second term to the liberal stronghold still reeling from some of the worst wildfires in its history. In a wide-ranging phone interview on Saturday with 'Meet the Press' moderator Kristen Welker, Trump said he 'was going to go, actually yesterday,' to the Golden State, but decided 'it would be better if I went as president.'

Trump hires fed-firing mastermind	President-elect Donald Trump is bringing back a senior White House official who led his first-term push to make it easier to fire civil servants. James Sherk, who served as a special assistant on domestic policy during Trump’s first term, will return to serve in the White House Domestic Policy Council, Trump announced Saturday. Sherk has worked at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute during the Biden administration. Sherk was central to the Trump administration’s efforts to make it easier to fire some federal employees using a classification called Schedule F. That effort generated an outcry from civil servants, and the Biden administration moved quickly to reverse course. But the effort 'could — and should — be reissued by another president,' Sherk wrote in a 2022 Wall Stre...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/18/trump-hires-fed-firing-mastermind-00199154	2025-01-18T11:36:44-08:00	https://static.politico.com/76/68/ac5fbe53477a92f06e69e390f343/1594391562082.jpg
The Real Story Behind Mike Turner’s Firing	When Speaker Mike Johnson summarily fired House Intelligence Chair Mike Turner this week, everyone assumed it was about Donald Trump. Actually, it was about power — not the incoming president’s, but Johnson’s.

Ellis, who is currently on the CIA landing team, held senior legal and intelligence policy roles on Trump’s National Security Council during his first term.

The Capitol grapples with Trump's last-minute inauguration switch	Donald Trump won’t be crowing about crowd size at his second inauguration. Barely more than 2,000 people will pack into the Capitol Rotunda for a cold-weather inaugural ceremony backup plan not seen since Ronald Reagan. The call to move the swearing in and inaugural address indoors was made by the Trump team, but the pivot will have to be executed by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and hundreds of workers across Capitol Hill — who have less than 72 hours to pull off a huge pivot. The have nots: Just a tiny fraction of committed Trump supporters who traveled to Washington will get to see the ceremonies in person. The rotunda crowd will mostly be comprised of lawmakers, other high-ranking officials and Trump’s family.

The group said its letter had failed to make clear that progressive staff were dedicated to 'serving the American people no matter how many hours it takes to get the job done' and that there were 'well-known, longstanding workplace issues that deserve Congress’s immediate attention.'

Donald Trump’s DOJ could win convictions of two Jan. 6 defendants next week	By early next week, Donald Trump’s Justice Department may secure its first convictions of Jan. 6 felony defendants. That’s because two jury trials launched this week by President Joe Biden’s DOJ have not yet reached verdicts and are slated to continue into the first days of the Trump administration. Unless Trump pulls the plug on trials that are already reaching their final phase, it will be his DOJ that sees them through, perhaps as early as Tuesday. Trump could extend blanket pardons to all Jan. 6 defendants, which would short-circuit ongoing trials. However, his allies have signaled he’s unlikely to summarily pardon people charged with felonies and would instead review them on ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/17/congress/donald-trump-january-6-cases-00199097	2025-01-17T13:40:10-08:00

DeWine passes over Ramaswamy, will select Jon Husted for Senate	Gov. Mike DeWine has selected his own Lt. Gov. Jon Husted to become the next senator from Ohio, passing over entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Two sources, granted anonymity to speak freely about the appointment, confirmed that DeWine will pick Husted. DeWine is expected to make the announcement at 1p.m. Husted, a Republican more in DeWine’s institutionalist mold, had long planned to run for governor in 2026 to succeed DeWine. His ascent to the Senate will likely scramble the field in that race. Ramaswamy learned mid-morning Friday he would not be the pick, according to a person familiar with the discussion and granted anonymity to describe it.

Democrats look to inject fresh energy into the LGBTQ+ movement	It's been a dozen years since the Stonewall Democrats, a once-prominent LGBTQ+ rights group, went defunct. But now, on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration, a new coalition of state-level advocacy groups is reestablishing a national presence to gird against the incoming president and a Republican-controlled Congress. The group, the National Federation of Stonewall Democrats, comes together at a fraught time for movement, amid recriminations from within the Democratic Party that its focus on transgender rights harmed Democrats in November.

Dozens of House Dems back GOP immigration bill related to sex crimes	More than 60 House Democrats backed a GOP bill that would make sexual and domestic violence deportable offenses, marking the second bipartisan immigration bill to pass the chamber this Congress. The bill, led by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), earned 10 more Democratic votes than the 51 who backed it in the last Congress. Many Democrats who supported it were from purple districts, but some in solidly blue seats also voted for it, including Reps. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), Sarah McBride (D-Del.), and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.). Congressional Democrats are under intense pressure from the GOP majority to vote for immigration and crime-related bills.

Get ready for a 🥶🥶🥶 Inauguration Day	Prepare to freeze at Donald Trump’s inauguration. It’s forecasted to be the coldest Inauguration Day since President Ronald Reagan’s second swearing-in ceremony in 1985 (temperature: A cool 7 degrees). The weather is expected to peak in the mid-20s (very cold!) and dip as low as 10 degrees (very very cold!) at night. The good news: The sun is set to shine during Trump’s ceremony, but 10 to 20 mph freezing winds will make it feel even colder. D.C.’s had its fair share of cold days in January, but frigid temperatures aren’t the norm for Inauguration Day. The average Jan. 20 temperature has hovered around a 45-degree high and 30-degree low with wind chill also in the 30s, according to the National Weather ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/16/congress/donald-trump-inauguration-day-weather-forecast-00198682	2025-01-16T09:12:28-08:00	
Trump selects private equity CEO Pulte as top housing regulator	President-elect Donald Trump has selected private equity CEO and philanthropist Bill Pulte to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency. If confirmed, Pulte would become the country's top housing regulator. FHFA oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage giants standing behind roughly half of the U.S. residential mortgage market. Pulte founded Pulte Capital Partners LLC, which focuses on housing products, in 2011 and garnered attention in recent years for promoting his giveaways of money and other goods on social media. He is a grandson of real estate magnate William Pulte. The Trump administration is expected to pursue a plan to release Fannie and Freddie from government control — a complex maneuver that could have major repercussions for the mortgage market.	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/16/congress/trump-picks-top-housing-regulator-00198667	2025-01-16T09:10:10-08:00	
Pelosi is skipping Trump's inauguration	Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi won’t be attending President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday, her spokesperson confirmed. She’s joining other Democrats who are expected to skip Trump’s swearing in, though lawmakers haven’t mounted an organized boycott of the inauguration like they did in 2017. Instead, a sizable number of House Democrats are expected to attend after their districts slid towards Trump in the November elections. Pelosi had gone to Trump’s inauguration in 2017, when she was the House Minority Leader. Since then, she’s departed the top House Democratic position and stepped off her committees. She’s attended 11 inaugurations so far; her first was President John F. Kennedy’s.

Tim Scott scoops then deletes Moody Senate announcement	Senate GOP campaign Chair Tim Scott welcomed Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody to the Senate on X — minutes before Gov. Ron DeSantis actually announced his pick for the open seat. In a quickly deleted tweet, Scott congratulated Moody on her appointment saying she’s a 'proven conservative fighter' for President-elect Donald Trump and has been a 'national leader on border security,' according to a screenshot of the tweet provided to POLITICO. DeSantis shortly after named Moody as his choice to fill the seat of Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump’s secretary of State nominee. Scott was elected to serve as chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee for the 2026 cycle.

Rep. Rick Crawford expected to serve as House Intelligence chair	Speaker Mike Johnson is expected to choose Rep. Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) as the next chair of the House Intelligence Committee, two people familiar with Johnson's intentions said. Johnson on Wednesday removed former Chair Mike Turner (R-Ohio) in a move that stunned even some Republicans on the panel.

DeSantis picks Florida AG Ashley Moody to replace Rubio in the Senate	Gov. Ron DeSantis has selected state Attorney General Ashley Moody to become the next senator from Florida. The elevation of Moody into the role, once Sen. Marco Rubio resigns to be President-elect Donald Trump’s secretary of State, installs a close DeSantis ally — someone who was the first and only state Cabinet-level official to endorse the governor in the 2024 Republican presidential primary over Trump. The seat will open up soon, with Rubio on a glide path to become Trump’s secretary of State shortly after he is inaugurated. Moody will hold the seat through at least a 2026 special election.

Progressive Hill staff group pitches lighter workweek	As the second Donald Trump presidential term dawns, some progressive Capitol Hill staffers are floating a bold new proposal: working less. The Congressional Progressive Staff Association proposed establishing a rotating 32-hour workweek on the Hill in a letter to top House and Senate leaders Thursday, saying reduced hours could 'improve worker satisfaction, increase staff retention in Congress, and model a more sustainable approach to work on a national level.' Under the proposal, congressional staffers would still work long hours when their boss is around. But when Congress is in session, district office staffers would be entitled to an abbreviated, 20-percent-lighter schedule, and when it is not, D.C.-bas...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/16/congress/32-hour-capitol-hill-workweek-00198640	2025-01-16T07:29:51-08:00	
Freedom Caucus pushes two-step reconciliation proposal, countering Johnson’s plan	The House Freedom Caucus is pushing against Speaker Mike Johnson’s plan to pass major GOP priorities. The ultra-conservative group made their preference for a two-step reconciliation plan official on Thursday, releasing a proposal that calls for an initial bill that would reverse Biden administration policies, fund border security and raise the debt ceiling for two years. The Freedom Caucus noted that this plan leaves room for a second reconciliation package with tax cuts, though it didn’t detail what conservatives want that legislation to look like.

Dems press Garland to release report on Trump charges	House Judiciary Committee Democrats are urging Attorney General Merrick Garland, in his final days in office, to release special counsel Jack Smith’s report on Donald Trump’s alleged mishandling and concealment of classified documents — even if it means dropping criminal charges against his alleged accomplices. 'It is essential that the American people and Congress understand how Mr. Trump mishandled our nation’s most sensitive classified information, especially because he will be sworn in as Commander-in-Chief and take leadership of our national security apparatus in just five days,' the Committee Democrats, led by write ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), wrote in a letter obtained by POLITICO.

Why Can't Mike Johnson and John Thune Just Get Along?	Ask Congress’ top two leaders about each other, and you’ll hear all the expected pleasantries — on the surface. When I asked Speaker Mike Johnson about Senate Majority Leader John Thune at a POLITICO Live event Tuesday, he was quick to praise the South Dakotan as a 'principled' and 'experienced' counterpart. He called Thune a straight shooter and spoke graciously about a recent dinner they’d shared with their wives. Thune, in turn, commended his 'strong working relationship' with Johnson in a 'Meet the Press' interview earlier this month and said he was ready to give 'deference to how he runs the House.'

Senate Democrats circulating memo alleging Bessent tax dodges	Senate Democrats are circulating a memo claiming that President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, improperly claimed nearly $2 million in tax losses and owes nearly $1 million in taxes related to his hedge fund — providing ready ammunition for them as Bessent goes before the Finance Committee on Thursday. The memo obtained by POLITICO, which was prepared by Finance Committee staff under ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), alleges Bessent should have paid $910,182 in taxes for income he made through his hedge fund, the Key Square Group, from 2021 through 2023. Bessent was able to avoid that income because he claimed he was a 'limited partner' not making decisions for Key Squa...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/15/senate-democrats-memo-scott-bessent-tax-dodges-00198567	2025-01-15T18:10:31-08:00	https://static.politico.com/75/44/c3434dd647fcb58cecaef75c0107/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2189258295
JD Vance hosts $250k-a-plate fundraiser in Palm Beach	Vice president-elect JD Vance hosted a who’s who of Trump-world types Wednesday at a ritzy, $250,000-a-plate fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, according to a person who attended the event and was granted anonymity to disclose details about it. The event, hosted at French restaurant Le Bilboquet, is an early example of Vance’s desire to position himself as heir-apparent to Trump and his 'America First' political movement. Donald Trump Jr., who was key in his father’s decision to name Vance as his No. 2, attended. Vance has been the presumed MAGA standard-bearer since Trump picked him as his running mate in July. But the fundraiser appears aimed at demonstrating he has not only the vision but the fundraising chops to inherit the Trump legacy.

Everything's on the table': Jordan mulls calling Jack Smith to Judiciary	House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan says he is mulling whether to call Jack Smith, the special counsel who led the federal investigations into President-elect Donald Trump, to testify before his committee. 'Everything’s on the table,' Jordan told reporters Wednesday. 'I’m just now looking at his report.' Smith led cases around Trump’s retention of classified documents after his first term in office, and Trump's efforts overturn the results of the 2020 election. This month, Smith released his report into the election subversion case, arguing that he would have been able to obtain a conviction had Trump not won reelection in 2024, making him immune to prosecution.

Johnson removes Mike Turner as Intel chair	Speaker Mike Johnson has removed Mike Turner as chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, according to three people familiar with the decision. House GOP hardliners and other Republicans have been pressing for Johnson to remove Turner for months; he’s made many enemies over his handling of key intelligence matters, including a major internal battle over a surveillance bill. The Ohio Republican has been an outspoken advocate for Ukraine funding and other hawkish national security stances. Still, the decision blindsided many members who remain loyal to Turner, including some current Intelligence panel members.	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/15/johnson-removes-mike-turner-as-intel-chair-00198522	2025-01-15T14:32:29-08:00	https://static.politico.com/a5/71/a893d60d48f599226f1eb050ba55/u-s-congress-13372.jpg
Trump’s pick for budget chief echoes his ‘power of the purse’ dreams	Russell Vought wouldn't commit to having the federal government spend all the money Congress approves. The issue came up during his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday, where he testified before lawmakers in pursuit of a second tour as White House budget director for President-elect Donald Trump. Vought famously froze aid to Ukraine and Puerto Rico the first time he ran the Office of Management and Budget during the first Trump administration. Now that Trump is claiming so-called 'impoundment' law is unconstitutional, senators in both parties are eager to hear Vought promise to spend federal cash as Congress intends.

Bondi won’t promise to enforce TikTok ban	Attorney general nominee Pam Bondi declined to say Wednesday whether she would enforce the law set to kick in on Sunday that would ban the popular social media app TikTok if it isn’t sold to a new owner. While Bondi vowed to follow the law on other subjects, she was evasive when Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pressed her on whether she would make sure that the ban takes effect despite the fact that President-elect Donald Trump has urged the Supreme Court to put the law on hold. 'That is pending litigation within the Department of Justice. … I can’t discuss pending litigation,' Bondi said. The Supreme Court heard arguments last Friday on cases challenging the constitutionality of ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/pam-bondi-on-tiktok-ban-00198394	2025-01-15T08:43:34-08:00	
Trump zeroes in on Sean Plankey to lead U.S. cyber agency	The Trump transition team is honing in on Sean Plankey as its choice to be the next director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, according to three people familiar with the matter. Any decision about who will head the roughly $3 billion Department of Homeland Security agency is not official until President-elect Donald Trump announces his pick for the Senate-confirmed role, the three people cautioned. But Plankey, a senior cyber policy official from Trump’s first administration and a veteran of the Pennsylvania National Guard and U.S. Coast Guard, is firmly the leading contender at this point in the process. The CISA Director announcement and those for other senior cybersecurity roles in the new administration 'are expected soon,' said one of the people, who like the o...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/sean-plankey-likely-to-lead-u-s-cyber-agency-00198382	2025-01-15T08:32:44-08:00	
Rubio: US diplomats should support Trump mission	Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio says he’s willing to promote career diplomats to top posts, including ambassadorships, but indicated that the candidates must be in step with the Trump administration’s foreign policy vision. Rubio, speaking Wednesday to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stressed that he wasn’t talking about partisan politics. But his comments are a sign that the incoming administration won’t tolerate much dissent in the diplomatic ranks. 'I’m not talking about political alignment,' Rubio said. 'I’m talking about alignment with the mission that we’ve outlined for American foreign policy, which is one of the things that I think has hurt the State Department under numerous administrations.' The last time Donald Trump was president, he and his team grew wary of Sta...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/rubio-us-diplomats-should-support-trump-mission-00198360	2025-01-15T08:13:07-08:00	
Rubio: ‘Top priority’ of State Department will be US interests	Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to be secretary of State, on Wednesday vowed that the 'top priority' of U.S. foreign policy 'will be the United States' as he outlined his life story and his goals if confirmed to be America’s top diplomat. In his remarks before his colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio outlined that under Trump and him, the State Department will put forward policies that make America 'more prosperous' and avoid past mistakes where 'America far too often continued to prioritize the 'global order' above our core national interests.' Rubio, who remains in the Senate until he is confirmed, received a chummy and friendly response from the foreign policy panel.

Bondi vows she won’t pursue DOJ ‘enemies list’ — but defends Patel	Attorney General nominee Pam Bondi promised the Senate Judiciary Committee that she won’t use her power to pursue a so-called 'enemies list,' even as she defended FBI Director nominee Kash Patel’s vow to target a list of people he views as 'government gangsters.' 'There will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice,' Bondi said under questioning from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). Asked to defend a comment she made on Fox News last year declaring that 'the prosecutors will be prosecuted' and 'the investigators will be investigated,' Bondi noted Wednesday that she also referred in that interview to focusing on 'bad' prosecutors.

Former Bernie Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir enters DNC Chair race	Faiz Shakir, who led Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign, is jumping into the race for chair of the Democratic National Committee — injecting a new candidate into the low-key contest. Shakir confirmed his candidacy in a text message to POLITICO. The New York Times first reported Shakir’s decision. Shakir’s late entrance into the race could shake up a contest that has largely focused on party mechanics rather than its ideology. In a letter to DNC members, Shakir said he’s become 'frustrated' by the 'lack of vision and conviction for what to do to restore a deeply damaged Democratic brand,' prompting his decision to join the race.

Bondi sidesteps question of whether Biden won the 2020 election	Pam Bondi, Donald Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, repeatedly declined to say Wednesday that Joe Biden won the 2020 election, saying he was 'duly sworn in' but sidestepping a question about whether he was the legal winner of the contest. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Bondi’s refusal to answer the 'yes or no' question was concerning and he encouraged her to listen to Trump’s hourlong call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which Trump asked Georgia officials to 'find' enough votes to reverse the outcome. Bondi said she’d only heard a clip. Durbin pressed Bondi on how she would advise Trump on clemency decisions for people who attacked police officers on Jan. 6, 2021.

Pam Bondi, Trump's AG pick, says ‘partisan’ weaponization of DOJ ‘will be gone’	President elect Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general Pam Bondi is being questioned by the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Democrats are expected to press her on whether she will prioritize loyalty to Trump over her constitutional duty. In her opening statement, the former Florida attorney general emphasized to lawmakers that she would not use the federal law enforcement agency to attack political rivals and endeavor to 'restore confidence and integrity' to the department. Trump has repeatedly suggested in his second term he would leverage his prosecutorial power against adversaries. 'The partisanship, the weaponization will be gone,' Bondi said in her statement.

It may be an indication that there will be a heavy focus on policy in the second Trump administration. Worthington and Vince Haley, the incoming director of the domestic policy council, crafted policy-infused speeches for Trump on the campaign trail, as well as the first drafts of scripts Trump used to record the policy videos that appeared on his campaign website. Trump praised his speechwriters but frequently went off script and had a habit of freelancing large portions of his speeches before returning to the teleprompter.

Ernst told an Iowa radio show that said the former Fox News host was able to adequately answer all her questions during his confirmation hearing before the Armed Services Committee. 'He pointed out the woke issues at the Pentagon and I think we’re at a point where now we can start moving forward. People know where he stands on these issues,' Ernst said.

‘Throwing mud up against the wall’: E&C Republicans plot health care cost savings	Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans met Tuesday to discuss where they might find billions of dollars in potential cuts to existing health care programs — including by making changes to the safety-net program Medicaid.

Addressing the debt limit in reconciliation is not 'completely foreclosed,' Johnson said at a POLITICO Live event, but he said House leaders were 'looking at all options.' 'I'm not wed to any of them,' he said. Striking a deal with Democrats to raise the debt ceiling would enrage the House’s conservative hard-liners.

Bannon on Musk: He doesn’t have that much power	Steve Bannon taunted his fellow Trump ally Elon Musk on Tuesday, telling POLITICO that the president-elect’s billionaire right-hand-man doesn’t have all that much power. Bannon, a former chief strategist for Trump and host of the 'War Room' podcast, told POLITICO White House bureau chief Dasha Burns that Musk has had some influence over Cabinet picks and policy discussions but that he doesn’t 'have the ability to actually make decisions and inform those decisions and drive those decisions.' As Trump’s big-tent GOP returns to power, Bannon and Musk have served as a prime example of the infighting already underway — and the challenges it will pose to the incoming president. Allies argue<...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/14/bannon-on-musk-he-doesnt-have-that-much-power-00198060	2025-01-14T06:34:16-08:00	http://vod.politico.com/media/v1/pmp4/static/clear/1155968404/11ac5a01-b9de-4196-9a56-2fa308db3524/314cf305-8720-4eae-8f61-22e18678fde5/main.mp4

How healthy are Donald Trump’s nominees?	President-elect Donald Trump’s top nominees are about to go under the Senate spotlight. Hearings kick off on Tuesday, and while some of Trump’s most controversial picks appear to be on track for confirmation, others remain short of the support they need, according to conversations with a half-dozen GOP senators and aides. This week’s public questioning could be decisive: 'Right now, I think it looks like smooth sailing, but sometimes unexpected things happen,' Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said. With a 53-seat majority and incoming Vice President JD Vance available to break ties, the nominees could be in trouble if they lose support from more than three GOP senators. Several Republicans, whose comments are bei...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/14/donald-trump-cabinet-nominees-health-check-00196964	2025-01-14T02:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/c5/dc/c28d5f7e4897b94796cd64fb62f7/main-debonismeyers-noms-in-peril-revise.jpg
Trump made the GOP a big-tent party. Now, he’s stuck with the infighting.	A coalition of MAGA die-hards, tech bros and blue-collar workers were key to Donald Trump’s November victory. Now, some of them are already at each other’s throats. Free traders and protectionists are at odds over Trump’s promise to enact 'universal' tariffs.

‘Non-starter’: California Democrats blast GOP’s fire trade	Democrats are rejecting a tentative pitch by House Republicans to attach wildfire aid to a federal debt limit increase. GOP lawmakers began floating the idea in meetings this weekend with incoming President Donald Trump. The thinking behind the plan, according to House Republicans, is that they’ll need bipartisan support to raise the cap on federal borrowing authority in the coming months and that including assistance for fire-stricken Southern California would be an incentive for Democrats to help solve one of Trump’s most pressing economic problems this year. But Democrats are refusing to entertain the deal. 'Why would you be trying to link completely unrelated issues?' California Rep. Ted Lieu, vice ch...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/13/congress/disaster-aid-debt-limit-wildfires-00198014	2025-01-13T18:20:00-08:00

Jared Moskowitz does not intend to return to the House Oversight Committee this Congress, four people familiar with the Florida Democrat’s intentions said. The move comes after Moskowitz was rumored to potentially join the Trump administration and lead the Federal Emergency Management Agency, something he publicly denied.

FBI background check delays VA secretary confirmation hearing	The Senate confirmation hearing slated for Tuesday for President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, former Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), has been postponed to Jan. 21 — the latest snag for one of Trump’s selections. Senate Veterans’ Affairs Chair Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) said in a statement Monday that Collins has submitted necessary paperwork in a 'timely manner' and has been 'transparent and forthcoming' with the panel. However, he added, the FBI has not finished its background check of the nominee, who was supposed to have his confirmation hearing on Tuesday morning.

Johnson confirms 'discussions' on tying wildfire aid to debt limit	House Speaker Mike Johnson confirmed to reporters Monday there’s 'been some discussion' of tying California wildfire aid to a debt limit increase, after GOP members raised the issue with Donald Trump in several meetings at the President-elect’s Florida resort this weekend. The notion that Congress could make the release of disaster relief dollars conditional upon also agreeing to raise the debt ceiling is already facing pushback from some Democrats. But many California Republicans, including Rep.

Dems should hold Trump nominees ‘accountable’ at hearings, Schumer says	Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is privately urging his members to use upcoming hearings on President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees to hold their 'feet to the fire,' according to a Senate Democratic official. Schumer’s guidance, given to members during a closed-door lunch last Tuesday, comes as the Senate kicks off a marathon run of confirmation hearings this week. All of the early attention will be on Pete Hegseth, Trump’s pick to lead the Defense Department. He will appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday.

House Republicans and Trump discuss tying California wildfire aid to debt ceiling	A group of House Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump talked about tying wildfire aid to a debt ceiling increase Sunday night, as the fires spreading across huge swaths of Los Angeles are estimated to become one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. Of the nearly two dozen House Republicans who attended the Sunday dinner at Mar-a-Lago, where this option was discussed, several are caucus leaders and appropriators with major influence in upcoming budget reconciliation and government funding negotiations.

Moon over Mars? Congress is determined to kill Elon Musk’s space dream.	Trump confidant Elon Musk wants NASA to drop its ambitious plans to return to the moon and instead head straight to Mars. Congress is ready to put up a fight. Republican and Democratic lawmakers, who control NASA’s purse strings, want Americans to return to the lunar surface in 2027 — and they’re not willing to abandon that mission despite Musk’s obsession with skipping the moon for Mars. The division sets up a potential showdown with Republican policymakers and the influential Trump ally over one of the most consequential space policy decisions this century. President-elect Donald Trump has, at least for now, stayed out of the fray. His first administration launched NASA’s plans to land on the moon, but he has also pressed the agency on why it can’t go directly to Mars.

There is going to be shock and awe with executive orders'	President-elect Donald Trump will issue 'a blizzard of executive orders' as soon as he inaugurated Jan. 20, Sen. John Barrasso predicted Sunday. Speaking on CBS' 'Face the Nation,' the Wyoming Republican said: 'When President Trump takes office next Monday, there is going to be shock and awe with executive orders. A blizzard of executive orders on the economy, as well as on the border.' Executive orders, for better or worse, allow a president to bypass Congress. But Barrasso, the new Senate majority whip, said that he expects Trump to also rely on the narrow Republican majority in the Senate and even more slender one in the House to get his agenda enacted.
