Matt Gaetz gets his own TV show on OAN	Former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) has a found an outlet for his sharp tongue and yearning for the limelight: far-right broadcaster One America News Network. The former lawmaker from Florida's Panhandle and MAGA provocateur will soon host his own hourlong political talk show on OAN, which heavily supports President-elect Donald Trump. OAN promoted the show in a series of graphics on Tuesday and called Gaetz a 'powerhouse' in a release, describing the hire as a 'mega MAGA investment' that will air weeknights at 9 p.m. It is yet another high-profile, public platform for Gaetz, a firebrand Republican who made no shortage of enemies in the House before President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to nominate him to ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/10/congress/the-matt-gaetz-show-oan-00193429	2024-12-10T05:05:59-08:00	
Ron who? How Trump allies brought Hegseth back from the brink	Donald Trump's transition team entered a critical week of nomination meetings on Capitol Hill with a new head of steam, emboldened by a swarm of grassroots support and a pressure campaign that has revived Pete Hegseth's hopes for Defense secretary and given them confidence about other controversial nominees, too. In recent days, allies of Trump adopted an approach that is not novel for the president-elect and his followers: Make life extremely uncomfortable for anyone who dares to oppose him. The swarm of MAGA attacks that Sen. Joni Ernst has experienced is a warning of what's in store for others who express skepticism of his personnel choices. Days after signaling she continued to have serious concerns about confirming Hegseth, Ernst on Monday sounded a different note. She described their...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/10/trump-hegseth-controversial-nominee-playbook-00193349	2024-12-10T02:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/87/fe/80a2f7c1492da56c01376d75b821/pete-hegseth-on-capitol-hill-40341.jpg
Homan tells Democrats to ‚Äòget the hell out of the way‚Äô on immigration	CHICAGO ‚Äî Donald Trump‚Äôs choice to lead border security efforts promised a hard line on enforcement in a speech Monday to Chicago Republicans, with apparently little room for leniency even for the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. Tom Homan, who has been picked to serve as 'border czar' in the new administration, said the children of non-citizens would be part of the wave of deportations promised by the incoming administration. 'When you have a child, that's on you. I'm not looking to separate families at all. That's not my goal. My goal is to enforce the law,' Homan said. 'But if you put yourself in that position, it may happen.' His remarks showed none of the flexibility that Trump himself seemed to suggest in a weekend interview, when he said that he favored some kind of resolut...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/09/congress/border-czars-tough-talk-00193416	2024-12-09T19:10:33-08:00

Trump picks ex-GOP official in California to lead civil rights division at DOJ	A rare voice for conservative policies in deep blue California has been invited to join the new Trump administration. President-elect Donald Trump said Monday that he will nominate Harmeet K.

In the new administration, he will work with the cost-cutting 'Department of Government Efficiency,' led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the president-elect said. 'Mark will work closely with our DOGE team to cut the size of our bloated Government bureaucracy, and root out wasteful and anti-American spending,' Trump said in a statement.

Gabbard woos GOP defense hawks in first Hill visit	Former Democratic Congressperson Tulsi Gabbard kicked off her bid to win Senate support as America‚Äôs new top spy on Monday by wooing a key demographic: Republican defense hawks. The recent MAGA convert and longtime anti-interventionist held one-on-one meetings on Monday with four muscular advocates of American foreign policy. She started the day by having breakfast with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). Later, she met with Sens. Mike Rounds (R-SD), James Lankford (R-OK), and Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) behind closed doors.

Johnson needs Dems to pass a stopgap spending bill. Here's what they want.	Lawmakers only have nine working days left to figure out government funding before the shutdown deadline, and Speaker Mike Johnson will almost certainly need House Democratic votes to pass it. Congress is likely to pass a stopgap government funding measure before Dec. 20, likely to fund the government until March of next year at its current levels. But considering Johnson‚Äôs razor-thin margin and a notable conservative faction of his conference that doesn‚Äôt generally support stopgap spending bills, known as continuing resolutions, House Democrats will likely be the ones to get the legislation over the finish line. Typically, punting a funding deadline into a new year when Republicans will control every lever of power would make Democrats shudder. But they‚Äôre not putting up much of a fight t...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/09/johnson-pass-spending-bill-00193377	2024-12-09T15:33:18-08:00	https://static.politico.com/2b/46/c43a1495429c9cb80430c69ccca1/u-s-congress-01536.jpg

The Iowa Republican, a pivotal swing vote on the Senate Armed Services Committee, struck a positive tone in a statement issued after their meeting ‚Äî and indicated Hegseth is moving toward her positions.

Mast set to become House Foreign Affairs chair after steering recommendation	House Republicans‚Äô steering committee recommended Rep. Brian Mast on Monday to become the next chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, two people familiar with the decision told POLITICO. The decision still needs to be ratified by the full conference. But the GOP steering committee, which doles out most committee gavels and assignments, picked Mast (R-Fla.) as their recommendation to be the next chair during a closed-door meeting where they heard from each of the candidates for the gavel. Mast faced off against Reps. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.), Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) and Darrell Issa (R-Calif.). Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the current chair, is term-limited.

The brief but busy reign of Sen. George Helmy is coming to an end	Sen. George Helmy, a New Jersey Democrat, is making his brief tenure at the Capitol a busy one. Last Monday, Helmy was on the Senate floor to give a complex speech about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The remarks were based on a trip to the Middle East he took during the roughly 12 weeks he‚Äôll be in office after Gov. Phil Murphy picked him to fill disgraced Sen. Bob Menendez‚Äôs vacant seat. The next day, a day after walking the tightrope of Middle Eastern politics, Helmy was back to make joint remarks with Sen. Katie Britt, the Alabama Republican.

‚ÄòHe's not a manager‚Äô: Former RFK Jr. staffers on how he'd run HHS	If Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gets confirmed as secretary for President-elect Donald Trump's Department of Health and Human Services, it will be the biggest job he's ever had. And some of his former campaign staffers question whether he‚Äôs up for the challenge. Kennedy, who comes from one of the most high-profile families in Democratic politics, has held leadership roles as a lawyer and at nonprofit organizations but has more often been the public face of these operations than an executive manager. His presidential campaign was similarly run with Kennedy not closely involved in its daily management, according to interviews with a half dozen former campaign staffers.

Mexico's president and Trump had an upbeat call despite dust-up over tariffs	President-elect Donald Trump said his conversation Wednesday with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was 'wonderful' and 'very productive.' She, in turn, described their phone call as 'excellent.' Their upbeat readouts on the call marked a contrast from earlier in the week, when Trump warned he would impose a 25 percent tariff on all goods from Mexico if it doesn‚Äôt stop the flow of migrants and drugs across their shared border ‚Äì and Sheinbaum fired back by warning that her country could retaliate with tariffs of its own.

'Delete CFPB,' Musk, who is leading an effort on behalf of President-elect Donald Trump to shrink the size of the federal government, wrote in a post on X. 'There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.'

Democrat Derek Tran ousts Michelle Steel in CA House battle	Derek Tran, a first-time Democratic candidate, has flipped a toss-up California House seat, narrowly defeating GOP Rep. Michelle Steel, who conceded on Wednesday after a protracted vote count. Tran had declared victory early this week, and currently leads by roughly 600 votes. Steel, a two-term congressmember, had been an elusive target for Democrats, occupying an Orange County district that had backed President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. The race ended up being the most expensive House battle in the country, with at least $46 million spent by the campaigns and an array of outside groups.

Trump appoints Keith Kellogg as Ukraine peace envoy	President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday named former national security aide and retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg as a special envoy to Russia and Ukraine, commissioning him to lead negotiations to end the war. In a statement, Trump said that Kellogg, who served as national security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence, 'was with me right from the beginning' and 'will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!' The move is not likely to allay anxieties among European allies that Trump will attempt to pursue peace between Russia and Ukraine.
