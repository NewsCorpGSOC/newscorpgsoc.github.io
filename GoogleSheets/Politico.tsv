Trump’s latest budget nominee avows funding freeze, pledges to follow Vought	The Senate began its public vetting on Tuesday of President Donald Trump’s pick for the No. 2 post at the White House budget office, a position key to carrying out the president’s funding freeze. Dan Bishop, a former congressmember from North Carolina, testified before senators in his first confirmation hearing to be deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. Pledging to follow the orders of Trump and White House budget director Russell Vought, the OMB nominee vowed to 'fix' a federal bureaucracy he characterized as 'self-absorbed, inefficient, unaccountable and mal-administered.' Bishop skirted a direct question about whether he would follow the law, or Trump, if the president directed him to take action that would break the law. 'I’m confident that President Trump will issue...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/25/congress/trumps-latest-budget-nominee-avows-funding-freeze-pledges-to-follow-vought-00205991	2025-02-25T12:12:00-08:00

Prospects dim for reviving deal to grow the federal judiciary	Bipartisan talks to add judges to the federal judiciary are over — at least for now. At a Tuesday morning hearing of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet on Tuesday, Republicans and Democrats blamed the other for the demise of a deal last year to add dozens of new judgeships to U.S. courts. House Republicans failed to bring the agreement, in the form of legislation, up for a vote until after President Donald Trump’s election victory. Following its passage on the House floor, then-President Joe Biden vetoed the legislation in a bid to block Trump from being able to add a host of new conservative judges to the bench. 'In my 24 plus years here in Washington, it was the first time I ever saw a bipartisan, bicameral bill vetoed by a President,' said...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/25/congress/judges-trump-judiciary-courts-00206017	2025-02-25T11:20:56-08:00	
House budget plan advances to final floor vote	The House Republican approach to President Donald Trump’s sweeping domestic policy agenda moved a step closer to approval after Republicans stayed united on a test vote, setting up a possible final floor vote Tuesday evening. The Trump-backed fiscal blueprint still faces tough odds on final adoption, with a handful of conservative hard-liners demanding it get rewritten to guarantee deeper spending cuts. Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford one GOP defection on a party-line vote if all members are voting. But clearing the procedural hurdle was still a victory for Johnson, who made public...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/25/congress/house-budget-advances-rule-vote-00206005	2025-02-25T11:19:18-08:00	
Democrats use committee hearing to rail against GOP Medicaid cuts and DOGE	Tensions are boiling over inside the typically bipartisan House Energy and Commerce Committee, with Democrats railing against Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and the GOP’s plan to extend Trump-era tax cuts. With little power in GOP-led Washington, Democrats are hijacking a markup to adopt the committee’s oversight plan to advance their message — both by speechifying and forcing votes on more than 50 likely-doomed amendments on thorny issues like preventing spending cuts to Medicaid, condemning President Donald Trump’s firing of inspectors general and disapproving of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Cramer suffers ‘severe concussion’ after fall in North Dakota	Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) is recovering back in North Dakota after falling on Sunday and suffering a 'severe concussion,' he said in a Facebook post. Cramer, who turned 64 last month, said that he was walking down to his dock earlier this week when he 'stepped on ice and evidently fell hard, hitting the back of my head.' 'I do not remember anything from the fall until arriving at Sanford Health emergency room with Kris. After seeing the emergency doctor, taking some tests, including a CT Scan, and seeing a neurologist, I was diagnosed with a severe concussion, a seizure, and a slight brain bleed,' Cramer wrote on Monday.

Ted Cruz's efforts to gain unilateral subpoena power to haul Big Tech CEOs before his panel, the Senate Commerce chair now plans to compel testimony from an online service provider he argues has deplatformed conservatives.

Warren Davidson is the latest Republican to oppose the House budget	Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio on Tuesday became the latest Republican to oppose Speaker Mike Johnson's budget plan, further imperiling the House GOP's plans for President Donald Trump's sweeping domestic policy agenda. Johnson can afford minimal defections, and Davidson joins Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana in publicly opposing the fiscal blueprint GOP leaders want to pass Tuesday evening.

‘Furious and looking for action’: DOGE is turning into a Democratic candidate recruitment tool	Democrats say sweeping government cuts led by Elon Musk have started to awaken a latent opposition to President Donald Trump — and they’re hoping it will motivate a slew of new down-ballot candidates to run in the years ahead. Early interest in running for office is already beginning to rise — at least one major candidate recruitment organization saw a sharp spike of more than 2,000 new applications pouring in as Musk issued major actions pushing federal workers out. A lot of that web traffic came from Reddit threads of former federal employees considering runs for political office that sprang up last week. Capitalizing off the influx, Run For Something will host an 'Ask Me Anything' event to answer questions about running for political office on a Rep. <a href='https://directory.politicop...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/recruit-federal-workers-run-for-office-022064	2025-02-25T07:33:30-08:00	https://static.politico.com/b3/4c/d03d555a48d391ffd72453623d30/federal-workers-rally-73286.jpg
Johnson brushes off Musk, but GOP budget holdouts stand firm	Speaker Mike Johnson said in a brief interview Tuesday he's not worried that a late-night post from Elon Musk signaling concerns with the GOP budget plan could tank support ahead of a vote this evening. 'No concerns,' Johnson said when asked about the post, adding that he felt 'very positive' about the vote’s prospects today. He is still, however, facing an array of opposition. Indiana Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz, arriving for a House GOP Conference meeting, confirmed she's a 'no today' on the budget resolution, 'unless the instr...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/25/congress/johnson-brushes-off-musk-but-gop-budget-holdouts-stand-firm-00205925	2025-02-25T06:50:53-08:00	
Top Committee Dem goes after Trump's interim U.S. attorney	Rep. Gerry Connolly, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, plans to investigate Washington’s top prosecutor for making threats against the Trump administration’s political adversaries — including one of his own members. In a letter shared first with POLITICO, Connolly, a Virginia lawmaker, announced he was leading the minority party in a probe against Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. Connolly is requesting materials related to Martin’s inquiries into Democratic officials, arguing that Martin is moving to suppress political expression. One of Martin’s targets is Rep. Robert Garcia, a California Democrat who recently said on CNN that Americans want 'us to bring actual weapons to this bar fight.

Capitol agenda: Big, beautiful budget on life support	Mike Johnson has about 12 hours to get his conference behind his plan for enacting the president’s sweeping agenda. It’s not looking good. The speaker insists he’s not changing the budget resolution, which would set parameters for a sweeping bill to address border security, energy and tax policy. If House Democrats are at full attendance, just two GOP 'no' votes would sink the resolution. He and other GOP leaders held meetings late into the night Monday to try to flip holdouts, who fall into two camps with diametrically opposed demands: centrists who don’t want significant reductions to Medicaid and other safety-net programs, and conservatives who want steeper spendin...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/25/congress/johnson-budget-trouble-houldouts-00205900	2025-02-25T05:00:00-08:00	
The House GOP's Medicaid holdouts are coming around	Some of the House Republicans who have doubted Speaker Mike Johnson's budget plan said Monday night that they’re more inclined to support the blueprint after GOP leaders ruled out certain cuts to Medicaid in a private meeting. GOP leaders provided some generic but reassuring details about how they would protect certain Medicaid services and not cut into the share of federal payments for Medicaid, a joint state-federal program, according to several lawmakers who attended the late night confab in Johnson's office. A group of swing-district Republicans and others representing redder areas were in the meeting, along with House Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.). Those members have demanded more detail from GOP leaders on how they would reach the $2 trillion in spending cuts they a...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/24/congress/house-budget-medicaid-holdouts-come-around-00205886	2025-02-24T18:46:50-08:00	
Musk renews his ‘5 things’ demand with Trump’s apparent support	An emboldened Elon Musk is once again directing federal employees to justify their existence in writing — or face dismissal. Musk made his renewed demand in a social media post Monday after President Donald Trump seemed to contradict other senior administration officials and approve the directive that the billionaire initially sent out to workers over the weekend. 'Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance,' Musk wrote on X. 'Failure to respond a second time will result in termination.' The billionaire’s Department of Government Efficiency on Saturday sent an email to federal agencies with the subject line 'What did you do last week.'

Government funding deal ‘very close’ as negotiations hinge on Trump power struggle	The fight over curbing President Donald Trump’s ability to freeze cash is now the make-or-break dispute as leading lawmakers close in on a deal to avert a government shutdown next month. Top appropriators on both sides of the Capitol reported good progress Monday night toward a bipartisan deal on overall spending totals for the military and non-defense programs, with a shutdown deadline looming on March 14. But House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole said Democrats’ insistence on adding conditions to stop Trump from withholding funding that Congress already appropriated could foil a final agreement.

Cory Mills continues to refute allegations of assault	Rep. Cory Mills continues to push back against allegations he assaulted a woman last week. In an interview at the Capitol on Monday evening, Mills emphasized that both he and the alleged victim — who POLITICO is declining to name as a possible target of domestic violence — denied that any assault took place. The woman initiated the call to law enforcement, but said in a statement afterwards she did so in a state of being 'severely jet-lagged and sleep-deprived' and that there was, in fact, 'no physical altercation.' 'Both myself and the other individual said that what they’re claiming took place never took place and that’s been reported multiple times,' M...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/24/congress/cory-mills-denies-assault-allegations-00205873	2025-02-24T17:36:13-08:00	
Winning over budget holdouts ‘won't be that difficult,’ Arrington says	House Budget Chair Jodey Arrington said Monday he is not expecting substantial alternations to the fiscal blueprint he muscled through his committee earlier this month as Republicans try to placate holdouts and move it across the floor this week.

Democrats plot difficult votes for Energy and Commerce Republicans	The House Energy and Commerce Committee will on Tuesday adopt its oversight plans for the new Congress — and Democrats might make it all about Medicaid. Members of the minority party who sit on the powerful panel intend to force their Republican colleagues to take difficult votes on amendments to the majority’s 17-page document that outlines the types of hearings and legislative efforts it will prioritize in the coming months. Some of those amendments could put Republicans on the record about their support for Medicaid on the very same day the full House is scheduled to vote on a budget resolution that would instruct the committee to slash $880 billion from programs under its purview.

Still the 'plan' to hold budget plan vote this week, Johnson says	Speaker Mike Johnson said Monday it's still his 'plan' to clear his budget plan on the House floor this week despite mounting skepticism from key holdouts who could foil his wishes. Speaking at an event held by Americans for Prosperity, Johnson stressed the importance of moving the 'one, big beautiful bill' the House is pursuing so that a swath of 2017 tax cuts don't expire without an extension. But the speaker is facing off with GOP members who are still not supportive of the budget blueprint that is an essential first step toward that legislation.

Capitol agenda: Johnson's make-or-break budget week	Speaker Mike Johnson doesn't yet have the votes to get his budget plan approved on the House floor. He’s barreling ahead anyway. Johnson is looking to move the budget resolution through House Rules today and to the floor on Tuesday. The former seems likely, at least — the Rules Committee’s conservative hard-liners, Reps. Chip Roy and Ralph Norman, are on board with Johnson’s framework. But Tuesday’s floor vote is ambitious, even with Trump endorsing Johnson’s one-bill strategy for passing the president’s border, energy and tax agenda. Johnson can likely only afford to lose one or two Republicans if he wants to move forward on his plan, depending on Democratic attendance. Rep.

The Dallas Mavericks minority owner was asked if his name would be on a ballot in the near future at the Principles First convention, a gathering of conservatives who feel politically homeless in Trump's MAGA-fied version of the party. 'Hell no.

‘Childbirth isn't fun, but it's necessary’: Republicans at CPAC shrug off voter anger at Musk	OXON HILL, Maryland — A political backlash is sneaking up on billionaire Elon Musk and President Donald Trump across America as they take an ax to the government. But inside the gleeful halls of the Conservative Political Action Conference, the vanguard of the Republican Party couldn’t care less. At the annual gathering of conservatives inaugurated by Ronald Reagan, attendees are buying up Musk-related merchandise and the tech mogul is being feted as a chainsaw-wielding warrior taking on the deep state on behalf of Trump. If that gets a little messy sometimes, it’s just part of the process. 'Childbirth isn't fun, but it's necessary for the perpetuation of the species, right? I love what he's doing.

Talks between the top appropriators in the House and Senate have soured in the past week, with lawmakers still searching for an agreement on topline spending levels that are a prerequisite for funding individual agencies and programs for the remainder of the fiscal year. Negotiators have insisted they are staying at the table to hash out an accord. But there’s no clear strategy to break the logjam, and House Republican leaders privately acknowledge that contingency plans need to be drawn up in case the impasse continues ahead of the March 14 deadline.

DC police probe incident involving Rep. Cory Mills	D.C. police have launched an internal investigation into the department's handling of a Wednesday incident involving an alleged assault by Florida Rep. Cory Mills. Metropolitan Police Department officers were called midday to a home in southwest Washington for a reported assault involving the use of force with hands or feet, according to a police report obtained Friday by POLITICO. A department spokesperson confirmed that Mills, a two-term Republican, is the alleged assailant. No arrest was made, and the matter remains under investigation, a second police spokesperson, Tony Lynch, said. Mills denied wrongdoing in a statement issued by his office Friday: 'This week, law enforcement was asked to resolve a private matter at Congressman Mills’ residence.

Trump talks of a third term amid growing concerns about a constitutional crisis	The Constitution expressly forbids presidents from running for a third term. But that hasn't stopped Donald Trump from raising it repeatedly — and this time from an official White House event. 'Should I run again? You tell me.' Trump said on Thursday before a crowded East Room filled with mostly Black supporters who were there for a Black History Month event held just a month into his second term. The crowd, which included elected officials, like Republicans Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Rep. John James of M...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/21/trump-third-term-white-house-022002	2025-02-21T10:50:23-08:00	https://static.politico.com/34/93/a144c92c42cbae81fdcd0eef623c/trump-60568.jpg
Trump continues to muddy the waters on path forward for budget plan	Donald Trump is continuing to complicate the path forward for congressional Republicans, who are desperate for clarity on what the president wants them to do to enact his massive domestic agenda. In comments on Brian Kilmeade’s radio show Friday, Trump openly entertained a notion that the GOP's efforts to extend expiring tax cuts with new policies on border security and energy production may need to be broken up into smaller bills to clear Congress. The Senate approved a budget resolution early in the morning after hours of amendment votes that would pave the way for two bills to accomplish those priorities, while the House is set to muscle through a budget blueprint next week that would set the stage for one piece of legislation encapsulating everything. 'Now what they approved yesterday ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/21/congress/trump-budget-senate-house-00205446	2025-02-21T09:30:55-08:00

Capitol agenda: What you missed in the overnight vote-a-rama	Senate Republicans just approved their budget resolution after a more than 10-hour vote-a-rama. For now, it’s the GOP's 'Plan B,' as President Donald Trump's preferred budget may not have the support to move ahead next week in the House. Senators slogged through 25 roll-call votes on amendments as Democrats tried to squeeze the opposing party and lay the groundwork for 2026 attack ads. Some Republicans grumbled about having to go through the exercise. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) told reporters he spoke to Trump on Thursday evening, relaying that while the president did give a 'little nod' towards the Senate budget in <a href='https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114038732...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/21/congress/senate-budget-trump-thune-00205397	2025-02-21T05:00:00-08:00	
To resist Trump or work with him? This governor says you can do both.	Few things are more authentically Washington than a fly-in. As in, the great capital tradition of getting people from all 50 states into town and unleashing them on the halls of Congress for a few days of lobbying. This week, the group showing up to have their voices heard isn’t local farm bureaus, chambers of commerce or realtors associations. It’s the governors who are here for the National Governors Association’s winter meeting. And the Republicans and Democrats attending have a lot to talk about. The man in charge of the NGA is Colorado Governor Jared Polis, who has taken more than a few unconventional stances on the issues in his two terms as governor, and during his Congressional career before that.

Senate trudges through vote-a-rama to ready a backup budget	Senate Republicans are on track to adopt their budget resolution in the early hours of Friday morning — a bid to show support for a 'Plan B' if House GOP lawmakers can’t unite around their more expansive vision for a party-line package necessary to enact President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda. Senators had voted on more than 10 amendments to their budget resolution before midnight, with plans to continue their 'vote-a-rama' into the night.

Musk gets big cheers — and a chainsaw — at CPAC	Elon Musk was hailed as a chainsaw-wielding slasher of the government at his debut at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Appearing on stage in a gold chain, black MAGA hat and sunglasses, the tech mogul on Thursday boasted about taking on the federal bureaucracy and dismissed the Democratic opposition as fake during a sit-down interview with Newsmax host Rob Schmitt. Asked to give the audience a picture of the inside of his mind, he called it 'a storm.' 'I am become meme,' he told the crowd outside Washington. At one point, Argentine President Javier Milei delivered a gilded chainsaw to Musk on the stage. At another, Musk was handed a sci-fi-themed painting of himself.

Grassley starts talks with White House on moving judicial nominees	Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley is starting talks with the White House about moving judicial nominees through his committee. 'The only discussion I've had is the process,' the Iowa Republican said in an interview this week. 'Just with the White House Counsel.' The update, however preliminary, signals the start of President Donald Trump’s relaunched efforts to transform the courts. Confirming hundreds of judges — including three Supreme Court justices — was a marquee achievement of Trump's first term that is poised to leave the federal judiciary with a conservative slant for decades. This time around, there aren't many slots for Trump to fill: There are just 43 total vacancies in the federal judiciary, according to <a href='https://www.uscourts.gov/data-news/judicial-vacancies/current...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/20/congress/judges-grassley-white-house-00205308	2025-02-20T14:10:38-08:00	
Welcome to a new era of West Wing Playbook	Donald Trump returned to power exactly one month ago today, and it is hardly possible to overstate the magnitude of the changes he has brought and is seeking to bring to the federal government and to the workings of power in Washington. The modern federal government — and much of the economy that gravitates around government in the nation’s capital — is overwhelmingly the product of a few big historical movements: the New Deal in the 1930s, World War II and the 45 years of Cold War that followed, and the burst of government social and regulatory activism in the 1960s and 1970s. The policies and agencies of government that flowed from those movements shaped national life and the lives of many millions of people for decades. It seems certain that the disruption the Trump administration is pr...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/politico-west-wing-playbook-00205226	2025-02-20T13:30:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/b1/d7/5b89080a4f8283982268e082ace9/politico-cms-shared-graphic-1120x629.jpg

'But if you think about our core principles,' he added, noting the growing national debt: 'I think we need to pay down the credit card.' Johnson again cheered Musk’s efforts to slash the federal government. 'What Elon and the team are doing is what Congress has not had the ability to do,' Johnson said. 'They are exposing this massive fraud, waste and abuse that we have not been unable to uncover because the deep state has hidden it from us.'

Senate stares down an all-nighter to approve a ‘Plan B’ budget Trump spurned	Senate Republicans are embarking Thursday afternoon on an amendment free-for-all expected to keep lawmakers voting through the night — all to green-light a fiscal blueprint President Donald Trump doesn’t favor. The budget measure the Senate is on track to adopt at the end of an arduous 'vote-a-rama' sets a framework for a party-line package of energy policy, defense spending and border security investments.

A longtime Trump loyalist who has in the past expressed his desire to help root out the 'deep state,' Patel has raised questions among critics about whether he’s prepared to insulate the department from undue influence from the White House.

Trump says federal government should 'take over' local politics in DC	President Donald Trump said he was thinking about taking over local politics in the District of Columbia, a move that’d reignite controversy about the authority of the nation’s capital city to govern itself. 'The federal government should take over the governance of D.C. and run it really, really properly,' Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday. 'We should run it strong, run it with law and order, make it absolutely flawless.'

Patel on cusp of confirmation to run FBI as Collins says she'll oppose	Kash Patel, President Donald Trump's controversial nominee to lead the FBI, is on track to be confirmed in a matter of hours to run the federal law enforcement agency — but at least one Republican will withhold support. The Senate voted 51-47 to end debate on Patel's nomination on Thursday, setting up a final confirmation vote later in the afternoon. As that procedural vote was underway, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced she would vote against him, saying in a statement that his 'recent political profile undermines his ability to serve in the apolitical role of Director of the FBI.' Democrats have echoed those concerns, rallying against Patel's bid to be the next FBI director on grounds that he would put fealty to the president over his responsibilities to lead a department that has t...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/20/congress/kash-patel-fbi-cloture-00205164	2025-02-20T08:53:32-08:00

Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the former majority leader and the most consequential Republican senator of his generation, will announce Thursday he will not seek re-election next year.

The news of McConnell's retirement was described by three people with direct knowledge of the matter. They were granted anonymity to share the news ahead of a formal announcement. McConnell turned 83 on Thursday. He has recently suffered several health challenges, including a fall taken while leaving the Senate chamber earlier this month that has left him using a wheelchair.

'We've sanitized different language so significantly that, you know, people don't feel like we're talking to them.'

Fresh executive order targets sanctuary cities, federal aid for undocumented migrants	President Donald Trump signed an immigration executive order late Wednesday designed to target sanctuary cities and ensure undocumented immigrants aren’t receiving federal benefits. The order directs federal departments and agencies to identify any federal programs providing financial benefits to undocumented immigrants, while in the same breath acknowledging that under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, undocumented immigrants are already mostly barred from public programs. But the order argues that the Biden administration 'undercut the goal of' temporary parole authority, which allows the government to grant migrants temporary permission to live and work in the U.S., by using it too extensively.

The 6 most urgent policy questions we have for America’s governors	Governors are scrambling to figure out the most effective way to respond to the seismic changes unleashed in the opening weeks of the Trump administration. The basic calculus is clear: Democrats are searching for ways to thwart the White House’s most sweeping actions, while Republicans are desperate to show they’re fully on board with the MAGA agenda. But beneath that crude dynamic, the deliberations happening in state capitals are far more nuanced and politically fraught. Democrats are wary of simply mounting a scorched-earth resistance to President Donald Trump’s policies given the GOP’s sweeping victories on Election Day. That’s especially true on immigration, where the president’s hard-line tactics have resonated even with voters in deep blue swaths of the country. Republicans, meanwhi...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/six-policy-questions-american-governors-00203907	2025-02-20T02:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/5d/f3/d677a34a45e89abc3c92ca81a3a1/fifty-demko-govsummit.jpg

Republicans fret over giving Cruz broad subpoena power of key committee	Sen. Ted Cruz’s bid for broad subpoena powers as chair of the Senate Commerce Committee is facing consternation even among some Republicans who worry about giving their colleague so much control. It puts the Texas Republican in an awkward position as he seeks to find his footing as the leader of a powerful committee with jurisdiction over some of the major issues facing Congress under a new Republican governing trifecta. After nearly a month of uncertainty, GOP members of the Senate Commerce Committee met last week to discuss whether to give their chair unilateral authority to haul Big Tech CEOs before the panel, according to two people familiar with the private meeting.

Republicans in Hispanic-heavy districts push Johnson not to slash Medicaid or SNAP	Eight House Republicans who are members of the Hispanic conference or represent large Hispanic populations are publicly pressing Speaker Mike Johnson to not slash Medicaid, food assistance and Pell Grants in his budget plan. The group’s new letter to Johnson Wednesday is a serious escalation of private concerns lawmakers have been airing in recent days. House GOP leaders are pressing for rank-and-file lawmakers to back the latest budget plan on the House floor next week — the next step to unlock their massive, party-line bill that spans energy, border and tax policy.

Vance keeps Senate budget plan alive	Vice President JD Vance told Senate Republicans on Wednesday that Donald Trump prefers the House’s one-bill approach to his legislative agenda. But Vance didn’t put a stake in the Senate’s competing approach — as a backup. Senate Republicans took the message, delivered during a closed-door lunch, as a sign that they have a green light from the administration to move forward with their two-bill budget plan this week. It would tee up a border, defense and energy bill, saving an overhaul of the tax code for a separate bill later this year. 'We’re moving forward tomorrow,' Senate Budget Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said after the lunch.

Collins: Spending negotiations ‘not going well’ ahead of March shutdown cliff	Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins told reporters Wednesday afternoon that funding negotiations with Democrats 'are not going well' as lawmakers stare down a government shutdown deadline in just over three weeks. It usually takes congressional leaders at least a month to finalizing a dozen annual funding bills after top appropriators strike an initial agreement on overall totals for the military and non-defense programs. But Collins (R-Maine) and her fellow top appropriators have yet to strike that 'toplines' agreement to lay the groundwork for negotiating the details of the 12 bills — and the shutdown deadline on March 14 is quickly ticking closer.

Trump stuns Senate GOP with House budget endorsement	Republicans on Capitol Hill have long wanted President Donald Trump to weigh in on the strategic disputes that have divided the two chambers over how to pass his legislative agenda. But this is not what GOP senators had in mind. Trump’s public call Wednesday for the adoption of a House-drafted budget framework — and the 'one big, beautiful bill' it sketches out — left Senate Republicans flat-footed and uncertain about the path forward. 'As they say, did not see that one coming,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune said after emerging from a morning huddle with his fellow GOP leaders. Trump, he confirmed, gave him no heads up that his Truth Social missive backing the House was coming.

Senate still moving forward with budget, Thune says	Senate Majority Leader John Thune said that Republicans are moving ahead — for now — with their budget blueprint, even after President Donald Trump endorsed the House’s competing plan on Wednesday. 'We're planning to proceed. But, you know, obviously we are interested in and hoping to hear with more clarity where the White House is coming from,' Thune told reporters after meeting with fellow GOP leaders.

Trump backs House budget plan, calls on Senate to stand down	President Donald Trump threw his support on Wednesday behind the House's budget blueprint — throwing a curveball into the Senate's plan to vote on a competing version this week. Trump, in a Truth Social post, said both chambers are 'doing a SPECTACULAR job of working together' but added that the House budget was preferable because it would fold all of his priorities together instead of separating them into two bills like the Senate GOP plan would. 'We need both Chambers to pass the House Budget to 'kickstart' the Reconciliation process, and move all of our priorities to the concept of, 'ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL.'

GOP leaders face some objections that will slow them down, mostly from Democrats, but for now they’re on track. Contrast that with the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson is struggling to corral his conference, and it’s unclear whether he’ll have the votes to move forward with his own budget next week.

GOP privacy hawks brush off concerns about DOGE data dives	Some of the Senate’s most notorious GOP privacy hawks are shrugging off moves by Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency to access Americans’ sensitive taxpayer data. It’s a sharp turn for lawmakers who often carp about intrusions on individual privacy, and just the latest example of how Republicans are willing to forgive an unelected billionaire set on shattering institutional norms. In this case, Musk is seeking to give his team the ability to look up personal information on an IRS system that contains broad individual financial records along with information from the Social Security Administration.

Senate tees up ‘vote-a-rama’ on budget for party-line package	Senate Republicans took their first procedural vote Monday night on the budget plan they hope to use to swiftly enact a border security, energy and defense spending bill — and deliver President Donald Trump a major legislative victory during his first months in office. The 50-47 vote will allow GOP senators to forge ahead later this week with floor debate on that fiscal blueprint, followed by a so-called vote-a-rama — an overnight barrage of amendment votes that precedes adoption of the budget resolution. But the power of that measure to allow lawmakers to skirt Senate filibuster rules to draft and pass a partisan bill won't be unlocked until GOP leaders in the House and Senate get on the same page about the scope of their party-line package.

Trump's FBI pick one step closer to confirmation	Kash Patel, the controversial nominee to lead the FBI, cleared another key procedural hurdle Tuesday. The Senate voted 48-45 to move forward with Patel’s nomination, setting up his confirmation vote in the coming days to helm the agency for a 10-year term. Patel, if confirmed, is set to be a central figure in President Donald Trump’s efforts to leverage his powers against perceived enemies. A former House staffer who worked to discredit the congressional inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Patel has promised to go after Trump’s adversaries and shut down the FBI’s Washington headquarters on Day 1 of his tenure to create 'a museum' of the 'deep state.'

Ways and Means eyeing limits to corporate tax deductions	The House Ways and Means Committee is looking at limiting corporate state and local tax deductions as one way to offset the costs of a large party-line tax bill, according to two people familiar with the discussions. The panel, which oversees all tax policy, is considering the limit among other potential offsets for the bill, according to the people, who were granted anonymity to share private deliberations. Companies currently can deduct an unlimited amount of state income, property and sales taxes from their federal tax bill. The discussions signal that a proposal to limit corporate SALT, as the deduction is called, may have enough support among Republicans to make it into a party-line tax bill.

'Congress can’t do anything except complain' about the slashing of the federal government at the hands of Musk and his allies, Grassley said during a press call on Tuesday, according to a report from RadioIowa. The Iowan's comments serve as a stark admission that, despite growing Republican discomfort that Musk's actions are getting the green light from President Donald Trump, there is little the GOP might be able, or willing, to do.

Trump is shocking official Washington. Will he leave his mark on the District too?	Donald Trump isn’t just looking to remake the federal government. He has his sights set on the city of Washington, too. In his first few weeks in office, the president has moved to drastically alter the fabric of the nation’s capital. He ordered thousands of Washington-area federal workers to return to the office — some of whom his administration is moving to lay off.

They’re not just suing to stop DOGE. They’re suing Elon Musk himself.	Elon Musk’s efforts to disrupt and dismantle the federal government at the behest of Donald Trump have already sparked a legion of lawsuits. Now the legal challengers are setting their sights on a new target: Musk himself. Two new cases accuse the ultra-wealthy CEO of illegally amassing too much government power without the accountability typically required of high-level executive branch officials. They are seeking court orders that would force Musk to halt the cost-cutting and information-gathering activities he has been spearheading through his U.S. DOGE Service. The lawsuits rest on a provision of the Constitution that says powerful federal officers must be 'established by law,' must be formally appointed by the president and must be confirmed by the Senate.

Brooke Rollins confirmed as USDA chief	The Senate voted 72-28 on Thursday to confirm Brooke Rollins’ nomination to serve as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. All Republicans agreed to pass Rollins, but more Democrats voted against her than expected — including Sens. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), who initially helped advance her out of the Senate Agriculture Committee to the full Senate floor. Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), who voted in favor of Rollins, said 'a lot of Democrats' are voting against most of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees in response to his ef...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/13/congress/brooke-rollins-confirmed-agriculture-secretary-00204043	2025-02-13T09:12:15-08:00	
RFK Jr.’s plans could make Musk’s look small	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now in charge of the nation’s health agencies. His plans to upend them could make Elon Musk’s budget-cutting spree look modest by comparison. Kennedy won Senate confirmation on Thursday even after vowing to take nutrition and health programs in a radical new direction, and despite his long history of criticizing the safety of scientifically proven vaccines. 'We will make sure our tax dollars support healthy foods. We will scrutinize the chemical additives in our food supply. We will remove the financial conflicts of interest in our agencies,' he told the Senate Finance Committee in describing his goals. 'We will create an honest, unbiased, science-driven HHS, accountable to the president, to Congress, and to the American people.' The Senate confirmed Kennedy in a 5...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/rfk-jr-now-runs-americas-health-agencies-00204063	2025-02-13T08:34:21-08:00	https://static.politico.com/40/7c/9bd06ebb45dd9e63ee152ab6c432/unlimiteduse-rfkhearing-023.jpg
Senate panel votes 'yes' on Trump's pick to lead the FBI	Kash Patel, President Donald Trump’s controversial pick to lead the FBI, was voted out of committee along party lines on Thursday morning. The 12-10 vote from the Senate Judiciary Committee paves the way for Patel to be confirmed by the full Senate in the coming weeks, when he'll take the helm of the federal law enforcement agency amid a massive leadership shakeup. The committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, has accused Patel of helping from the outside to oust some of the Justice Department's top officials in the early days of the Trump administration. If confirmed, Patel would become a key leader in Trump’s broad efforts to root out those deemed disloyal to his cause from the federal government. 'He’s been subjected to relentless attacks on his character,' said committee ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/13/congress/kash-patel-trump-fbi-00204035	2025-02-13T08:10:43-08:00	
Speaker Johnson bullish on budget blueprint's prospects	Speaker Mike Johnson said the House GOP budget resolution will advance out of the Budget Committee today with no Republican defections, despite protests from key hard-liners. 'I expect it to pass — unanimously,' Johnson told reporters as he entered the Capitol on Thursday. After weeks of delays, the Budget panel is meeting later this morning to debate and vote on a budget blueprint necessary for unlocking the massive Trump agenda bill they’re trying to pass this year along party lines. Fiscal hawks like Reps. Chip Roy of Texas, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and others on the panel are still demanding higher spending cuts, guarantees on work requirement...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/13/congress/johnson-budget-reconciliation-00204030	2025-02-13T06:32:44-08:00	
Capitol agenda: Johnson's budget dare, RFK Jr. confirmation vote	Speaker Mike Johnson is daring conservatives to sink his budget resolution, setting up a make-or-break moment in the House Budget Committee later today. The speaker emerged from hours of talks Wednesday with two hard-liner holdouts — Reps. Chip Roy and Ralph Norman, both House Freedom Caucus members who also serve on the Budget Committee — saying he would not change his budget blueprint to meet their demands for deeper spending cuts and other adjustments.

Key committee could advance stalled health policy overhaul	The House Energy and Commerce Committee is giving a significant platform to revived, bipartisan talks on legislation to lower prescription drug costs, according to a staff memo reviewed by POLITICO. The committee’s health subcommittee, led by Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), will hold a hearing on so-called 'PBM reform' for Feb. 26, although that date could change. Democrats and Republicans struck a deal late in the last Congress to place new regulations on pharmacy intermediaries, known as pharmacy benefit managers, in a bid to lower costs for patients and employers. These benefit managers, or PBMs, negotiate drug costs for insurers and employers. Carter and his counterpart on the health subcommittee, Rep. <a ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/12/congress/energy-and-commerce-plots-pbm-hearing-00203968	2025-02-12T18:00:00-08:00	
Top House appropriator says spending talks still on track	The top appropriators of the House and Senate are still pursuing a bipartisan spending agreement ahead of the March 14 deadline to avoid a government shutdown — barely a month away. House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said the so-called 'four corners' spending leaders are getting closer to agreement, but are still 'not there,' following a Tuesday night meeting. 'We've been negotiating, we're working hard, and we've closed some of the gap,' Cole told reporters Wednesday. 'We have some knotty issues between us. Are we as far apart as we were? No, we're not. We've made considerable progress.'

Energy and Commerce Committee's Medicaid problem just got tougher	It was always going to be tough for House Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie to rally his members around cuts to Medicaid; his job could soon get even harder. The House GOP budget blueprint unveiled Wednesday would direct several congressional committees to achieve at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts across programs under their panels’ purviews — necessary to offset a party-line, budget reconciliation bill to enact President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda. The Energy and Commerce Committee has been told to find at least $880 billion in savings, or more than half of that total amount, to pay for a massive package that would extend expiring tax cuts, beef up border security and expand American energy...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/12/congress/energy-commerce-medicaid-guthrie-00203919	2025-02-12T14:15:50-08:00	
Vance, Miller and Vought backing 2-bill reconciliation strategy; Bessent pushing 1	Vice President JD Vance, White House policy chief Stephen Miller and budget chief Russ Vought are among those in the Trump administration pushing for a two-bill approach on reconciliation, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is pushing for one, people familiar with their thinking, granted anonymity to share it, said Wednesday. Two of those familiar confirmed Vance and Miller’s positions, which prioritize quickly passing immigration-related funding and dealing with tax cuts in separate legislation later, while one of those and a third person confirmed Vought also supports the strategy. Congressional Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to bypass Senate filibusters and more quickly enact President Donald Trump’s agenda, including tax cuts and additional funding for bord...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/12/congress/vance-miller-and-vought-backing-two-bill-reconciliation-strategy-bessent-pushing-one-00203896	2025-02-12T13:31:00-08:00

House budget resolution in limbo as conservatives push deeper spending cuts and work requirements	A planned markup on House GOP leaders' budget plan is less than 24 hours away — and they currently don't have the votes to pass it. The House Budget Committee released text of their one-bill proposal to tackle the border, energy and taxes Wednesday morning, which includes $1.5 trillion in minimum spending cuts. The panel plans to meet Thursday to markup and possibly vote to advance the resolution. It was immediately panned by some hard-liners in the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, who huddled in the basement of the Capitol Wednesday afternoon to discuss it. They're pushing for at least $500 billion in additional spending cuts, as well as work requirements for Medicaid, food aid benefits and another safety net program to be guaranteed in the resolution.

Dems fail to land viral moment at DOGE hearing	The highly anticipated first meeting of the House Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency, or DOGE, came and went on Wednesday with scarce political drama. Democrats sought to cast the subcommittee — a complementary effort to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk — as an extension of what they see as a corrupt executive branch plot to destroy the federal bureaucracy. But Republicans largely sidestepped those attacks, arguing they were in the business of eliminating government waste while Democrats had little interest in engaging earnestly on the subject. It was a surprising twist for a panel filled with political firebrands and chaired by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who just a few years ago was <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/12/congress/doge-subcommittee-mtg-musk-00203870	2025-02-12T11:05:50-08:00	
Tulsi Gabbard confirmed as director of national intelligence	The Senate voted to confirm Tulsi Gabbard to serve as director of national intelligence on Wednesday, with Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the only member of his party to vote against President Donald Trump’s nominee. The vote was 52 to 48. No Democrats voted in support for the former lawmaker. Gabbard has been one of Trump’s most contentious nominees because of her past remarks on foreign adversaries and concerns about whether she has the experience to do the job. But Republican senators — many of whom had expressed reservations about Gabbard as DNI — overwhelmingly backed her nomination. While McConnell’s office did not immediately release a statement explaining his vote, it is in keeping with...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/12/tulsi-gabbard-confirmed-as-director-of-national-intelligence-00203829	2025-02-12T08:59:43-08:00	https://static.politico.com/ba/05/5d4f97664ca096809b9d631f056c/u-s-congress-70033.jpg
Senate gets moving on two-track budget plan	The Senate Budget Committee is marking up its its signature piece of legislation — the reconciliation-unlocking budget resolution — in its race against House counterparts to identify the best path forward for turning President Donald Trump’s policy ambitions into law. While Congress has skipped a budget resolution in recent years, this year the measure is the centerpiece of Republican policymaking on Capitol Hill as the majorities in both chambers are hungry to uncork the power to bypass Senate filibusters and pass party-line bills to enact Trump's domestic agenda.

House budget draft unveiled ahead of Thursday markup	The House Budget Committee unveiled a fiscal blueprint for Republicans' sweeping domestic policy legislation Wednesday that would allow for at least $4.5 trillion in tax cuts while slashing spending by at least $1.5 trillion over the coming decade. The draft budget resolution also provides for as much as $300 billion in new border and defense spending and would allow Republicans to raise the debt limit by $4 trillion — enough for about a two-year extension.

Federal watchdogs fired by Trump urge court to reinstate them	Eight federal watchdogs, abruptly fired last month by President Donald Trump, are suing to get their jobs back, saying Trump broke the law by failing to give Congress a 30-day heads up and concrete explanation for the dismissals. Trump sent a jolt through Washington when he fired 17 inspectors general on the first Friday night of his term, presaging weeks of extraordinary assertions of power that have at times crossed clear legal boundaries. A 2022 federal law requires Trump to notify Congress 30 days before he terminates an inspector general and to provide detailed reasons.

House GOP budget still not final	House Budget Committee members are still debating key final details of the fiscal blueprint for Republicans’ massive domestic policy bill, with GOP leaders still hoping to release text of a budget resolution in the coming hours. Majority Leader Steve Scalise, arriving at the Capitol Wednesday, told reporters he still expects that text to be released to the public 'this morning.' 'I think we’re going to be on track to have budget markup tomorrow,' Scalise said. But he acknowledged it’s not ready quite yet. Key Budget Committee members continue to debate the final range of spending cuts to target in the plan, according to two people familiar with the ongoing talks.

Senate Republicans think Trump tacitly approves of their two-bill budget plan	Senate Republicans believe they have President Donald Trump’s blessing as they pursue a two-bill strategy for passing his domestic legislative agenda. Trump has repeatedly said that he prefers 'one big, beautiful bill,' but Senate Republicans have been privately checking that he is OK with them moving forward with two bills — one that addresses the border, energy and defense spending quickly, while a second gets into more complicated tax cuts. On Tuesday, OMB Director Russ Vought and Border Czar Tom Homan also said behind closed doors that they need $175 billion in additional border money quickly, further boosting Senate Republicans' confidence in moving immediately.
