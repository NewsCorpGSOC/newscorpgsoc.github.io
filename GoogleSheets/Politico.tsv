Gallego is latest Dem to back Laken Riley Act	Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) is the latest Democratic senator to sign on to support the Laken Riley Act, the House-passed immigration legislation with improving odds of passing in the upper chamber. 'We must give law enforcement the means to take action when illegal immigrants break the law, to prevent situations like what occurred to Laken Riley,' he said in a statement. The bill, approved Tuesday by the House with notable bipartisan support, would require the detention of any undocumented immigrant charged with theft or burglary. Gallego, elected to the Senate last November and sworn in last week, voted for the legislation when he was a member of the House last Congress. Gal...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/08/congress/laken-riley-act-ruben-gallego-00197043	2025-01-08T05:23:40-08:00	
Cotton pushing to hold Ratcliffe and Gabbard hearings next week	Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee are racing to schedule confirmation hearings next week for Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe — though panel Democrats and winter weather are complicating those plans. Sen. Tom Cotton, the new chair of the committee, wants to convene hearings for President-elect Donald Trump’s two top spy picks before his inauguration on Jan. 20, his spokesperson, Patrick McCann, said in a statement Tuesday. Trump has nominated Ratcliffe to be head of the CIA and Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence. 'The Intelligence Committee, the nominees, and the transition are diligently working toward that goal,' McCann said. But reaching that goal might be a challenge. Committee rules stipulate that vetting paperwork for the nominees must be received by the pane...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/07/congress/possible-delays-for-intel-picks-00197007	2025-01-07T17:26:53-08:00	
Mar-a-Lago meetings to include an offer on SALT cap	The incoming Trump administration plans to offer an expansion of the state and local tax deduction to Republican lawmakers from New York, New Jersey and California who are heading to Mar-a-Lago on Saturday for a sit-down with the president-elect. While exact details weren't available, one proposal being discussed would allow married couples to deduct $20,000 of their state and local taxes from their federal income taxes. Under current law, married couples can deduct only $10,000, which is the same for single taxpayers. In return, the so-called SALT Republicans will be expected to fall in line behind a sweeping tax bill the GOP hopes to enact later this year, two sources familiar with the new administration’s thinking told POLITICO, who were granted anonymity to discuss the internal strateg...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/07/congress/salt-advocates-expect-offer-at-mar-a-lago-00197002	2025-01-07T16:49:02-08:00	
A delay in confirmation plans for Linda McMahon as Education secretary	The Senate panel overseeing the confirmation of President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Education Department is waiting on documents from the transition team to proceed further, likely punting the hearing to after Inauguration Day. Sen. Bill Cassidy, chair of the Senate HELP Committee, said the timeline for Linda McMahon’s confirmation hearing is dependent on getting paperwork. Cabinet nominees have to submit documentation like financial disclosures and conflict of interest forms to the Office of Government Ethics. 'It really depends on us getting paperwork,' Cassidy told POLITICO when asked about the timeline for the confirmation hearing. 'Right now the hold seems to be on their side.'

Thune games out which Trump nominees he can confirm on Day One	Senate Republicans are strategizing how to land a top party priority in the next two weeks: getting some of incoming President Donald Trump’s nominees confirmed on Day One. News: Senate Majority Leader John Thune told us in a brief interview on Tuesday that Republicans have started feeling out who Democrats will help confirm on Jan. 20, immediately after Trump is sworn in. Remember that quick confirmation in the Senate will require support from all 100 senators. Senate GOP Whip John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) called Day One confirmations a current 'top priority.' 'That process is beginning,' Thune said, asked about efforts to check with Senate Democrats on confirmations they can clear on Jan. 20. He added that 'as you might expect, the noms for the national security space are awfully importa...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/07/congress/senates-day-one-goal-on-nominees-00196981	2025-01-07T14:53:43-08:00	
Durbin calls on DOJ to withdraw certain legal opinions on presidential war powers	Former Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin is asking the Biden administration to withdraw or release some 20 legal opinions regarding presidential war powers after Donald Trump indicated Tuesday that he was open to using military force to take Greenland or the Panama Canal. 'Congress and the executive branch may have differing views in some respects as to the separation of powers between them,' Durbin wrote in his letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland. 'However, these opinions are concerning outliers even by the standards of the executive branch’s own legal doctrine.' Durbin’s request spans a host of legal opinions, ranging from 1953 all the way to 'a 2020 memorandum articulating one ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/07/congress/fallout-from-trumps-greenland-comments-00196974	2025-01-07T14:48:43-08:00	
Laken Riley Act gains steam — with Democrats	A rightward national shift on border-related concerns helped give Republicans control of the White House and Senate — and the consequences are playing out on Capitol Hill this week with Democrats showing a new willingness to follow the GOP’s lead on illegal immigration. It’s an unmistakable sign that some in the Democratic ranks are moving in step with the electorate, abandoning their party’s old pieties on those issues and embracing tough new enforcement measures. Forty-eight House Democrats voted Tuesday to advance an illegal immigration crackdown known as the Laken Riley Act, a bill named for a Georgia nursing student murdered last year by an undocumented immigrant. That’s up from the 37 Democrats who b...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/07/democrats-immigration-issues-trump-00196950	2025-01-07T14:26:19-08:00	https://static.politico.com/e9/a0/068779264728b3abb2e6bd597bdd/u-s-congress-37475.jpg
Republican governors head to Mar-a-Lago	The march through Mar-a-Lago (aka the 'Winter White House') continues this week with a dinner for Republican governors on Thursday, according to two people familiar with the plans. It comes as Trump prepares to host a slew of House Republican groups there this weekend to game plan his ambitious 2025 agenda. The governors’ convening will offer a chance to reaffirm their loyalty — the biggest currency in Trump world. That’s particularly key for those like ally-turned-rival-turned-ally again, Gov. Ron DeSantis, who will make the trip down from Tallahassee, one of the people familiar said. But it’s not just a one-way street. Trump will also need these leaders to help execute his biggest priority: mass deportation, which will require coordination and resources at the state level.

Meet the new members: A Navy SEAL knocks out a Montana fixture	The new member: Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.) How they got here: Sheehy won an incredibly expensive contest to oust three-term Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester by a 52.6 percent to 45.5 percent margin. Inside the campaign: Spending the contest hit record-levels in the state, with an estimated $487 being doled out for each of the state’s 648,000 active registered voters. As Democrats hoped to hold onto the seat despite the state’s red tinge at the federal level, Sheehy faced scrutiny over how he sustained a gunshot wound in his arm — either during a visit to a national park or while serving in Afghanistan. Montana voters were bombarded with advertising and mailers throughout the contest, which Sheehy ultimately prevailed in.

Trump warns of new tariffs against Canada, Mexico, EU. And maybe Denmark, too.	President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated his threat to impose tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods from Mexico and Canada to pressure both countries to stop the flow of illegal immigration and cross-border fentanyl shipments. 'We're going to put very serious tariffs on Mexico and Canada,' Trump said during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort, a little less than two weeks before he is sworn into office for a second term as president. Trump also raised the U.S. trade deficit with Canada, complaining that, 'they make 20 percent of our cars. We don't need that. I'd rather make them in Detroit.' 'We don’t need anything they have,' he continued, singling out other key Canadian exports to the U.S., such as lumber and dairy.

Jordan plans meeting with Zuckerberg after Meta eliminates fact-check program	Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan told reporters that he's meeting with Mark Zuckerberg in the next few weeks, as the Meta CEO plans an upcoming visit to D.C. Meta announced on Tuesday that it would be getting rid of its fact-checking program, which Republicans have criticized as a way the parent company of Facebook and Instagram has suppressed conservative speech. Jordan said Tuesday he was hopeful that Zuckerberg would now be an ally in his crusade against censorship on social media platforms. It’s part of Meta’s broader push to make amends with the GOP as Republicans take control of the White House and Congress. Meta recently recruited former Bush White House staffer Joel Kaplan to run its global policy. Jordan said Kaplan informed him of Meta’s policy changes on Monday, before they were annou...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/07/congress/jordan-plans-meeting-with-zuckerberg-00196890	2025-01-07T10:54:12-08:00	
Johnson downplays debt cliff risks with one-track reconciliation push	Trying to raise the debt limit in a massive reconciliation bill could completely derail an already messy process. Speaker Mike Johnson is insisting it’s still his plan. Republicans were already worried that passing new policies on the border, energy and taxes via the budget reconciliation process — which they can use to pass bills on a party-line basis — was going to be difficult. Johnson then promised incoming President Donald Trump in December that he would also use a reconciliation bill to raise the debt ceiling, adding another layer of complexity. Conservatives are generally opposed to raising the debt limit and have demanded huge spending cuts in exchange for their support. Asked about the potential risks to the nation’s credit rating if the package is delayed, Johnson indicated in a ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/07/congress/johnson-sticks-to-debt-limit-plan-00196882	2025-01-07T10:32:31-08:00	
Trump slams Carter’s Panama Canal deal as he’s set to lie in state	President-elect Donald Trump slammed Jimmy Carter’s agreement to transfer ownership of the Panama Canal to Panama as a 'disgrace' — on the first day the late former president is set to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol. 'Jimmy Carter gave it to them for $1 and they were supposed to treat us well. I thought it was a terrible thing to do,' Trump said Tuesday at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago. Carter died last month at 100 years old. On Tuesday, his casket was transferred to Washington, D.C., where he will lie in state at the Capitol before his funeral on Thursday. The Democrat signed the Torrijos-Carter Treaties in 1977 during his one term in office, setting in motion the 1999 transfer of the U.S.-built infrastructural wonder to the country of Panama.

In his first press conference of the new year, Trump called the new foreign investment from property development company DAMAC Properties an example of business growth spurred by his election. It 'underscores that many of the greatest business leaders on Earth are seeing a very bright future for America,' he said.

New Dem additions to a plum panel are spurring private angst	An under-the-radar decision to add Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and about half a dozen other members to the House Energy and Commerce is causing some angst among House Democrats, according to three people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to detail private discussions. In an unusual move, the Steering and Policy panel filled six out of the seven open slots on the Energy and Commerce Committee Tuesday morning and left the last position open for a 10-way race.

It’s the Laken Riley Act, named after a Georgia nursing student murdered last February, and it would require the detention of any undocumented migrant charged with theft or burglary. It's also an early test of how Democrats will approach border issues after losing control of the White House and Senate in last year’s election. Speaker Mike Johnson challenged Democrats this morning to join Republicans in passing the bill: 'It can't be just empty rhetoric.

He wants to be sworn in as Venezuela’s president. He needs US help.	In the eyes of President Joe Biden and much of the world, Edmundo González Urrutia is the rightful next president of Venezuela. Yet he’s in Washington this week seeking America’s help making that a reality. Venezuela holds its inauguration on Friday, and strongman ruler Nicolás Maduro is planning to be sworn in. González says he, too, intends to be there to take the oath of office — if he can reach Venezuela’s shores, avoid the $100,000 bounty on his head, and convince Maduro to step aside. The odds are against González, but he’s doing his best to convince Biden, aides to President-elect Donald Trump and other American leaders to support his cause.

First step on reconciliation in limbo amid GOP infighting	Republicans are looking to take the first step to jumpstart the budget reconciliation bill: Writing the instructions that will govern the terms of the package. But they’re stuck in limbo amid an ongoing debate about whether to go with a one- or two-bill strategy. House and Senate Republican leaders have been struggling to decide if they’ll pass one package on the border, taxes and energy, or whether to do two bills that splits off taxes. To start the reconciliation process, Budget Committees in both chambers have to write instructions that would both detail how many bills they plan to pass and direct relevant committees to develop language.

Dems to the GOP on budget reconciliation: 'Good luck'	As House Republicans publicly grapple over how to advance President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda, House Democrats are looking across the aisle with some schadenfreude. Just four years ago, Democrats were hotly debating how to enact President Joe Biden’s ambitious legislative agenda as they faced similar problems — a tiny legislative majority and the gauntlet of the Senate parliamentarian. Democrats ultimately ended up splitting the agenda into two separate bills, pandemic aid legislation and a massive social spending package, and the legislative wrangling consumed much of the first two years of Biden’s presidency.

GOP memo: Congress likely can't slash certain infrastructure law programs for tax cuts	Lawmakers likely can't count on yanking back some portions of 2021 infrastructure law spending to pay for tax cuts or other GOP priorities like border security as part of a forthcoming reconciliation bill, according to an analysis by the House Transportation Committee’s GOP staff. The memo, obtained by POLITICO, makes clear that scaling back the law's $184 billion in advanced appropriations designated as emergency spending for DOT-administered programs would not translate into direct savings and can't be used to offset direct spending because of the way the budget is scored. Though just a fraction of the law's total $1.2 trillion in spending, it represents a blow to the GOP's quest to yank back what they see as wasteful spending in the law.

Trump fights Jan. 6 civil lawsuits on 4th anniversary of riot	A lawyer for Donald Trump argued Monday that the Supreme Court ruling last summer granting him criminal immunity for some official acts also bolsters his case to escape liability in civil suits filed against him related to the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. As proceedings to certify Trump’s 2024 victory were getting underway at the Capitol Monday, Trump’s attorneys and lawyers for Democratic lawmakers suing him squared off at a virtual hearing to address the status of one of eight lawsuits the president-elect faces alleging that his actions and statements fueled the violence that broke out four years ago. Attorney Jonathan Shaw told U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta th...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/donald-trump-jan-6-lawsuits-00196671	2025-01-06T11:28:41-08:00	
Trump promises to undo Biden lame-duck drilling ban	President-elect Donald Trump on Monday vowed to quickly reverse President Joe Biden’s lame-duck push to ban oil and gas drilling along most of the U.S. coast. Trump said in a radio interview that he plans to undo Biden’s policy 'immediately' after he takes office later this month, although doing so would likely require help from Congress. The incoming president slammed Biden’s offshore drilling ban Monday in an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt. Biden announced earlier Monday — two weeks before Inauguration Day — that he was banning new offshore oil and gas drilling along most of the U.S. coastline. 'It's ridiculous. I'll unban it immediat...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/donald-trump-drilling-ban-00196667	2025-01-06T11:14:11-08:00	
Congress certifies Trump's presidential victory without melodrama	Congress formally certified President-elect Donald Trump’s victory with no drama on Monday. The sedate proceedings cemented Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, who also presided over the certification. Democratic leaders had stressed the importance of a peaceful transfer of power leading up to Monday, even as Trump and his allies attempt to whitewash the events of the insurrection at the Capitol four years ago. With the memory of rioters in the building still fresh in the minds of many lawmakers and a heavy security presence ringing the Capitol, no Democrats objected to the counting of electoral votes Monday. 'There was a proud but bipartisan tradition of using Jan. 6 to make technical objections within the byzantine electoral college system. And I think all of that got wash...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/congress-certifies-trumps-win-00196663	2025-01-06T10:41:47-08:00	
‘Stay tuned’: GOP leaders struggle over how to advance Trump’s legislative agenda	Top Republicans on Capitol Hill are still jockeying over how to advance Donald Trump’s vast legislative agenda, as the incoming president’s comments have given little clarity about how GOP leaders should proceed. Trump said on Monday that he prefers one large package — which would cover the border, energy and tax reforms — but is open to two bills. It’s stoking divisions between Senate and House GOP leaders, as Speaker Mike Johnson publicly pushes one bill, while Senate Majority Leader John Thune favors separating tax priorities from immigration and energy. The speaker told House Republicans Saturday that Trump wants 'one big beautiful bill.' But Senate Republicans quietly pushed back on that assertion all weekend, arguing they were still negotiating the best strategy.

Fed’s top bank cop to step down, averting potential clash with Trump	The Federal Reserve’s top regulatory official, Michael Barr, announced Monday that he will step down in the coming weeks, clearing the way for President-elect Donald Trump to reshape federal banking regulation. Barr, who has served as the Fed’s vice chair for supervision since 2022, said he would resign from that role by Feb. 28 or earlier if his successor is confirmed. He said he will continue to serve as a member of the Federal Reserve Board. His resignation will avert what could have been a major legal fight if Trump had sought to fire or demote him. Barr had been discussing his options with outside legal counsel. Barr’s term as vice chair for supervision had been set to run until 2026. But some Republicans and Trump allies had floated a legally controversial plan to try to remove or de...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/feds-top-bank-cop-will-step-down-00196640	2025-01-06T08:46:48-08:00	
Schumer to push for anti-terror funds in budget negotiations	NEW YORK — Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer will push for $615 million in anti-terror funds as part of the March budget negotiations with incoming President Donald Trump’s administration, Schumer’s team told POLITICO on Monday. The federal dollars from the Urban Area Security Initiative, or UASI, account — which is administered by FEMA — are necessary to protect New York City and Long Island, especially in light of the recent attacks in New Orleans and Las Vegas, Schumer said. 'This amount will help New York City and the region tap federal dollars that help prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism,' the New York senator said in a statement. 'Any effort to cut this anti-terror program, especially right now, cannot stand.'

Trump denies that he will pare back universal tariffs	President-elect Donald Trump denied Monday that he is considering paring back his plan for universal tariffs on imports, after the Washington Post reported his team is considering raising tariffs only on 'critical' imports related to national defense, energy and other key sectors. 'The story in the Washington Post, quoting so-called anonymous sources, which don't exist, incorrectly states that my tariff policy will be pared back,' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. 'That is wrong. The Washington Post knows it's wrong. It's just another example of Fake News.'

All quiet at the Capitol — except for the massive security operation	Rings of metal fencing and a powerful snowstorm have conspired to keep the area around the Capitol virtually lifeless Monday morning — with the exception of a massive security presence as Congress meets to finalize the results of the 2024 election. Secret Service, Capitol Police, Justice Department agencies and officers from cities across the country jammed every corridor of the building, vastly outnumbering the handful of reporters and lawmakers who arrived at the Capitol early. Vice President Kamala Harris made clear she’ll preside over a relatively uneventful count of electoral votes that will confirm Donald Trump’s victory. And Trump himself made only a passing reference to the certification on his Truth Social feed before posting a picture of the crowd at his rally four years ago, whi...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/january-6-election-certification-00196577	2025-01-06T07:16:12-08:00	
Trump says he's still open to two-bill track on GOP legislative priorities	President-elect Donald Trump publicly said that he’s open to a two-bill approach to budget reconciliation, slightly walking back his Sunday night endorsement of tackling the border, energy and taxes in one mammoth package. 'While I favor one bill, I also want to get everything passed. And you know, there are some people that don't necessarily agree with it,' Trump said in an interview with conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt Monday morning. Congressional Republicans have been debating for weeks whether to do one package, which they could pass on party lines using the budget reconciliation process, or break off tax cut proposals into a separate bill.

Former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio asks Trump for Jan. 6 pardon	The most notorious of all Jan. 6 defendants — former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio — has formally asked President-elect Donald Trump to pardon him for his seditious conspiracy conviction related to the attack on the Capitol. Tarrio was convicted by a jury of helping orchestrate the attack on the Capitol, even though he was banished from the city by prosecutors that day for his role in burning a stolen Black Lives Matter banner. U.S. District Judge Tim Kelly, a Trump appointee, sentenced Tarrio to 22 years in prison, the lengthiest sentence of any Jan. 6 defendant. Now, Tarrio is asking Trump for a full pardon, claiming he was targeted by the Biden administration for his political views rather than the alle...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/proud-boys-enrique-tarrio-pardon-00196572	2025-01-06T07:04:10-08:00

Biden: Don’t forget Jan. 6 attack — but let’s get back to a peaceful transition	Shortly ahead of the expected certification of the 2024 election, President Joe Biden said the country cannot ignore the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, but the nation must also return to the norms of a peaceful transfer of power. Biden, speaking with reporters late Sunday after he signed the Social Security Fairness Act, said he is 'hopeful' the country can move beyond that period, adding that President-elect Donald Trump’s actions at the time posed a 'genuine threat to democracy.' 'I think it should not be rewritten. I don’t think it should be forgotten,' Biden said, adding that he’s tried to make the transition 'smooth' for the incoming Trump administration.

Gillibrand to chair Senate Democrats' campaign arm for 2026 cycle	Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) will chair Senate Democrats' campaign arm this cycle, teeing up the party’s attempt to regain the majority in 2026. Senate Democrats will have critical races next year in Georgia, Michigan and Maine, where swing-vote Republican Sen. Susan Collins is up for reelection. They will also have potential pickup opportunities in Texas and North Carolina, though those states have proved tricky for Democrats to topple in the past. While the 2026 map is not miraculously favorable for Senate Democrats, it's far more friendly than the 2024 map that had them on defense in virtually every race, including red states like West Virginia, Montana and Ohio, all of which went to the GOP.

Trump backs massive single bill for taxes, border and energy	Incoming President Donald Trump threw his support on Sunday behind having one sweeping border, energy and tax bill. 'Members of Congress are getting to work on one powerful Bill that will bring our Country back, and make it greater than ever before. We must Secure our Border, Unleash American Energy, and Renew the Trump Tax Cuts,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'Republicans must unite, and quickly deliver these Historic Victories for the American People. Get smart, tough, and send the Bill to my desk to sign as soon as possible,' he added.

Clyburn hopes Johnson will attempt to find 'common ground'	Senior Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn on Sunday encouraged newly reelected House Speaker Mike Johnson to work with Democrats on agenda items in the new term.

Trump chooses Estonia-born lawyer as ambassador to the Baltic nation	President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Estonian-born lawyer Roman Pipko as his nominee for America’s next ambassador to the tiny Baltic country. The position requires Senate confirmation, and Republican control of the upper chamber should make such approval relatively easy to obtain. Still, the role could get more attention than normal because Estonia shares a border with Russia and is among the European countries most vocal about the need to defend Ukraine as it fights off a Russian invasion. Pipko has represented U.S. interests at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Russian American Enterprise Fund, according to Trump’s announcement Friday night.

Johnson prevailed in the speakership race. His problems are just beginning.	Mike Johnson managed to avoid a drawn-out battle for the speakership on Friday. His headaches are just getting started. While Johnson ultimately secured enough votes to remain speaker on the first ballot — after two members switched their votes after further lobbying from Johnson and phone calls with President-elect Donald Trump — the aftermath of his victory made it clear that conservatives see this as a tentative truce. Hardliners said they have certain expectations for the speaker going forward, and signaled that forcing a vote to oust him is on the table if Johnson doesn’t meet them. The newly adopted rules package requires the support of nine GOP members, up from the current threshold of one, to trigger an ouster vote. 'It's always going to be there.

House adopts rules package expanding Johnson’s protections	The narrowly divided House has adopted a rules package, with a vote of 215-209, that most notably will see a significantly raised threshold for members to trigger an effort to oust the speaker. Under the section-by-section analysis of the rules, it would now take nine members of the Republican conference to trigger a motion to vacate the speakership, a threshold that was just a single member when the GOP opted to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last Congress.

Trump picks a former State Department official to be deputy Middle East envoy	Donald Trump has invited former State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus to join his new administration — but he doesn't seem thrilled about it. The president-elect said Friday that he would appoint Ortagus, who was the public face of the State Department for three years in his first administration, to be deputy special presidential envoy for Middle East Peace. Trump noted in a post on Truth Social that 'early on Morgan fought me for three years, but hopefully has learned her lesson.' He didn’t provide any specifics about their disagreement. In 2016, Ortagus criticized Trump’s isolationist views, but became a vocal Trump supporter when he won the Republican nomination at the time.

'We don't know all the information about some of these nominees,' Thune added. 'I think we know a lot about them, but they deserve a fair process. And that's what we've committed to and promised.'

Trump's inside-the-box pick to run tax at Treasury	President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for his point man on tax at the Treasury Department is an experienced insider whose nomination signals business will have a strong ally in the administration as it pushes through major tax legislation. Ken Kies, a leading tax lobbyist who has advocated for big corporations such as Microsoft and Hess, is widely seen as extremely knowledgeable about both the tax code and the ways of Washington, though he has also developed a reputation among some for sharp elbows and a prickly, suffer-no-fools personality.

Why two GOP holdouts flipped their votes on Johnson	Reps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self received phone calls from President-elect Donald Trump between their initial votes against Speaker Mike Johnson and their eventual flips to support him, according to two Republicans who were granted anonymity to speak candidly.

'His one-on-one calls weren’t what got it done,' one of the Republicans said, referring to the Trump calls. A handful of Republicans repeated the same sentiment. Self confirmed that he spoke to Trump multiple times, calling it 'lively.' But he added that they have the same agenda.

Initial Norman holdout on speaker vote leads to GOP ire	Before the Freedom Caucus member switched his vote, conservatives lined up to criticize Rep.

He doesn’t support MAGA and he’s an embarrassment to South Carolina,' wrote Wesley Donehue, a veteran South Carolina GOP strategist, in an X post.

Centrists warn Johnson not to cut deals with conservatives to get the speakership	House centrists are warning Speaker Mike Johnson to not cut side deals with conservatives to win the gavel. The verbal red flag comes as Johnson is heading toward a showdown over keeping his speakership, with a vote set to begin shortly after noon. He doesn’t appear to have the votes to secure it on the first ballot, as one Republican vows to oppose him and about a dozen others are publicly undecided. Johnson’s right flank is making several demands, including seeking commitments on slashing spending. But it’s one significant ask — a bid to give Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) the Rules Committee gavel — that is sparking the biggest heartburn. Unlike most top committee spots, who gets the Rules gavel is up to the speaker alone.

Thune: The filibuster survives under my watch	Soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader John Thune will kick off his tenure atop the chamber by committing, again, to preserving the legislative filibuster, according to excerpts of his prepared remarks obtained by POLITICO. 'One of my priorities as leader will be to ensure that the Senate stays the Senate,' Thune’s prepared remarks read. 'That means preserving the legislative filibuster — the Senate rule that today has perhaps the greatest impact in preserving the Founders’ vision of the Senate.' 'That includes empowering committees, restoring regular order, and engaging in extended debate on the Senate floor, where all members should have a chance to make their voices — and the voices of their constituents — heard,' the remarks add. Holding the filibuster in tact could be a lofty task. Preside...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/senate-filibuster-republicans-keep-00196359	2025-01-03T08:54:16-08:00	
Some of Johnson's detractors think he'll still win	Some potential Republican holdouts are signaling they’re preparing for Mike Johnson to win the speaker’s gavel Friday, in a positive shift for Johnson as his speakership hangs in the balance. Some of the Louisianan's detractors have privately said that they will 'vote for Trump’s agenda,' making clear that they will either support Johnson on the first ballot or at least after the first few rounds of voting, according to three Republicans familiar with the conversations who were granted anonymity to candidly discuss them. However, key holdout Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) has not yet privately expressed that same sentiment, four Republicans similarly granted anonymity said. Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.), another remaining holdout, said Friday at the Capitol that he thinks Johnson will be elected —...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/03/congress/mike-johnson-vote-count-latest-00196354	2025-01-03T07:46:14-08:00

Trump taps more business leaders as ambassadors	President-elect Donald Trump has selected two more wealthy business leaders for ambassadorships. He has tapped health care executive Benjamin Leon Jr. for the post in Spain and chosen entrepreneur Joe Popolo to head to the Netherlands. Both positions will require Senate confirmation, but that should not prove a major hurdle given that Republicans control the upper chamber. Leon has made his fortune in the health care industry. He’s an avid equestrian and philanthropist, according to online biographies. Much of Leon's work and philanthropy has been concentrated in Florida.

Trump’s former air chief may helm EPA landing team	Former acting EPA air chief Anne Idsal Austin is a member of the Trump transition landing team at the agency — and may be leading it, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss the transition. The Texas lawyer, who also served as a regional EPA administrator early in President-elect Donald Trump’s first term, is one of several landing team member names that have been shared with EPA career staff, said the people briefed on the agency’s transition. There’s less clarity about whether she is leading the team charged with readying EPA for Trump’s second term, which begins Jan. 20.

Trump digs in on Johnson support as speaker showdown looms	Mike Johnson is heading toward a noon showdown over the fate of his speakership — even as President-elect Donald Trump doubled down on his support Friday morning. The House will kick off the new Congress and move almost immediately to a vote for the speaker’s gavel, with Johnson likely still short of the votes to retain the gavel with just hours to go. 'Good luck today for Speaker Mike Johnson, a fine man of great ability, who is very close to having 100% support.

Who to watch as Johnson’s speakership hangs in the balance	Mike Johnson can likely only afford to lose a single GOP vote if he wants to remain speaker. He’s already got one Republican promising to oppose him, and about a dozen more who won’t commit to backing him. Many of those publicly undecided lawmakers have indicated they won’t reveal how they plan to vote ahead of time so, for now, it’s impossible to predict if Johnson can succeed. And while Speaker Mike Johnson said Thursday that it was his 'plan' to win on the first ballot that will commence shortly after noon on Friday, even his allies are telegraphing that it might take a few votes before he clinches it. The House is starting the 119th Congress with effectively a 219-215 GOP-led chamber, assuming former Rep. Matt Gaetz doesn’t participate. Rep.

Johnson tries to avoid McCarthy pitfalls as he preps for a speaker showdown	Mike Johnson is trying to avoid the mistakes of his predecessor as he faces the toughest test of his political career on Friday. With his bid to keep his speakership on the line — despite support from President-elect Donald Trump — the Louisiana Republican is looking to sidestep the kinds of side deals with conservative Republicans that ultimately cost Kevin McCarthy his own political future. But that's a hard tightrope to cross. Fiscal hawks want Johnson to make commitments, including giving them greater control over how bills move to the floor and slashing spending — pledges that could be untenable for Johnson with a razor-thin GOP margin. And while conservatives believe that Johnson is keeping an open mind on some of their demands, they’re also concerned about whether he will keep the t...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/03/mike-johnson-kevin-mccarthy-speaker-fight-00196317	2025-01-03T02:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/85/0e/cd16a11f49628dc5c435df6f4caa/u-s-congress-69809.jpg
Buddy MacKay, a Democrat who briefly served as Florida’s governor, dead at 91	TALLAHASSEE, Florida — Former Florida Gov. Buddy MacKay, who lost to Jeb Bush in 1998 but still served 23 days in office after the sudden death of Gov. Lawton Chiles, has died. He was 91. The former Democratic governor took a nap after lunch at his home in Ocklawaha, Florida, on Tuesday and never woke up, his son Ken MacKay told The Associated Press. All of the governor’s adult children were present at the time, he said. 'It was a very peaceful end to a great life,' said MacKay, who hopes his father is remembered as a defender of Florida’s environment and an advocate for minorities. Floridians honored MacKay not just for his brief service as governor, but his time as a state legislator, congressman and diplomat. 'We mourn the passing of Buddy MacKay,' Gov. Ron DeSantis posted on X.

There’s a big problem with trying to replace Johnson — no clear alternates	Even House Republicans who are skeptical about keeping Mike Johnson on as speaker acknowledge they have a persistent problem: Who could replace him? As Johnson faces potentially a dozen holdouts or more going into the speakership vote on Friday, three familiar alternative candidates have come up in internal GOP conversations: Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan of Ohio and GOP Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota. All three ran for the speakership in October 2023 before Johnson was elected to take the gavel, and all three were forced to drop their bids as it became obvious they couldn’t get the near-unanimous support needed from House Republicans. Their prospects haven’t changed a ton since then — each still has a faction of the conference that would likely oppose...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/02/house-speaker-johnson-alternates-00196311	2025-01-02T15:01:26-08:00	https://static.politico.com/d3/a4/0557cbd64be79dc33442730e49b5/u-s-congress-31602.jpg

Trump throws more weight behind Johnson's speakership bid	President-elect Donald Trump is throwing more weight behind Mike Johnson's speakership bid, as a handful of Republicans are weighing whether to block Johnson's attempt to reclaim the gavel in less than 24 hours. Johnson’s team and Trump officials have discussed a list of GOP holdouts for the president-elect to call, according to three Republicans who were granted anonymity to speak candidly. And Johnson has signaled he's willing to make some concessions to keep the gavel, as hardliners make various demands, including top positions on the Rules Committee and commitments on spending. He told reporters Thursday afternoon that he was 'open' to some of the process reforms the hardliners are pushing, though it wasn't immediately clear what he was referring to.

How a long speaker fight could impact Trump’s ability to start his next term	If Republicans fail to elect a speaker Friday, the ensuing chaos could impact two of the most crucial moments enshrined in the Constitution: the Jan. 6 certification of the 2024 election, and — if things really go haywire — the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has endorsed Speaker Mike Johnson for another stint atop the House and has privately indicated that he doesn’t want Republicans delaying his priorities with a drawn-out speaker fight. But Johnson’s restive right flank is weighing opposing him anyway, and the House is essentially frozen until it elects a speaker. So if the election to lead the House is significantly delayed, it will have a cascading effect that could upend the transfer of power from Joe Biden to Trump in unpredictable ways.

Barrasso criticizes Cheney over the Presidential Citizens Award	President Joe Biden naming former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) as one of 20 recipients of the Presidential Citizens Award is already drawing backlash from her home state senator. GOP Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, in a statement, said Biden 'was either going to pardon Liz Cheney or give her an award. She doesn’t deserve either. She represents partisanship and divisiveness — not Wyoming.' Barrasso is set to become the Senate GOP whip. Biden on Thursday announced he would award Cheney, an outspoken critic of President-elect Donald Trump, and 19 others with the Presidential Citizens Award, which honors people who have performed 'exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens.'

Johnson doesn’t have the votes to remain speaker. But his allies insist it’s trending his way.	With less than 24 hours left until the start of the 119th Congress, Mike Johnson doesn’t have the votes yet to remain speaker. The Louisiana Republican has been working diligently over the past few days to lock down the 218 votes he needs, even after spending the holidays working the phones and meeting with incoming President-elect Donald Trump. But even the incoming president’s repeated endorsement earlier this week doesn’t mean Johnson is guaranteed a victory. Roughly a dozen Republicans are still on the fence, as some of them try to get concessions on the rules or commitments from Johnson on spending. There are some positive signs for the speaker. In addition to Trump’s restated backing, Johnson has managed to keep his official 'no' votes to only one so far — Rep.

But their early treatment of the first openly transgender House member is likely just a preview of how they'll navigate transgender politics and policies for the next two years. Believing voters in the 2024 elections rejected Democrats’ more inclusive positions on transgender rights, Republicans appear ready in 2025 to double down in support of executive orders and provisions in spending bills that would make it harder for transgender individuals to get health care, serve in the military or participate in school activities.

House rules would make it harder to oust speaker in next Congress	Republicans will make it harder to remove the speaker in the 119th Congress under a rules package unveiled Wednesday. The proposed rules package would require nine GOP members to back making a motion to vacate to trigger a vote on ousting the speaker. That’s an increase from the current rule, which allows any single GOP member to force a vote. The deal to increase the threshold was negotiated in November by members of the House Freedom Caucus and the small business-oriented Main Street Caucus last year — an agreement that was first reported by POLITICO.

Chris Sununu still believes the GOP is bigger than Donald Trump	Donald Trump remade the GOP in his image. Chris Sununu doesn’t think it’ll stick. That’s because the outgoing Republican governor of New Hampshire, who routinely oscillates between supporting Trump and criticizing him, believes his party is bigger than both its enduring standard bearer and the political movement he created. 'Trump is extremely unique. There's no ‘Trump lite’ or ‘Trump 2.0’ that can replace or replicate what he's brought to the table, for better or for worse,' Sununu said in an interview. And the GOP, he insists, is still a 'big tent,' ticking off varied constituencies like the Log Cabin Republicans, fiscal hawks, libertarian-leaners and social conservatives.

Speaking briefly with reporters outside of a New Year’s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect reaffirmed his support for the Louisiana Republican after his formal endorsement on Monday, saying 'he’s the one that can win right now.' The boost of support comes as Johnson’s path to retaining the speakership is tenuous. With the expected makeup of Congress on Friday, he can only have two Republican defections — and Rep.

Elaine Chao's advice for Trump's Labor and Transportation secretaries	Nothing much surprised Elaine Chao when she was named secretary of Labor by former President George W.

Trump endorses Johnson for speaker	Speaker Mike Johnson picked up a key endorsement from President-elect Donald Trump in his bid to serve another term. 'He will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN. Mike has my Complete &amp; Total Endorsement,' Trump wrote in a Monday social media post. Johnson faces some resistance from Hill conservatives ahead of Friday's vote, but Trump's backing could stifle other opposition.	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/30/congress/trump-endorses-johnson-for-speaker-00196113	2024-12-30T07:18:06-08:00

Happy New Year, the debt limit is here. Get ready for an all-out war over it.	GOP leaders are staring down two bad options to solve President-elect Donald Trump's debt-limit problem, after failing to execute his demand to lift the federal borrowing cap in the last government funding bill. One path requires full buy-in from Republican lawmakers to address the issue via budget reconciliation — a huge challenge thanks to the party’s fierce fiscal hawks. The other entails winning over Democrats, who for the most part rejected Trump’s initial debt-limit gambit last week. 'Whoever advised the president that it was even possible needs to better understand how this place works,' Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said about Trump’s latest push to raise the debt limit. It's going to be an urgent iss...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/30/debt-limit-dividing-republicans-trump-00195913	2024-12-30T02:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/c4/57/4401ee2a4c76bd8a2300e372539a/u-s-congress-97536.jpg
Tributes pour in for Jimmy Carter	Former President Jimmy Carter’s death on Sunday prompted an outpouring of tributes from fellow presidents and politicians. 'Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well,' President Joe Biden said in a statement with first lady Jill Biden. The Bidens celebrated the long and loving marriage between Carter and his wife Rosalynn, writing that it was 'the definition of partnership and their humble leadership is the definition of patriotism.' Carter entered the White House in 1977 as ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/29/tributes-jimmy-carter-death-00196106	2024-12-29T15:01:20-08:00	https://static.politico.com/c5/c9/e8a735df411ab18124a04551aba0/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/508226994
Former President Jimmy Carter dead at 100	Jimmy Carter had such confidence in his improbable path to the White House that he bet Americans worn down by Vietnam and Watergate would welcome a new kind of president: a peanut farmer who carried his own bags, worried about the heating bill and told it, more or less, like it was. And for a time, the voters embraced him. Yet just four years later, in the aftermath of a presidency that was widely seen as failed, it sometimes seemed as if all that was left of Carter was the smile — the wide, toothy grin that helped elect him in the first place, then came to be caricatured by countless cartoonists as an emblem of naïveté. But it was Carter’s great fortune to enjoy a post-presidency more than 10 times as long as his tenure in office — in March 2019, he became the longest-lived president ever...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/29/jimmy-carter-former-president-dead-at-100-033324	2024-12-29T13:25:18-08:00	https://static.politico.com/d0/da/4ee6068d421a995375dae1c9c618/carteroverride.jpg
Eric Schmitt, Ro Khanna voice support for H-1B visa reform, as GOP clashes over immigration	A Silicon Valley Democrat and a Republican Senator are calling for reform to the H-1B Visa program, which tech companies use to recruit thousands of high-skilled foreign workers every year. 'So I think the solution here, President Trump has actually articulated this in 2020, is to reform that system and get rid of the abuses, make it merit-based, and make sure that we're not undercutting wages, and having Americans train their foreign replacements,' Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) told 'Fox News Sunday' anchor Shannon Bream. The debate over the program, and immigration in general, roiled the Republican party last week, pitting tech entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk, David Sacks and Vivek Ramaswamy against the likes of Nikki Haley, far-right political activist Laura Loomer and many in the MAGA base...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/29/eric-schmitt-ro-khanna-h-1b-visa-reform-00196105	2024-12-29T12:22:54-08:00	https://static.politico.com/a4/0d/7152e6994fe795f02068252ff5de/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1950952089
Is the Democratic brand toxic? A growing number of Dems wonder if going ‘independent’ will help them win	Losing to a twice-impeached convicted felon has left a small, but growing, number of Democrats wondering if their party brand is so toxic that they should shed the label — particularly in battleground and red states. Mike Duggan, the longtime Democratic mayor of Detroit, is pursuing an independent campaign for governor in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory in his state. Democratic strategists are studying this year’s bid by independent Dan Osborn, who as a Senate candidate in Nebraska overperformed the top of the ticket, as a model to win the upper chamber. And a Joe Biden mega-fundraiser is floating a gubernatorial run in Florida on what he calls the 'Capitalist Party' ticket. The deliberations, some of which are taking place in private, reflect the extent to which Trump’s win has made th...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/29/democrats-running-independent-toxic-brand-001832	2024-12-29T03:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/70/73/910299f3472cad577d5ce3314ff7/election-2026-michigan-33714.jpg
Trump appears to side with Musk, tech allies in debate over foreign workers roiling his supporters	President-elect Donald Trump appears to be siding with Elon Musk and his other backers in the tech industry as a dispute over immigration visas has divided his supporters. Trump, in an interview with the New York Post on Saturday, praised the use of visas to bring skilled foreign workers to the U.S. The topic has become a flashpoint within his conservative base. 'I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,' Trump said. In fact, Trump has in the past criticized the H-1B visas, calling them '...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/28/trump-musk-tech-00196101	2024-12-28T13:32:42-08:00	https://static.politico.com/2a/1c/9a3697c74c25a62f5b874446ca17/trump-musk-65492.jpg
Yellen sees U.S. hitting debt limit in early- or late-January	Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Friday she expects the U.S. will officially run up against its borrowing limit in mid- to late-January, starting the clock on a major fiscal challenge facing President-elect Donald Trump in his first months in office. 'Treasury currently expects to reach the new limit between January 14 and January 23, at which time it will be necessary for Treasury to start taking extraordinary measures,' Yellen wrote in a letter to congressional leadership. The debt limit has been suspended since June 2023 when Congress passed a bipartisan deal reached between then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden. Under that law, the limit on Treasury’s abili...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/27/congress/yellen-sees-u-s-hitting-debt-ceiling-in-early-2025-00196091	2024-12-27T16:03:51-08:00	
Far-right activist Laura Loomer claims she was suspended on X by Elon Musk	Far-right activist Laura Loomer said she was suspended for 12 hours on X following a clash with its billionaire owner Elon Musk and the MAGA base over highly skilled foreign workers. Loomer said in a post Friday afternoon that she was temporarily booted from the social media site for 'raising concerns and speaking the truth about the technocratic takeover of our country and the White House.' 'How can you call yourself a ‘free speech absolutist’ and then punish someone by restricting their speech?' Loomer wrote. 'We need to have an honest conversation about Big Tech influence over MAGA.' Loomer said X also removed her blue checkmark and deactivated her subscriptions.

Republican brawl on immigration erupts as MAGA and tech world clash	An online debate over high-skilled immigration between Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and MAGA evangelists reveals Donald Trump’s Republican Party is grappling with growing pains as it prepares to retake the White House. Days after the powerful allies of Trump in Silicon Valley took to social media to argue for a greater number of high-skilled immigrants, with a side-swipe at American culture for emphasizing 'mediocrity over excellence,' some members of the far-right said such policies would make America 'look like India.' Enter Republican leaders like Rep.

Inside the campaign: Cisneros switched districts upon the retirement of longtime 88-year-old Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-Calif.). He emerged first in a crowded all-party primary with 23.6 percent of the vote. He previously won a swing California House seat in 2018, but lost reelection to Rep. Young Kim (R-Calif.). The issues he’ll focus on: The former congressman said he’ll focus on 'gun safety reform, educational opportunities, climate action, and women's rights' upon his return to Congress.

Roy hails Musk, Ramaswamy influence on spending as Hill GOP looks toward cuts	DOGE co-chairs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will have significant influence in how Congress slashes spending, Rep. Chip Roy said in an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Friday. 'When the DOGE guys came in, Elon and Vivek, I pointed to my Republican colleagues and I said, ‘You know what the problem is, right here in this room,’' Roy said. 'We have Republicans and Democrats who never met a program they didn’t want to promote for some sort of political gain.' Roy, the Freedom Caucus policy chair, added that Musk and Ramaswamy were working to identify spending waste, and the two businessmen could use their platforms to shine a light on the issue. Roy also floated potential examples of spending cuts, including the restricting the use of food stamps and repealing the Inflation Reduction Act.

Former Freedom Caucus chair on Johnson: ‘I'm going to keep my options open’	Rep. Scott Perry said Thursday that he’s not committing to voting for Mike Johnson for speaker, adding a former Freedom Caucus chair to the conservative crowd sowing doubt over Johnson’s prospects to retake the gavel. 'I think that Mike has done an admirable job under tough conditions, but I'm going to keep my options open,' Perry (R-Pa.) said Friday morning on Fox Business.

Former FBI and CIA head prods Senate to reject Patel, Gabbard	A former head of the FBI and CIA is raising objections over whether Kash Patel and Tulsi Gabbard, President-elect Donald Trump's picks to be directors of the FBI and national intelligence, respectively, are qualified to serve in the Cabinet. In a letter to senators on Thursday, William Webster, the only person to lead both the FBI and CIA, wrote that neither nominee meets the demands of top intelligence jobs. Webster, who is 100 years old, praised Patel's patriotism but wrote that his allegiance to Trump was concerning. 'His record of executing the president’s directives suggest a loyalty to individuals rather than the rule of law — a dangerous precedent for an agency tasked with impartial enforcement of justice,' he said. When it came to Gabbard, Webster wrote that her 'profound lack' of ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/26/congress/tulsi-gabbard-kash-patel-fbi-cia-trump-00196055	2024-12-26T15:11:17-08:00	
Freedom Caucus chair: House GOP needs to consider if ‘current leadership is what we need’	House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris told Fox Business on Thursday that the chamber’s Republicans need to consider if current leadership 'is what we need' going into unified GOP government next year. 'Before the last couple of weeks, I was in his corner, but now we should consider what’s the best path forward,' Harris (R-Md.) said of Speaker Mike Johnson. 'We do need to consider whether — if we’re going to advance Mr. Trump’s agenda — whether the current leadership is what we need.' Harris’ comments come after he signaled last week that he was on the fence about whether or not to support Johnson during the Jan. 3 speaker vote, <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/20/johnson-unsteady-speakership-time-0...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/26/congress/freedom-caucus-chair-on-johnson-house-gop-harris-trump-00196049	2024-12-26T12:49:20-08:00	
Meet the new members: From governor to rank-and-file senator	The new member: Sen.-elect Jim Justice (R-W.Va.) How they got here: Justice, West Virginia’s sitting governor, easily defeated Democrat Glenn Elliott by more than 40 percentage points to flip control of this Senate seat for Republicans. Inside the campaign: Since announcing his Senate bid in April 2023, Justice was the heavy favorite for this key GOP flip opportunity. He easily dispatched Rep. Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.) in the GOP primary by more than 35 percentage points. Justice is termed out as governor, making the Senate a tempting opportunity. His push got even easier when longtime Sen. Joe Manchin (I) announced he would not run for reelection.

How Schumer is prepping for Trump 2.0	In less than a month, elected Democrats will find themselves with a lot less power in Washington, with a GOP-controlled House, Senate and White House resulting in a landscape in which their ability to tussle with President-elect Donald Trump will be largely rhetorical. But if Dem leaders have learned one thing from Republicans over the years, it’s that sometimes, the judiciary can be the best bulwark against the opposing party getting what it wants. As our Anthony Adragna reported Friday, Senate Democrats have approved 235 of Biden’s judicial picks, eclipsing Trump's 234 first-term judicial nominations. 'I don’t know exactly what [Trump will] do. But I can tell you this: The judicia...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/26/congress/schumers-trump-2-0-00196038	2024-12-26T07:17:07-08:00	
Expect a quieter Jan. 6 this time around — as long as Republicans avert a looming speakership crisis	Donald Trump’s victory has made Jan. 6 boring again. Four years after a mob of Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s victory, Republicans and Democrats seem to agree they’ll give Trump the smooth, drama-free transfer of power he denied Democrats in 2020. That’s despite the fact that many Democrats see Trump as an insurrectionist, ineligible to hold the presidency because of his role in creating the conditions that led to the attack four years earlier. Instead, top Democrats say they have no plans to stand in the way of Trump’s victory — and they’re not even sure their rank-and-file colleagues will make the token objections they’ve lodged in years past. They also anticipate that Vice President Kamala Harris will lead the joint session of Cong...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/26/january-6-donald-trump-001733	2024-12-26T07:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/20/fa/aa9ba6c241c6956d95f2088bd57c/trump-indictment-democracy-72395.jpg

Inside how the Capitol Police has changed since Jan. 6, 2021	As Congress prepares to certify another election on Jan. 6, the U.S. Capitol Police looks like a vastly different agency than it was ahead of the attack on the Capitol four years ago. Security officials on the Hill were widely excoriated for the lack of preparedness ahead of the attempted insurrection, prompting multiple high-level resignations in the following weeks. An oft-repeated criticism was that officials should have requested help prior to the attack, given clear signals that there would be a huge protest coming to the area with the potential to turn violent. Those issues coincided with a steep increase in violent threats made against members of Congress. With that in mind, Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger has sought to shift the agency’s identity as a traditional police force with ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/25/capitol-police-change-since-jan-6-00195947	2024-12-25T11:00:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/6b/b1/d8692b46487aa4df50c06b903c0b/capitol-buildling-at-night-capitol-hill-92913.jpg
