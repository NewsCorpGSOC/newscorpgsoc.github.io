JB Pritzker on Chuck Schumer's spending vote: 'I disagree with what he did'	JB Pritzker criticized Chuck Schumer and declined to say whether he should continue leading Senate Democrats amid an escalating internal crisis over the party’s strategy in the second Trump presidency. Schumer joined Republicans in voting to avert a government shutdown last week, infuriating broad swaths of the left — and leading to calls for him to step down as Senate Democratic leader — for declining to use leverage in the spending fight to oppose Donald Trump’s agenda. Pritzker, a high-profile governor and Democratic operator, chose not to publicly extend a life raft to Schumer when asked about the senator’s future. 'Look, he's the elected leader,' Pritzker told reporters after a sit-down at the Center for American Progress in Washington. 'I disagree with what he did and vehemently so. ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/jb-pritzker-on-chuck-schumers-spending-vote-i-disagree-with-what-he-did-00236359	2025-03-18T11:01:49-07:00	https://static.politico.com/f7/96/e0c5446a4c258f89d0143c1e8c68/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2205718538
Walz knocks Schumer over government funding blowup	Tim Walz took a jab at Chuck Schumer over his decision to avert a government shutdown, accusing the party of ceding to Republicans. 'I believe that Chuck 100 percent believes that he made a decision that reduced the pain and the risk to Americans,' the Minnesota governor said in the latest episode of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s podcast released on Tuesday. 'I see it now that we're in a point where … that pain is coming anyway and I think we gave up our leverage.' Walz’s comments are the latest in the chorus of Democratic backlash aimed at Schumer over the Senate Democratic leader’s support for a Republican-backed stopgap measure last week to keep the governme...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/tim-walz-chuck-schumer-shutdown-026353	2025-03-18T07:42:25-07:00	https://static.politico.com/73/be/617a865e4e938117d569abbdd35e/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2165607145
Trump calls for impeachment of judge who tried to halt deportations	President Donald Trump on Tuesday called for the impeachment of the federal judge who ordered a two-week halt to his efforts to remove Venezuelan migrants using extraordinary war powers that haven’t been invoked for decades. Trump’s call to remove U.S. District Judge James Boasberg — the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, D.C. — is the first time since taking office for his second term that he’s asked Congress to seek a judge’s removal, joining increasingly pointed calls by his top donor and adviser Elon Musk and a segment of his MAGA base. Trump also suggested that 'many' of the judges who have ruled against him in other cases should be impeached as well. ...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/trump-impeachment-judge-deportations-00235173	2025-03-18T06:58:54-07:00	https://static.politico.com/88/01/02e042684f58bcfd4a6b44babbc2/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2205096901
Centrist Democrats are having their moment	Moderate Democrats are on a tear. Democrats are overperforming at the state level, with centrist candidates flipping one seat and coming close in another in special elections in deep red parts of Iowa. Rahm Emanuel, who once orchestrated a takeover of the House by recruiting Blue Dog Democrats, is eying a 2028 bid for president. And leading Democrats like Gavin Newsom and Chuck Schumer are rebuffing the left — the California governor siding against trans players in women’s sports and the Senate minority leader veering away from progressive demands to shut down the government.

How Matt Gaetz poisoned the House Ethics Committee	Scandal-ridden former Rep. Matt Gaetz is gone from Congress, but the wounds he inflicted on the House Ethics Committee that investigated him remain fresh. After the longest delay in recent history, the panel finally recruited enough members to perform its grim mandate of governing fellow lawmakers’ conduct in the 119th Congress. And they’ll have their work cut out for them: The committee is still regrouping from its crisis late last year over whether to break with recent precedent and release the results of an investigation into their former Florida GOP colleague, who was being considered for attorney general. The Ethics Committee rarely releases findings of investigations into lawmakers who resign before those investigations can conclude. Gaetz tested that practice, with lawmakers on both...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/17/house-ethics-committee-matt-gaetz-00232686	2025-03-18T01:45:00-07:00	https://static.politico.com/1f/75/26284f7c46f8996282a480c795d8/ye-top-photos-us-photo-gallery-25071.jpg

‘Full of despair’: Senate Dems look to regroup after losing shutdown fight	Senate Democrats are bracing for a painful post-mortem as they try to avoid a September rerun of their latest government funding defeat. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, and nine of his members helped get a House GOP-authored government funding bill to the finish line, saying a vote to advance legislation they loathed was the least bad option. The alternative, they argued, was allowing a shutdown that could empower Trump and Elon Musk to accelerate their slashing of the federal bureaucracy. This was the first time since the start of Trump’s second administration that the party had real leverage to fight the president, as Republicans needed Democratic votes to overcome a filibuster.

The Congress Issue	After nearly three decades on Capitol Hill, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) reached the apex of his career as the new Senate majority leader and head of the Republican caucus. But he’s also reached a personal crossroads — and how he navigates it will determine his legacy and the future of the American experiment. There’s no question that Thune is a conservative who supports President Donald Trump’s agenda, despite his previous opposition to Trump becoming the GOP nominee. But temperamentally, he’d seem to be at odds with Trump’s aggressive, norm-breaking approach to the presidency. 'In a move-fast-and-break-things era of anti-government ardor, he’s virtually a public-sector lifer, an easy-does-it institutionalist,' <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/03/14/john-thune-south-da...	https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-weekend/2025/03/15/weekend-newsletter-congress-issue-00231668	2025-03-15T07:13:00-07:00	
‘Uniting anger’: Democrats fume over Schumer’s handling of funding fight	Chuck Schumer is facing one of the most perilous moments of his Senate leadership career. The Senate minority leader came under heavy fire for the second straight day from Democrats enraged at him for backing a Republican bill to avoid a government shutdown, and fallout appears likely to last well past Friday’s vote. A handful of House lawmakers, including some in battleground districts, are floating supporting a primary challenge against him. Activists are organizing efforts to punish him financially. Schumer is facing questions within his own caucus about whether he made strategic errors in handling the high-stakes moment and failed to outline a clear plan about how to deal with the complex politics of a shutdown, according to interviews with six lawmakers or their aides.

Senate passes DC budget fix after House GOP omission	The Senate passed a bill Friday night to free up more than $1 billion in Washington's city budget, fixing an omission in the government funding bill now on its way to the president's desk. Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) said on the Senate floor that President Donald Trump has 'endorsed' the bill, along with House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.). 'There are no federal dollars involved,' Collins assured her colleagues before the Senate passed the bill by voice vote.

Inside the Jeffries-Schumer Rupture	Year after year, in shutdown fight after shutdown fight, in debt-limit standoff after debt-limit standoff, you could count on this: While Republicans would be bickering and taking potshots at each other, Democratic leaders would stay in lockstep — giving their members a united front to rally behind. That all exploded in dramatic fashion this week, culminating Friday at a news conference unlike any I have seen in my career covering Congress, where the No. 1 House Democrat repeatedly dodged questions about whether the No. 1 Senate Democrat was fit to lead. Should Senate Democrats ditch Chuck Schumer? House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, as the kids say, chose violence: 'Next question.'

Senate Democratic leadership split on funding bill	The Democrats' fight over their shutdown strategy is extending all the way to the upper echelons of the Senate. The Friday vote to get the House GOP funding patch over a procedural hurdle divided Senate Democratic leadership, with 10 members of the full caucus helping break a filibuster. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stressed to reporters Thursday, after he announced his decision to help advance the bill, that he was letting each member come to their own decision — an indication that he wasn’t going to try to squeeze anyone to oppose or support the bill. But it still marked a high-profile split within Schumer’s leadership team. Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Dick Durbin of Illinois joined Schumer in helping advance the House Republican bill, just ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/14/congress/senate-dem-split-00231781	2025-03-14T14:43:46-07:00

Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) is facing a defamation lawsuit filed by one of the four men she has publicly accused of sexual abuse in a floor speech, in a case that could test the legal protections members of Congress have for their official conduct. The South Carolinian took to the House floor last month to accuse her ex-fiance, Charleston businessman Patrick Bryant, and three other men of rape, sex trafficking and nonconsensually filming sex acts with her and others.

Jeffries stays silent on Schumer's future as Senate leader	House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries sidestepped a question about the leadership of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — a stunning demonstration of the breach that has emerged between the two New York Democrats over a looming government shutdown. 'Next question,' Jeffries told reporters when asked if there should be new leadership in the Senate. He also declined to answer a question on whether he had confidence in Schumer and said that while he'd been in touch with his fellow leader, their conversations would 'remain private.' Schumer said Thursday he planned to vote to advance a GOP-written funding patch to avert a shutdown, which is said was the better of two bad options.

The chainsaw-wielding special adviser to the president has spearheaded the Department of Government Efficiency’s shuttering of agencies and mass firings across the government. He’s also Tesla’s CEO.

'A non pass would be a Country destroyer, approval will lead us to new heights,' wrote the president Friday morning on Truth Social. 'Again, really good and smart move by Senator Schumer,' wrote the president on Truth Social. 'Took 'guts' and courage!' Trump added.

House Democrats stew over Schumer's capitulation on GOP funding bill	LEESBURG, Virginia — House Democrats privately and publicly steamed Thursday evening about Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s decision to back passage of a GOP spending patch they had fiercely opposed. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said he was 'extremely disappointed,' while Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) called it a 'gut punch.' Some Democrats attending the yearly Democratic policy retreat here went so far as to privately hope that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) would launch a primary challenge against Schumer — though he’s not up for reelection until 2028.

Senate confirms Pulte as top housing regulator, with market's future at stake	The Senate on Thursday voted 56-43 to confirm Bill Pulte as the nation's top housing regulator, putting him at the center of a fight over the future of two government-controlled companies that prop up half the residential mortgage market. As the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Pulte will have oversight of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been in government conservatorship for more than 16 years. The Trump administration is widely expected to seek to release Fannie and Freddie from government control — a complicated process that will rekindle debate about the role of the federal government in housing at a time when affordability has emerged as a major political concern. Pulte gave few clues during his confirmation hearing with the Senate Banking Committ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/13/congress/senate-pulte-housing-regulator-00228439	2025-03-13T10:50:17-07:00	
Sarah McBride says she lives ‘rent-free’ in Republicans’ heads	LEESBURG, Virginia — Rep. Sarah McBride said she lived to 'rent-free in the minds of some of my Republican colleagues' amid a controversy about GOP lawmakers referring to her by the wrong gender. Speaking Thursday at a news conference with House Minority Whip Katherine Clark and first-term Democratic women lawmakers, McBride said Republicans were 'obsessed with culture war issues' and said it was 'weird' and 'bizarre.' 'We will not take a lecture on decorum from a party that incited an insurrection,' the first openly transgender member of Congress said, making reference to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas) referred to her as 'Mr. McBride' during a congressional hearing earlier this week, sparking a confrontation between Self and Rep.

Top Illinois Democrat readies a Senate bid — and tells people she has major backing	Ambitious Illinois Democrats are dreaming about Sen. Dick Durbin’s exit in 2026. The latest contender: the state’s lieutenant governor. Juliana Stratton, who first took office in 2019, is quietly positioning herself for a Senate bid if Durbin bows out, calling key Democratic figures to ask for support, according to three people with knowledge of her plans, one of whom spoke with her directly and the other two who spoke with members of her team. And she and her staff have said that she’s already secured the support of Gov. JB Pritzker, the three people said. They were granted anonymity to discuss private conversations and avoid political retribution. She and her team have made clear she expects Pritzker to be heavily involved financially, those people said.

Johnson taps Boeing exec Curtis Beaulieu as top tax adviser	House Speaker Mike Johnson is naming Boeing official Curtis Beaulieu his top tax adviser, sources familiar with the decision say, filling a big hole on his staff as a sprawling fight in Congress over the tax code begins to heat up. Beaulieu, a senior director at Boeing, will replace Derek Theurer, who left for the Treasury Department — part of a recent wave of Republican tax aides to leave the Hill, even as lawmakers begin to zero in on what to do about some 40 temporary tax provisions slated to expire at the end of this year.

White House withdraws CDC director nominee	The White House has withdrawn its nominee to run the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in an abrupt move just hours before his confirmation hearing was scheduled to begin. Trump officials informed the Senate on Thursday morning that Dave Weldon, a former Florida congressman, will no longer be its pick for the agency, according to two people familiar with the matter and granted anonymity to discuss it. The White House made the decision after determining that he did not have the support to win confirmation on the Senate floor, one of the people said.

Capitol agenda: Senate Dems’ last-minute shutdown gambit	Senate Democrats are still not committing to helping Republicans pass a seven-month funding stopgap, edging the country closer to a government shutdown as they attempt to force a vote on a shorter funding patch. After two days of lengthy closed-door caucus talks (and another planned for Thursday), Democrats emerged with an attempted strategy Wednesday afternoon: Democrats won’t give Republicans the votes to advance the stopgap funding bill, known as a continuing resolution or CR, until they get an amendment vote on a 'clean' CR through April 11. Democrats have some leverage, despite being in the minority.

Trump’s Capitol Hill agenda in limbo	Congressional Republicans notched a major victory by muscling a funding bill through the House, but GOP lawmakers are still struggling to make headway on President Donald Trump’s biggest legislative priorities. House and Senate Republicans have yet to reach a deal on a budget plan that would set the framework for Trump’s legislative agenda — a source of tension ahead of a meeting Thursday between GOP senators and Trump at the White House. Republicans need to agree on how much spending to cut to offset the cost of their massive bill to fund tax cuts, border security, defense and energy policy. And they also don’t agree on when or how they’ll try to raise the debt ceiling to avoid a global economic catastrophe. But there’s one sentiment House and Senate Republicans do share right now: They h...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/13/trumps-capitol-hill-agenda-in-limbo-00227894	2025-03-13T01:45:00-07:00	https://static.politico.com/c2/dc/a22ee2944a7eab7b7b5106ee45c0/u-s-congress-09636.jpg
Chuck Schumer is in a real shutdown mess. Can he lead Democrats out of it?	Two days out from a government shutdown, Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats find themselves in a serious jam. But some of them are starting to hint at how they might get out of it. Publicly, the Senate minority leader and many of his fellow Democrats are vowing they won’t provide the votes to allow a House GOP funding bill to pass, while demanding a vote on a Plan B. Privately, though, Senate Democrats appear to be moving toward that potential offramp: Securing a vote on their preferred 30-day stopgap bill in exchange for helping the House bill, which funds government through September, clear the 60-vote filibuster hurdle — even if they ultimately oppose it on final passage.

Senate Democrats face 'tough map' as a slate of retirements hit Dem-friendly states	Senate Democrats’ already difficult 2026 map just got even worse. After losing the majority last November, the party faced a very narrow path out of the wilderness. Then Sen. Jeanne Shaheen piled on. The New Hampshire Democrat announced her retirement Wednesday, forcing the Democrats to defend a third Senate seat in 2026, in addition to retiring Sens. Gary Peters’ and Tina Smith’s seats in Michigan and Minnesota. 'It’s no secret that we face a tough map,' Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said, though he remained upbeat: 'I don't think you can read into losing one senator in a state where I think we will do very, very well.' There might be more departures for Democrats to come, though in much bluer states: Sen. Dick Durbin is on retirement watch in Illinois and Sen.

‘Be careful about this’: Warnings abound as GOP considers writing off tax cuts	It’s the accounting maneuver that could break the Senate, upend the federal budget process and explode the national debt. That’s according to critics of a fiscal tactic that congressional Republicans are now seriously considering as they struggle to figure out how to deliver on all of President Donald Trump’s policy demands. Adopting the 'current policy baseline,' as it’s called, could be the only way for the GOP to make Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent and avoid painful cuts to federal programs, as well as pile on new income tax exemptions for tips, overtime and Social Security. Trump is expected to discuss the move with members of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee at a White House meeting Thursday.

How many GOP senators ‘support DOGE’? Rand Paul pushes to vote on it.	Sen. Rand Paul wants to force the Senate to vote on codifying President Donald Trump’s cuts to foreign aid, a potential hitch for Republican leaders working to pass a bill to prevent a government shutdown Friday night. Paul wants the Senate to vote on an amendment that would cut foreign aid grant funding by 83 percent, which would enact the reductions Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the president’s Department of Government Efficiency are already making. The Kentucky Republican predicts that about half of Republican senators would oppose the amendment, putting them on record against the Trump administration’s work.

Senate Dems form plan to avoid a shutdown	Senate Democrats want a vote on an alternative stopgap funding bill as they look for leverage against Republicans with two days to go until a government shutdown. The lawmakers emerged from a closed-door lunch on Wednesday and said that they would not help advance the House GOP-passed, seven-month funding measure unless Republicans would agree to give them amendment votes — including on a 30-day, alternative short-term funding bill. Democrats do have some leeway to make demands, despite being in the minority: In order to meet the Friday night deadline to avoid a shutdown, Republicans will need an agreement from all 100 senators to speed up consideration of the House GOP funding bill, which would otherwise take days to get through the chamber.

Senate GOP advances Trump’s latest budget pick as Dems deem him a Vought ‘acolyte’	President Donald Trump’s pick for the No. 2 post at the White House budget office — a position key to orchestrating Trump’s orders to freeze funding — has cleared a critical committee vote, sending the nomination to the Senate floor. In a 11-10 vote, the Senate Budget Committee backed Dan Bishop’s nomination to serve as deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. The Senate is expected to vote to confirm Bishop in the next few weeks, officially seating him as right-hand man to OMB Director Russ Vought. Oregon Sen.

House GOP tax writers maintain radio silence on their plans	House Republican tax writers were clamming up Wednesday about their tax plans, a sign that negotiations were getting serious as they prepared to go into a second day of close-door talks.

'I hope you’re not finding anybody who is willing to talk.'

'There are urgent challenges ahead, both here at home and around the world, and while I’m not seeking reelection, believe me, I am not retiring,' Shaheen said in a video.

They are also being careful to condemn Hamas, which attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250, and prompting an Israeli response that has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths in Gaza, including many civilians.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson finally quashed that assumption. It took an all-out lobbying blitz that involved promises of future spending cuts, a scattering of presidential threats and 11th-hour policy concessions involving tariffs and visas for Afghan refugees. But in a 217-213 vote, the House passed a seven-month funding patch without needing a single Democrat.

Trump taps Eric Ueland for key role at OMB	President Donald Trump has tapped Eric Ueland, a veteran Senate and White House aide, to a key post at the Office of Management and Budget. Ueland has been nominated to serve as deputy director for management at the White House budget office, a high ranking role that would have him serving directly under OMB Director Russ Vought. He is already a familiar face to many lawmakers and staffers on Capitol Hill in his former capacity as legislative affairs director during the first Trump administration. Ueland also was a key fixture in the Senate during negotiations on the massive, $2 trillion pandemic relief package enacted in March 2020. That was a major legislative effort under budget reconciliation, a process he’d likely be deeply involved with again in the coming months if confirmed at OMB....	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/11/congress/trump-taps-eric-ueland-for-key-role-at-omb-00224628	2025-03-11T12:57:49-07:00	
Trump continues to attack Massie ahead of vote	President Donald Trump is increasing pressure on Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) to align with House Republicans and vote yes on the government funding bill. In a Truth Social post Tuesday, Trump labels Massie as a 'Congressman' and a grandstander. It follows a message Monday where Trump suggested Massie should be primaried — saying he would 'lead the charge' against Massie in the upcoming midterm election and comparing the Kentucky Republican to former Rep. Liz Cheney. 'He additionally voted to delay the current Budget Disaster from the Biden Administration to the Trump Administration. I was running for Office at the time, doing my thing, and when I heard about this, it was, quite simply, hard to believe — A catastrophic mistake!'

House GOP one step closer to passing stopgap funding bill	The House GOP’s seven-month stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown is one step closer to passage. Republicans stayed mostly united on a test vote on the measure Tuesday afternoon, paving the way for a vote on final passage later in the day — just three days before the deadline to prevent a lapse in federal funding. The 216-214 vote bodes well for Speaker Mike Johnson, who can’t, in his razor-thin majority, afford more than a couple GOP defections on a bill that isn’t expected to garner much, if any, Democratic support.

Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has pledged to oppose the bill to fund the government through t...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/11/congress/house-gop-one-step-closer-to-passing-stopgap-funding-bill-00224131	2025-03-11T11:24:44-07:00	
House Republicans move to block vote on Trump’s tariffs	House Republicans are moving to block Democrats from forcing a vote on President Donald Trump’s controversial tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. GOP leadership slipped language into a House rule on their stopgap funding bill that would prevent any member of Congress from bringing up a resolution terminating Trump’s declaration of a national emergency over fentanyl and undocumented immigrants entering the U.S. The president has used that emergency declaration to justify his tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.

Vance gives hard sell for spending patch to House Republicans	Vice President JD Vance told House Republicans hours ahead of an expected vote on a seven-month funding patch on Tuesday that Republicans will take the blame for a government shutdown if they don't pass the legislation, according to three people who were in the room for the comments. Vance emphasized that Republicans had little room for dissent given the tight margin in the House. Government funding is set to expire at midnight Friday, and a handful of GOP members have yet to commit to the stopgap put forward by Speaker Mike Johnson and endorsed by President Donald Trump.

Johnson confident ahead of government funding vote	Speaker Mike Johnson said in an interview Tuesday morning he expects House Republicans 'are going to pass' a bill to fund the government later in the day, ahead of the looming March 14 deadline to avoid a shutdown. His comments came as Vice President JD Vance is attending the House GOP Conference's weekly meeting to rally members ahead of the big vote, which would keep federal operations afloat through the end of the fiscal year. Johnson predicted there would be 'maybe just one' GOP defection on this bill, appearing to reference Rep. Thomas Massie.

Republicans join bill to protect workers after DOGE firings	A new bill to address the mass firings of probationary federal workers by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is picking up bipartisan support. First-term Republican Reps.

Their support for the Protect Our Probationary Employees Act — to be formally introduced Tuesday by fellow first term Rep.

Capitol agenda: Johnson’s spending holdouts	House GOP leaders went into the week with plans to pass their stopgap funding bill today without Democratic support. That might not be possible. With one surefire 'no' in Rep. Thomas Massie, Republican leaders still need to wrangle a handful of potential holdouts — including Reps. Tony Gonzales, Tim Burchett, Cory Mills, Rich McCormick, Beth Van Duyne, Kat Cammack, Andy Ogles and Brian Fitzpatrick. This group seems more open than Massie to backing the funding patch that would avert a shutdown that could kick in Saturday. Gonzales has repeated he will make a 'game-time decision.'

John Kennedy is trying to get Trump to get serious about the debt limit	Senate Majority Leader John Thune has deputized a folksy Louisiana lawmaker known for his blunt political observations and creative analogies to take the lead in convincing President Donald Trump to develop a strategy for raising the debt limit later this year. That Senate envoy, Sen. John Neely Kennedy, says Trump isn’t ready to focus just yet — and that attention deficit could have reverberations across the global economy.

House Republicans huddle with Bessent on tax policy menu	Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee huddled on Monday with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to review a large menu of tax options for the GOP’s policy agenda. The tax writers were for the most part tight-lipped on what they discussed as they exited the all-day session at the Jefferson building of the Library of Congress. But committee members indicated that it was a productive discussion about the framework for a large bill that would enact President Donald Trump’s tax agenda, which would include an extension of trillions of dollars in expiring tax cuts.

Democrats offer short-term alternative to House GOP spending patch	Top Democratic appropriators released a short-term funding bill Monday night meant to serve as an alternative to the House Republican plan to fund the government through September as the two parties face off ahead of a Friday midnight shutdown deadline. The Democratic bill would keep the government running on current funding levels for four weeks in an effort to buy more time for lawmakers to strike a deal on a bipartisan funding package. But GOP leaders have so far shown no interest in the bipartisan talks and are now seeking to push through a seven-month extension.

DC officials protest House stopgap, claiming billion-dollar impact on city	Top D.C. officials protested a House Republican-written funding patch outside the Capitol on Monday, saying the omission of routine language included in prior continuing resolutions could mean a de facto $1 billion budget cut for the city government. Mayor Muriel Bowser — flanked by Democratic Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, members of the D.C. Council and other local officials — said the measure would force cuts to police, public schools, sanitation and other key city services if passed later this week.

Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to muscle through a stopgap spending bill to avert a government shutdown, but he doesn't have the votes locked down yet.

And in calls to supporters, allies and trusted aides in recent weeks, Harris has made clear that she plans to make a decision in a few months. Harris’ timeline, reported here first, is the clearest indication to date that she may enter the race to succeed the termed-out Gavin Newsom in the Golden State. And, allies said, a win would almost certainly take a 2028 presidential run — which Ha...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/07/kamala-harris-california-governor-decision-deadline-00216737	2025-03-07T02:55:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/f4/e4/7e5cdafb4752a1df59eb141b6f31/56th-naacp-image-awards-show-31383.jpg

Senate Democrats' impending choice: Shutdown or surrender	Senate Democrats have a fast-approaching dilemma: Vote for a spending bill unilaterally drafted by House Republicans or engage in the kind of shutdown brinkmanship they’ve long opposed. It isn’t a decision they’ll be able to put off for much longer. House GOP leaders are poised early next week to send a bill to the floor that would largely hold current spending levels in place through the end of September. Democrats don’t like this approach, arguing it would only further empower President Donald Trump and Elon Musk to continue to act beyond their authority in clawing back congressionally approved dollars. In the House, Democrats are vowing to hold back support, arguing tha...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/07/senate-democrats-shutdown-decision-00217178	2025-03-07T01:45:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/c2/44/98d60ea94f2a9ecb2307ccbb7c6a/u-s-congress-63409.jpg
House GOP stopgap funding bill expected to avert pay cuts to doctors, extend telehealth access	A stopgap measure to keep the government funded through the end of September is expected to include measures to avert cuts in pay for doctors treating Medicare patients and extend eased Medicare telehealth rules, according to five industry lobbyists granted anonymity to share details of private negotiations. The health measures to be incorporated into the spending patch next week — necessary to avoid a shutdown after March 14 — are expected to be relatively narrow. Still, Speaker Mike Johnson has been promising to move a 'clean' continuing resolution that would fund government programs at current levels through the end of the current fiscal year. Any new provisions could be viewed with scrutiny by members of the razor-thin House GOP majority. Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.), who co-chairs the GO...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/06/congress/house-gop-stopgap-doctors-pay-00216769	2025-03-06T14:35:14-08:00	
Veterans cuts spark GOP backlash on Capitol Hill	As President Donald Trump and Elon Musk lay waste to scores of federal programs and the careers of thousands of government workers, Republicans on Capitol Hill have mostly kept their objections to themselves — with one big exception. Military veterans have been disproportionately affected by the administration’s early cuts, and GOP lawmakers have unleashed a rare tide of public pushback. That reached a crescendo this week as the Trump administration raises the possibility of large-scale dismissals of Veterans Administration employees. Mass firings at the VA began weeks ago, spurring a flurry of panicked calls from GOP lawmakers to the White House. But a new memo outlines the potentia...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/06/veterans-cuts-backlash-republicans-doge-00216726	2025-03-06T14:09:00-08:00	https://static.politico.com/fa/57/d386748546d6b21ce3e7b71bc428/congress-ukraine-74978.jpg

Newsom’s move on trans athletes jolts 2028 campaign	Gavin Newsom's provocative new position on trans athletes on Thursday reopened a rift in the Democratic Party that could serve as one of the earliest flash points in the party’s 2028 primary. Within hours of the California governor condemning trans athletes playing in female sports — shocking his party in his home state — some Democrats unloaded on the likely presidential contender. 'It’s disgusting,' said Lori Lightfoot, the former Chicago mayor. 'There are kids waking up today in California with this news thinking that their governor hates them, and rightly so.' Rep.

Chavez-DeRemer on verge of confirmation to run Labor Department	Lori Chavez-DeRemer’s bid to lead the Labor Department cleared a key procedural hurdle on Thursday — the last major step before a confirmation vote on the Senate floor. The Senate voted 66-30 to end debate on the former GOP representative's nomination to serve as President Donald Trump’s Labor secretary, one week after she advanced out of the Senate HELP Committee with bipartisan support. Though her confirmation has not been as contentious as other high-profile Trump administration officials, Chavez-DeRemer will be the last Cabinet secretary to arrive. Still, she's already attended a recent Cabinet meeting at the White House and Trump’s joint address to Congress this week.

Jim Jordan continues subpoena spree of social media platforms	House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan sent a subpoena to Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, on Thursday, requesting communications between the company and the executive branch as well as internal company communications. The move to go after Alphabet is the next step in Jordan's yearslong crusade to go after social media platforms for what he says constitutes suppression of conservative speech. After Meta adjusted its own policies in January to respond to concerns from conservatives, Jordan has set his sights on a new target, accusing Alphabet of coordinating with the Biden administration to censure users.

Democrats slam GOP campaign committee labeling New York lawmaker an ‘illegal immigrant’	House Republicans’ campaign arm directly attacked Democratic Rep. Adriano Espaillat’s immigration status, drawing condemnation from Democrats. 'Democrats literally chose an illegal immigrant to give their response to President Trump's address,' the National Republican Congressional Committee wrote on X on Wednesday, adding that 'Democrats couldn't be more disconnected from the American people.' The direct attack of Espaillat, the first Dominican American member of Congress and a former undocumented immigrant, was met with a swift response from top Democrats who called the post racist.

Al Green censured for joint session outburst	The House voted 224-198 Thursday to censure Rep. Al Green for disrupting President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress this week. Green shouted at Trump during the Tuesday night address and was ordered removed from the House chamber by Speaker Mike Johnson, prompting a flurry of GOP efforts to punish him for the disruption. The censure measure was introduced and called up by Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) through a fast-track process allowing for quick consideration on the House floor. Democratic leaders didn’t formally whip against the measure, and 10 Democrats voted with all Republicans in support of the censure. Typically a censured member is immediately made to stand in the well of the House to formally receive punishment.

Capitol agenda: Government funding frenzy	The government-funding frenzy is in full swing on Capitol Hill with nine days to go before a potential shutdown, and the state of play is simple enough: It’s appropriators vs. GOP leaders. With the March 14 deadline bearing down, the heads of the two Appropriations panels are finalizing a bipartisan deal on government funding totals for fiscal 2025 — Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democratic appropriator in the House, said it’s 'imminent.' But Speaker Mike Johnson and other GOP leaders aren’t much interested in what appropriators are cooking up.

Musk to House Republicans: DOGE ‘can’t bat a thousand all the time’	Elon Musk defended himself to a room full of House Republicans on Wednesday night, saying that he 'can’t bat a thousand all the time,' according to four people present for his remarks. But he also promised to work to correct mistakes amid the Department of Government Efficiency’s slash-and-burn operation across the federal government. Musk met the House GOP conference after a growing number of Hill Republicans have raised concerns about DOGE and called for the team to be more careful in its methods for rooting out waste, fraud and abuse across agencies.

Sanctuary city mayors struggle to counter GOP's ‘pro-criminal’ attacks	Democratic mayors, summoned to Washington to answer for their handling of the immigration crisis, struggled on Wednesday to combat Republican allegations their cities are rife with violent crime and in need of rescuing by the GOP administration. It was the culmination of months of relentless attacks by President Donald Trump and his allies, and it sets up further moves by the administration — including Vice President JD Vance’s trip to the southern border Wednesday afternoon — to keep Democrats in a defensive crouch on the issue. Republicans on the House Oversight Committee grilled the chief executives of Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York City on the heels of Trump’s victory lap in his joint address to Congress Tuesday evening.

Fellow Democrats tear into Eric Adams on Capitol Hill	The four big city mayors who testified Wednesday on Capitol Hill knew they were invited by House Republicans to be punching bags. For New York’s Eric Adams, however, the blows were thrown by fellow Democrats. GOP lawmakers not only spared Adams from the brunt of their often-theatrical attacks on sanctuary cities, they defended him against the Democratic onslaught — including from fellow New Yorker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Top Johnson aide arrested for DUI	Speaker Mike Johnson's top staffer, Hayden Haynes, was arrested for driving under the influence shortly after Tuesday's joint session of Congress, the speaker's office and Capitol Police said. 'A driver backed into a parked vehicle last night around 11:40 p.m. We responded and arrested them for DUI,' a police statement said. The incident took place about 45 minutes after President Donald Trump completed his congressional address, with Johnson sitting directly behind him. Haynes has served as an aide to Johnson since 2016 and has served as his chief of staff since the Louisiana Republican became speaker in October 2023.

Top appropriators near government funding deal ahead of shutdown cliff	Congress’ top appropriators are finalizing a bipartisan agreement on overall government funding totals as House Republican leaders forge ahead with a different plan President Donald Trump has endorsed to avoid a shutdown. The impending deal on funding totals comes far too late to save Congress from having to clear a funding patch next week to avert a government shutdown set to begin just after midnight on March 14. Whether that continuing resolution lasts just a few weeks — or spans through September, as Trump prefers — remains an open question. Despite the tentative agreement among appropriators for funding 'toplines,' House Republican leaders still aim to hold a vote next week on a Trump-backed plan for a 'full-year' continuing resolution that keeps the military and non-defense agencies ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/05/congress/top-appropriators-near-government-funding-deal-ahead-of-shutdown-cliff-00214504	2025-03-05T13:23:22-08:00

Susan Collins received a warm welcome across the Capitol Wednesday at the House Republican Study Committee’s weekly lunch, where the moderate from Maine talked with staunch conservatives about tough realities for funding the government ahead of the March 14 shutdown deadline. The meeting at which the Senate Appropriations Committee chair was a special guest served partly as a rally for bicameral cooperation in a hard-fought Republican trifecta — and partly as a wake up call for what will actually be achievable over the next nine days.

Ted Cruz, clashed in a rancorous hearing Wednesday morning over the GOP's push to subpoena documents from the Massachusetts Port Authority related to its sheltering of migrants in Boston Logan Airport.

'America's momentum is back,' Trump said in a stemwinder that lasted an hour and 40 minutes. 'Our spirit is back. Our pride is back.'

Trump is about to face an audience with the power to make or break his agenda. And it’s not Congress.	When President Donald Trump speaks to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, the audience with the most sway over his second-term agenda won't be the lawmakers. It's the Supreme Court justices. Trump’s blitz of early executive actions have triggered a tsunami of more than 100 lawsuits — many of them heading toward the high court. Two of those actions have already made it to the justices, and their looming rulings could strike at Congress’ power to control federal spending and the independence of executive branch watchdogs.

Trump is making his big speech to Congress. Here’s how to watch.	President Donald Trump is set to address Congress — and the rest of the country — on Tuesday evening, his first prime-time address since the start of his second term. A president addressing Congress each year is routine. However, from deep cuts to federal agencies to public feuds with foreign allies, the early days of Trump’s second term have been nothing close to standard. Trump’s upcoming address is expected to recount and expand on the administration’s aggressive efforts to fulfill the president’s ambitious campaign promises to reshape the federal government.
