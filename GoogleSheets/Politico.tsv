Senate committee advances Trump's pick for AG	Donald Trump’s attorney general nominee Pam Bondi, who represented the president during his first impeachment trial, was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday morning in a party-line, 12-10 vote. The former Florida attorney general is expected to be confirmed on the Senate floor. Her confirmation hearing earlier this month went fairly smoothly — so much so that Democrats repeatedly attacked Trump’s pick to run the FBI Kash Patel, who was not even in the room and will have his own confirmation hearing Thursday morning. Democrats have acknowledged Bondi's qualifications, even as they questioned her role in the effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election and her staunch loyalty to the new president. 'Her record and her testimony showed the American people that she will...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/29/congress/bondi-ag-confirmation-trump-00201188	2025-01-29T07:10:36-08:00	
Capitol agenda: GOP lacks a Trump line, RFK confirmation hearing, last day in Doral	Donald Trump’s federal funding freeze is on ice after an eleventh-hour court order delayed implementation until Feb. 3 — but not before it became crystal clear Republicans don't appear to have any red lines when it comes to the president. First, congressional GOP leaders didn't condemn Trump’s threats to circumvent the Senate’s advise-and-consent role on his nominees. Then, Republican lawmakers caved to the president's push to delay the ban on TikTok — undermining legislation they passed last year. There was also the party's about face over Jan. 6, when Republicans who publicly criticized Trump after the Capitol attacks shrugged off his pardons of the riot’s most violent parti...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/29/congress/what-were-watching-00201157	2025-01-29T05:00:00-08:00

GOP steps aside as Trump assaults Congress’ power	President Donald Trump has declared an all-out war on congressional power. And his allies on Capitol Hill aren’t doing much to fend off the invasion. From firing a slate of inspectors general to changing citizenship qualifications to delaying a ban on the TikTok app, the president is running roughshod over Congress in his first week back in office. The effort culminated Monday night with a budget office memo freezing 'all federal financial assistance' pending a review by administration political appointees. The effort represents a frontal assault on the legislative branch’s core constitutional power to raise and spend federal funds — the 'power of the purse' that has been zealously protected by generations of congressional leaders of both parties.

Work requirements gain favor with House Republicans	DORAL, Florida — As they work through a sweeping 'menu' of potential spending cuts, House Republicans are facing growing anxiety in their ranks about slashing away at key safety-net programs. But there is one proposal that enjoys broad support inside the GOP: instituting new and expanded work requirements for some of those programs. According to three Republicans who attended a closed-door session at the House GOP retreat Tuesday, members there appeared to coalesce around the work requirements idea — which would generate less savings than other, more far-reaching proposals but is seen as more politically palatable in swing districts. Speaker Mike Johnson said in a brief interview leaving the meeting that ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/28/congress/gop-agenda-work-requirements-00201080	2025-01-28T14:11:21-08:00

Vance advises House GOP: Keep it simple	DORAL, Florida — Vice President JD Vance told House Republicans in a closed-door meeting Tuesday that President Donald Trump still prefers to address the approaching debt limit in the GOP's big party-line reconciliation package. But Hill leaders are making other plans. Vance, speaking at the House GOP retreat in Florida, said that way Republicans don't need to negotiate with Democrats to lift the debt ceiling, according to two Republicans in the room who were granted anonymity to describe the private remarks. But given internal divisions among Republicans over the borrowing limit, House and Senate GOP leaders are increasingly likely to incorporate a hike in a government funding negotiation with Democrats.

Senate Dems block bill that would sanction ICC	Senate Democrats successfully blocked a GOP-led bill to sanction the International Criminal Court on Tuesday afternoon, as they’ve tried to negotiate changes to the legislation with Republicans. Republicans are pushing the bill in response to the ICC charging Israeli officials over the war in Gaza. Democrats, worried that the bill was too broad and could lead to sanctions against U.S. allies that are ICC member states and U.S. tech companies that provide support to the court, have been trying to negotiate language to address those concerns. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Democrats’ lead negotiator, told reporters those discussions were 'ongoing' about two hours before the procedural vote. The status of those talks is now unclear, though the bill’s failure gives Shaheen more leverage.

The joint request from Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking member Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) notes that the White House did not submit the required 30-day notice to Congress to dismiss inspectors general. The senators are requesting further information on the 18 watchdog dismissals, which occurred late on Friday, and the names of officials who will act in their places.

White House defends dramatic federal funding freeze	White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt vehemently defended the administration’s sweeping freeze on federal aid, arguing Tuesday in her first press briefing that it was critical to scrutinize the scope of the government’s spending. 'The reason for this is to ensure that every penny going out the door is not conflicting with the executive orders and action that this president has taken,' Leavitt said. 'This is a very responsible measure.' Leavitt insisted that the freeze would not affect federal assistance that goes directly to individuals, such as Social Security benefits and food aid. But she would not directly answer whether other social service programs that serve people indirectly — such as Meals on Wheels and Medicaid — would be affected. She dismissed reports of widespread confu...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/28/trump-omb-funding-cuts-00200998	2025-01-28T11:07:28-08:00	http://vod.politico.com/media/v1/pmp4/static/clear/1155968404/80961acc-ea05-4b2a-84d4-9f39ab5069c6/7c00da0f-9cd2-4a4c-87c3-75235e38c375/main.mp4
Jim Acosta, prominent Trump critic, leaves CNN	Longtime reporter and anchor Jim Acosta is exiting CNN — but not before warning viewers about navigating the news during the second Trump administration. The 'CNN Newsroom' anchor announced on his show Tuesday that he would be leaving. On air, he reflected on what he viewed as the highlight of his time at CNN: questioning the Castro regime on Cuba's political prisoners, during former President Barack Obama’s visit in 2016. The son of a Cuban refugee, Acosta said he learned an important lesson: 'It is never a good time to bow down to a tyrant.'

Capitol agenda: Johnson's GOP retreat plans, ICC bill, controversial Trump nominees ahead	Speaker Mike Johnson will confront an increasingly anxious House GOP today at Donald Trump’s Doral resort, where they’re holding their annual policy retreat through Wednesday.

Trump's agenda is about to hit a make-or-break moment	House Republicans are heading to President Donald Trump’s Miami-area resort for their annual policy retreat. They’re not going there for the weather. Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP members have major decisions to make over the coming days that will determine whether Trump and Republicans can deliver on their sweeping legislative agenda before the 2026 midterms.

Cotton: ‘I hope no one would impugn Ms. Gabbard's patriotism’	Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's pick to serve as director of national intelligence, will have a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. In the meantime, committee Chair Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) has a message for her doubters. 'I do hope though that we won’t see anyone questioning her patriotism,' Cotton told host Shannon Bream on 'Fox News Sunday.' 'You know, Hillary Clinton has basically called her a traitor in the past.

House Intel committee must remain focused, Mike Turner says	Rep. Mike Turner, recently displaced as chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday he's concerned about the direction the panel make now take. Speaking on CBS' 'Face the Nation,' Turner (R-Ohio) expressed concerns that the panel might, with encouragement from President Donald Trump, focus too much on internal enemies at the expense of powerful countries than can do America harm. 'The one thing that he has said is that he wanted to take the committee in a different direction. I'm a little concerned, because his different direction indicates pursuing the elusive deep state,' he said. Turner said there are reasons at times to pursue internal enemies, but seemed to worry that could be a dangerous distraction.

Democrats’ approach to Trump this time is much quieter	When President Donald Trump signed the pardons of Jan. 6 defendants, many 2028 Democratic hopefuls didn’t acknowledge it. And few got sucked into an outrage cycle over Elon Musk's straight-arm gesture during Trump's inauguration celebration.

Johnson invites Trump to address joint session on March 4	Speaker Mike Johnson on Saturday extended an invitation for President Donald Trump to address a joint session of Congress on March 4, the first in Trump's second presidency. In a letter to the president, Johnson invited Trump to 'share your America First vision for our legislative future,' thanking him for his 'strong leadership and bold action' in the first days of his presidency and asserting that 'America’s Golden Age has begun.' The White House has yet to formally accept the invitation, though Trump is expected to confirm his March 4 address.	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/25/johnson-state-of-the-union-march-4-trump-00200619	2025-01-25T13:40:26-08:00	https://static.politico.com/e2/6c/a4373ba341aaa28ec98a35f404d6/u-s-congress-81077.jpg
‘I am terrified’: Workers describe the dark mood inside federal agencies	President Donald Trump’s executive orders targeting the federal workforce have injected a fresh wave of anxiety among employees across the bureaucracy — stoking fears the president is coming for their jobs. Just a few days into Trump’s second term, some federal workers are contemplating quitting. Others are preparing to file grievances with their unions or moving communications with each other to secure platforms like Signal. Some, fearing they’ll be caught up in the White House’s purge of diversity programs, are leaving their names off of memos and documents they worry could be labeled as DEI-adjacent.

Kristi Noem confirmed as DHS secretary	The Senate confirmed Kristi Noem as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security on Saturday, voting to give President Donald Trump another Cabinet official who has pledged to help carry out his aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration. The bipartisan vote was 59-34. No Republicans opposed Noem's nomination. Noem’s final vote follows the Senate’s confirmation of Marco Rubio, who Trump tapped as secretary of State and Pete Hegseth, who will lead the Department of Defense. Republican leaders are working to make good on their promise to press ahead with confirming the president’s Cabinet nominees even as some Democrats raise objections, slowing down the process. The South Dakota governor’s ascension to DHS came as a surprise in some quarters.

McConnell sends a message	Mitch McConnell might not run the Senate anymore. But he made clear on Friday night that he still knows how to wield power. After days of meeting with silence a steady stream of questions about whether he would support Pete Hegseth’s Defense secretary nomination, McConnell became the third Senate Republican to vote against Hegseth. The move forced Vice President JD Vance to break a tie to get him through, making him the first Cabinet nominee since 2017 to need help from the vice president. And it made clear to Donald Trump that McConnell, a longtime party man, is willing to buck the president even after stepping down from leadership, especially on national security issues. McConnell, in a lengthy statement, warned that whoever leads the Pentagon faces a 'daily test with staggering conseque...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/24/pete-hegseth-vote-mcconnell-006649	2025-01-24T20:02:31-08:00	https://static.politico.com/15/70/47676b554717943e691b60a4da32/brooke-rollins-confirmation-hearing-95054.jpg
Hegseth will be Defense secretary. Here's how he plans to upend the Pentagon.	The Senate on Friday confirmed Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary, a triumphant moment for the former Fox News host who overcame allegations of sexual misconduct, alcohol abuse and inexperience to attain one of the country’s most crucial positions. Republicans largely rebuffed those accusations and approved Hegseth with the help of Vice President JD Vance, who broke a rare 50-50 tie, in the first big nomination fight for President Donald Trump’s Cabinet. Hegseth’s confirmation could smooth the way for other controversial Trump administration picks. He will enter the Pentagon with a stated desire — and a mandate from the president — to upend traditional practices, from the role of top generals to where U.S. forces are stationed overseas.

Not gonna fly:' Senate Republicans cool on recess appointments	Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) pitched Senate Republicans on Friday about allowing President Donald Trump to make recess appointments. By his own admission, it didn’t gain traction. Johnson made his case to his Senate GOP colleagues during a closed-door lunch meeting as the chamber is staring down the possibility of a rare weekend session as it slogs through Trump’s Cabinet picks amid Democratic slow-walking. Asked afterward if his colleagues were interested in the idea, Johnson said, 'No, not at this point in time.' Johnson added that, 'if we can grind through this process,' Republicans can get close to reaching the pace of confirmations during the Obama years and his Senate GOP colleagues would be 'OK just maintaining the process' rather than allowing recess appointments.

House Democrats worry a repeat loser will ruin their chances in a Michigan battleground	Some Democrats are worried the third time will not be the charm for a failed congressional candidate. Carl Marlinga, a septuagenarian former judge and attorney, is telling Michigan Democrats that he plans to run again against GOP Rep. John James, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations who were granted anonymity to reveal private discussions. That's sparked concerns among Democrats in Michigan and in Washington who believe he will once again tank their chances in the crucial battleground district. Marlinga ran in the 2022 midterms, coming within a fraction of a point of besting James in what was then a newly created southeastern Michigan seat. He tried again two years later and lost by 6 points. (He also ran in 2002.)

Trump ‘very surprised’ at Collins, Murkowski over Hegseth vote	President Donald Trump took notice on Friday of two old sparring partners — Sens.

'I was very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that,' Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Friday. The two moderate Republicans vote with their party most of the time, but came under intense scrutiny during the first Trump administration because of their willingness to break ranks on some high-profile votes, including Cabinet and judicial nominees and a high-stakes GOP health care plan.

Capitol agenda: Spending heats up, Hegseth up in the Senate, House GOP retreat	Democrats are widely opposed to pairing the debt limit and wildfire aid — two key parts of a spending proposal GOP leaders are circling behind closed doors. But unless Democrats are willing to flirt with a government shutdown or a potential debt default, they’re likely stuck with the deal, or one similar to it. One House Democrat says his party isn’t willing to make those threats. 'The one thing that has united Democrats, in my entire career here, is a commitment to do what's necessary to govern, to keep the government open and to work to improve the lives of the people we all represent, whether that's lowering costs or helping them in a time of crisis,' said Rep.

E&C Chair Guthrie talks TikTok, AI, privacy	House Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie said Thursday he's in favor of President Donald Trump’s decision to extend the deadline for TikTok to divest from Chinese ownership. 'Giving him a window of opportunity to make significant progress — I support that,' said the Kentucky Republican in his first public comments on Trump’s actions. 'I also understand the confines that we have in the law.' Guthrie’s comments are notable in that his panel, then chaired by retired Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), led the charge last year to pass legislation, 50-0, to force TikTok to find a new buyer by a certain deadline or shut down.

Congress finds Trump's TikTok sale scheme confusing, possibly illegal	Members of Congress are declaring themselves bewildered by Donald Trump’s latest proposal to save TikTok by brokering a joint-ownership deal.

'I don't understand what the president is doing,' said Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Trump has promised to hash out a deal to keep TikTok in business, despite a law that ordered its parent company to divest by last Sunday.

Ratcliffe is only the second Trump Cabinet nominee to get confirmed since the new president was sworn in Monday, as Republicans have prioritized national security picks.

At least two Republican members of the Intelligence Committee remain on the fence, raising the prospect that she could be at risk of not even advancing out of the panel. Republicans are watching closely to see how she does in the hearing, as well as a closed-door session that will immediately follow the public grilling.

Senate panel advances Turner for HUD on party-line vote	The Senate Banking Committee voted 13-11, along party lines, on Thursday to advance Scott Turner’s nomination to be secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, with Democrats voting no over concerns about Turner’s unfinished FBI background check. If confirmed by the full Senate, the NFL veteran and former developer would run a department with a $70 billion budget and roughly 8,000 employees at a time when housing has risen to the forefront politically after costs soared in the wake of the pandemic.

Capitol agenda: Nominee battles, reconciliation problems, abortion bill	If you work in the Senate, we're sorry about your weekend plans for the foreseeable future. Majority Leader John Thune appears to be making good on his threat to keep senators in town to confirm a trio of President Donald Trump’s nominees, after Democrats delayed CIA pick John Ratcliffe and continue to raise concerns about Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary. And Republicans are responding to Trump's renewed talk of recess appointments by saying they're not going to have a recess until all of his Cabinet nominees are confirmed. That could take a while. In Trump’s first term, Republicans didn’t get all of his initial Cabinet confirmed until April. And Democrats ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/23/congress/what-were-watching-00200175	2025-01-23T05:00:00-08:00	
Trump's pick to lead Commerce set for confirmation hearing	President Donald Trump’s pick to head the Department of Commerce, longtime friend and billionaire Howard Lutnick, is set for a Senate confirmation hearing next week. Lutnick will appear before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on Jan. 29, Chair Ted Cruz’s office announced Wednesday. Like several other of Trump’s Cabinet picks, Lutnick’s hearing was delayed due to paperwork issues, Cruz said in an interview last week. 'Mr. Lutnick will play a key role in unleashing unprecedented innovation and ensuring our nation’s job creators are well equipped to expand opportunities for good-paying jobs,' Cruz (R-Texas) said in the statement.

GOP leaders mull a big debt-and-funding deal with Democrats	House and Senate GOP leaders are internally debating a possible deal with Democrats that would include government funding, California wildfire aid, a debt-limit hike and border security money, according to two Republicans with direct knowledge of the matter. Senior Republicans have been privately mulling a bipartisan government funding deal for weeks now, wary that they may not be able to add a debt-limit hike to their party-line reconciliation package given internal GOP divisions over the matter. But conversations around the potential larger deal have heated up in recent days as GOP leaders try to figure out how to lift the approaching debt ceiling while also advancing a massive, party-line reconciliation bill and avoiding a March 15 government shutdown. The strategy isn’t finalized.

Senate Dems block GOP's first abortion bill	A GOP-led abortion bill failed in the Senate due to Democratic opposition on Wednesday, a sign of where the party is drawing the line on bipartisan cooperation. After a week marked by Senate Democrats' willingness to work with their Republican counterparts on both an immigration bill and confirming former Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of State, every Democrat voted against legislation that would 'prohibit a health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion.' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had come out against the bill ahead of the vote, and other Democrats who opposed it say the law already requires doctors to give children appropriate medical care.

Trump’s budget pick is famous for defying Congress. GOP senators want to confirm him anyway.	Senate Republicans are eager to seat the man who could undercut their funding power. As President Donald Trump boldly defies the will of Congress by issuing executive orders freezing billions of dollars in federal cash that lawmakers have approved in recent years, Senate Republicans are still speaking accolades of Russ Vought, the president’s pick for White House budget director and the man famous for withholding government money during Trump’s first administration. Key committee chairs are predicting that the Senate will confirm Vought without issue to head the Office of Management and Budget again, even as some GOP senators raise concern about protecting Congress’ 'power of the purse' — granted under Article I of the Constitution — from presidential overreach.

'While that’s your right, in working together on a bipartisan basis, we can achieve the best outcome for the American people.

New York, New Jersey and California Republicans made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago recently to reiterate their demands to lift the so-called SALT cap, which limits the deduction to $10,000, in negotiations over a large tax bill. The lawmakers say the cap is harming constituents in their politically competitive, high-tax districts.

NRCC chief digs in for midterms: ’The math is in our favor’	NRCC Chair Richard Hudson on Wednesday tried to rally House Republicans ahead of their tough battle to keep their majority in the upcoming midterms, with many GOP lawmakers wary they’ll lose a swath of seats in 2026. 'The math is in our favor. We’re on offense,' Hudson told House Republicans during their closed-door meeting Wednesday morning at the Capitol Hill Club, according to two people in the room. He did acknowledge a big challenge will be turning out Trump voters who are less engaged in nonpresidential election years, the people said.

The Reluctant Steamroller in the White House	Just hours into his second presidency, Donald Trump was already bulldozing congressional Republicans. He granted clemency to some 1,500 Jan. 6 offenders, some of them convicted of violent assaults. He flouted a bipartisan TikTok ban, ordering it to remain unenforced. And he moved to cancel some of his predecessor’s energy programs over the pleadings of some in the GOP who wanted him to wait — to name just a few of the ways he undercut members of his own party. A day later, it was as if a switch had been flipped. In a meeting Tuesday with top GOP leaders, he didn’t move to settle key strategic disputes over raising the debt limit and passing the party’s big domestic policy package.

Jules Feiffer, Pulitzer-winning cartoonist and writer known for lacerating wit, dies at 95	NEW YORK — Jules Feiffer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist and writer whose prolific output ranged from a long-running comic strip to plays, screenplays and children’s books, died Friday. He was 95 and, true to his seemingly tireless form, published his last book just four months ago. Feiffer’s wife, writer JZ Holden, said Tuesday that he died of congestive heart failure at their home in Richfield Springs, New York, and was surrounded by friends, the couple’s two cats and his recent artwork. Holden said her husband had been ill for a couple of years, 'but he was sharp and strong up until the very end. And funny.'

CIA director pick John Ratcliffe is expected to get a relatively smooth bipartisan confirmation on Tuesday.

They also want directions on spending limits needed to pass government funding legislation by mid-March and clarity on how to handle the debt limit, as the U.S. faces a potential default in the months ahead. 'All of it’s on the table,' Johnson said in an interview. Here's what else we're watching today: Want this in your inbox by 5 a.m.?

Trump repeals rule allowing transgender troops to serve in military	President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday night that repeals a provision allowing transgender troops to serve in the military, part of a wide-ranging effort to end Biden-era policies his first day in office. Trump issued a ban during his first administration that prevented transgender troops from serving, which former President Joe Biden eliminated. While Trump did not institute a new ban, the repeal of the Biden-era executive order clears the way for one. The president, in...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/20/donald-trump-inauguration-day-news-updates-analysis/trump-repeals-transgender-troops-rule-00199577	2025-01-20T19:01:50-08:00	
Trump: ‘We don’t need’ Latin America	President Donald Trump issued a stark message Monday to would-be economic and strategic partners in Latin America: The U.S. doesn’t need you. Speaking from the Oval Office after signing a spate of executive orders, Trump was asked about relations with Latin America and Brazil and said the relationship 'should be great.' But he made it clear who needs who more in the relationship. 'They need us much more than we need them. We don't need them,' he said. 'They need us. Everybody needs us.' Those comments seem poised to deflate hopes of some in Latin America that Trump would refocus resources on shoring up ties with countries in the Americas. China and Russia have increased their footholds in the region over the past decade, financing major infrastructure projects including deep water ports, a...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/17/congress/trumps-tough-latam-talk-00199560	2025-01-20T18:06:15-08:00	
Senate unanimously confirms Rubio as secretary of State	Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was confirmed Monday as secretary of State, the first of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks to take office. In becoming secretary of State, Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, also makes history as the highest-ranking U.S. politician of Latino and Hispanic descent to date. Rubio experienced a relatively easy and trouble-free confirmation process. The third-term Florida lawmaker was the top Republican member of the selective Senate Intelligence Committee and served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Not a single senator opposed his nomination on the Senate floor and he faced no opposition in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee markup that preceded it. But there’s been debate around Washington as to how long Rubio will remain in the role, given that...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/17/congress/its-official-for-rubio-00199519	2025-01-20T15:52:27-08:00

Trump airs 2020 election grievances after being sworn into a second term	Four years after President Donald Trump helped incite a mob to storm the Capitol to block the certification of the 2020 election he lost, he took aim at his political enemies — including the select panel that investigated the violent event. Trump promised the crowd in the inauguration’s 'overflow room' in the Capitol Visitors Center, following his formal inaugural remarks in the Rotunda: 'You’re going to see a lot of action on J6 hostages.' He has floated pardoning the rioters, many of whom are facing formal criminal charges. Trump also took aim at the last-minute pardons and commutations President Joe Biden issued in his final hours in office, including those who served on a select committee tasked with looking into the role Trump played in circumventing the 2020 election results that cul...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/17/congress/trump-inauguration-speech-overflow-00199390	2025-01-20T11:02:24-08:00	
Top Republican blasts Raskin for Biden pardon	House Oversight and Government Reform Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) delivered a blistering statement against his former Democratic counterpart on the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who received a preemptive pardon from outgoing President Joe Biden on Monday. 'Jamie Raskin will be remembered for his abuse of power, hypocrisy, consistent dishonesty, and unwavering loyalty to Joe Biden, despite evidence showing that Biden and his family were involved in peddling influence for tens of millions of dollars with our adversaries around the world,' said Comer. 'Jamie Raskin once claimed that ‘the seeking of pardons is a powerful demonstration of the consciousness of guilt, or at least the consciousness that you may be in trouble.’ It’s clear that the chickens have come home to roost for Jamie Ra...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/17/congress/jamie-raskin-pardon-j6-00199291	2025-01-20T07:54:27-08:00

TikTok celebrates Trump inauguration, over and over	With TikTok back online after shutting off for less than a day, the company embarked on an inaugural weekend goodwill tour aimed at incoming President Donald Trump, the person the video-sharing app is counting on to save it in the long term. On Sunday, TikTok contributed $50,000 to a party in honor of Gen Z Trump supporters and his biggest social media allies.

We're running out of time': GOP already antsy on Trump’s Hill agenda	Welcome to the Washington trifecta, Republicans. Now get ready to wait. Even as the GOP takes unified control of the House, Senate and White House on Monday, congressional leaders are facing doubts about just how quickly they will be able to deliver major wins for Donald Trump. Their legislative plans are highly unsettled, and the clock is ticking toward distracting fights over federal spending and the debt limit. And when it comes to the heart of Trump’s agenda — a sprawling party-line effort encompassing border, energy and tax policy — key strategic questions remain in flux. Once they agree on the general direction of travel, leaders will then have to navigate a thicket of nasty intraparty disputes on the policies themselves.

Why Trump supporters see sunshine in Trump’s dark and foreboding speeches	The first time Donald Trump gave an inaugural address, official Washington winced. It was a scorching and dystopian assessment of what he cast as a country in ruins — this 'American carnage,' Trump said. And it was, as George W. Bush reportedly called it, 'some weird shit.' But that’s not how much of Trump’s MAGA base remembers it. Like Trump, they, too, saw a hollowed-out nation in 2017. But what Trump’s supporters mostly recalled in the president-elect — and the repeat performance they are preparing for on Monday — is redemption.

‘Not enough room’: Lawmakers fret about indoor inauguration	The last-minute move to bring President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration indoors could leave some members of Congress out in the cold. Perhaps not literally: No one is expected to be seated outside in 25-degree bluster. But the possibility that not all lawmakers might get seats in the Rotunda for the oath-of-office ceremony has cast a chill over the occasion in some congressional offices, according to four lawmakers and aides. 'Simply put, there’s not enough room,' one senior Republican aide said. 'It’s a shitshow.' The initial guidance from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies after Trump’s team decided to move things indoors on Friday was that 't...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/19/trump-inauguration-rotunda-congress-004800	2025-01-19T13:43:05-08:00	https://static.politico.com/57/15/f0dca855496ab92debba3ab5e268/inauguration-57288.jpg
Tim Kaine explains strategy on Pete Hegseth	Sen. Tim Kaine said he pushed Defense Secretary-nominee Pete Hegseth about infidelity and sexual misconduct in a hearing last week because he believed it was the only way to get Republicans to consider voting against him. Speaking Sunday on CBS' 'Face the Nation,' Kaine (D-Va.) said: 'My observation of my Republican colleagues is the only reason they ever vote no on a nominee is either a belief of gross incompetence in terms of qualifications or serious character deficit.' As an example, Kaine cited the case of then-Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), whose chances to be President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general were quickly scuttled by personal scandal.

Trump says he will ‘probably’ travel to California next week after LA fires	President-elect Donald Trump will 'probably' travel to Southern California next week, he told NBC News, making the likely first trip of his second term to the liberal stronghold still reeling from some of the worst wildfires in its history. In a wide-ranging phone interview on Saturday with 'Meet the Press' moderator Kristen Welker, Trump said he 'was going to go, actually yesterday,' to the Golden State, but decided 'it would be better if I went as president.'

Trump hires fed-firing mastermind	President-elect Donald Trump is bringing back a senior White House official who led his first-term push to make it easier to fire civil servants. James Sherk, who served as a special assistant on domestic policy during Trump’s first term, will return to serve in the White House Domestic Policy Council, Trump announced Saturday. Sherk has worked at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute during the Biden administration. Sherk was central to the Trump administration’s efforts to make it easier to fire some federal employees using a classification called Schedule F. That effort generated an outcry from civil servants, and the Biden administration moved quickly to reverse course. But the effort 'could — and should — be reissued by another president,' Sherk wrote in a 2022 Wall Stre...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/18/trump-hires-fed-firing-mastermind-00199154	2025-01-18T11:36:44-08:00	https://static.politico.com/76/68/ac5fbe53477a92f06e69e390f343/1594391562082.jpg
The Real Story Behind Mike Turner’s Firing	When Speaker Mike Johnson summarily fired House Intelligence Chair Mike Turner this week, everyone assumed it was about Donald Trump. Actually, it was about power — not the incoming president’s, but Johnson’s.

The Capitol grapples with Trump's last-minute inauguration switch	Donald Trump won’t be crowing about crowd size at his second inauguration. Barely more than 2,000 people will pack into the Capitol Rotunda for a cold-weather inaugural ceremony backup plan not seen since Ronald Reagan. The call to move the swearing in and inaugural address indoors was made by the Trump team, but the pivot will have to be executed by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and hundreds of workers across Capitol Hill — who have less than 72 hours to pull off a huge pivot. The have nots: Just a tiny fraction of committed Trump supporters who traveled to Washington will get to see the ceremonies in person.

Donald Trump’s DOJ could win convictions of two Jan. 6 defendants next week	By early next week, Donald Trump’s Justice Department may secure its first convictions of Jan. 6 felony defendants. That’s because two jury trials launched this week by President Joe Biden’s DOJ have not yet reached verdicts and are slated to continue into the first days of the Trump administration. Unless Trump pulls the plug on trials that are already reaching their final phase, it will be his DOJ that sees them through, perhaps as early as Tuesday. Trump could extend blanket pardons to all Jan. 6 defendants, which would short-circuit ongoing trials.

Two sources, granted anonymity to speak freely about the appointment, confirmed that DeWine will pick Husted. DeWine is expected to make the announcement at 1p.m. Husted, a Republican more in DeWine’s institutionalist mold, had long planned to run for governor in 2026 to succeed DeWine. His ascent to the Senate will likely scramble the field in that race.

But now, on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration, a new coalition of state-level advocacy groups is reestablishing a national presence to gird against the incoming president and a Republican-controlled Congress. The group, the National Federation of Stonewall Democrats, comes together at a fraught time for movement, amid recriminations from within the Democratic Party that its focus on transgender rights harmed Democrats in November.

Energy and Commerce readies first hearings	The House Energy and Commerce Committee has settled on the themes for its first hearings of the new Congress, focusing on bolstering U.S. innovations and advancements in domestic wireless technology and chemical production. The topics send a signal about the panel’s priorities in the new Republican governing trifecta — and what political message it wants to send through the policies it plans to highlight. On Wednesday, Jan. 22, the Environment Subcommittee will hold a hearing to assess whether the EPA has interpreted a decade-old, landmark chemical safety law in contradiction with statute.

Garland’s message to DOJ staffers: ‘You have worked to pursue justice, not politics’	Attorney General Merrick Garland bid farewell to the Justice Department Thursday with an unmistakable call to its career staff to resist any efforts by the incoming Trump administration to turn the department into a political weapon. 'It is the obligation of each of us to follow our norms, not only when it is easy, but also when it is hard, especially when it is hard,' Garland told hundreds of current and former DOJ staffers gathered in the Great Hall at DOJ. 'It is the obligation of each of us to adhere to our norms, even when and especially when the circumstances we face are not normal.' Garland grew emotional at times during his 15-minute speech. He recounted the work prosecutors, FBI agents and others have done in the time since he left his lifetime post on the D.C. Circuit Court of Ap...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/16/congress/merrick-garland-farewell-justice-department-00198844	2025-01-16T15:14:25-08:00	
Former Trump HHS official Paul Mango dies	Paul Mango, a former Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate and senior health official during President-elect Donald Trump’s first term who was advising on the current transition, has died. Mango’s death was confirmed Thursday afternoon by his current employer, the Paragon Health Institute. 'Paul was a mentor and friend who dedicated his life to serving his country, who led a life of amazing accomplishment, and who will be dearly missed,' Brian Blase, Paragon's president, said in a statement to POLITICO. 'Professionally, Paul's unmatched leadership and management skills and attention to detail were instrumental in the success of Operation Warp Speed, saving many Americans' lives.'

Trump nominates special envoys to… Hollywood 🎬	President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday tapped three new special ambassadors — but not to a foreign nation or policy area. Actors Jon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone will serve as 'Special Ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood, California,' Trump said in a post on Truth Social, with the aim of boosting the American filmmaking capital after it 'has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries.' In this seemingly unprecedented role, the stars will serve as Trump’s 'eyes and ears.' 'I will get done what they suggest,' he wrote.

GOP poll shows Kemp beating Ossoff in hypothetical Georgia Senate matchup	Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp leads Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff in a hypothetical matchup in next year’s Senate race, according to new polling from a conservative group. The poll, conducted by WPA Intelligence for the Club for Growth and shared with POLITICO, also found Ossoff leading by double digits over several other potential GOP candidates.

Energy and Commerce GOP meets on reconciliation plans	House Energy and Commerce Republicans met Thursday to shape their strategy for energy portions of the GOP’s budget reconciliation bill — including clawing back climate spending approved by Democrats. Panel leaders previewed a 'menu' of programs in the Inflation Reduction Act and other Biden administration climate spending that could be rescinded, lawmakers familiar with the discussion said. Still, members said they were far away from reaching any definitive conclusions on what specific programs they will end up targeting. 'We're just throwing mud against the wall to see what sticks,' said Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.).

Dozens of House Dems back GOP immigration bill related to sex crimes	More than 60 House Democrats backed a GOP bill that would make sexual and domestic violence deportable offenses, marking the second bipartisan immigration bill to pass the chamber this Congress. The bill, led by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), earned 10 more Democratic votes than the 51 who backed it in the last Congress. Many Democrats who supported it were from purple districts, but some in solidly blue seats also voted for it, including Reps. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), Sarah McBride (D-Del.), and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.). Congressional Democrats are under intense pressure from the GOP majority to vote for immigration and crime-related bills.

Get ready for a 🥶🥶🥶 Inauguration Day	Prepare to freeze at Donald Trump’s inauguration. It’s forecasted to be the coldest Inauguration Day since President Ronald Reagan’s second swearing-in ceremony in 1985 (temperature: A cool 7 degrees). The weather is expected to peak in the mid-20s (very cold!) and dip as low as 10 degrees (very very cold!) at night. The good news: The sun is set to shine during Trump’s ceremony, but 10 to 20 mph freezing winds will make it feel even colder. D.C.’s had its fair share of cold days in January, but frigid temperatures aren’t the norm for Inauguration Day. The average Jan. 20 temperature has hovered around a 45-degree high and 30-degree low with wind chill also in the 30s, according to the National Weather ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/16/congress/donald-trump-inauguration-day-weather-forecast-00198682	2025-01-16T09:12:28-08:00	
Trump selects private equity CEO Pulte as top housing regulator	President-elect Donald Trump has selected private equity CEO and philanthropist Bill Pulte to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency. If confirmed, Pulte would become the country's top housing regulator. FHFA oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage giants standing behind roughly half of the U.S. residential mortgage market. Pulte founded Pulte Capital Partners LLC, which focuses on housing products, in 2011 and garnered attention in recent years for promoting his giveaways of money and other goods on social media. He is a grandson of real estate magnate William Pulte. The Trump administration is expected to pursue a plan to release Fannie and Freddie from government control — a complex maneuver that could have major repercussions for the mortgage market.	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/16/congress/trump-picks-top-housing-regulator-00198667	2025-01-16T09:10:10-08:00	
Pelosi is skipping Trump's inauguration	Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi won’t be attending President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday, her spokesperson confirmed. She’s joining other Democrats who are expected to skip Trump’s swearing in, though lawmakers haven’t mounted an organized boycott of the inauguration like they did in 2017. Instead, a sizable number of House Democrats are expected to attend after their districts slid towards Trump in the November elections. Pelosi had gone to Trump’s inauguration in 2017, when she was the House Minority Leader. Since then, she’s departed the top House Democratic position and stepped off her committees. She’s attended 11 inaugurations so far; her first was President John F. Kennedy’s.

Tim Scott scoops then deletes Moody Senate announcement	Senate GOP campaign Chair Tim Scott welcomed Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody to the Senate on X — minutes before Gov. Ron DeSantis actually announced his pick for the open seat. In a quickly deleted tweet, Scott congratulated Moody on her appointment saying she’s a 'proven conservative fighter' for President-elect Donald Trump and has been a 'national leader on border security,' according to a screenshot of the tweet provided to POLITICO. DeSantis shortly after named Moody as his choice to fill the seat of Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump’s secretary of State nominee.

DeSantis picks Florida AG Ashley Moody to replace Rubio in the Senate	Gov. Ron DeSantis has selected state Attorney General Ashley Moody to become the next senator from Florida. The elevation of Moody into the role, once Sen. Marco Rubio resigns to be President-elect Donald Trump’s secretary of State, installs a close DeSantis ally — someone who was the first and only state Cabinet-level official to endorse the governor in the 2024 Republican presidential primary over Trump. The seat will open up soon, with Rubio on a glide path to become Trump’s secretary of State shortly after he is inaugurated. Moody will hold the seat through at least a 2026 special election.

Progressive Hill staff group pitches lighter workweek	As the second Donald Trump presidential term dawns, some progressive Capitol Hill staffers are floating a bold new proposal: working less. The Congressional Progressive Staff Association proposed establishing a rotating 32-hour workweek on the Hill in a letter to top House and Senate leaders Thursday, saying reduced hours could 'improve worker satisfaction, increase staff retention in Congress, and model a more sustainable approach to work on a national level.' Under the proposal, congressional staffers would still work long hours when their boss is around. But when Congress is in session, district office staffers would be entitled to an abbreviated, 20-percent-lighter schedule, and when it is not, D.C.-bas...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/16/congress/32-hour-capitol-hill-workweek-00198640	2025-01-16T07:29:51-08:00	
Freedom Caucus pushes two-step reconciliation proposal, countering Johnson’s plan	The House Freedom Caucus is pushing against Speaker Mike Johnson’s plan to pass major GOP priorities. The ultra-conservative group made their preference for a two-step reconciliation plan official on Thursday, releasing a proposal that calls for an initial bill that would reverse Biden administration policies, fund border security and raise the debt ceiling for two years. The Freedom Caucus noted that this plan leaves room for a second reconciliation package with tax cuts, though it didn’t detail what conservatives want that legislation to look like.

'It is essential that the American people and Congress understand how Mr. Trump mishandled our nation’s most sensitive classified information, especially because he will be sworn in as Commander-in-Chief and take leadership of our national security apparatus in just five days,' the Committee Democrats, led by write ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), wrote in a letter obtained by POLITICO.

When I asked Speaker Mike Johnson about Senate Majority Leader John Thune at a POLITICO Live event Tuesday, he was quick to praise the South Dakotan as a 'principled' and 'experienced' counterpart. He called Thune a straight shooter and spoke graciously about a recent dinner they’d shared with their wives.

Senate Democrats circulating memo alleging Bessent tax dodges	Senate Democrats are circulating a memo claiming that President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, improperly claimed nearly $2 million in tax losses and owes nearly $1 million in taxes related to his hedge fund — providing ready ammunition for them as Bessent goes before the Finance Committee on Thursday. The memo obtained by POLITICO, which was prepared by Finance Committee staff under ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), alleges Bessent should have paid $910,182 in taxes for income he made through his hedge fund, the Key Square Group, from 2021 through 2023.

The event, hosted at French restaurant Le Bilboquet, is an early example of Vance’s desire to position himself as heir-apparent to Trump and his 'America First' political movement. Donald Trump Jr., who was key in his father’s decision to name Vance as his No. 2, attended. Vance has been the presumed MAGA standard-bearer since Trump picked him as his running mate in July.

'Everything’s on the table,' Jordan told reporters Wednesday. 'I’m just now looking at his report.' Smith led cases around Trump’s retention of classified documents after his first term in office, and Trump's efforts overturn the results of the 2020 election. This month, Smith released his report into the election subversion case, arguing that he would have been able to obtain a conviction had Trump not won reelection in 2024, making him immune to prosecution.

Trump’s pick for budget chief echoes his ‘power of the purse’ dreams	Russell Vought wouldn't commit to having the federal government spend all the money Congress approves. The issue came up during his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday, where he testified before lawmakers in pursuit of a second tour as White House budget director for President-elect Donald Trump. Vought famously froze aid to Ukraine and Puerto Rico the first time he ran the Office of Management and Budget during the first Trump administration. Now that Trump is claiming so-called 'impoundment' law is unconstitutional, senators in both parties are eager to hear Vought promise to spend federal cash as Congress intends.

'And the trade-offs between those two are the decisions politicians make, and they're the decisions that will impact the future of our world.' Wright, who is the CEO of Colorado-based fracking services company Liberty Energy, faced numerous questions Wednesday over his previous comments on climate change and his support for growing U.S. ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/doe-nominee-wright-climate-change-00198407	2025-01-15T10:43:31-08:00	
Bondi won’t say if she’ll investigate Jack Smith	Donald Trump has called for former special counsel Jack Smith to be prosecuted and even thrown out of the U.S., but the president-elect's pick for attorney general declined to say Wednesday whether she’d investigate Smith’s conduct if confirmed. 'I haven't seen the file. I haven't seen the investigation. I haven't looked at anything,' Pam Bondi said during questioning by Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) 'It would be irresponsible of me to make a commitment.' During a testy exchange, Bondi told Schiff she wouldn’t rely on his 'summary' of the situation to make a decision, prompting the senator to reply: 'Not a summary by the president either?' 'I will look at the facts and evidence,' she replied. <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/11/jack-smith-resigns-justice-department-trump-crimin...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/pam-bondi-doj-jack-smith-00198444	2025-01-15T10:42:00-08:00	
Bondi gets into testy exchange with Padilla during questioning over 2020 election	Tensions at the confirmation hearing for Pam Bondi, Trump’s pick for attorney general, boiled over Wednesday afternoon, as Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) pressed Bondi about her role in Trump’s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. 'You pointed your finger at me and said you were speaking,' Bondi interjected, as the two attempted to speak over one another in the line of questioning around Bondi’s involvement in the campaign to block Joe Biden’s win in Pennsylvania. 'I’m not going to be bullied by you Senator Padilla.' Bondi’s previous confrontations with Democratic senators had been relatively uncontentious, even as they pushed Bondi to <a href='https://www....	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/pam-bondi-alex-padilla-00198434	2025-01-15T10:21:34-08:00	
Jill Biden shares disappointment with Pelosi: ‘We were friends for 50 years’	First lady Jill Biden shared her disappointment with Nancy Pelosi amid the former speaker’s role in President Joe Biden’s decision to exit the presidential race last year, in an interview with the Washington Post published Wednesday. 'We were friends for 50 years,' Jill Biden told the Post, in what appear to be her first public comments about Pelosi since the president dropped his reelection bid. 'It was disappointing.' Following the president’s shaky debate performance and growing questions from Democratic lawmakers about his capability to beat former President Donald Trump, Pelosi privately shared her concerns with Biden that he was dragging down the party and urged the pr...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/jill-biden-disappointed-pelosi-00198431	2025-01-15T10:15:54-08:00	
Stacey Abrams-founded group settles case over illegal support for her campaign	A nonprofit founded by perennial candidate Stacey Abrams has settled a complaint with the Georgia Ethics Commission and will pay $300,000 to the state for illegally spending millions to bolster Abrams’ gubernatorial bid in 2018. According to the consent order, which was made public on Wednesday following the ethics commission’s vote to approve it, the New Georgia Project and its fundraising arm, the New Georgia Project Action Fund, failed to disclose roughly $4.2 million in contributions and $3.2 million in expenditures that were used mostly to support Abrams during the 2018 primary and general election. The order details 16 violations of state law, including the group’s failure to register as...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/15/stacey-abrams-new-georgia-project-settlement-00198397	2025-01-15T09:12:31-08:00	https://static.politico.com/08/a2/76dd4efe4bfabb6bd1bccd8a7fad/ethics-fine-georgia-75898.jpg
Rubio prefers working with Mexico, not bombing it, to get cartels	Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio didn’t rule out designating Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations during his Senate confirmation hearing, previewing a sharp crackdown by the incoming Trump administration on threats to the U.S. southern border. 'These sophisticated transnational terroristic organizations have operational and functional control over huge swaths of areas that border the United States of America,' he told senators Wednesday. 'It is important for us not just to go after these groups but identify them and call them for what they are and that is terroristic in their nature.' Rubio said he’d prefer to work collaboratively with Mexico instead of turning to military force to root out drug cartels. But he didn’t rule out the possibility of the latter as an option Pre...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/rubio-prefers-working-with-mexico-not-bombing-it-to-get-cartels-00198400	2025-01-15T09:00:18-08:00	
Bondi changes her tune on special counsels	Pam Bondi has argued in courton behalf of a pro-Trump legal group that special counsel Jack Smith’s appointment was unconstitutional because he wasn’t confirmed by the Senate, despite his broad prosecutorial powers. But on Wednesday, Trump’s pick for attorney general said under current law, special counsels 'don’t need to be confirmed by the Senate.' Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) homed in on the apparent contradiction in her position during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. 'I will follow the law, senator,' Bondi said. 'Understood,' Coons responded. 'Just getting to the clarity about the position you have advocated and what the current law...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/pam-bondi-special-counsels-00198399	2025-01-15T08:58:14-08:00	
Bondi won’t promise to enforce TikTok ban	Attorney general nominee Pam Bondi declined to say Wednesday whether she would enforce the law set to kick in on Sunday that would ban the popular social media app TikTok if it isn’t sold to a new owner. While Bondi vowed to follow the law on other subjects, she was evasive when Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pressed her on whether she would make sure that the ban takes effect despite the fact that President-elect Donald Trump has urged the Supreme Court to put the law on hold. 'That is pending litigation within the Department of Justice. … I can’t discuss pending litigation,' Bondi said. The Supreme Court heard arguments last Friday on cases challenging the constitutionality of ...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/pam-bondi-on-tiktok-ban-00198394	2025-01-15T08:43:34-08:00	
Trump zeroes in on Sean Plankey to lead U.S. cyber agency	The Trump transition team is honing in on Sean Plankey as its choice to be the next director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, according to three people familiar with the matter. Any decision about who will head the roughly $3 billion Department of Homeland Security agency is not official until President-elect Donald Trump announces his pick for the Senate-confirmed role, the three people cautioned. But Plankey, a senior cyber policy official from Trump’s first administration and a veteran of the Pennsylvania National Guard and U.S. Coast Guard, is firmly the leading contender at this point in the process. The CISA Director announcement and those for other senior cybersecurity roles in the new administration 'are expected soon,' said one of the people, who like the o...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/sean-plankey-likely-to-lead-u-s-cyber-agency-00198382	2025-01-15T08:32:44-08:00	
Rubio: US diplomats should support Trump mission	Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio says he’s willing to promote career diplomats to top posts, including ambassadorships, but indicated that the candidates must be in step with the Trump administration’s foreign policy vision. Rubio, speaking Wednesday to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stressed that he wasn’t talking about partisan politics. But his comments are a sign that the incoming administration won’t tolerate much dissent in the diplomatic ranks. 'I’m not talking about political alignment,' Rubio said. 'I’m talking about alignment with the mission that we’ve outlined for American foreign policy, which is one of the things that I think has hurt the State Department under numerous administrations.' The last time Donald Trump was president, he and his team grew wary of Sta...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/rubio-us-diplomats-should-support-trump-mission-00198360	2025-01-15T08:13:07-08:00	
Rubio: ‘Top priority’ of State Department will be US interests	Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to be secretary of State, on Wednesday vowed that the 'top priority' of U.S. foreign policy 'will be the United States' as he outlined his life story and his goals if confirmed to be America’s top diplomat. In his remarks before his colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio outlined that under Trump and him, the State Department will put forward policies that make America 'more prosperous' and avoid past mistakes where 'America far too often continued to prioritize the 'global order' above our core national interests.' Rubio, who remains in the Senate until he is confirmed, received a chummy and friendly response from the foreign policy panel.

Bondi vows she won’t pursue DOJ ‘enemies list’ — but defends Patel	Attorney General nominee Pam Bondi promised the Senate Judiciary Committee that she won’t use her power to pursue a so-called 'enemies list,' even as she defended FBI Director nominee Kash Patel’s vow to target a list of people he views as 'government gangsters.' 'There will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice,' Bondi said under questioning from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). Asked to defend a comment she made on Fox News last year declaring that 'the prosecutors will be prosecuted' and 'the investigators will be investigated,' Bondi noted Wednesday that she also referred in that interview to focusing on 'bad' prosecutors.

Former Bernie Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir enters DNC Chair race	Faiz Shakir, who led Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign, is jumping into the race for chair of the Democratic National Committee — injecting a new candidate into the low-key contest. Shakir confirmed his candidacy in a text message to POLITICO. The New York Times first reported Shakir’s decision. Shakir’s late entrance into the race could shake up a contest that has largely focused on party mechanics rather than its ideology. In a letter to DNC members, Shakir said he’s become 'frustrated' by the 'lack of vision and conviction for what to do to restore a deeply damaged Democratic brand,' prompting his decision to join the race. 'We all seemingly agree — rhetorically at least — that foc...	https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/15/faiz-shakir-dnc-chair-democrats-00198365	2025-01-15T07:56:08-08:00	https://static.politico.com/09/40/36a6898a433d915cf110fdf5d4ec/20250115-faiz-shakir-getty.jpg
Bondi sidesteps question of whether Biden won the 2020 election	Pam Bondi, Donald Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, repeatedly declined to say Wednesday that Joe Biden won the 2020 election, saying he was 'duly sworn in' but sidestepping a question about whether he was the legal winner of the contest. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Bondi’s refusal to answer the 'yes or no' question was concerning and he encouraged her to listen to Trump’s hourlong call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which Trump asked Georgia officials to 'find' enough votes to reverse the outcome. Bondi said she’d only heard a clip. Durbin pressed Bondi on how she would advise Trump on clemency decisions for people who attacked police officers on Jan. 6, 2021. Bondi emphasized that the decisions are entir...	https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/15/congress/pam-bondi-2020-election-00198362	2025-01-15T07:41:11-08:00

Pam Bondi, Trump's AG pick, says ‘partisan’ weaponization of DOJ ‘will be gone’	President elect Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general Pam Bondi is being questioned by the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Democrats are expected to press her on whether she will prioritize loyalty to Trump over her constitutional duty. In her opening statement, the former Florida attorney general emphasized to lawmakers that she would not use the federal law enforcement agency to attack political rivals and endeavor to 'restore confidence and integrity' to the department. Trump has repeatedly suggested in his second term he would leverage his prosecutorial power against adversaries. 'The partisanship, the weaponization will be gone,' Bondi said in her statement. 'America must have one tier of justice for all.'
