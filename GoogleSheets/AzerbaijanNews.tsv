US sanctions against Russia: India faces the risk of a looming oi...	By Asif Aydinly The introduction of new US sanctions on Russian oil marks the beginning of a challenging phase for India, an emerging economic powerhouse that heavily relies on imported energy resources. As the third-largest economy in Asia and one of the fastest-growing globally, India’s dependence on foreign oil leaves it vulnerable to external shocks. The sanctions targeting Russian oil producers and transporters have the potential to disrupt energy stability, fuel inflation, and create significant macroeconomic imbalances. These developments will have far-reaching consequences, not only for India’s economy but also for the global energy market.	 https://news.az/news/-us-sanctions-against-russia-india-faces-the-risk-of-a-looming-oil-crisis 	2025-01-22T12:20:00-08:00

By Samir Muradov On January 6, 2026, the U.S. Coast Guard officially announced the commissioning of the icebreaker supply vessel Aiviq, renamed CGC Storis.

After over 25 years of stagnation in icebreaker construction, America is taking critical steps to strengthen its presence in the Arctic. Amid intensifying competition from Russia and China, and given the region's historical significance, modernizing the U.S. icebreaker fleet serves not only as a military upgrade but also as a political statement.	 https://news.az/news/-us-arctic-strategy-enters-new-era-intensifying-race-with-russia-and-china 	2025-01-14T15:03:00-08:00	
World oil exports fall: How new routes are changing global trade	By Asif Aydinly The global export of crude oil declined by 2% in 2024—the first drop since the COVID-19 pandemic—marking significant shifts in the global oil industry. Reuters, citing shipment data, notes that this decrease stems from weak demand growth, changes in refinery operations, pipeline disruptions, and the redistribution of global trade routes. These factors have exacerbated an already volatile global oil market. Geopolitical tensions remain a major factor influencing the market. The Russia-Ukraine war and escalating conflict in the Middle East have disrupted traditional supply chains. Sanctions and restrictive measures have redirected Russian exports from Europe to India and China.	 https://news.az/news/-world-oil-exports-fall-how-new-routes-are-changing-global-trade 	2025-01-14T14:20:00-08:00

Trump breaks Biden's game: EU prepares for shocking changes	European Union officials are examining the sanctions imposed by U.S. President Joe Biden, worried that President-elect Donald Trump might rescind them and disrupt current foreign policy and trade dynamics. According to sources within the European Commission (EC), senior officials have been instructed to review Biden-era executive orders, encompassing sanctions on Russia as well as trade and cybersecurity measures, to determine which reversals could impact the EU or undermine its own initiatives the most. The urgency, ahead of Trump’s January 20 inauguration, highlights Brussels’ mounting concerns over the incoming president’s potential policies —especially given his past criticisms of key U.S. allies. The EU hopes Trump will preserve the sanctions at least as a bargaining tool in any negotiations with Moscow over a possible ceasefire. However, on January 10, 2025, with just days left in office, the Biden administration introduced its most extensive package of sanctions yet, targeting Russia’s oil and gas revenues. Analysts say the move was designed to provide both Kyiv and President-elect Trump with additional leverage in forging a peace deal in Ukraine.	 https://news.az/news/-trump-breaks-biden-s-game-eu-prepares-for-shocking-changes 	2025-01-13T00:00:00-08:00

From CSTO to the EU: Can Armenia withstand the geopolitical fallo...	On January 9, 2025, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan announced that the Armenian government approved a bill to initiate the country’s accession process to the European Union (EU). The proposal, titled 'On Initiating the Process of the Republic of Armenia’s Membership in the European Union,' was submitted to parliament by Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan for consideration and a final decision. According to Prime Minister Pashinyan, any decision to join the EU would ultimately require a nationwide referendum. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov characterized Armenia’s decision to launch an EU accession bid as the country’s 'sovereign right,' but cautioned that Armenia cannot simultaneously remain part of two different organizations. 'What does this EU membership mean? It is difficult to say right now, because, of course, it is impossible to be a member of two different organizations, hypothetically speaking,' Peskov added. Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chair of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, also responded to Armenia’s move, remarking that 'Armenia can apply directly to the EU, where they like to help candidates for paradise with money and weapons,' and alluding to the EU’s ongoing support for Ukraine. He further suggested that Prime Minister Pashinyan might still remember Armenia’s membership in the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). In an interview with News.az, several political analysts offered insights into the implications of Armenia’s decision:	 https://news.az/news/-from-csto-to-the-eu-can-armenia-withstand-the-geopolitical-fallout 	2025-01-09T20:37:00-08:00
