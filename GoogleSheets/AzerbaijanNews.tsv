At first glance, this event might seem routine, but in reality, it reflects significant shifts in the United States' Arctic strategy. After over 25 years of stagnation in icebreaker construction, America is taking critical steps to strengthen its presence in the Arctic. Amid intensifying competition from Russia and China, and given the region's historical significance, modernizing the U.S. icebreaker fleet serves not only as a military upgrade but also as a political statement.	 https://news.az/news/-us-arctic-strategy-enters-new-era-intensifying-race-with-russia-and-china 	2025-01-14T15:03:00-08:00	
World oil exports fall: How new routes are changing global trade	By Asif Aydinly The global export of crude oil declined by 2% in 2024—the first drop since the COVID-19 pandemic—marking significant shifts in the global oil industry. Reuters, citing shipment data, notes that this decrease stems from weak demand growth, changes in refinery operations, pipeline disruptions, and the redistribution of global trade routes. These factors have exacerbated an already volatile global oil market. Geopolitical tensions remain a major factor influencing the market. The Russia-Ukraine war and escalating conflict in the Middle East have disrupted traditional supply chains. Sanctions and restrictive measures have redirected Russian exports from Europe to India and China.	 https://news.az/news/-world-oil-exports-fall-how-new-routes-are-changing-global-trade 	2025-01-14T14:20:00-08:00
