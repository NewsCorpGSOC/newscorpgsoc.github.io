Trump breaks Biden's game: EU prepares for shocking changes	European Union officials are examining the sanctions imposed by U.S. President Joe Biden, worried that President-elect Donald Trump might rescind them and disrupt current foreign policy and trade dynamics. According to sources within the European Commission (EC), senior officials have been instructed to review Biden-era executive orders, encompassing sanctions on Russia as well as trade and cybersecurity measures, to determine which reversals could impact the EU or undermine its own initiatives the most. The urgency, ahead of Trump’s January 20 inauguration, highlights Brussels’ mounting concerns over the incoming president’s potential policies —especially given his past criticisms of key U.S. allies. The EU hopes Trump will preserve the sanctions at least as a bargaining tool in any negotiations with Moscow over a possible ceasefire. However, on January 10, 2025, with just days left in office, the Biden administration introduced its most extensive package of sanctions yet, targeting Russia’s oil and gas revenues. Analysts say the move was designed to provide both Kyiv and President-elect Trump with additional leverage in forging a peace deal in Ukraine.	 https://news.az/news/-trump-breaks-biden-s-game-eu-prepares-for-shocking-changes 	2025-01-13T00:00:00-08:00

From CSTO to the EU: Can Armenia withstand the geopolitical fallo...	On January 9, 2025, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan announced that the Armenian government approved a bill to initiate the country’s accession process to the European Union (EU). The proposal, titled 'On Initiating the Process of the Republic of Armenia’s Membership in the European Union,' was submitted to parliament by Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan for consideration and a final decision. According to Prime Minister Pashinyan, any decision to join the EU would ultimately require a nationwide referendum. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov characterized Armenia’s decision to launch an EU accession bid as the country’s 'sovereign right,' but cautioned that Armenia cannot simultaneously remain part of two different organizations. 'What does this EU membership mean? It is difficult to say right now, because, of course, it is impossible to be a member of two different organizations, hypothetically speaking,' Peskov added. Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chair of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, also responded to Armenia’s move, remarking that 'Armenia can apply directly to the EU, where they like to help candidates for paradise with money and weapons,' and alluding to the EU’s ongoing support for Ukraine. He further suggested that Prime Minister Pashinyan might still remember Armenia’s membership in the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO).

French President Emmanuel Macron recently sparked outrage by accusing African countries of ' forgetting to thank France for its help in the fight against terrorism in the Sahel .' During a speech broadcast on the Élysée Palace’s social media page, Macron went so far as to claim that without French military intervention, none of the current African leaders in that region would govern sovereign nations today.
