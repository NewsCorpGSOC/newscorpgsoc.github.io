Battle for the financial future: Can BRICS challenge the dollar?	By Samir Muradov Once again, the world awaits the much-hyped 'collapse of the dollar,' but for now, we’re witnessing yet another diplomatic spectacle called 'the BRICS currency.' This drawn-out performance has its comedic and tragicomic moments. On stage: Brazil with utopian ideas, Russia with forced support, China with ambitions, India with caution, and the U.S. wielding a tariff club at 100%. Let’s break down why this series has yet to become a blockbuster.	 https://news.az/news/-battle-for-the-financial-future-can-brics-challenge-the-dollar 	2025-02-02T13:20:00-08:00

Is Germany changing course? Nord Stream back in the spotlight	The idea of restoring Nord Stream is no longer marginal. The notion of reviving the Nord Stream pipeline no longer sounds as far-fetched as it did just a year ago. Discussions on the feasibility of bringing the pipeline back online are no longer limited to pro-Russian politicians and energy experts—German officials, such as Saxony’s Prime Minister Michael Kretschmer, are now openly addressing the issue. This is happening despite Germany’s official stance of having written off the project both politically and economically.

Vladimir Bekish: 'In Sudan, the Chinese built a closed city where...	In recent years, China’s approach to demographic and economic expansion has sparked debates across geopolitical circles. While the country faces declining birth rates and an aging population, its long-term strategies extend far beyond domestic policies. Some analysts suggest that Beijing may seek to bolster its global influence by strategically relocating populations, fostering industrial footholds abroad, and deepening its presence in resource-rich regions. In this exclusive interview with News.az, Russian military-political analyst and strategic security expert Vladimir Bekish delves into China’s potential migration policies, its growing footprint in Russia and Africa, and the geopolitical implications of Beijing’s economic outreach. Could China’s expanding role in Russia lead to demographic shifts in key regions? How might Moscow respond to an increasing Chinese presence? And what are the broader consequences for global security? Western media have occasionally touched on these issues, but often with a narrow focus. This conversation sheds light on deeper strategic considerations and long-term trends that could shape the global balance of power.	 https://news.az/news/-vladimir-bekish-in-sudan-the-chinese-built-a-closed-city-where-even-the-police-couldnt-enter-interview 	2025-01-30T13:20:00-08:00

What is behind the extension of the EU mission in Armenia? - EXPE...	Recent developments in Armenia have reignited debates over geopolitical realignments in the South Caucasus. Footage has surfaced of European Union Mission in Armenia (EUMA) observers conducting surveillance along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border. The mission, originally deployed in February 2023 with a mandate expiring in 2025, has now been extended for an additional two years—prompting speculation about its evolving role. This decision raises critical questions: Is the EU mission transitioning from a monitoring role to a more active Western military presence? How will Russia react, particularly in light of Armenia’s recent decision to withdraw Russian border troops from the Armenia-Iran frontier? If Yerevan insists on defending its borders independently, why does it continue to rely on a Western mission to oversee the region? Could the extension of EUMA’s mandate signal a gradual substitution of Russian forces with Western security structures?	 https://news.az/news/-what-is-behind-the-extension-of-the-eu-mission-in-armenia-expert-opinions 	2025-01-29T22:36:00-08:00

And within the Middle East itself, one of the most important and critical points is Syria. Syria has long been a volatile state, influencing regional dynamics even before.

The Middle East is undergoing rapid geopolitical shifts, reshaping the interests and strategies of key regional and global players. At the heart of these transformations are Türkiye, Iran , Israel, and Russia, whose policies intersect in Syria and beyond. How will the balance of power in the region evolve after the potential collapse of the Assad regime? Can Iran maintain its influence in Syria and Lebanon ? What will be the fate of Russia’s military bases? These pressing questions are gaining importance amid the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, as well as Moscow’s diminishing presence in Syria.To provide insight into these complex dynamics, News.az turned to Professor Dr. Selçuk Çolakoğlu, the founder and director of the Turkish Center for Asia-Pacific Studies in Ankara .

Türkiye or Saudi Arabia: Who will lead the Islamic world?	From 1517 to 1917, nearly all modern Arab countries were under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, whose sultan also held the title of caliph. Following its defeat in World War I, the Republic of Türkiye was established in 1923. Meanwhile, in 1932, after a series of successful wars on former Ottoman lands, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) emerged. Spanning approximately 2.15 million square kilometers and home to nearly 35 million people, its capital is Riyadh. However, what truly elevates its standing in the Islamic world is its stewardship of Islam’s two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina. In 1938, vast oil reserves were discovered in the kingdom, cementing its economic power.	 https://news.az/news/turkiye-or-saudi-arabia-who-will-lead-the-islamic-world 	2025-01-29T17:20:00-08:00

Ali Semin: The U.S. cannot annex Canada, even if Trump wants it -...	Donald Trump’s desire to integrate Greenland and Canada into the United States has sparked serious discussions on the international stage. With this initiative, Trump aims to expand the global influence of the U.S. and strengthen its economic power. One of his key arguments is the claim that the U.S. loses $250 billion annually due to Canada. In an interview with News.az, Ali Semin, a researcher at Istanbul Communication University , emphasized that the realization of this idea is highly unlikely. According to him, such actions contradict international law and could lead to serious global repercussions. Trump’s approach has been compared to Russia’s annexation of Crimea , stirring debates even within the U.S. Moreover, his hardline stance on social issues such as LGBT rights and abortion has also drawn significant attention. Ali Semin notes that while Trump’s nationalist policies aim to maintain American hegemony, these steps will only increase both domestic and international pressure on the U.S. Such expansionist initiatives could set a dangerous precedent for other states.	 https://news.az/news/-ali-semin-the-us-cannot-annex-canada-even-if-trump-wants-it-interview 	2025-01-28T22:13:00-08:00
