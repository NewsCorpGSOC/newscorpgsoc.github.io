While such an operation may be necessary to neutralize the growing threat of Houthi missile strikes, its success hinges on the formation of a coalition involving key regional and global players. This coalition would likely comprise Israel, several Sunni Arab states, and the United States, whose missile defense systems and military expertise are indispensable. Yet the challenges of forging such alliances reflect the intricacies of modern Middle Eastern diplomacy.	 https://news.az/news/-israel-vs-houthis-the-beginning-of-a-new-coalition-in-the-region 	2024-12-29T22:00:00-08:00

Egypt between Africa and Asia	Egypt, one of the cradles of world civilization, boasts a rich history. The country is the largest state in the Arab world and plays a pivotal role in both Africa and the Middle East. Its military, a formidable regional force, has essentially become the backbone of the state since the monarchy's abolition in 1952. Despite its vast territory exceeding one million square kilometers, Egypt struggles to sustain its rapidly growing population. Only 3.6% of its land—comprising the Nile Valley and a narrow strip along the river—is arable, making the country reliant on imported American wheat and weapons. This reliance heavily influences Egypt’s foreign policy, which is shaped by a strict authoritarian governance style.	 https://news.az/news/-egypt-between-africa-and-asia 	2024-12-29T21:00:00-08:00

India and Russia unite against China’s Belt and Road Initiative	It is often said that the new is merely the well-forgotten old. During the Middle Ages, Europe relied on several major trade routes, many of which connected northern and southern states. One notable example was the Varangians-to-Greeks trade route, which linked Scandinavia to Byzantium and traversed the lands of the Eastern Slavs. This route had several branches, one of which extended from Veliky Novgorod southeastward along the Volga River to the Caspian Sea. Although no sophisticated canal systems or hydraulic structures existed at the time, even then, people sought ways to develop trade, exchange goods, and share ideas.	 https://news.az/news/-india-and-russia-unite-against-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative 	2024-12-26T01:35:00-08:00
