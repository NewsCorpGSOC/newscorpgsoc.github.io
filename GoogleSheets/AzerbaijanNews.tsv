COP17 in Armenia: A 'consolation prize' for Yerevan	By Tural Heybatov Speculation and manipulation are long-standing tools in Armenia's foreign policy. We know this well by now. Today, Yerevan is brazenly stirring up controversies around the COP29 climate conference in Baku. Funded and promoted by the Armenian diaspora, a series of hysterical actions are being staged across the West, aiming to undermine Azerbaijan’s reputation and belittle the agenda set by Azerbaijan’s chairmanship, which will be discussed in Baku. If no obstacles arise, the current COP could become historic in terms of practical solutions to climate issues. It’s high time to move from words to action. For years, world leaders have merely talked, meeting annually here and there, while the climate crisis worsens before our eyes. Azerbaijan is determined to change this trend and tackle the core issue hindering global efforts to save the planet—financing.	 https://news.az/news/-cop17-in-armenia-a-consolation-prize-for-yerevan 	2024-11-03T21:26:00-08:00

When France forgot human rights: Shameful war in Algeria	The conflict that erupted in Algeria between France and local insurgents in 1954 can aptly be described as a form of 'special military operation.' This was a war without frontlines or clear divisional boundaries, where insurgent bases were identified and dismantled through tactics more akin to special operations than traditional combat. The French army segmented Algeria into sectors, 'squares,' into which military units were deployed via helicopters to locate and eliminate insurgents. Simultaneously, intelligence agencies worked to infiltrate the National Liberation Front (FLN), creating conditions for internal fragmentation.	 https://news.az/news/-when-france-forgot-human-rights-shameful-war-in-algeria 	2024-11-01T23:33:00-07:00
