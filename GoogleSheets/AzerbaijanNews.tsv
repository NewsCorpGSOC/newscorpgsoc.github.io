Shadow of geopolitics: What will Georgia's future be?	The ongoing internal political confrontation in Georgia unfolds between supporters of European integration and pro-Russian forces. From the early years of its independence, the country experienced a bloody civil war, which led to the loss of South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and de facto autonomy for Adjara. Under the presidency of Eduard Shevardnadze, ties with Russia strengthened, but this path was not acceptable to all. The 'Rose Revolution,' which brought Mikheil Saakashvili to power, set clear priorities: restoring territorial integrity and joining the European Union. Saakashvili successfully and bloodlessly reintegrated Adjara, thanks to Russia's neutrality. However, the war of August 8, 2008, undermined the revolutionaries' positions and forced them to relinquish power.	 https://news.az/news/-shadow-of-geopolitics-what-will-georgia-s-future-be 	2024-12-10T21:54:00-08:00

Rising oil prices: What to expect in the coming months	The future of global oil prices remains a topic of intense debate, with opinions shaped by a series of unfolding events poised to impact the market. The delayed U.S. presidential election, Donald Trump's stark divergence from the Biden administration’s energy policies , the fall of the Syrian government, and discrepancies between real-time oil prices and OPEC+ decisions have all contributed to the uncertainty surrounding oil price forecasts. Oil prices have surged following the collapse of the Syrian government, a development that has destabilized the Middle East and dealt significant blows to its long-time backers, Russia and Iran. Brent crude climbed toward $72 a barrel, while Texas Intermediate surpassed $67. Former President Donald Trump has reignited his rallying cry to 'drill, baby, drill,' promising to halve energy costs. This approach has raised alarms among emerging market oil producers reliant on dollar earnings, while offering hope to poorer oil-importing nations. Meanwhile, the power vacuum left by Bashar al-Assad’s fall has sparked competition among various factions, raising fears of escalating violence akin to the turmoil in post-revolution Libya and Iraq.	 https://news.az/news/-rising-oil-prices-what-to-expect-in-the-coming-months 	2024-12-09T10:00:00-08:00

US wants to punish China for COVID-19: Is Wuhan solely to blame?	By Tural Heybatov On Monday, a detailed report from members of the U.S. House of Representatives was published, naming China as responsible for the global spread of COVID-19.

The report suggests that an incident in the Wuhan Institute of Virology may have triggered the pandemic, citing claims of inadequate biological safety standards at the facility. The document notably emphasizes that, based on nearly all scientific criteria, if evidence for a natural origin existed, it would have surfaced by now. However, these conclusions rely heavily on terms such as 'likely,' 'apparently,' and 'probable,' leaving room for interpretation and debate.	 https://news.az/news/-us-wants-to-punish-china-for-covid-19-is-wuhan-solely-to-blame 	2024-12-03T02:10:00-08:00

Trump vs. BRICS: Battle over global currency dominance	President-elect Donald Trump said he would require countries that are part of BRICS to commit to not creating a new currency or face 100% tariffs during his administration. The warning came less than a week after Trump declared he would impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China once he was inaugurated as president. This summit promises to be a significant event not only for its member states but also for countries seeking closer ties with BRICS. Among these countries is Azerbaijan, which aims to contribute to the development of a multipolar world and foster deeper global cooperation. The spokesman for Azerbaijan’s Foreign Ministry, Aykhan Hajizada, announced on August 20 that Azerbaijan has officially applied to join the BRICS group. This move follows the July 3 adoption of the 'Joint Declaration of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the People’s Republic of China on Establishing a Strategic Partnership' during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Astana. As stated in paragraph 4.5 of the declaration, Azerbaijan expresses its desire to join BRICS, and China welcomes Azerbaijan’s participation in BRICS cooperation. Baku's aspiration to join BRICS is no surprise. BRICS includes Azerbaijan's key trading partners and major investors. Specifically, China and India remain the country's largest economic partners, contributing significantly to trade volumes and investments in key sectors. Azerbaijan actively fosters bilateral relations with leading countries worldwide, employing a strategic foreign policy based on the principles of sovereignty and non-interference. Joining BRICS would enhance this course, enabling the country to expand political and economic cooperation with major global players. A 100% tariff at the U.S. border, if implemented, would sharply increase the cost of goods from BRICS members, fueling U.S. inflation and destabilizing global trade flows.	 https://news.az/news/-trump-vs-brics-battle-over-global-currency-dominance 	2024-12-02T00:48:00-08:00

Without normal relations with Azerbaijan, Armenia has no future'...	Polish President Andrzej Duda visited Armenia on November 25. Duda visited Armenia's regions bordering Azerbaijan.

On Thursday, Azerbaijan’s Foreign Ministry summoned Polish Chargé d'Affaires Michal Greczylo to express its protest against a recent visit by Poland’s President Andrzej Duda to the Armenia-Azerbaijan border region. During the meeting on Thursday, Azerbaijan raised a protest against the visit of Polish President Andrzej Duda to the Armenia-Azerbaijan border region, near the village of Kerki, which remains under Armenian occupation. The protest noted that the president participated in anti-Azerbaijani propaganda alongside the European Union Mission to Armenia, despite prior warnings from the Azerbaijani side. It was emphasized that, contrary to its stated goal of contributing to regional stability and building confidence between Azerbaijan and Armenia, the mission has often been used as a tool for anti-Azerbaijani propaganda. The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry highlighted that such actions contradict Azerbaijani-Polish relations and urged Poland to refrain from steps that negatively affect Azerbaijan's legitimate security interests.

How the Syrian conflict impacts Türkiye-Russia relations - EXPERT...	Clashes continue in Syria between the Bashar al-Assad regime and the opposition military group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in rural areas of Aleppo province. The clashes, which began early on November 27, have resulted in HTS taking control of the village of Kafer Besme, along with the heights of Aqil, al-Raghib, Kuptan, and Dabbabat in the western Aleppo countryside. Amid the ongoing conflict, large numbers of civilians have been forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in the Idlib countryside. Meanwhile, Russian jets bombed the village of Orem Al-Sugra in the western part of the province following the Assad regime’s loss of control over the area. Prior to this, Russian forces were engaged in fighting on the outskirts of Atarib. Reports suggest that the Islamists have received support from the pro-Turkish opposition. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan recently expressed his desire to establish ties with the Syrian government to promote peace in the region, including the creation of security zones. This raises questions: Could such a statement provoke certain forces to become more active in the region, potentially obstructing Ankara's initiatives with Syria? If the involvement of the pro-Turkish opposition in this confrontation is confirmed, how might this impact relations between Türkiye and Russia , considering Moscow's support for the Assad regime? To explore these questions, News.az sought insights from political scientists in Russia and Türkiye.	 https://news.az/news/-how-the-syrian-conflict-impacts-turkiye-russia-relations-expert-opinions 	2024-11-28T07:48:00-08:00

Patrice Lefeu: How COP29 redefined global climate finance commitm...	The COP29 Presidency of Azerbaijan announced the agreement of the Baku Finance Goal (BFG), a new commitment to channel $1.3tn of climate finance to the developing world each year. Success on the COP29 Presidency’s top priority for the UN Climate Summit represents a significant uplift from the previous climate finance goal of $100 billion and will unlock a new wave of global investment. The Baku Finance Goal contains a core target for developed countries to take the lead on mobilizing at least $300 billion per year for developing countries by 2035. This represents a $50bn increase on the previous draft text and is the product of 48 hours of intensive diplomacy by the COP29 Presidency. It pays special consideration to support the least developed countries and small island developing states, with provisions on accessibility and transparency. The analytical-information portal News.Az continues its series of articles, and interviews regarding climate change. As part of this series, we will be posting interviews with and videos of prominent climate and environmental experts. Our guest today is Patrice Lefeu, CEO of Climate Finance Plc .
