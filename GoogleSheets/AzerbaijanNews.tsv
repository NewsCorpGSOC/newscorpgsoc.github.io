Why Macron’s accusations of African 'ingratitude' are deeply misg...	French President Emmanuel Macron recently sparked outrage by accusing African countries of ' forgetting to thank France for its help in the fight against terrorism in the Sahel .' During a speech broadcast on the Élysée Palace’s social media page, Macron went so far as to claim that without French military intervention, none of the current African leaders in that region would govern sovereign nations today.

In my view, these comments reflect a profound misunderstanding of Africa’s past and present, as well as a troubling sense of entitlement on the part of the French government.	 https://news.az/news/-why-macrons-accusations-of-african-ingratitude-are-deeply-misguided 	2025-01-07T19:54:00-08:00

Egypt between Africa and Asia	Egypt, one of the cradles of world civilization, boasts a rich history. The country is the largest state in the Arab world and plays a pivotal role in both Africa and the Middle East. Its military, a formidable regional force, has essentially become the backbone of the state since the monarchy's abolition in 1952.

Only 3.6% of its land—comprising the Nile Valley and a narrow strip along the river—is arable, making the country reliant on imported American wheat and weapons. This reliance heavily influences Egypt’s foreign policy, which is shaped by a strict authoritarian governance style.	 https://news.az/news/-egypt-between-africa-and-asia 	2024-12-29T21:00:00-08:00
