Without normal relations with Azerbaijan, Armenia has no future'...	Polish President Andrzej Duda visited Armenia on November 25. Duda visited Armenia's regions bordering Azerbaijan. He met with the Polish delegation of the European Union Monitoring Mission (EUMM) operating in the region. On Thursday, Azerbaijan’s Foreign Ministry summoned Polish Chargé d'Affaires Michal Greczylo to express its protest against a recent visit by Poland’s President Andrzej Duda to the Armenia-Azerbaijan border region. During the meeting on Thursday, Azerbaijan raised a protest against the visit of Polish President Andrzej Duda to the Armenia-Azerbaijan border region, near the village of Kerki, which remains under Armenian occupation. The protest noted that the president participated in anti-Azerbaijani propaganda alongside the European Union Mission to Armenia, despite prior warnings from the Azerbaijani side. It was emphasized that, contrary to its stated goal of contributing to regional stability and building confidence between Azerbaijan and Armenia, the mission has often been used as a tool for anti-Azerbaijani propaganda. The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry highlighted that such actions contradict Azerbaijani-Polish relations and urged Poland to refrain from steps that negatively affect Azerbaijan's legitimate security interests. Considering the relevance of the issue, News.Az interviewed Polish political analyst Jakub Koreiba, an expert at the Institute of Eurasian Studies in Poland.	 https://news.az/news/-without-normal-relations-with-azerbaijan-armenia-has-no-future-polish-expert-on-dudas-visit 	2024-11-28T22:15:00-08:00

Trump’s return: How U.S. foreign policy might change	As Donald Trump hints at a potential return to the White House, discussions around his foreign policy legacy and its potential trajectory are intensifying. His administration’s hallmark 'America First' doctrine disrupted conventional U.S. foreign policy, favoring transactional relationships over long-term alliances. This approach, while criticized by some as overly self-centered, resonated with those who viewed America’s global entanglements as burdensome. Should Trump reclaim the presidency, his policies could bring both opportunities and challenges to regions like Central Asia, the South Caucasus, and the theater of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.	 https://news.az/news/-trumps-return-how-us-foreign-policy-might-change 	2024-11-28T21:43:00-08:00

How the Syrian conflict impacts Türkiye-Russia relations - EXPERT...	Clashes continue in Syria between the Bashar al-Assad regime and the opposition military group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in rural areas of Aleppo province. The clashes, which began early on November 27, have resulted in HTS taking control of the village of Kafer Besme, along with the heights of Aqil, al-Raghib, Kuptan, and Dabbabat in the western Aleppo countryside. Amid the ongoing conflict, large numbers of civilians have been forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in the Idlib countryside. Meanwhile, Russian jets bombed the village of Orem Al-Sugra in the western part of the province following the Assad regime’s loss of control over the area. Prior to this, Russian forces were engaged in fighting on the outskirts of Atarib. Reports suggest that the Islamists have received support from the pro-Turkish opposition. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan recently expressed his desire to establish ties with the Syrian government to promote peace in the region, including the creation of security zones. This raises questions: Could such a statement provoke certain forces to become more active in the region, potentially obstructing Ankara's initiatives with Syria? If the involvement of the pro-Turkish opposition in this confrontation is confirmed, how might this impact relations between Türkiye and Russia , considering Moscow's support for the Assad regime? To explore these questions, News.az sought insights from political scientists in Russia and Türkiye.	 https://news.az/news/-how-the-syrian-conflict-impacts-turkiye-russia-relations-expert-opinions 	2024-11-28T07:48:00-08:00

Patrice Lefeu: How COP29 redefined global climate finance commitm...	The COP29 Presidency of Azerbaijan announced the agreement of the Baku Finance Goal (BFG), a new commitment to channel $1.3tn of climate finance to the developing world each year. Success on the COP29 Presidency’s top priority for the UN Climate Summit represents a significant uplift from the previous climate finance goal of $100 billion and will unlock a new wave of global investment. The Baku Finance Goal contains a core target for developed countries to take the lead on mobilizing at least $300 billion per year for developing countries by 2035. This represents a $50bn increase on the previous draft text and is the product of 48 hours of intensive diplomacy by the COP29 Presidency. It pays special consideration to support the least developed countries and small island developing states, with provisions on accessibility and transparency. The analytical-information portal News.Az continues its series of articles, and interviews regarding climate change. As part of this series, we will be posting interviews with and videos of prominent climate and environmental experts. Our guest today is Patrice Lefeu, CEO of Climate Finance Plc .
