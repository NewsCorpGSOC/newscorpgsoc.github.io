COP17 in Armenia: A 'consolation prize' for Yerevan	By Tural Heybatov Speculation and manipulation are long-standing tools in Armenia's foreign policy. We know this well by now.

For years, world leaders have merely talked, meeting annually here and there, while the climate crisis worsens before our eyes.

Ukraine’s new energy plan with the EU	By Asif Aydinli The agreement between Ukraine and the European Union to substantially increase electricity imports for the 2024–2025 winter season aims to stabilize Ukraine’s energy system amid mounting challenges.

This, according to Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko, is expected to strengthen the resilience of Ukraine’s power grid.
