Has Russia left China on the sidelines in the North-South corrido...	Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan are joining forces to create a unified operator to develop the North-South International Transport Corridor, marking a significant step in enhancing regional connectivity and trade. This ambitious initiative, announced by Kazakhstan’s Minister of Transport, Marat Karabayev, aims to streamline logistics and increase the economic potential of participating nations. 'Together with Russia and Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan will establish a single operator and introduce tariff discounts of up to 50% to boost transportation volumes from the current 10 million tons to 20 million tons annually,' Karabayev said during a government meeting at the Majilis. He added that most cargo transported along this route originates in Russia and is destined for Persian Gulf countries. To further strengthen the corridor’s potential, a synchronized development roadmap involving Russia, Turkmenistan, and Iran has been approved. The plan seeks to expand the corridor’s capacity from 23 to 33 trains per day, representing a significant 1.5-fold increase. Highlighting the importance of infrastructure, Karabayev noted that the development of the North-South and Trans-Caspian International Transport Routes hinges on the functionality of the Aktau and Kuryk seaports. Container transportation will be a key priority, with plans to enhance the container-handling capacity of Aktau port from 140,000 to 550,000 containers within three years. In collaboration with the Chinese company Lianyungang Port, construction of a container hub is already underway. Simultaneously, discussions are ongoing to create an additional terminal with a capacity of 300,000 containers, involving companies such as Germany’s Renus, the American firm Wondernet, and the French CMA CGM. Meanwhile, at the Kuryk port, a multifunctional Sarzha terminal is being constructed to further expand the region’s logistical capabilities.	 https://news.az/news/-has-russia-left-china-on-the-sidelines-in-the-north-south-corridor 	2024-12-24T01:25:00-08:00
