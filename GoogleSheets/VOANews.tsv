Threats in Indo-Pacific fuel debate over US nuclear redeployment	washington — Threats from China, Russia and North Korea have fueled debate in Washington about whether the United States should consider redeploying tactical nuclear weapons to the Indo-Pacific region, with leading U.S. Senate members expressing opposing views. Earlier in May, Republican Senator Roger Wicker, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, put forward a military spending plan that included the idea of redeploying U.S. tactical nuclear arms that were withdrawn from South Korea more than three decades ago. Another Republican, Senator James Risch, who is the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told VOA Korean last month in an email statement that the U.S. should 'explore options for returning nuclear weapons to the Pacific theater for the purpose of strengthening extended deterrence.' The term 'extended deterrence' refers to the U.S. commitment to respond in kind to a nuclear attack on South Korea. Drawing a contrast, Democratic Senator Jack Reed, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Monday in a phone conference that he didn't think that U.S. tactical nuclear weapons should be redeployed to the Korean Peninsula, adding that it could provoke a 'major response from the Chinese.' Redeployment of nukes The U.S. government has made it clear that the U.S. does not plan to redeploy its tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula. 'We believe that the only effective way to reduce nuclear threats on the peninsula is by curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons,' a State Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement to VOA last week. In 1991, the U.S. withdrew from South Korea all of its nuclear weapons, or about 100, according to some studies. The U.S. has been closely watching the growing military cooperation among China, Russia and North Korea, especially in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It has identified the three nations as threats to stability in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. On August 22, the White House confirmed to VOA that a new 'nuclear employment guidance' had been issued. The terms of the classified document are not public, but The New York Times quoted two senior administration officials as saying that it 'seeks to prepare the United States for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and North Korea.' 'The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat,' White House National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said in an email to VOA. 'We have repeatedly voiced concerns about the advancing nuclear arsenals of Russia, PRC [China] and the DPRK [North Korea].' Vipin Narang, who recently served as the acting assistant secretary of defense for space policy, said in an August forum held by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies that the United States may need to seek 'a change in the size or posture' of nuclear forces to deal with threats from China, Russia and North Korea. Growing threats In South Korea, there is growing uneasiness about the U.S. capability to protect South Korea from North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile weapons. North Korea’s state Korean Central News Agency on Sunday released a photo showing the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, inspecting a new 12-axle transporter erector launcher (TEL), which could be used to launch a new, longer missile to potentially attack the United States. The next day, in a speech celebrating the country’s founding anniversary, Kim vowed to increase the number of nuclear weapons 'exponentially.' Amid these geopolitical tensions, U.S.-based experts appear to be divided about whether the U.S. should redeploy tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula. Richard Lawless, former deputy undersecretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security, said the idea that South Korea would be intimidated by China, Russia or South Korea from even beginning a discussion on the subject with Washington 'is failed logic.' 'Many Americans continue to fail to appreciate the threat of North Korea and China, typically playing down the latter.' Robert Peters, a research fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile defense at the Heritage Foundation, told VOA Korean via email that he supported the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea. 'I’m concerned about the credibility of our deterrent in the face of North Korean nuclear expansion and Chinese nuclear breakout,' Peters said, adding that stationing nonstrategic nuclear weapons within the theater gives the U.S. president 'far more optionality when crafting a deterrence message during times of acute crisis or conflict than if he or she could rely solely on strategic nuclear weapons.' Opposing views But Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, said he was against redeploying U.S. tactical nuclear weapons. 'Placing such high-value weapons in a static, fixed bunker makes a very tempting preemptive target for North Korea,' Klingner told VOA Korean on Tuesday via email. 'During a crisis, it could even lower deterrence by making Pyongyang more likely to initiate a preemptive attack on the bunker prior to the weapons being deployed on mobile launch platforms.' Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said he didn't support the redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons to South Korea. 'From a strictly military standpoint, the U.S. can enforce extended deterrence with nuclear-armed submarines and long-range bombers that North Korea cannot defend against,' Samore told VOA Korean on Tuesday via email. 'Politically, redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea would be controversial with some Korean political parties and the Korean public and would increase tensions in the region, especially with China and North Korea, and even between South Korea and Japan,' Samore said. Sydney Seiler, who until last year was the national intelligence officer for North Korea on the U.S. National Intelligence Council, told VOA Korean via email Tuesday that 'there is a consensus among [U.S. and South Korean] leaders and their senior national security advisers that such a redeployment is unnecessary at this time.' The Chinese Embassy in Washington told VOA in an email Tuesday that the Chinese 'firmly oppose any country’s attempt to use the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue to harm China’s strategic security interests.' 'It is hoped that the U.S. can abandon the cold war mentality and hegemonic logic, adopt a rational and responsible nuclear policy, stop nuclear sharing, extended deterrence, expanding nuclear alliance, and other negative moves, and play a constructive role in maintaining regional and global peace and stability,' Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said Tuesday in a written statement via email, responding to an inquiry from VOA Korean.	https://www.voanews.com/a/threats-in-indo-pacific-fuel-debate-over-us-nuclear-redeployment/7780765.html	2024-09-11T16:57:29-07:00

US pledges support for Africa's AI goals	Abuja, Nigeria — The two-day pan-African AI conference co-hosted by the United States concluded Wednesday in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial hub. Hundreds of delegates including public officials, tech leaders, policy makers academics and entrepreneurs attended the conference to hold talks about the development and use of safe, secure and trustworthy AI systems in Africa. The U.S. deputy secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, spoke at the summit about the opportunity at hand. 'A global technology revolution is well under way — the race to develop and deploy new technologies, including artificial intelligence, is already shaping everything about our lives,' said Campbell. 'We aim to foster collaborations between the United States and Africa AI researchers, policy makers and industry leaders, so that we can work together to drive innovation and address common challenges. This will enable us to share the benefits of AI globally.' The conference is a significant step in Africa's technological future. Campbell said artificial intelligence can be used to address problems like global health, food security, education, energy and climate change, and asserted the conference has provided the ground for African voices in AI to shape emerging global AI systems. 'I cannot overstate Africa's growing importance in the global technology landscape,' said Campbell. 'By developing human capital and strengthening research and innovation ecosystems and building and AI ready institutional and regulatory environment, we can help AI work for Africa. The African Union's landmark AI strategy sets the roadmap for African countries to harness AI's potential to achieve developmental aspirations in education, health, agriculture, infrastructure, peace and security and good governance.' In July, the African Union launched the continent's Artificial Intelligence Strategy, saying AI is pivotal in transforming Africa into a global technology hub, and it called on member states to adopt the strategy. On Tuesday, Nigeria's minister of communication, innovation and digital economy, Bosun Tijani, announced a $61,000 grant for Nigeria's brightest AI startups. 'For us to truly harness artificial intelligence for our collective benefits, we must be deliberate and collaborative in our approach,' said Tijani. 'We just ensure that our digital transformation journey is inclusive, equitable and human focused.' Africa currently represents 2.5% of the global AI market, according to the Artificial Intelligence for Development Africa, or AI4D. But analysts say with more talks about safe use, AI applications could boost Africa's economy by $2.9 trillion by the year 2030 with Kenya, South Africa and Nigerian markets taking the lead.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-pledges-support-for-africa-s-ai-goals/7780639.html	2024-09-11T14:10:15-07:00	
International arms embargo on Darfur renewed as fighting rages	United Nations — The U.N. Security Council unanimously renewed for another year an arms embargo on parties in the Darfur region of Sudan, where the war between rival generals has intensified in recent months, exacerbating a dire humanitarian crisis. Sudan’s envoy welcomed the extension but urged the council to go further and sanction the entire Rapid Support Forces militia, the rival of the government-backed Sudanese Armed Forces. 'The militia, in its entirety, really needs to be listed, because it fulfills all the conditions,' Ambassador Al-Harith Idriss Al-Harith Mohamed said. 'There also needs to be an end to the financing of the militia.' The RSF as it is known, has captured most of Darfur, and a battle has been going on since May over North Darfur’s capital, El Fasher, which is the only Darfuri regional capital not to have fallen to the RSF. Sudan’s military has repeatedly accused the United Arab Emirates of supplying the RSF with arms and ammunition smuggled in through neighboring Chad. The UAE strongly denies the accusations. A report by a United Nations panel of experts earlier this year said there was substance to media reports that cargo planes originating in the UAE capital had landed in eastern Chad with arms, ammunition and medical equipment destined for the paramilitary group. At the meeting, Sudan’s envoy accused the UAE of profiting from his nation’s natural resources, including gold and uranium, and he urged the Security Council to act. 'We are calling for clear measures to be taken against those who seek to sabotage the Sudanese economy — namely businesses and companies whose headquarters are in the UAE,' Mohamed said. 'The repetition of baseless allegations does not make them true,' Emirati Ambassador Mohamed Abushahab told the council. He urged the army, known as the SAF, to show 'political courage' and participate in peace talks to end the war. The SAF sat out U.S.- and Saudi-brokered talks in Geneva in August because the UAE was invited to participate. The United States led the negotiations in the council on the renewal of the Darfur arms embargo, which was first put in place in 2004 during the genocide carried out by Arab Janjaweed fighters against non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur. Janjaweed fighters make up elements of today's RSF. 'Renewing the sanctions measures will restrict the movement of arms into Darfur and sanction individuals and entities contributing to, or complicit in, destabilizing activities of Sudan,' U.S. envoy Robert Wood said. 'All of this is critical to helping end the escalating conflict, alleviate humanitarian catastrophe and put Sudan back on the path to stability and security.' The U.S. also has proposed that the Security Council sanction two RSF commanders, but their designation remains in limbo after Russia put a hold on it on August 31. Rights groups said the embargo renewal did not go far enough and should include the whole of Sudan. 'The council should correct this failure as soon as possible and expand the arms restrictions to cover all of Sudan, to limit the flow of arms and curb widespread atrocities being committed in the country,' said Human Rights Watch’s Jean-Baptiste Gallopin. Sudan is facing a massive humanitarian crisis as a result of the war between the rival generals that began in April 2023. More than 10 million people have fled their homes in search of safety, and last month, international monitors confirmed famine in North Darfur. Across the country, the United Nations says, 26 million people are in crisis levels of hunger. Human rights violations are also rife. In June, the RSF and SAF were added to an annual U.N. blacklist for perpetrators of grave violations against children. They were named for violations committed last year, including the killing and maiming of children, for attacking schools and hospitals, and in the case of the RSF, for sexual violence and recruiting and using children in their ranks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/international-arms-embargo-on-darfur-renewed-as-fighting-rages/7780603.html	2024-09-11T13:37:39-07:00	
Aflatoxin kills hundreds of dogs in southern Malawi	Blantyre, Malawi — Malawi has recently recorded the sudden deaths of dogs that consumed meals prepared from maize husks contaminated with aflatoxins. Veterinary experts say the country has recorded 450 dog deaths since April, when the first cases were identified in Malawi’s commercial city, Blantyre. Aflatoxins are toxic substances produced by fungi that grow on pet food ingredients like peanuts, corn and other grains. Experts warn that the accumulation of those toxins in an animal’s body can lead to liver damage, blood clotting and, in severe cases, death. Timothy Banda is the veterinary clinic manager at the Blantyre Society for the Protection and Care of Animals, which has been testing the dogs. He told VOA that symptoms include a yellowish tint on the dog‘s skin, hemorrhagic diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, and sometimes vomiting. 'For the past two, three weeks, we haven’t received any death from the problem,' he said. 'But from the time it started somewhere around April up to somewhere around early August, the estimations could be somewhere around 450 dogs so far have died.' He said the aflatoxin contamination was suspected after it was observed that the dogs were not responding to treatment. 'Under normal circumstances, once we started the right treatment, we could get good results, but in this scenario, they were all dying despite whatever treatment was given. Nothing could work out,' Banda said. Banda said the affected dogs were those fed with nsima, a thick porridge prepared from maize or maize husks. Alfred Manda, a resident of Chirimba township, told VOA that he lost three dogs in August. 'The kind of food I mostly give out to my dogs is nsima flour made from leftover maize called madeya,' he said. 'To me, I thought it was a healthy diet. I wish I knew earlier. I could have done things better to save my dogs, but unfortunately this is the sad reality that I have faced.' Health experts warn that aflatoxins can also cause tumors in the livers of animals and humans. But health officials in Malawi, where maize is the staple food, have not reported any human deaths resulting from consuming contaminated maize. In Zambia, media reports indicate over 400 dogs died in July after consuming maize meal contaminated with aflatoxins. Malawi authorities are advising dog owners to switch to alternative foods, such as rice, until the problem is contained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/aflatoxin-kills-hundreds-of-dogs-in-southern-malawi-/7780590.html	2024-09-11T13:27:06-07:00	
Mexico's Senate OKs controversial judicial overhaul after protesters storm chamber	MEXICO CITY — Mexico's Senate voted early Wednesday to overhaul the country's judiciary, clearing the biggest hurdle for a controversial constitutional revision that will make all judges stand for election, a change that critics fear will politicize the judicial branch and threaten Mexico's democracy. The approval came in two votes after hundreds of protesters pushed their way into the Senate on Tuesday, interrupting the session after it appeared that Morena, the governing party of outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, had lined up the necessary votes to pass the proposal. Judicial employees and law students had protested for weeks, saying the plan, under which all judges would be elected, could threaten judicial independence and undermine the system of checks and balances. The legislation sailed through the lower chamber, where Morena and its allies hold a supermajority, last week. Approval by the Senate posed the biggest obstacle and required defections from opposition parties. Both of the Senate votes were 86-41. The chamber erupted into cheers and chants of 'Yes, we could!' The legislation must now be ratified by the legislatures of at least 17 of Mexico's 32 states. The governing party is believed to have the necessary support after major gains in recent elections. Oaxaca's legislature became the first to ratify it just hours after the Senate's approval. President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, who takes office October 1, congratulated lawmakers on passing the overhaul. The election of judges 'will strengthen the delivery of justice in our country,' Sheinbaum wrote on the social media platform X. 'The regime of corruption and privileges each day is being left farther in the past and a true democracy and true rule of law are being built.' López Obrador acknowledged Wednesday that many are against the plan, but said that 'it's incredibly important to put an end to corruption and impunity. We're going to make a lot of progress when the people can freely elect judges, magistrates and ministers.' Some experts and observers, however, have suggested that the overhaul could have the opposite effect, and allow corrupt individuals and criminals to have more sway over the justice system. On Tuesday evening, just hours after the governing party appeared to have wrangled the votes it needed, protesters with pipes and chains broke into the Senate chamber. The protesters said lawmakers were not listening to their demands. 'The judiciary isn't going to fall,' yelled the protesters, waving Mexican flags and signs opposing the overhaul. They were joined by a number of opposition senators as they chanted in the chamber. Others outside roared when newscasters announced the Senate was taking a recess. Among them was Alejandro Navarrete, a 30-year-old judicial worker who said he and his colleagues, 'knowing the danger the reform represents,' came to call on the Senate to strike down the proposal. 'They have decided to sell out the nation and sell out for political capital they were offered. We felt obligated to enter the Senate,' he said, carrying a Mexican flag. 'Our intention is not violent, we didn't intend to hurt them, but we intend to make it clear that the Mexican people won't allow them to lead us into a dictatorship.' López Obrador, a populist long averse to independent regulatory bodies who has ignored courts and attacked judges, says the plan would crack down on corruption by making it easier to punish judges. Critics say it would handicap the judiciary, stack courts with judges favoring the president's party, allow anyone with a law degree to become a judge and even make it easier for politicians and criminals to influence courts. It has spooked investors and prompted U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar to call it a risk to democracy and an economic threat.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-s-senate-oks-controversial-judicial-overhaul-after-protesters-storm-chamber-/7780547.html	2024-09-11T12:43:21-07:00	
Jordan's Islamist party bounces back in election clouded by Gaza war	AMMAN — Jordan's moderate Islamist opposition made significant gains in Tuesday's parliamentary election, initial official results showed on Wednesday, boosted by anger over Israel's war in Gaza. The Islamist Action Front (IAF) also benefited from a new electoral law that encourages a bigger role for political parties in the 138-seat parliament, though tribal and pro-government factions will continue to dominate the assembly. The IAF, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, won up to a fifth of the seats under the revamped electoral law, which for the first time allocated 41 seats for parties, according to preliminary figures seen by Reuters and confirmed by independent and official sources. 'The Jordanian people have given us their trust by voting for us. This new phase will increase the burden of responsibility for the party towards the nation and our citizens,' Wael al Saqqa, head of the IAF, told Reuters. The IAF win allowed it to capture 31 seats for the first time since parliamentary life was revived in 1989 after decades of martial law. The party has emerged as the largest political grouping in parliament. 'The elections reflect the desire for change and those who voted were not necessarily all Islamists but wanting change and had become fed up with the old ways,' said Murad Adailah, the head of the Muslim Brotherhood. The IAF, the only effective grassroots opposition, praised the authorities for not meddling in polls. Adailah told Reuters their win was a 'popular referendum' that backs their platform of support for the militant Palestinian group Hamas, their ideological allies, and their demand to scrap the country's peace treaty with Israel. In a country where anti-Israel sentiment runs high, they have led some of the largest protests in the region in support of Hamas in what their opponents say allowed them to increase their popularity. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the U.S., U.K., EU and others. The election represents a modest step in a democratization process launched by King Abdullah as he seeks to insulate Jordan from the conflicts at its borders and speed up the slow pace of political reforms. Under Jordan's constitution, most powers still rest with the king who appoints governments and can dissolve parliament. The assembly can force a cabinet to resign by a vote of no confidence. The monarch hopes nascent political parties under the new law will help pave the way for governments that emerge from parliamentary majorities. The voting system still favors sparsely populated tribal and provincial regions over the densely populated cities mostly inhabited by Jordanians of Palestinian descent, which are Islamist strongholds and highly politicized. Turnout among Jordan's 5.1 million eligible voters in Tuesday's poll was low at 32.25%, initial official figures showed, up slightly from 29% at the last election in 2020. The Muslim Brotherhood has been allowed to operate in Jordan since 1946. But it fell under suspicion after the Arab Spring, which saw Islamists pitted against established powers in many Arab countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jordan-s-islamist-party-bounces-back-in-election-clouded-by-gaza-war-/7780493.html	2024-09-11T12:16:13-07:00	
Soyuz craft heads to space station with 2 Russians, 1 American	MOSCOW — A Soyuz spacecraft carrying two Russians and an American blasted off Wednesday for an express trip to the International Space Station. The space capsule atop a towering rocket set off at 1623 GMT from Russia's manned space launch facility in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, and was scheduled to dock with the space station three hours later, in contrast to some missions that last for days. The mission commander is Alexei Ovchinin, with Russian compatriot Ivan Vagner and American Donald Pettit in the crew. The blast-off took place without obvious problems and the Soyuz entered orbit eight minutes after liftoff, a relief for Russian space authorities after an automated safety system halted a launch in March because of a voltage drop in the power system. On the space station, Pettit, Vagner and Ovchinin will join NASA's Tracy Dyson, Mike Barratt, Matthew Dominick, Jeanette Epps, Butch Wilmore, and Suni Williams, and Russians Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.	https://www.voanews.com/a/soyuz-craft-heads-to-space-station-with-2-russians-1-american/7780406.html	2024-09-11T11:45:20-07:00

Afghanistan, Turkmenistan begin work on long-delayed gas pipeline	ISLAMABAD — Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and neighboring Turkmenistan on Wednesday marked the resumption of work on a long-delayed gas pipeline designed to run through the two countries, Pakistan and India. The estimated $10 billion Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India, or TAPI, project is designed to annually transport up to 33 billion cubic meters of Turkmen natural gas from the southeastern Galkynysh field through the proposed 1,800-kilometer pipeline. Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund of the de facto Taliban government traveled to the Turkmen border region of Mary and joined top leaders of the host country to inaugurate construction of a vital section of the TAPI project. It is intended to link the city of Serhetabat in Turkmenistan to Herat in western Afghanistan. Turkmen President Serdar Berdimuhamedov joined and addressed the ceremony via video link. 'This project will benefit not only the economies of the participating countries but also the entire region,' he said. Taliban authorities declared a public holiday in Herat, the capital of the province of the same name, to mark the occasion, with posters celebrating the TAPI project plastered across the border city. Initially signed in the early 1990s to provide natural gas to energy-deficient South Asia, the TAPI project has faced repeated delays due to years of Afghan hostilities, which ended in 2021 when the then-insurgent Taliban recaptured power as all U.S. and NATO forces exited the country. While Turkmen leaders Wednesday pledged to enhance bilateral ties between Ashgabat and Kabul and carry forward the TAPI project, experts remain skeptical that the gas pipeline will become operational soon. They cite funding issues, U.S.-led Western economic sanctions on Afghanistan and the international community’s refusal to recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government over restrictions on Afghan women’s rights. Islamabad’s persistent diplomatic and military tensions with New Delhi are also considered a significant obstacle to the materialization of the TAPI project. According to officials of the participating countries, Pakistan and India, each one plans to purchase 42% of the gas exports, and Afghanistan will receive the rest. Kabul will also earn around $500 million in transit fees annually. Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan deteriorated after the Taliban takeover over terrorism concerns. Islamabad complains that Kabul shelters and facilitates fugitive anti-Pakistan militants to orchestrate cross-border terrorist attacks from Afghan sanctuaries, charges the Taliban reject.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghanistan-turkmenistan-begin-work-on-long-delayed-gas-pipeline/7780374.html	2024-09-11T10:55:13-07:00	
US House Republicans cancel vote on stopgap funding measure	WASHINGTON — U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson canceled a vote scheduled for Wednesday on his stopgap funding bill, saying more work is needed to build support for a measure, less than three weeks before a government shutdown deadline. 'No vote today, because we're in the consensus-building business here in Congress, with small majorities, and that's what you do,' Johnson told reporters at the Capitol. The vote had been set for later on Wednesday. Johnson added that Republicans will be working through the weekend to find a bill that would gain enough votes for passage, now that his measure, opposed by President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats, has faltered. House Republicans have attached a controversial provision requiring people to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote, a measure meant to force Democrats to take stances on the politically charged issue of non-citizen voting, which is already illegal in federal elections. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who continues to falsely claim his 2020 loss was the result of fraud, has urged Republicans to pass the voting measure ahead of the November 5 election. The federal government's fiscal year ends on September 30, when funding for many agencies expires. Without some sort of extension, federal programs not deemed essential would have to suspend many of their operations, forcing thousands of government workers to go on leave. Success for the funding bill was not guaranteed in the chamber that Republicans control by a narrow 220-211 margin. Several House Republicans have said they would vote against the measure, citing spending concerns, and many members of the caucus generally oppose stopgap spending measures. Two Republicans joined Democrats on Tuesday in voting against a procedural move to advance the bill. Democrats broadly see the citizenship registration requirement as meant to undermine confidence in administering elections. 'We're watching a movie we've seen over and over again,' said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday. 'House Republicans are trying to pass a bill so partisan that it even splits their own caucus. This proposal isn't even serious.' The White House on Monday said Biden would veto this funding package were it to pass, citing the 'unrelated cynical' voting requirement. The administration also wants a temporary funding period shorter than six months, as well as more money for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to fix infrastructure damaged by natural disasters. Lawmakers face an even more critical self-imposed deadline on January 1, before which they must act to raise or extend the nation's debt ceiling or risk defaulting on more than $35 trillion in federal government debt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-republicans-cancel-vote-on-stopgap-funding-measure/7780375.html	2024-09-11T10:50:42-07:00

Generation Z drives far-right support in Europe	London — Support for far-right figures among young voters appears to be growing in several European countries. Much of the focus is on Germany, where the Alternative for Germany party (AfD) is hoping to secure another victory in the upcoming Brandenburg state election in the east of the country on September 22. AfD secured a resounding victory in the Thuringia state election earlier this month, winning 32.8% of the vote, well ahead of second-place Christian Democrats at 23.6%. It was the first time the far right had won a state election since the end of World War II in 1945. 'More than a third of young people, almost 40% of 18- to 29-year-olds, [voted] for the AfD,' according to Ben Ansell, a professor at the University of Oxford and host of the podcast 'What’s Wrong with Democracy?' In contrast, only 1 in 5 voters over 70 years of age chose AfD. The party is hoping young voters will propel it to victory in the upcoming Brandenburg state election. '[Other parties] probably expected that the AfD is only a party for old people and that young people don't vote for the AfD. That is exactly wrong,' said AfD chairman in Brandenburg Hans-Christoph Berndt at a recent campaign event. What’s driving the popularity of the far right among younger people? Immigration appears to be a key factor, said Ansell. 'In eastern Germany, [AfD] are just really popular,' he said. 'It’s a part of the country that is poorer than the other parts, that is less ethnically diverse and therefore reacts more to the new diversity than Berlin does, or other parts of Germany.' 'Some people have argued that it's concerns about the war in Ukraine,' Ansell added. 'Other people have argued that it's a response to COVID, or a response to the housing crisis … it's getting on the housing ladder and things like that, having the same quality of life they thought their elders had.' The trend among young voters is not limited to Germany. In June’s European elections, France’s far-right National Rally was the most popular party among 18- to 34-year-olds, with 32% of the vote — much higher than over-65s. National Rally’s 28-year-old president, Jordan Bardella, has 1.6 million followers on TikTok, a social media platform popular among young people. 'TikTok is short videos that aim to shock. The skill that populist parties have in making videos and finding political moments that are short, sharp and shocking — to get people excited about politics,' said Ansell. Meanwhile, a recent study by El País newspaper suggested that a quarter of Spanish men aged between 18 to 26 — known as 'Generation Z' — believe that in some circumstances, authoritarianism may be preferable to democracy. Among the so-called baby-boomer generation, aged 59 and over, the figure is less than 10%. Preference for authoritarianism was also lower among female voters — a trend seen in other countries, said Ansell. 'It’s something that comes out actually most obviously in east Asia — that young men are reacting politically very differently to young women. In [South] Korea, that’s extremely stark, as young men have voted for explicitly anti-feminist movements. But you can see this huge gender gap among the under-30s opening up in all countries, including in the United States right now,' he said. It remains to be seen whether such trends among young voters will be replicated in the United States in the presidential election on November 5. Recent polls suggest the Democrats’ Kamala Harris has increased support among younger voters compared to her Republican rival, Donald Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/generation-z-drives-far-right-support-in-europe-/7780257.html	2024-09-11T09:48:13-07:00

Biden, Harris and Trump visit Sept. 11 site in New York	New York — President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump made a rare joint appearance on Wednesday at the New York City site that marks the Sept. 11 plane attacks in 2001 that killed nearly 3,000 people. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee and Trump, her Republican rival in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, shook hands and exchanged a few words, despite their a contentious debate the night before, then lined up for the commemoration. Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, also attended. Instead of formal remarks, the ceremony at the 'ground zero' site where planes brought down the World Trade Center's twin towers included wives, husbands, sisters, brothers and grandchildren reading the names of family members killed 23 years ago. The annual rite marks the suicide attacks by al Qaeda Islamist militants that hit Manhattan, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field. 'Richard J. O'Connor. We will always love and miss you,' a small red-headed boy said of his grandfather, who was killed in the World Trade Center that morning. A bagpipe and drum processional was accompanied by New York City's fire and police departments and Port Authority honor guards. The national anthem was performed and moments of silence were held at the times each target was struck. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg also attended, standing between Biden and Trump. After New York, Biden and Harris were flying to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where passengers on United Flight 93 overcame the hijackers and the plane crashed in a field, preventing another target from being hit. Then the president and vice president will head back to the Washington area to visit a memorial at the Pentagon. 'On this day 23 years ago, terrorists believed they could break our will and bring us to our knees. They were wrong. They will always be wrong. In the darkest of hours, we found light. And in the face of fear, we came together - to defend our country, and to help one another,' Biden said in an early morning statement. Trump, who also plans to visit the Pennsylvania memorial, told Fox News on Wednesday: 'It was very, very sad, horrible day. There's never been anything like it.' Biden earlier issued a proclamation honoring those who died as a result of the attacks, as well as the hundreds of thousands of Americans who volunteered for military service afterwards. 'We owe these patriots of the 9/11 Generation a debt of gratitude that we can never fully repay,' Biden said, citing deployments to Afghanistan, Iraq and other war zones, as well as the capture and killing of Sept. 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden and his deputy. U.S. congressional leaders on Tuesday posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal to 13 service members who were killed in the Aug. 26, 2021, suicide bombing at Kabul's airport during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7780183.html	2024-09-11T08:46:35-07:00	
Hellish' scene unfolds as wildfire races toward California mountain community	TRABUCO CANYON, California — Alex Luna, a 20-year-old missionary, saw the sky turn from a cherry red to black in about 90 minutes as an explosive wildfire raced toward the Southern California mountain community of Wrightwood and authorities implored residents to leave their belongings behind and get out of town. 'It was very, I would say, hellish-like,' Luna said Tuesday night. 'It was very just dark. Not a good place to be at that moment. ... Ash was falling from the sky like if it was snowing.' Luna was among those who heeded the evacuation order that was issued for the community of about 4,500 in the San Gabriel Mountains east of Los Angeles. The Bridge Fire, which had burned 189 square kilometers (73 square miles) as of late Tuesday with no containment, is one of three major wildfires burning in Southern California and endangering tens of thousands of homes and other structures. The fires sprung to life during a triple-digit heat wave that finally broke Wednesday. The cooler temperatures brought the prospect of firefighters finally making headway against the flames. Other major fires were burning across the West, including in Idaho, Oregon and Nevada, where about 20,000 people had to flee a blaze outside Reno. In Northern California, a fire that started Sunday burned at least 30 homes and commercial buildings and destroyed 40 to 50 vehicles in Clearlake City, 175 kilometers (109 miles) north of San Francisco. Roughly 4,000 people were forced to evacuate. California is only now heading into the teeth of the wildfire season but already has seen nearly three times as much acreage burn than during all of 2023. Evacuation orders were expanded Tuesday night in Southern California as the fires grew and included parts of the popular ski town of Big Bear. Some 65,600 homes and buildings were under threat by the Line Fire, including those under mandatory evacuations and those under evacuation warnings, nearly double the number from the previous day. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department announced Tuesday that a Norco man suspected of starting the Line Fire in Highland on September 5 had been arrested and charged with arson. He was held in lieu of $80,000 bail. Residents along the southern edge of Big Bear Lake were told to leave the area, which is a popular destination for anglers, bikers and hikers. As of late Tuesday, the blaze had charred more than 140 square kilometers (54 square miles) of grass and brush with 14% containment, according to CalFire. It blanketed the area with a thick cloud of dark smoke. The fire impacted key radio towers, including communication channels for those responding to the fire. Cooler weather could moderate fire activity toward the end of the week, CalFire said in an update. Public safety power shut-offs were anticipated in parts of the Big Bear and Bear Valley areas. The acrid air prompted several districts in the area to close schools through the end of the week because of safety concerns. Three firefighters have been injured since the blaze was reported Thursday, state fire managers said. For Wrightwood, a picturesque town 124 kilometers (77 miles) east of Los Angeles known for its 1930’s cabins. threatening wildfires have become a regular part of life. Authorities expressed frustration in 2016 when only half the residents heeded orders to leave. Janice Quick, the president of the Wrightwood Chamber of Commerce, lives a few miles outside town. Late Tuesday afternoon she was eating lunch outside with friends and they were rained on by embers the size of her thumbnail that hit the table and made a clinking sound. A friend texted to tell her that the friend's home had been consumed by fire, while another friend was watching through her ring camera as embers rained down on her home. 'I've never seen anything like this and I've been through fires before,' said Quick, who has lived in Wrightwood for 45 years. In neighboring Orange County, firefighters used bulldozers, helicopters and planes to control a rapidly spreading blaze called the Airport Fire that started Monday and spread to about 8 square kilometers (3 square miles) in only a few hours. The blaze was ignited by a spark from heavy equipment being used by public workers, officials said. By Tuesday night, it had charred more than 78 square kilometers (30 square miles) and was heading over mountainous terrain into neighboring Riverside County with no containment, said Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Steve Concialdi. It burned some communications towers on top of a peak, though so far officials said they did not have reports of the damage disrupting police or fire communication signals in the area. Concialdi said the fire was burning away from homes in Orange County, but there are 36 recreational cabins in the area. He said authorities don't yet know if the cabins were damaged or destroyed by the blaze. Two firefighters who suffered heat-related injuries and a resident who suffered from smoke inhalation were treated at a hospital and released. Sherri Fankhauser, her husband and her daughter set up lawn chairs and were watching helicopters make water drops on a flaming hillside a few hundred yards away from their Trabuco Canyon home on Tuesday. They didn't evacuate even though their street had been under a mandatory evacuation order since Monday. A neighbor did help Fankhauser's 89-year-old mother-in-law evacuate, Fankhauser said. The flames died down last night but flared up again in the morning. 'You can see fire coming over the ridge now,' Fankhauser said Tuesday afternoon. 'It's getting a little scarier now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hellish-scene-unfolds-as-wildfire-races-toward-california-mountain-community-/7780144.html	2024-09-11T08:27:52-07:00

Samsung Electronics plans global job cuts of up to 30%, sources say	SEOUL/NEW DELHI — Samsung Electronics, the world's top maker of smartphones, TVs and memory chips, is cutting up to 30% of its overseas staff at some divisions, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. South Korea-based Samsung has instructed subsidiaries worldwide to reduce sales and marketing staff by about 15% and the administrative staff by up to 30%, two of the sources said. The plan will be implemented by the end of this year and would impact jobs across the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa, one person said. Six other people familiar with the matter also confirmed Samsung's planned global headcount reduction. It is not clear how many people would be let go and which countries and business units would be most affected. The sources declined to be named because the scope and details of the job cuts remained confidential. In a statement, Samsung said workforce adjustments conducted at some overseas operations were routine, and aimed at improving efficiency. It said there are no specific targets for the plans, adding that they are not impacting its production staff. Samsung employed a total of 267,800 people as of the end of 2023, and more than half, or 147,000 employees, are based overseas, according to its latest sustainability report. Manufacturing and development accounted for most of those jobs and sales and marketing staff was around 25,100, while 27,800 people worked in other areas, the report said. The 'global mandate' on job cuts was sent about three weeks ago, and Samsung's India operation was already offering severance packages to some mid-level employees who have left in recent weeks, one of the direct sources said. The total employees who may need to leave the India unit could reach 1,000, the person added. Samsung employs some 25,000 people in India. In China, Samsung has notified its staff about the job cuts that are expected to affect about 30% of its employees at its sales operation, a South Korean newspaper reported this month. Big challenges The job cuts come as Samsung grapples with mounting pressure on its key units. Its bread-and-butter chip business has been slower than its rivals in recovering from a severe downturn in the industry that drove its profit to a 15-year low last year. In May, Samsung replaced the head of its semiconductor division in a bid to overcome a 'chip crisis' as it seeks to catch up with smaller rival SK Hynix in supplying high-end memory chips used in artificial intelligence chipsets. In the premium smartphone market, Samsung is facing stiff competition from Apple and China's Huawei, while it has long lagged behind TSMC in contract chip manufacturing. And in India, which earns Samsung around $12 billion in annual revenue, a strike over wages is disrupting production. One of the sources familiar with the plans said the job cuts were being made in preparation for a slowdown in global demand for technology products as the global economy slows. Another source said Samsung is seeking to shore up its bottom line by saving costs. It was not immediately clear if Samsung will also cut jobs in its headquarters in South Korea. One of the sources said Samsung would find it difficult to lay off workers in South Korea because it was a politically sensitive issue. Conglomerate Samsung Group, of which the electronics giant is the crown jewel, is the country's biggest employer and plays a key role in its economy. Job cuts could also stir labor unrest at home. A South Korean workers' union at Samsung Electronics recently went on strike for several days, demanding higher wages and benefits. Shares in Samsung Electronics, South Korea's most valuable stock, are trading at their lowest level in 16 months on Wednesday, as some analysts cut their profit estimates for the company recently, citing a weak recovery in demand for smartphones and personal computers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/samsung-electronics-plans-global-job-cuts-of-up-to-30-sources-say-/7780071.html	2024-09-11T08:03:47-07:00	
AI not a US election gamechanger yet	Washington — When the U.S. announced the seizure of 32 internet domains tied to Russian efforts to ply American voters with disinformation ahead of November’s presidential election, prosecutors were quick to note the use of artificial intelligence, or AI. The Russian operation, known as Doppelganger, drove internet and social media users to the fake news using a variety of methods, the charging documents said, including advertisements that were 'in some cases created using artificial intelligence.' AI tools were also used to 'generate content, including images and videos, for use in negative advertisements about U.S. politicians,' the indictment added. And Russia is far from alone in turning to AI in the hopes of swaying U.S. voters. 'The primary actors we've seen for election use of this are Iran and Russia, although as various private companies have noticed, China also has used artificial intelligence for spreading divisive narratives in the United States,' according to a senior intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive information. 'What we've seen is artificial intelligence is used by foreign actors to make their content more quickly and convincingly tailor their synthetic content in both audio and video forms,' the official added. But other U.S. officials say the use of AI to spread misinformation and disinformation in the lead-up to the U.S. election has so far failed to live up to some of the more dire warnings about how deepfakes and other AI-generated material could shake-up the American political landscape. 'Generative AI is not going to fundamentally introduce new threats to this election cycle,' according to Cait Conley, senior adviser to the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the U.S. agency charged with overseeing election security. 'What we're seeing is consistent with what we expected to see,' Conley told VOA. AI 'is exacerbating existing threats, in both the cyber domain and the foreign malign influence operation-disinformation campaigns,' she said. But little of what has been put out to this point has shocked officials at CISA or the myriad state and local governments who run elections across the country. 'This threat vector is not new to them,' Conley said. 'And they have taken the measures to ensure they're prepared to respond effectively.' As an example, Conley pointed to the rash of robocalls that targeted New Hampshire citizens ahead of the state’s first in the nation primary in January, using fake audio of U.S. President Joe Biden to tell people to stay home and 'save your vote.' New Hampshire's attorney general quickly went public, calling the robocalls an apparent attempt to suppress votes and telling voters the incident was under investigation. This past May, prosecutors indicted a Louisiana political consultant in connection with the scheme. More recently, the alleged use of AI prompted a celebrity endorsement in the U.S. presidential race by pop star Taylor Swift. 'Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site,' Swift wrote in an Instagram social media post late Tuesday. 'It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,' she wrote, adding, 'I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.' But experts and analysts say for all the attention AI is getting, the use of such technology in attacks and other influence operations has been limited. 'There's not a tremendous amount of it in the wild that's particularly successful right now, at least to my knowledge,' said Katie Gray, a senior partner at In-Q-Tel, the CIA's technology-focused, not-for-profit strategic investment firm. 'Most attackers are not using the most sophisticated methods to penetrate systems,' she said on September 4 at a cybersecurity summit in Washington. Others suggest that at least for the moment, the fears surrounding AI have outpaced its usefulness by malicious actors. ‘We jump to the doomsday science fiction,' said Clint Watts, a former FBI special agent and counterterror consultant who heads up the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC). 'But instead, what we're seeing is the number one challenge to all of this right now is access, just getting to the [AI] tools and accessing them,' he said, speaking like Gray at the cybersecurity summit. Over the past 14 months, MTAC has logged hundreds of instances of AI use by China, Russia and Iran, Watts said. And analysts found that Moscow and Tehran, in particular, have struggled to get access to a fully AI toolbox. The Russians 'need to use their own tools from the start, rather than Western tools, because they're afraid they'll get knocked off those systems,' Watts said. Iran is even further behind. 'They've tried different tools,' Watts said. 'They just can't get access to most of them for the most part.' U.S. adversaries also appear to be having difficulties with the underlying requirements to make AI effective. 'To do scaled AI operations is not cheap,' Watts said. 'Some of the infrastructure and the resources of it [AI], the models, the data it needs to be trained [on] – very challenging at the moment.' And Watts said until the products generated by AI get better, attempted deepfakes will likely have trouble resonating with the targeted audiences. 'Audiences have been remarkably brilliant about detecting deepfakes in crowds. The more you watch somebody, the more you realize a fake isn't quite right,' according to Watts. 'The Russian actors that we've seen, all of them have tried deepfakes and they've moved back to bread and butter, small video manipulations.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-not-a-us-election-gamechanger-yet/7780093.html	2024-09-11T08:03:15-07:00

Workers' protest grounds flights at Kenya's main airport	Nairobi — Hundreds of workers at Kenya's main international airport demonstrated on Wednesday against a planned deal between the government and a foreign investor. Planes have remained grounded, with hundreds of passengers stranded at the airport. The government has said that the build-and-operate agreement with India's Adani Group would see the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport modernized, and an additional runway and terminal constructed, in exchange for the group running the airport for 30 years. Kenya Airport Workers Union, in announcing the strike, said that the deal would lead to job losses and 'inferior terms and conditions of service' for those who will remain. Kenya Airways on Wednesday announced there would be flight delays and possible cancellations because of the ongoing strike at the airport, which serves Nairobi. The strike has affected local flights coming from the port city of Mombasa and the lake city of Kisumu, where delays have been reported by local media. At the main airport, police officers had taken up security check-in roles with long lines seen outside the departure terminals and worried passengers unable to confirm if their flights would depart as scheduled. The Kenya Airports Authority said in a statement that it was 'engaging relevant parties to normalize operations' and urged passengers to contact respective airlines to confirm flight status. The Central Organization of Trade Unions' secretary-general, Francis Atwoli, told journalists at the airport that the strike would have been averted had the government listened to the workers. 'This was a very simple matter where the assurance to workers in writing that our members will not lose jobs and their jobs will remain protected by the government and as is required by law and that assurance alone, we wouldn't have been here,' he said. Last week, airport workers had threatened to go on strike, but the plans were called off pending discussions with the government. The spotting of unknown people moving around with airport officials taking notes and photographs raised concerns that the Indian firm officials were readying for the deal, local media outlets reported last week. The High Court on Monday temporarily halted the implementation of the deal until a case filed by the Law Society and the Kenya Human Rights Commission is heard.	https://www.voanews.com/a/workers-protest-grounds-flights-at-kenya-s-main-airport/7779969.html	2024-09-11T06:32:57-07:00	
Gunmen kill Pakistan polio vaccinator and police guard near Afghan border	Islamabad — Gunmen in northwestern Pakistan killed an anti-polio worker and a policeman guarding him Wednesday, the second attack on healthcare teams trying to carry out a national immunization campaign against the paralytic virus. Area officials reported that the assailants targeted a polio team providing vaccine to children in the Bajaur district, bordering Afghanistan. The attack also injured a policeman. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the deadly attack in one of the militancy-hit districts of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The start of the immunization campaign Monday was marred by a roadside bombing of a polio vaccination team in the province’s South Waziristan district. That attack resulted in injuries to at least ten people, including three vaccinators and six police personnel. An Afghanistan-based Islamic State affiliate known as Islamic State-Khorasan reportedly claimed responsibility for the deadly blast. Militants in violence-affected districts often target polio vaccinators, suspecting them of spying on behalf of Pakistani security forces. Such attacks have killed dozens of vaccinators and police personnel escorting them in past years, mostly in areas near or adjacent to the Afghan border, dealing critical blows to polio eradication efforts. On Monday, the Pakistan Polio Eradication Program said that the country of about 240 million is facing an 'intense outbreak' of wild poliovirus this year, paralyzing 17 children so far nationwide. It reported that sewage samples tested positive in 66 districts for the highly contagious virus, threatening more children. The program noted that the ongoing house-to-house campaign aims to vaccinate more than 33 million children under five in 115 districts nationwide. Pakistan and Afghanistan, which reported nine paralytic polio cases so far in 2024, are the only two remaining polio-endemic countries globally. Polio immunization drives in both countries, which share a nearly 2,600-kilometer border, have long faced multiple challenges, such as security and vaccine boycotts, which have set back the goal of eradicating the virus from the globe. Officials at the World Health Organization have reported an improvement in Afghan vaccination efforts since the Islamist Taliban retook control of the country three years ago, ending years of nationwide hostilities and enabling polio teams to inoculate children in previously inaccessible areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunmen-kill-pakistan-polio-vaccinator-and-police-guard-near-afghan-border/7779922.html	2024-09-11T06:04:01-07:00	
US inflation reaches 3-year low as Federal Reserve prepares to cut interest rates	Washington — The post-pandemic spike in U.S. inflation eased further last month as year-over-year price increases reached a three-year low, clearing the way for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates next week. Wednesday’s report from the Labor Department showed that consumer prices rose 2.5% in August from a year earlier. It was the fifth straight annual drop and the smallest such increase since February 2021. From July to August, prices rose just 0.2%. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core prices rose 3.2% in August from 12 months earlier, the same as in July. On a month-to-month basis, core prices rose 0.3% last month, a pickup from July's 0.2% increase. Economists closely watch core prices, which typically provide a better read of future inflation trends. For months, cooling inflation has provided gradual relief to America’s consumers, who were stung by the price surges that erupted three years ago, particularly for food, gas, rent and other necessities. Inflation peaked in mid-2022 at 9.1%, the highest rate in four decades. Fed officials have signaled that they’re increasingly confident that inflation is falling back to their 2% target and are now shifting their focus to supporting the job market, which is steadily cooling. As a result, the policymakers are poised to begin cutting their key rate from its 23-year high in hopes of bolstering growth and hiring. A modest quarter-point cut is widely expected next week. Over time, a series of rate cuts should reduce the cost of borrowing across the economy, including for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The latest inflation figures could inject themselves into the presidential race in its final weeks. Former President Donald Trump has heaped blame on Vice President Kamala Harris for the jump in inflation, which erupted in early 2021 as global supply chains seized up, causing severe shortages of parts and labor. Harris has proposed subsidies for home buyers and builders in an effort to ease housing costs and backs a federal ban on price-gouging for groceries. Trump has said he would boost energy production to try to reduce overall inflation. A key reason why inflation eased again in August was that gas prices tumbled by about 10 cents a gallon last month, according to the Energy Inflation Administration, to a national average of about $3.29. Economists also expect the government’s measures of grocery prices and rents to rise more slowly. Though food prices are roughly 20% more expensive than before the pandemic, they have barely budged over the past year. Another potential driver of slower inflation is that the cost of new apartment leases has started to cool as a stream of newly built apartments have been completed. According to the real estate brokerage Redfin, the median rent for a new lease rose just 0.9% in August from a year earlier, to $1,645 a month. But the government’s measure includes all rents, including those for people who have been in their apartments for months or years. It takes time for the slowdown in new rents to show up in the government’s data. In July, rental costs rose 5.1% from a year ago, according to the government’s consumer price index. Americans’ paychecks are also growing more slowly — an average of about 3.5% annually, still a solid pace — which reduces inflationary pressures. Two years ago, wage growth was topping 5%, a level that can force businesses to sharply raise prices to cover their higher labor costs. In a high-profile speech last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that inflation was coming under control and suggested that the job market was unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure. Consumers have propelled the economy for the past three years. But they are increasingly turning to debt to maintain their spending and credit card, and auto delinquencies are rising, raising concerns that they may have to rein in their spending soon. Reduced consumer spending could lead more employers to freeze their hiring or even cut jobs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-inflation-reaches-a-3-year-low-as-federal-reserve-prepares-to-cut-interest-rates-/7779927.html	2024-09-11T06:03:09-07:00	
European business confidence in China is at an all-time low, report says	HONG KONG — China must reprioritize economic growth and reforms and boost investor confidence by leveling the playing field for all companies in the country, a European business group said Wednesday. With 'business confidence now at an all-time low' over lagging domestic demand and overcapacity in certain industries, the annual European Business in China Position Paper called on China to open its economy and allow a more free market to determine resource allocation. It also recommended introducing policies to boost domestic demand. Profit margins in China are at or below the global average for two-thirds of the companies surveyed earlier in the year, according to the paper published Wednesday by the European Chamber of Commerce in China. In August, China filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization over European Union tariffs on electric vehicles made in China. It also launched anti-dumping and subsidies investigations of European dairy products, brandy and pork exports. The tit-for-tat actions have raised fears that a trade war may break out. Many European businesses are deciding that the returns on investments in the world's second-largest economy are not worth the risks, due to issues including China's economic slowdown and a politicized business environment. 'For some European headquarters and shareholders, the risks of investing in China are beginning to outright the returns, a trend that will only intensify if key business concerns are left unaddressed,' Jens Eskelund, president of China's European Union Chamber of Commerce, said in a message at the beginning of the paper. The European Chamber's paper proposes over 1,000 recommendations for China to resolve challenges and problems faced by European businesses operating in the country and boost investor confidence. Among them are calls for China to refrain from punishing companies for the actions of their home governments. Others include ensuring that policy packages for attracting foreign investment are followed by implementation, and refraining from 'erratic policy shifts.' The report also recommended that the EU proactively engage with China and keep its responses 'measured and proportionate' when disagreements arise.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-business-confidence-in-china-is-at-an-all-time-low-report-says-/7779873.html	2024-09-11T05:00:01-07:00	
Wagner lost veteran fighters in Mali ambush, in setback to Russia's Africa campaign	LONDON/DAKAR — Among the dozens of Wagner mercenaries presumed dead after a lethal battle with Tuareg rebels during a desert sandstorm in Mali in July were Russian war veterans who survived tours in Ukraine, Libya and Syria, according to interviews with relatives and a review of social media data. The loss of such experienced fighters exposes dangers faced by Russian mercenary forces working for military juntas, which are struggling to contain separatists and powerful offshoots of Islamic State and Al Qaeda across the arid Sahel region in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. The Mali defeat raises doubts over whether Moscow, which has admitted funding Wagner and has absorbed many of its fighters into a defense ministry force, will do better than Western and U.N. troops recently expelled by the juntas, six officials and experts who work in the region said. By cross-referencing public information with online posts from relatives and fighters, speaking to seven relatives and using facial recognition software to analyze battlefield footage verified by Reuters, the news agency was able to identify 23 fighters missing in action and two others taken into Tuareg captivity after the ambush near Tinzaouaten, a town on the Algerian border. Several of the men had survived the siege of Bakhmut in Ukraine, which Wagner's late founder Yevgeny Prigozhin called a 'meat grinder.' Others had served in Libya, Syria and elsewhere. Some were former Russian soldiers, at least one of whom had retired after a full-length army career. Grisly footage of dead fighters has now circulated online, and some of relatives told Reuters the bodies of their husbands and sons had been abandoned in the desert. Reuters could not confirm how many of the men it identified were dead. Margarita Goncharova said her son, Vadim Evsiukov, 31, was first recruited in prison where he was serving a drug-related sentence in 2022. He rose through the ranks in Ukraine to lead a platoon of 500 men, she said. After coming home, he worked as a tailor but struggled with survivor's guilt and secretly traveled to Africa in April to join his former commander, she said. 'He wanted to fly to Africa many times. I discouraged him as much as I could,' Goncharova said in an interview with Reuters. 'I told him 'fate has given you a once-in-a-million chance. You can start your life again; you've won such a crazy lottery'.' The Russian Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Wagner did not respond to requests for comment for this story. After Prigozhin died in August last year, Wagner employees were invited to join a newly created group called the Africa Corps, under the defense ministry, 'to fight for justice and the interests of Russia,' according to the Africa Corps channel on social-media platform Telegram. On the channel, Africa Corps says about half its personnel are former Wagner employees who it allows to use Wagner insignia. Wagner's social media channels remain active. The Russian government has not publicly commented on the Tinzaouaten battle. Mali's armed forces-led government said the defeat had no impact on its goals. The Malian Armed Forces 'are committed to restoring the authority of the state throughout the country,' army spokesman Colonel Major Souleymane Dembele told Reuters. Wagner has acknowledged heavy losses in the Mali ambush but gave no figure. The Malian army, which fought alongside the Russians, also did not give a toll. Tuareg rebels, who are fighting for an independent homeland, said they had killed 84 Russians and 47 Malians. Reuters could not independently establish how many were killed in battle. One video, out of more than 20 sent to Reuters by a Tuareg rebel spokesman, showed at least 47 bodies, mostly white men, in military-style uniforms lying in the desert. Reuters verified the location and date of the video. Mikhail Zvinchuk, a prominent blogger close to the Russian defense ministry, said on social media platform RuTube in August that the defeat showed Wagner fighters who arrived from Ukraine had underestimated the rebels and the Al Qaeda fighters. Missing in action Wagner-linked Telegram accounts named two of the dead as Nikita Fedyakin, the administrator of The Grey Zone, a popular Wagner-focused Telegram channel with over half a million subscribers, and Sergei Shevchenko, who the accounts described as the unit commander. Reuters could not verify the identity of Shevchenko. Reuters separately identified 23 Wagner operators missing in Mali via relatives who posted in an official Wagner Telegram chat group, checking the names against social media accounts, publicly available data and facial recognition software. All the relatives received calls from Wagner recruiters on Aug. 6 to notify them their men were missing in action, they said in the chat group. Lyubov Bazhenova told Reuters she had no idea her son Vladimir Akimov, 25, who had briefly served in Russia's elite airborne forces as a conscript, had signed up. She was angry with Wagner for sharing no further information about his fate or the whereabouts of his body. She said letters to the prosecutor's office, defense ministry and foreign ministry had gone unanswered. Facial-recognition software was used to identify another two men captured by Tuareg fighters, based on photographs and videos of the ambush site published by Tuareg sources. The Tuareg rebels posted videos and photos of the two captives on social media. Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane, a spokesman for the rebel alliance, confirmed the men were in rebel captivity as of late August. One of the missing fighters, Alexei Kuzekmaev, 47, had no military experience, his wife Lyudmila Kuzekmaeva told Reuters. 'Neither my hysterics, nor tears, nor persuasion - nothing helped. He just confronted me a month before he left home. He said 'I bought a ticket and will be leaving.'' Among the most experienced men was Alexander Lazarev, 48, a Russian army veteran who served in wars against Chechen separatists in the 1990s and 2000s, according to his wife's posts in the Wagner channel. She declined to comment. Lazarev appears in many photos on the Russian Facebook equivalent VKontakte wearing military uniform, with symbols linked to several army subdivisions. Parastatal mercenary force Democratic governments in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger were overthrown since 2020 in a series of coups driven by anger with corrupt leaders and a near decade of failed Western efforts to fight insurgencies that have killed thousands and displaced millions. The military juntas have kicked out French and U.S. troops and U.N. peacekeepers. In Africa, Wagner emerged in Sudan in 2017 as the deniable face of Russian operations. Its enterprises soon ranged from protecting African coup leaders to gold mining and fighting jihadists. Wagner is also active in Central African Republic. It first appeared in Mali in late 2021. Wagner's fortunes rose and fell last year. In May, the group led Russia to its first significant Ukrainian battlefield victory in almost a year with the capture of Bakhmut. But after his criticism of Russian military leaders and his effort to lead a rebellion weeks after the Bakhmut victory, Prigozhin died in a fiery plane crash in August. The Kremlin has rejected as an 'absolute lie' U.S. officials' claim that Putin had Prigozhin killed. Eric Whitaker, the top U.S. envoy to Burkina Faso until retiring in June, who previously served in Niger, Mali and Chad, said the Putin administration has achieved complete control over the Wagner brand in the post-Prigozhin era. 'Africa Corps earns (the Russian government) hard-currency payments from host governments for its services and also gains a significant sources of revenue from gold derived from its activities in the Sahel,' he said. Russian mercenary activity soared in Mali after Africa Corps was formed, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a U.S.-based crisis-monitoring group. Based on media reports and social media documenting, the data shows violent events linked to Russian mercenaries rose 81% and reported civilian fatalities rose 65% over the past year, compared to the year before Prigozhin's death. Wagner does not publish recruitment figures. Jędrzej Czerep, an analyst at Warsaw-based think tank Polish Institute of International Affairs, estimated that around 6,000 Russian mercenaries serve in Africa, while three diplomatic sources said about 1,500-2,000 were in Mali. 'When Africa Corps started to promote and recruit, they were flooded with applications,' said Czerep. 'Being sent to one of the African missions was seen as far safer than Ukraine,' he said. Tuareg spokesman Ramadane said the rebel alliance was preparing for more clashes. Further losses could eventually drive Russia out, said Tibor Nagy, the top U.S. envoy to Africa in 2019, when Wagner withdrew from northern Mozambique months after around a dozen of its men were killed during a conflict with an Islamic State affiliate. 'They were out of there very quickly,' said Nagy. Wagner has not publicly commented on its plans in Mali.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wagner-lost-veteran-fighters-in-mali-ambush-in-setback-to-russia-s-africa-campaign-/7779865.html	2024-09-11T04:49:18-07:00	
China, Philippines to discuss South China Sea dispute amid clashes	Taipei, Taiwan — As China is set to host bilateral talks with the Philippines this month, their South China Sea dispute is expanding from sea to air, increasing the risk of military confrontation, analysts warn. The Chinese Communist Party’s People’s Daily newspaper on Monday published an article warning that 'China-Philippines relations stand at a crossroads' over the South China Sea dispute. The warning came after Filipino Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo told reporters at a diplomatic reception on September 4 that Beijing will host the next round of the Bilateral Consultative Mechanism meetings designed to manage differences between the two countries. Manalo did not say on which date the talks would start this month but expressed hope the two countries would discuss an incident in late August when coast guard ships from both sides collided at a disputed shoal. Both countries blame the other for the collision, though video released by the Philippine coast guard appears to show the Chinese coast guard ship ramming their vessel, BRP Teresa Magbanua. It was the second such collision of their coast guard ships in August at the disputed atoll. Vincent Kyle Parada, a former defense analyst for the Philippine Navy and a graduate student at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, says the frequency of the sea clashes is pushing the two sides to expand their operations to the air. 'Over the past few weeks, China has been actively working to disrupt resupply missions to the ship and crew, to the point that after one such failed attempt, the Philippine government announced that essential supplies reached critical levels,' he told VOA Mandarin. 'Manila did manage to resupply BRP Teresa Magbanua through a helicopter, signaling this potential shift.' Parada added, 'This potential shift from maritime to aerial resupply emissions in the future is obviously a risk because China has also been escalating aerial operations in the South China Sea. 'Beijing would increase its aerial presence in the Spratlys and send fighter jets to its artificial islands for extended deployments. I think the goal there really would be to make aerial resupply emissions an incredibly dangerous policy option for Manila. That way, it limits Manila's ability to sustain a long-term presence in the disputed territories.' According to the latest data from the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, the administration of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has lodged 176 diplomatic protests with the Chinese government, which claims almost the entire South China Sea, putting it in conflict with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and researcher at Xuanyuan (Hong Kong) Science and Technology Exchange Center, says any Chinese military moves in the airspace over the South China Sea are due to what he calls 'illegal expansion' by the Philippines. 'Whether it's Scarborough Shoal, Second Thomas Shoal or Sabina Shoal, these are all China's sovereign territories,' he told VOA Mandarin, repeating Beijing’s claims. 'If the Philippines wants to conduct patrols or resupply by air, this in itself is violating the security of China's airspace, and China will inevitably take certain measures to intercept it.' An article published on September 2 by the Beijing-based think tank South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative says since 2024, the Philippines has 'repeatedly dispatched military aircraft to invade the islands and reefs of Spratly Islands and Macclesfield Bank' and also sent military aircraft to carry out airdrops and replenishment missions over the sea, indicating that 'air intrusion is becoming another major path for the Philippines to cause trouble in the South China Sea.' The article warned that if the Philippines insists on carrying out an 'air invasion,' China will have to take corresponding measures, and 'once there is friction or even collision, the consequences will be much more serious than the collision with a ship.' Su Tzu-yun, a research fellow and director at the Division of Defense Strategy and Resources in Taiwan, says China is more likely to take coercive actions in the air, making it difficult for the Philippines to defend its sovereignty. 'China may first take measures to interfere, as it does with the United States and Australian military aircraft, and it will scatter thermal flares to interfere so that Philippine helicopters may not be able to get close,' Su told VOA Mandarin. 'It may use jets to create turbulence, meaning it uses air from the jet tail to interfere with the Philippine helicopter when it’s flying.' Su says Beijing is taking more aggressive interception actions, which greatly increase the risk of accidental conflict. 'The number of Chinese ships has increased. Second, coupled with the previous conflict between China and the Philippines in the sea, which caused injuries to Philippine coast guards, and now it threatens to use stronger means against the Philippine so-called aircraft, so it is moving the definition of gray zone operations closer to the direction of war.' Philippine National Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro in August said the Philippines plans to purchase 40 new multirole fighter jets and mid-range missiles to strengthen its territorial defense, Reuters reported. The U.S. in July repeated its commitment to the Philippines’ security after China’s increasingly assertive actions in the South China Sea. US reiterates 'ironclad' commitment to Philippines amid China actions in South China Sea. Parts of the disputed South China Sea are believed to be rich in oil and gas, and the waters are an important transit point for trillions of dollars in annual shipping. The Hague-based intergovernmental Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016 unanimously ruled that China’s claim to almost all the South China Sea had 'no legal basis,' which Beijing rejected.

Indonesia's dwindling middle class seen dimming economic outlook	KARAWANG, Indonesia — Rahmat Hidayat lost his job when the shoe factory he worked for closed down last year in the industrial town of Karawang in Indonesia's West Java. The 44-year-old now earns less than half of what he used to make by selling grilled meatballs. Unable to afford his wife's diabetes medication, Rahmat picks herbs to make a tonic instead. Like Rahmat, millions of working to middle class Indonesians have become poorer, largely due to an increase in layoffs and a drop in the number of job opportunities since the pandemic. This trend bodes ill for the outlook for Southeast Asia's biggest economy — household consumption accounts for over half of gross domestic product — as well as the widely held investment thesis that an expanding middle class will drive Indonesia's ambition to become a high-income nation by 2045. It also poses a challenge for the incoming administration of President Prabowo Subianto, who won a February election by a landslide on promises to boost economic growth and create 19 million of jobs. Prabowo takes office on Oct. 20. 'Pushing the economy to grow higher with weak consumption is difficult,' said Mohammad Faisal, an economist at the Jakarta-based Center of Reform on Economics. The government classifies those who spend between $132 to $643 a month as middle class, based on a World Bank criteria. This group is key to economic growth as their spending accounts for nearly 40% of private consumption, and more than 80% if combined with the aspiring middle class, who spend $57 to $132. The size of the middle class, however, has dropped from 21.5% of the total population in 2019 to 17.1% in 2024, according to official data released last month. Even though Indonesia's economy has bounced back after the pandemic, with growth of around above 5% a year since 2022 amid generally low inflation, this shrinking middle class is likely to pressure future growth, as the government will have to contend with lower tax revenues and a possibly more subsidies, said Jahen Rezki, an analyst from the University of Indonesia. 'In the long run, if the middle class dwindles, it will certainly be a big burden for the state,' he said. Big state spending One of the main reasons for the demise of the middle class is the changing labour market. A large portion of the foreign investment coming into Indonesia has targeted industries such as mining, which are becoming much less labour intensive as more cutting-edge technology is deployed. Also, stronger competition from lower cost destinations such as China, especially in the textile sector, has squeezed factories, leading to lay offs that the textile association said were the worst in the last decade. Prabowo's brother and adviser Hashim Djojohadikusumo said the incoming government will help the middle class by creating millions of new jobs from projects like the $28 billion free meals programme and the building of millions of homes. 'We want to create a lot of small, medium and micro entrepreneurs, for example through our housing program. We want to build 3 million units of houses, in villages and cities. That's to create middle class,' he told Reuters recently. However, how much the next government is able to spend on welfare schemes might be limited, especially next year when a large amount of government debt is due to mature, said Teguh Yudo Wicaksono, an economist at Islam Internasional Indonesia University. For former factory worker Rahmat, the best help the government can give is a handout he can use to expand his food business, as it has become increasingly difficult to find a job. His wife Fatimah said her children often ask for their favorite spicy meat dish, but she can only afford to feed them instant noodles with eggs most of the time. 'I could only tell my kids to please wait until dad got his fair compensation from the factory, we will cook a delicious meal again,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-dwindling-middle-class-seen-dimming-economic-outlook-/7779794.html	2024-09-11T03:29:30-07:00	
Hurricane Francine takes aim at Louisiana coast	BATON ROUGE, La. — Hurricane Francine barreled early Wednesday toward Louisiana and is expected to make landfall in coming hours as forecasters raised threats of potentially deadly storm surge, widespread flooding and destructive winds on the northern U.S. Gulf coast. Francine drew fuel from exceedingly warm Gulf of Mexico waters to jump from a tropical storm to a Category 1 hurricane on Tuesday night. The National Hurricane Center said Francine might even reach Category 2 strength with winds of 155 to 175 kph before crashing into a fragile coastal region that still hasn't fully recovered from a series of devastating hurricanes since 2020. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry warned at midday Tuesday — when Francine was still a tropical storm — that residents around south Louisiana and in the heavily populated state capital of Baton Rouge and nearby New Orleans — should 'batten down all the hatches' and finish last preparations before a 24-hour window to do so closed. Once Francine makes landfall, Landry said, residents should stay in place rather than venture out into waterlogged roads and risk blocking first responders or utility crews working to repair power lines. The governor said the Louisiana National Guard is being deployed to parishes that could be impacted by Francine. They are equipped with food, water, nearly 400 high-water vehicles, about 100 boats and 50 helicopters to respond to the storm, including possible search-and-rescue operations. Francine was centered Wednesday morning about 395 kilometers southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana, and was moving northeast at 17 kph with maximum sustained winds of 90 150 kmh, the Miami-based hurricane center said. Some additional strengthening is expected Wednesday morning and then Francine is expected to weaken quickly after it moves inland. A hurricane warning was in effect along the Louisiana coast from Cameron eastward to Grand Isle, about 80 kilometers south of New Orleans, according to the center. A storm surge warning stretched from the Mississippi-Alabama border to the Alabama-Florida border Such a warning means there's a chance of life-threatening flooding. In downtown New Orleans, cars and trucks were lined up for blocks on Tuesday to collect sandbags from the parking lot of a local YMCA. CEO Erika Mann said Tuesday that 1,000 bags of sand had already been distributed by volunteers later in the day to people hoping to protect homes from possible flooding. One resident picking up sandbags was Wayne Grant, 33, who moved to New Orleans last year and was nervous for his first potential hurricane in the city. The low-lying rental apartment he shares with his partner had already flooded out in a storm the year before and he was not taking any chances this time around. 'It was like a kick in the face, we've been trying to stay up on the weather ever since,' Grant said. 'We're super invested in the place, even though it's not ours.' Francine is the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. There's a danger of life-threatening storm surge as well as damaging hurricane-force winds, said Brad Reinhart, a senior hurricane specialist at the hurricane center. There's also the potential for 10 to 20 centimeters of rain with the possibility of 30 centimeters locally across much of Louisiana and Mississippi through Friday morning, Reinhart said. The hurricane center said parts of Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle were at risk of 'considerable' flash and urban flooding starting Wednesday, followed by a threat of possible flooding later in the week into the lower Mississippi Valley and lower Tennessee Valley as the soggy remnants of Francine sweep inland. Francine is taking aim at a Louisiana coastline that has yet to fully recover since hurricanes Laura and Delta decimated Lake Charles in 2020, followed a year later by Hurricane Ida. A little over three years after Ida trashed his home in the Dulac community of coastal Louisiana's Terrebonne Parish – and about a month after he finished rebuilding – Coy Verdin was preparing for another hurricane. 'We had to gut the whole house,' he recalled in a telephone interview, rattling off a memorized inventory of the work, including a new roof and new windows. Verdin, 55, strongly considered moving farther inland, away from the home where he makes his living on nearby Bayou Grand Caillou. After rebuilding, he said he's there to stay. 'As long as I can. It's getting rough, though,' he said. Francine's storm surge on the Louisiana coast could reach as much as 3 meters from Cameron to Port Fourchon and into Vermilion Bay, forecasters said. They said landfall was likely somewhere between Sabine Pass — on the Texas-Louisiana line — and Morgan City, Louisiana, about 350 kilometers to the east.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-francine-takes-aim-at-louisiana-coast/7779769.html	2024-09-11T02:49:33-07:00

Vietnam's export hub factories may face weeks of disruption after Typhoon Yagi	HANOI, VIETNAM — Typhoon Yagi severely damaged a large number of factories and flooded warehouses in northern Vietnam's export-oriented industrial hubs, forcing plants to shut, with some expected to take weeks to resume full operations, executives said. The typhoon, the strongest in Asia this year, made landfall in Vietnam's northern coast on Saturday and was still causing deadly floods and landslides on Wednesday, killing dozens and ravaging key infrastructure, including power networks and roads. The disruptions could affect global supply chains as Vietnam hosts large operations of multinationals that mostly export their products to the United States, Europe and other developed countries. In the coastal city of Haiphong, one of the areas worst hit by the typhoon, 95% of businesses were expected to resume some activities on Tuesday, the body managing Haiphong industrial zones said on its website. 'Many businesses had their roofs blown off, some walls were torn and collapsed, gates, fences, signs, camera systems, garages and sliding metal doors were overturned, water flooded into factories,' said a report on its website. In the DEEP C industrial zones, which host factories in Haiphong and the neighboring province of Quang Ninh, 20 out of 150 investors' plants will be out of service for at least a few weeks, said Bruno Jaspaert, head of DEEP C industrial zones. Based on a review of his clients, he expected power consumption at those facilities would remain one-third below normal for weeks or months because many companies were busy rebuilding their damaged factories. Goods ready for export or delivery to clients were flooded in warehouses in the area, companies said. In another industrial park in Haiphong, South Korea's LG Electronics said it had partly resumed work on Tuesday, although the factory's walls were crushed on Saturday and a warehouse with refrigerators and washing machines had been flooded. 'Many of them are gone with the wind,' said Calvin Nguyen, head of Vietnamese logistics firm WeDo Forwarding Co., referring to products that were to be delivered to the United States and the European Union, without specifying which goods. The company's three warehouses in Haiphong had their roofs blown off and on Wednesday were still flooded, he said. The industry ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Power cuts Power outages were still affecting several areas in the north, as Vietnam's state-owned power distributor EVN worked to restore dozens of damaged electricity lines. In Quang Ninh, along the coast north of Haiphong, many factories still had no electricity or water service, Jaspaert said. Chinese solar panel maker Jinko Solar's factory in Quang Ninh was severely damaged, one of its workers said, noting on Tuesday work had not resumed as windows had been smashed and the roof had been blown away. Jinko was not immediately available for a comment. Far from the coast, the industrial hubs of Thai Nguyen and Bac Giang which host large factories of multinationals such as Samsung Electronics and Apple supplier Foxconn were also facing severe flooding. Samsung's large facilities in Thai Nguyen had not been visibly affected on Tuesday evening, according to a Reuters witness. Water was receding on Wednesday in the province, about 60 kilometers north of Hanoi, but more rain was expected.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-s-export-hub-factories-may-face-weeks-of-disruption-after-typhoon-yagi/7779700.html	2024-09-10T22:58:27-07:00	
Pope Francis’ visit puts Indonesia’s religious freedom under spotlight	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — During his three-day visit to Indonesia last week, Pope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church, urged Indonesians to live up to the promise represented by the nation’s own motto — 'Unity in Diversity.' While praising Indonesia’s constitution, which guarantees religious freedom, Francis also warned in an address following a meeting with President Joko Widodo that the diversity of the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation can also lead to conflict. Francis emphasized the importance of interfaith dialogue to eliminate prejudices and build mutual respect. 'This is indispensable for meeting common challenges, including that of countering extremism and intolerance, which through the distortion of religion attempt to improve their views by using deception and violence,' Francis said. Indonesia’s statistical agency says that 87% of the country’s 280 million people are Muslim. However, 2.9% of the total population is Catholic, making its Christian community the third largest in Asia after the Philippines and China. Indonesia’s struggle against religious intolerance Despite legal guarantees of religious freedom, which includes a Religious Harmony bill signed into law in 2006, research by Human Rights Watch indicates a flare-up of religious intolerance. Examples include the imprisonment of Jakarta’s Christian governor for blasphemy in 2016, violence against religious minorities; and problems faced by some Christian groups seeking to secure building permits for churches. Novi from Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, a Catholic, who traveled to Jakarta to witness Pope Francis' visit to Istiqlal Mosque, hopes the visit can encourage a revival of religious tolerance in the country. 'I’m really sad when I hear news reports saying that churches faced difficulties in setting up a church and require approval of the majority from the surrounding community and municipal and provincial office,' she said. In 2006, a group of religious and community leaders established the Religious Harmony Forum (FKUB), dedicated to protecting religious harmony, including making recommendations to the mayor or regent on the construction of any new house of worship. But according to Andreas Harsono, a senior Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch, the forum has been politicized over the years. In hopes of quelling religious intolerance, Minister of Religious Affairs Yaqut Cholil Qoumas said a new presidential regulation is being developed that will no longer allow the FKUB to recommend the establishment of a house of worship. That right will remain with the Ministry of Religious Affairs. Andreas Harsono of the Human Rights Watch sees this as a 'step in the right direction.' 'The FKUB recommendations are proven to be the most damaging of the 2006 regulations on religious harmony. The religious harmony regulation basically makes the so-called majority have veto power over the minorities in Indonesia. It's turning Indonesia into an intolerant Muslim-majority country,' he said. Halili Hasan, executive director of the SETARA Institute, agrees with abolishing the FKUB’s right to recommend. He added that FKUB has not been able to prevent and handle various violations of freedom of religion and belief. SETARA Institute is a think tank that advocates for democracy and human rights in Indonesia and releases an annual report on the condition of freedom of religion and belief. The report in 2023 listed at least 65 places of worship that experienced disturbances throughout that year, ranging from objections to the construction of a house of worship to the sealing off of places of worship. That compares to 50 such incidents in the previous year. Still, the Ministry of Religious Affair’s Religious Harmony Index survey for 2023 found a steady increase in religious harmony from 2020 to 2023. The index was scored from 0 to 100, with 100 being the most harmonious. The national score for 2023 was 76.02, the highest score recorded in the last five years. Eli Trisiana is a Muslim and government civil servant who came to see Pope Francis. 'We need to hold a heart-to-heart dialogue with those deemed religious intolerant,’’ Eli Trisiana said. ‘’We cannot deal with them using violence. I think that is the best method to solve differences of opinion. In Islam there are verses taught to us that reconcile with non-believers, which is 'unto you your religion and unto me my religion.' Interfaith dialogue During an interfaith dialogue at Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta, 87-year-old Pope Francis met with representatives of Indonesia’s six officially recognized religions — Islam, Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Protestantism and Catholicism — along with a representative for traditional beliefs. Francis and the grand imam of the Istiqlal Mosque, Nasaruddin Umar, signed a 'Human Fraternity' document declaring their commitment to interfaith harmony. The document calls for religious leaders to overcome two serious crises faced by the world: dehumanization and climate change. The grand imam said he won’t let this signing be in vain and that he plans to follow up with a future plan of action that supports interfaith dialogue and true religious harmony.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-visit-puts-indonesia-s-religious-freedom-under-spotlight/7779698.html	2024-09-10T22:51:59-07:00	
Iran president heads to Iraq on first foreign visit	Tehran, Ian — Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, is to visit neighboring Iraq on Wednesday as he moves to deepen already close ties on his first foreign visit since taking office. Pezeshkian has vowed to make relations with neighboring countries a priority as he seeks to ease Iran's international isolation and mitigate the impact of U.S.-led sanctions on its economy. His visit comes after Western powers on Tuesday announced fresh sanctions on Iran for supplying Russia with short-range missiles for use against Ukraine. It also comes amid turmoil in the Middle East sparked by the war in Gaza, which has drawn in Iran-backed armed groups around the region and complicated Baghdad's ties with Washington. On Tuesday night, an explosion was heard at the base of a U.S.-led anti-militant coalition at the Baghdad international airport, according to Iraqi security officials. A spokesperson for the Iranian-backed Ketaeb Hezbollah (Hezbollah Brigades) in Iraq said the Tuesday night attack aimed to 'disrupt the Iranian president's visit to Baghdad.' Ties between Iran and Iraq, both Shiite-majority countries, have grown closer since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 toppled the Sunni-dominated regime of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Pezeshkian has directly linked shoring up ties to sanctions pressure. 'Relations with neighboring countries ... can neutralize a significant amount of pressure of the sanctions,' he said last month. Iran has suffered years of crippling Western sanctions, especially after its arch-foe the United States, under then-president Donald Trump, unilaterally abandoned a landmark nuclear deal between the Islamic republic and major powers in 2018. Pezeshkian, who assumed the presidency in late July, has made the top diplomat who negotiated the 2015 deal, Mohammad Javad Zarif, his vice president for strategic affairs as part of his bid for a more open Iran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-president-heads-to-iraq-on-first-foreign-visit/7779694.html	2024-09-10T22:36:47-07:00	
Top takeaways from the Harris-Trump debate	WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off on Tuesday night in Philadelphia in a debate that comes less than two months before the presidential election. The race is tight between the two candidates. Among registered voters, Harris leads Trump by 1 point — 49% to 48% — according to the latest PBS/NPR/Marist poll. That result falls within the margin of error. The ABC debate marks the first face-to-face meeting between Harris, 59, and Trump, 78. A former prosecutor, Harris is the first woman, Black American and South Asian American vice president. Trump, a businessman who has been criticized for his sexist and racist remarks, is the first convicted felon to run for president and, if elected, would be 82 by the end of his term. During what could be their only debate, Harris and Trump sparred on issues ranging from the economy and immigration to democracy, abortion and the Israel-Hamas war. Here are some of the key takeaways from the debate. Economy The economy was the debate’s first topic, with Harris saying she wants to create an 'opportunity economy.' She cited her plan to increase the tax credit for starting new small businesses from $5,000 to $50,000. 'I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class,' she said, adding that Trump wants to help the rich with tax cuts. Trump has said he will further reduce the corporate tax rate from the current 21% to 15%. Harris wants to increase the rate to 28%. It was 35% before Trump’s 2017 tax bill. Trump spent much of his answer on the economy talking about immigration. However, he also said he created one of the best economies in the United States, without offering specifics, and that he will do it again. 'Look, we’ve had a terrible economy, because inflation, which is really known as a country buster,' Trump said. Immigration Immigration has been one of the biggest issues in this presidential campaign. Throughout the debate, Trump lambasted the Biden administration’s handling of immigration – often when the moderators asked questions unrelated to immigration. Trump repeated his false claims that immigrants are 'taking over the towns. They’re taking over buildings. They’re going in violently.' He also cited baseless conspiracy theories about Haitian immigrants in Ohio eating pet dogs and cats. Harris criticized Trump for killing a bipartisan bill earlier this year that would have put 1,500 more border agents on the U.S. southern border. Harris has said she would support the bill. Abortion Trump and Harris grew increasingly combative when debating the question of abortion. As president, Trump appointed three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. That decision laid the groundwork for states to impose restrictive rules on abortion around the country. 'The Supreme Court had great courage in doing it,' Trump said during the debate. When asked if he would support a national abortion ban, he said: 'No, I’m not in favor of abortion ban. But it doesn't matter because this issue has now been taken over by the states.' He also said he would not oppose abortion in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at risk. He also falsely claimed that Democrats support abortions 'after birth.' In response, Harris emphasized the importance of women’s reproductive rights. 'One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,' she said. She added that she would support Congress passing a bill to codify federal abortion protections and, as president, sign it into law. Rule of law, threats to democracy and Jan. 6 Harris was a prosecutor for a dozen years, first as San Francisco district attorney and then as California’s attorney general. A central component of Harris’ campaign has been portraying Trump as a threat to democracy. During the debate, Harris highlighted Trump’s status as a convicted felon. Trump replied with the unsubstantiated accusation that Harris and the Biden administration are 'weaponizing' the government to prosecute him When asked by the moderator whether Trump would acknowledge that he lost the 2020 presidential election, he replied with the false claim that he actually won the election. On the Jan. 6 insurrection, Trump said, 'I had nothing to do with that, other than they asked me to make a speech.' 'It’s time to turn the page,' Harris said. 'There is a place in our campaign for you to stand for our country, to stand for democracy, to stand for rule of law and to end the chaos and to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy,' she added. Russia-Ukraine War and Israel-Hamas War In addition to domestic policy, the moderators also pressed Harris and Trump on foreign policy issues, including the ongoing wars between Ukraine and Russia, and Israel and Hamas. On the Israel-Hamas war, Harris said the United States would defend Israel. She added that she supports a two-state solution. The war 'must end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal, and we need the hostages out,' Harris said. Trump claimed that 'Israel will be gone' if Harris becomes president, which is unsubstantiated. Trump also repeated his claim that the Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas in southern Israel would have never happened if he were president. Trump said the Russia-Ukraine war would not have happened if he were president. When asked if he wants Ukraine to win the war against Russia, Trump would only say, 'I want the war to stop.' Harris replied: 'If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-takeaways-from-the-harris-trump-debate-/7779682.html	2024-09-10T21:51:14-07:00	
Arrested Nigerian workers' union leader freed	Abuja, Nigeria — The Nigerian secret police released labor union leader Joe Ajaero on Tuesday after hours of interrogation over alleged terrorism financing. Ajaero's arrest Monday sparked criticism about what critics see as a government crackdown on dissent. Ajaero, was released by the Department of State Services, or DSS, after he was arrested at the Abuja airport while on his way to the United Kingdom to attend a labor conference. He said Tuesday that DSS kept his passport. He said the police questioned him for hours about alleged terrorism financing involving British national Andrew Wynne and last month's anti-government protests in Nigeria. Ajaero is a prominent critic of the Nigerian government and has led many demonstrations to denounce reforms introduced by President Bola Tinubu last year. Hamisu Santuraki, the spokesperson of the United Action Front of Civil Society, a coalition of civil society groups, said the government should have asked Ajaero to come in for questioning. 'It’s not done anywhere — arresting somebody without sending him an invitation, it is wrong, they should've sent him a letter,' Santuraki said. We just want them to release his passport, so we're having a meeting. Nigeria is our country.' Later Tuesday, a government spokesman, Bayo Onanuga, said Ajaero was invited to speak to a law enforcement agency and was stopped from traveling abroad because he 'snubbed' that invitation. In a statement released on X, Onanuga also said Nigeria 'categorically denies any human rights abuse.' Santuraki said the coalition and the Labor Congress are deciding on what steps to take. The Nigerian government is facing a wave of criticism from rights groups who accuse it of trying to stifle dissent and free expression. Investigative journalist Isaac Bristol was recently detained on charges of leaking classified and restricted documents, sedition, and tax evasion, among other allegations. Another journalist, David Hundeyin, was declared wanted by the police last week. Ajaero's arrest came days after he criticized a decision by Nigerian officials to increase the gasoline price by 39 percent. Nigerian authorities said global oil market forces determined the new pump price of refined petrol, which had more than quadrupled in Nigeria since President Tinubu scrapped fuel subsidies last year. On Monday, the Socio-Economic Rights Accountability Project, or SERAP, said state operatives also raided their offices. The group this week called for a probe of the national oil company. 'We consider this an act of aggression, intimidation and harassment by the government, and it might not be unconnected with the statement that SERAP had issued over the weekend calling on the president to direct the NNPC to reverse the price of petroleum,' said Kolawole Oluwadare, a deputy director at SERAP. 'We consider this as an instance of the escalation of attacks against the civic space and this of course is not acceptable in a democracy.' Ajaero was also arrested in November by police in southeastern Imo state, moments before he was to lead a rally.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arrested-nigerian-workers-union-leader-freed/7779664.html	2024-09-10T21:17:07-07:00	
Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris for president after debate ends	WASHINGTON — Taylor Swift, one of the music industry's biggest stars, endorsed Kamala Harris for president shortly after the debate ended on Tuesday night. 'I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,' Swift wrote in an Instagram post, which included a link to a voter registration website. Swift has a dedicated following among young women, a key demographic in the November election, and her latest tour has generated more than $1 billion in ticket sales. In a half hour, the post received more than 2.3 million likes. She included a picture of herself holding her cat Benjamin Button, and she signed the message 'Childless Cat Lady.' The remark is a reference to 3-year-old comments made by JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, about women without children not having an equal stake in the country's future. A Harris senior campaign official said the endorsement was not coordinated with the campaign. Tim Walz, Harris' running mate, appeared to learn about the endorsement in the middle of a live interview on MSNBC. As Rachel Maddow read the text, Walz broke into a smile and patted his chest. 'That was eloquent. And it was clear,' Walz said. 'And that's the kind of courage we need in America to stand up.' Swift wrote that her endorsement was partially prompted by Trump's decision to post AI-generated pictures suggesting that she had endorsed him. One showed Swift dressed as Uncle Sam, and the text said, 'Taylor wants YOU to VOTE for DONALD TRUMP.' Trump's posts 'brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,' Swift wrote. She added that 'I've done my research, and I've made my choice.' The Trump campaign dismissed Swift's endorsement. 'This is further evidence that the Democrat Party has unfortunately become a party of the wealthy elites,' said spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. 'There's many Swifties for Trump out there in America,' she said, herself included. Swift's endorsement was not exactly a surprise. In 2020, she supported President Joe Biden, and she cheered for Harris in her debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence. She also was openly critical of Trump, saying he had stoked 'the fires of white supremacy and racism.' Swift is a popular figure nationwide, but especially among Democrats. An October 2023 Fox News poll found that 55% of voters overall, including 68% of Democrats, said they had a favorable view of Swift. Republicans were divided, with 43% having a favorable opinion and 45% an unfavorable one. AP VoteCast suggests that a partisan divide on Swift was apparent as early as 2018. That's the year Swift made her first political endorsement, supporting Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen for Senate over Republican Marsha Blackburn. VoteCast found that among Tennessee voters that year, 55% of Democrats and just 19% of Republicans said they had a favorable opinion of Swift. Blackburn won by a comfortable margin in the deep red state. Swift is the leading nominee at Wednesday's MTV Video Music Awards. While it's unclear whether Swift will attend the show in New York, she could use any acceptance speeches to elaborate on her support of Harris.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-for-president-after-debate-ends/7779656.html	2024-09-10T21:00:13-07:00	
Vietnam death toll from Typhoon Yagi at 141 as Hanoi faces flood risk	HANOI, Vietnam — The death toll in Vietnam from Typhoon Yagi has risen to 141, the government said on Wednesday as it warned that flood waters were causing the Red River to rise rapidly and threaten to inundate downtown districts of the capital Hanoi. Heavy rains brought by Typhoon Yagi have triggered deadly landslides and floods throughout northern Vietnam, killing 141 people with 59 others missing, the disaster management agency said. There has also been severe property damage and disruption to business and industry. State media reports late on Tuesday said the water level of the Red River in Hanoi had been rising 10 centimeters every hour. Some schools in Hanoi have told students to stay home for the rest of the week due to flood concerns, while thousands of residents living in low-lying areas have been evacuated, according to sources, government and state media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-death-toll-from-typhoon-yagi-at-141-as-hanoi-faces-flood-risk/7779648.html	2024-09-10T20:38:11-07:00	
US, UK top diplomats head to Ukraine with eye on weapons	Przemysl, Poland — The top U.S. and British diplomats headed together into Ukraine on Wednesday to discuss further easing rules on firing Western weapons into Russia, whose alleged acquisition of Iranian missiles has raised new fears. In a rare joint trip, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was taking the train to Kyiv with Foreign Secretary David Lammy, whose 2-month-old Labor government has vowed to keep up Britain's role as a key defender of Ukraine. The pair, who boarded the train early Wednesday at the Polish border town of Przemysl, are expected to meet in Kyiv with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has kept pressing the West for weapons with more firepower and fewer restrictions. U.S. President Joe Biden, asked in Washington whether he would let Ukraine use longer-range weapons, said: 'We're working that out right now.' Biden, while strongly supportive of Ukraine, has previously made clear he wants to avoid devolving into direct conflict between the United States and Russia, the world's two leading nuclear powers. Blinken, speaking Tuesday in London alongside Lammy, said the United States was committed to providing Ukraine 'what they need when they need it to be most effective in dealing with the Russian aggression.' But Blinken, who is on his fifth trip to Kyiv since the war, said it was also important to see if Ukrainian forces could maintain and operate particular weaponry. Pressed later in an interview with Sky News on whether the United States would green-light long-range weapons, Blinken said, 'We never rule out, but when we rule in, we want to make sure it's done in such a way that it can advance what the Ukrainians are trying to achieve.' The renewed talk about long-range weapons comes after the United States said that Iran has sent short-range missiles to Russia, which could strike Ukraine with them within weeks. The Iranian shipments have raised fears that Moscow would be freed up to use its long-range missiles against comparatively unscathed areas in western Ukraine. Western powers announced new sanctions against Iran's clerical state over the sale, which defied repeated warnings. The United States earlier this year gave its blessing for Ukraine to use Western weapons to hit Russian forces when in direct conflict across the border. But Ukraine last month launched a surprise, daring offensive directly into Russian territory in Kursk, hoping to restore morale and divert Moscow as Russian troops trudge forward in the front lines of eastern Ukraine. British media reports said Biden, who meets Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday, was set to end objections to letting Ukraine fire long-range Storm Shadow missiles into Russia. Britain has repeatedly pushed the United States, by far Ukraine's biggest military supplier, to be more forward on weapons. One key ask of Ukraine is to loosen restrictions on U.S.-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, which can hit targets up to 300 kilometers away. In a joint letter to Biden, leading members of Congress from the rival Republican Party asked him to act on ATACMS immediately. 'As long as it is conducting its brutal, full-scale war of aggression, Russia must not be given a sanctuary from which it can execute its war crimes against Ukraine with impunity,' said the letter signed by Representative Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Republicans, however, are deeply divided over Ukraine, and a victory in November by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump over Biden's political heir Kamala Harris could dramatically shift US policy. Trump aides have suggested that if he wins, he would leverage aid to force Kyiv into territorial concessions to Russia to end the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-uk-top-diplomats-head-to-ukraine-with-eye-on-weapons/7779634.html	2024-09-10T20:19:20-07:00	
Tigray leader reports talks with archrival Eritrea	Mekelle/Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — The leader of Tigray People's Liberation Front Debretsion Gebremichael has reported previously undisclosed talks between his region and the leaders of Eritrea. Speaking at a press conference in the regional capital Mekelle, Ethiopia, on Tuesday, Debretsion said the first round of talks took place about six months ago in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. He told reporters that Getachew Reda, the president of the Tigray Interim Regional Administration, represented the TPLF at the talks in Dubai. Without indicating venue and date, Debretsion also said there have been subsequent meetings with the Eritrean leaders after the initial meeting in Dubai. 'This was decided by the TPLF Executive Committee,' he said. 'Accordingly, President Getachew Reda has engaged with Eritrea's leaders. This is something that I know and my party's Executive Committee knows.' He said the talks, which were aimed at creating peace between the two sides, had a positive result. 'The abduction of citizens, looting and other activities by the Eritrean forces has improved and eased as a result,' he said. He said the TPLF party’s intention is to 'make peace with all our neighbors, including the Fano forces and the Eritrean government.' 'Based on this principle, Getachew met with the Eritrean leaders, which is known by the honorable prime minister and my part. But this is for a good cause and for peace,' he said. Debretsion indicated that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been encouraging them to engage in the talks. He adds that Getachew has also briefed the Ethiopian leader about the talks. There has been no immediate reaction from Ethiopia prime minister’s office, Eritrea and from IRA leader Getachew. VOA’s Horn of Africa Service has reached out to the Ethiopia prime minister’s office and government communication service but has not received a response. Also, repeated attempts to get reaction from the Eritrea’s ministry of information were not successful. The governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea were allies during a deadly two-year war in Tigray that killed thousands. Human rights organizations and the United States have accused Eritrean and Ethiopian forces of committing war crimes during the war in Tigray, a charge the two governments denied. In November 2022, the Ethiopian government and TPLF signed the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in Pretoria, South Africa, committing to a permanent ending of fighting. Tigray regional officials allege that Eritrean troops remain in parts of their region despite the Pretoria agreement’s call for the withdrawal of foreign forces. The agreement called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and non-Ethiopian National Defense Forces, referring to the Eritrean forces and Ethiopian militias allied with the Ethiopian government. During his visit to Ethiopia, Hammer will review the implementation of the Pretoria Cessation of Hostilities Agreement on northern Ethiopia with the signatories, the State Department said in a statement. 'The United States remains committed to supporting the Ethiopian government and the Tigray Interim Regional Administration to achieve lasting peace, including through effective disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration for ex-combatants; an orderly and peaceful return of internally displaced persons; and advancing transitional justice and accountability,' the statement read. Hammer will also discuss with Ethiopian officials their efforts to advance dialogue to end violence in the Amhara and Oromia regions, it added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tigray-leader-reports-talks-with-archrival-eritrea/7779628.html	2024-09-10T20:12:08-07:00

China takes lead in critical technology research after 'switching places' with US	SINGAPORE — An Australian think tank that tracks tech competitiveness says China is now the world leader in research on almost 90% of critical technologies. In a newly released report, the research group adds there is also a high risk of Beijing securing a monopoly on defense-related tech, including drones, satellites and collaborative robots — those that can work safely alongside humans. Analysts say the huge leap forward for China is the result of heavy state investment over the past two decades. They add that despite the progress, Beijing is still dependent on other countries for key tech components and lacks self-sufficiency. The report from the government-funded Australian Strategic Policy Institute, or ASPI, released last Thursday, says China led the way in research into 57 out of 64 advanced technologies in the five years from 2019-2023. ASPI's Critical Technology Tracker ranks countries' innovation capabilities based on the number of appearances in the top 10% of research papers. It focuses on crucial technologies from a range of fields including artificial intelligence, biotechnology, cyber and defense. The report found that 'China and the United States have effectively switched places as the overwhelming leader in research in just two decades.' China led in only three of the 64 technologies between 2003 and 2007 but has shot up in the rankings, replacing the U.S., which is now a frontrunner in just seven critical technologies. Josh Kennedy-White is a technology strategist based in Singapore. He says China's huge leap is a 'direct result of its aggressive, state-driven research and development investments over the past two decades.' He adds that the shift toward China is 'particularly stark in fields like artificial intelligence, quantum computing and advanced aircraft engines, where China has transitioned from a laggard to a leader in a relatively short period.' ASPI also determines the risk of countries holding a monopoly on the research of critical technologies. They currently classify 24 technologies as 'high risk' of being monopolized — all by Beijing. Ten technologies are newly classified as 'high risk' this year, with many of them linked to the defense industry. 'The potential monopoly risk in 24 technology areas, especially those in defense-related fields like radars and drones, is concerning in the current and future geopolitical context,' Tobias Feakin, founder of consultancy firm Protostar Strategy, told VOA. Chinese President Xi Jinping has sought to boost his country's advanced manufacturing capabilities with the ambitious 'Made in China 2025' initiative. The policy, launched in 2015, aims to strengthen Beijing's self-reliance in critical sectors and make China a global tech powerhouse. Xi, according to Feakin, views advanced technologies as 'strategic priorities for China's development, national security and global competitiveness.' He adds that technologies are seen as a 'central component of China's long-term economic and geopolitical goals.' Beijing's ambitions are being closely watched in Washington, with the Biden administration working to limit China's access to advanced technology. Last week, the U.S. introduced new export controls on critical technology to China, including chip-making equipment and quantum computers and components. That announcement came shortly after U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan made his first ever visit to Beijing. He met with Xi and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Sullivan told reporters that Washington 'will continue to take necessary action to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine national security.' The continued efforts to curb China's chip industry mean that Beijing must look further afield for advanced technology. 'Even though it leads in areas like artificial intelligence and 5G, China still depends on Taiwan, the U.S. and South Korea to produce high-end semiconductors', Kennedy-White told VOA. Describing this as China's Achilles' heel, Kennedy-White says the lack of self-sufficiency in the semiconductor industry could 'stunt Beijing's progress in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and military applications.' As China continues its dominance in critical technology research, questions have been raised over exactly how the country is making these breakthroughs. Last October, officials from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States) issued a joint statement accusing China of stealing intellectual property. U.S. FBI director Christopher Wray described it as an 'unprecedented threat.' Kennedy-White, managing director of Singapore-based venture catalyst firm DivisionX Global, agrees with this assessment. He says China's jump up the ASPI rankings is 'not entirely organic.' 'There is a correlation between China's rise in certain technologies and allegations of intellectual property theft,' he added. ASPI also recommends ways for other countries to close the gap on China. It advises the AUKUS alliance of Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. to join forces with Japan and South Korea to try to catch up. The report also highlights the emergence of India as a 'key center' of global research innovation and excellence. The South Asian nation now ranks in the top five countries for 45 out of the 64 technologies that are tracked by ASPI. It's a huge gain compared with 2003-2007, when India sat in the top five for only four technologies. Feakin says countries across the Asia-Pacific 'will benefit from leveraging India's growing technology expertise and influence.' It will also provide a counterbalance to 'overdependence on China's technology supply chain,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-takes-lead-in-critical-technology-research-after-switching-places-with-us/7779603.html	2024-09-10T18:50:59-07:00	
Congress bestows highest honor on 13 troops killed during Afghanistan withdrawal	WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday presented Congress' highest honor — the Congressional Gold Medal — to 13 U.S. service members who were killed during the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, even as the politics of a presidential election swirled around the event. Both Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation to posthumously honor the 13 U.S. troops, who were killed along with more than 170 Afghans in a suicide bombing at the Abbey Gate at Kabul's airport in August 2021. President Joe Biden signed the legislation in December 2021. On Tuesday, the top Republican and Democratic leaders for both the House and Senate spoke at a somber ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda, hailing the lives and sacrifices of the service members. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called on the lawmakers gathered to 'ensure the sacrifices of all our servicemembers were not in vain.' 'We must care for them and their families and defend the values of freedom and democracy they so nobly fought for,' said Schumer, a New York Democrat. But rather than a unifying moment, the event took place against the backdrop of a bitter back-and-forth over who is to blame for the rushed and deadly evacuation from Kabul. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican and ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, scheduled the ceremony just hours before the first debate between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. 'They lost their lives because of this administration's catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan,' Johnson said at a news conference minutes before the ceremony. Then as the speaker opened the ceremony, he took another jab at how the Biden administration has defended its handling of the final months of America's longest war. 'To the families who are here, I know many of you have yet to hear these words, so I will say them: we are sorry,' Johnson said. 'The United States government should have done everything to protect our troops, those fallen and wounded at Abbey Gate deserved our best efforts, and the families who have been left to pick up the pieces continue to deserve transparency, appreciation and recognition.' Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee also released a scathing investigation on Sunday into the withdrawal that cast blame on Biden's administration and minimized the role of Trump, who had signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby on Monday criticized the House report as partisan and one-sided and said it revealed little new information and contained several inaccuracies. He noted that evacuation plans had started well before the pullout, and the fall of Kabul 'moved a lot faster than anyone could have anticipated.' He also acknowledged that during the evacuation 'not everything went according to plan. Nothing ever does.' 'We hold ourselves all accountable for that,' he said of the deaths. Top military and White House officials attended the ceremony Tuesday, including Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough and Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown, Jr. the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Pentagon reviews have concluded that the suicide bombing was not preventable and suggestions troops may have seen the would-be bomber were not true. Regardless, Trump has thrust the withdrawal, with the backing from some of the families of the Americans killed, into the center of his campaign. Last month, his political team distributed video of him attending a wreath-laying ceremony for the fallen service members at Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of the bombing, despite the cemetery's prohibition on partisan activity on the grounds as well as an altercation with a cemetery employee who was trying to make sure the campaign followed those rules. Most assessments have concluded Trump and Biden share blame for the disastrous end to the 20-year war, which saw enemy Taliban take over Afghanistan again before the last American troops even flew out of the Kabul airport. Over 2,000 U.S. troops were killed in Afghanistan. The main U.S. government watchdog for the war points to Trump's 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw all U.S. forces and military contractors as 'the single most important factor' in the collapse of U.S.-allied Afghan security forces and Taliban takeover. Biden's April 2021 announcement that he would proceed with the withdrawal set in motion by Trump was the second-biggest factor, the watchdog said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congress-bestows-highest-honor-on-13-troops-killed-during-afghanistan-withdrawal/7779578.html	2024-09-10T17:50:10-07:00

House speaker pushes funding bill that includes proof of citizenship mandate	washington — House Speaker Mike Johnson vowed Tuesday to press ahead with requiring proof of citizenship for new voters as part of a bill to avoid a partial government shutdown in three weeks, though the measure appeared likely to be voted down. Democrats overwhelmingly oppose the measure. Enough Republicans were also coming out against the bill, though for different reasons, that its prospects of passing the House appeared dim. Even if it does pass the House on Wednesday, the bill would go nowhere in the Senate. Johnson said the issue of election security is too critical to ignore, though research has shown that voting by non-citizens is extremely rare. It's also clear that Republicans see value in making House Democrats take another vote on the issue. The House approved a bill with the proof of citizenship mandate back in July 'If you have a few thousand illegals participate in the election in the wrong place, you can change the makeup of Congress and you can affect the presidential election,' Johnson said. 'The American people understand that.' The first test for the stopgap spending bill came Tuesday with a 209-206 vote that kept it moving ahead. But some Republicans who have said they will oppose the bill on final passage allowed it to proceed. The measure includes a six-month extension of federal funding to keep agencies and programs operating through March 28. But Democrats want a shorter-term extension so that the current Congress will set full-year spending levels for fiscal 2025 rather than the next president and Congress. They also want the proof of citizenship mandate stripped out of the bill, saying it's unnecessary because states already have effective safeguards in place to verify voters' eligibility and maintain accurate voter rolls. 'Is it any surprise that the speaker's purely partisan CR seems to be running into trouble?' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, using Washington parlance for the short-term continuing resolution needed to prevent a shutdown. 'The answer is very simple. The House should stop wasting time on a CR proposal that cannot become law.' Schumer called on Johnson to consult with Democratic leaders and the White House on a bipartisan package that can pass both chambers. A few House Republicans have also come out against the bill. Some won't vote for any continuing resolution. They want Congress to return to passing the dozen annual appropriations bills individually. Others say the continuing resolution funds programs at levels they consider inappropriate at a time of nearly $2 trillion annual deficits. 'I'm a firm no on bankrupting the nation and a yes on election integrity,' said Representative Cory Mills in announcing his opposition. Representative Tim Burchett said Republican leadership was asking him to vote for what he called 'a Nancy Pelosi-Schumer budget.' 'I just think that's a bad idea,' Burchett said. Republicans can afford to lose only four votes from their ranks if every Democrat votes against the bill. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday seemingly encouraged a government shutdown if Republicans in the House and Senate 'don't get assurances on Election Security.' He said on the social media platform Truth Social that they should not go forward with a continuing resolution without such assurances. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell disagreed when asked about Trump's post. 'Shutting down the government is always a bad idea, no matter what time of the year it is,' McConnell said. House Republicans met behind closed doors Tuesday morning to discuss the path forward. Representative Jim Jordan, a co-founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told colleagues 'this is the best fight we've ever had,' said Representative Kevin Hern. By holding another vote on the proof of citizenship requirement for voter registration, House Republicans are making Democrats in competitive swing districts take another vote on the issue ahead of the election. Last time, five Democrats sided with Republicans in support of the requirement. And their votes this time will be highly scrutinized. Lawmakers said no plan B was discussed for government funding and that Johnson was determined to hold a vote regardless of the likely outcome. 'This is important to him,' said Representative Ralph Norman.

Questions continue to swirl around China's 'disappeared' foreign minister	washington — More than a year after China's former foreign minister, Qin Gang, disappeared from public view, raising a host of questions, the Chinese government remains silent on his whereabouts. A new report this week from The Washington Post, citing two former U.S. government officials, suggests Qin has been spared any jail time and now is nominally holding a low-ranking position at a publishing house under the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Earlier reports speculated that he was sentenced to life in prison or had died from suicide or torture. Some are skeptical about the Washington Post report, while others see it as evidence of uncertainty and impermanence within the political system directed by the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP. According to Sunday's Washington Post report, Qin, 58, now works, at least on paper, for the World Affairs Press, a state-owned publishing house under the Foreign Ministry. One of the former officials said Qin is 'not going to jail, but his career is over.' Before he disappeared from public view in July of last year, Qin was the youngest foreign minister since the founding of the CCP. A leading theory among Chinese political analysts is that Qin was removed because he had an affair with Fu Xiaotian, a prominent Chinese television journalist, and that the pair had a child born out of wedlock in the United States. Some reports suggested that the Chinese government suspected Fu of sharing state secrets with foreign intelligence agencies, but these rumors have never been confirmed. Like Qin, Fu disappeared from public life for more than a year ago. During a top-level political meeting in July, the Third Plenum of the 20th Central Committee, the CCP agreed to Qin's request that he be removed from his post as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chinese state media reported. That followed an official announcement in February that said Qin had resigned as a parliamentary deputy. A reporter from The Washington Post recently visited the bookstore of the World Affairs Press in Beijing, but employees there told the newspaper that they had not heard that Qin worked at the publishing house. A staff member who answered the phone said she did not know if the news was true. China's Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Some observers pointed out that the Washington Post's report is based on an anonymous source who has left office, and the authenticity still needs to be verified. Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, said on social media platform X, 'The rumors of Qin Gang moving to World Affairs Press have been around for months. Sources are U.S. ex-officials and I don't know what they do. But @nakashimae & @cdcshepherd are top reporters.' Charles Smith, an encryption security expert, said on X that he doesn't believe the article, which 'even notes the 'bookstore' employees have never seen Qin. ... He's on an extended fishing vacation.' His tweet was accompanied by an image of a skeleton fishing underwater. Last December, online news outlet Politico reported that Qin had been arrested for undermining national security and was tortured to death or committed suicide. Yen-Ting, an X user who frequently comments on China's social and political issues, tweeted, 'It's almost poetic justice, a 'Wolf Warrior' reduced to selling books while the regime's whispers suggest he's paid off the hook rather than locked up. This is China's way of dealing w/ its wayward wolves: not through the claws of justice but by shoving them into obscurity.' Kalpit A. Mankikar, a fellow in the Strategic Studies Program with the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, tweeted, 'Once seen as Stalin's heir, Soviet politician Georgy Malenkov fell from grace and was banished to Kazakhstan to manage a power plant. In #China, ex-foreign minister Qin Gang seems to have rehabilitated at a Party-run bookshop, says @washingtonpost.' The Washington Post report also quoted current and former U.S. officials who had dealt with Qin as saying he lacked the diplomatic skills of his experienced colleagues to break out of the 'Wolf Warrior' model. One example is that Qin appeared to threaten the U.S. with China 'erasing' Taiwan Strait's median line, in a heated exchange with U.S. officials amid former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August 2022. American columnist James Pinkerton tweeted a reader's online comment on the Washington Post report. The reader Paul Messina said, 'I believe that now that the Chinese economy is falling apart, Xi has realized that this 'Wolf Warrior' tactic has actually exacerbated the fall of Chinese industry. Besides aggravating the West, particularly the United States with this nonsense, it has led to multiple Western corporations leaving China, permanently closing their doors and factories in search of friendlier nations to do business. 'Vietnam and other nations have greatly benefited. Thus this idiot actually decreased the CCP's prestige in the world. I believe that this is why his new 'career' is librarian. Xi made a big mistake with his 'Wolf Warrior' attitude towards the world. I believe that he now realizes this fact.' Liu Jianchao, the head of the International Liaison Department of the CCP Central Committee, who is relatively moderate in terms of rhetoric and image, is considered a possible candidate to succeed Wang Yi as the next foreign minister. According to The New York Times, as China is already seeking to soften its image in the U.S. and Europe and improve relations with some of its neighbors, appointing Liu may mean China is abandoning its 'Wolf Warrior' diplomacy.

Google, Apple lose court fights against EU, owe billions in fines, taxes	LONDON — Google lost its last bid to overturn a European Union antitrust penalty, after the bloc's top court ruled against it Tuesday in a case that came with a whopping fine and helped jumpstart an era of intensifying scrutiny for Big Tech companies. The European Union's top court rejected Google's appeal against the $2.7 billion penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's top antitrust enforcer, for violating antitrust rules with its comparison shopping service. Also Tuesday, Apple lost its challenge against an order to repay $14.34 billion in back taxes to Ireland, after the European Court of Justice issued a separate decision siding with the commission in a case targeting unlawful state aid for global corporations. Both companies have now exhausted their appeals in the cases that date to the previous decade. Together, the court decisions are a victory for European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who is expected to step down next month after 10 years as the commission's top official overseeing competition. Experts said the rulings illustrate how watchdogs have been emboldened in the years since the cases were first opened. One of the takeaways from the Apple decision 'is the sense that, again, the EU authorities and courts are prepared to flex their [collective] muscles to bring Big Tech to heel where necessary,' Alex Haffner, a competition partner at law firm Fladgate, said by email. The shopping fine was one of three huge antitrust penalties for Google from the commission, which punished the Silicon Valley giant in 2017 for unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service over competitors. 'We are disappointed with the decision of the Court, which relates to a very specific set of facts,' Google said in a brief statement. The company said it made changes to comply with the commission's decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. It started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services. 'Our approach has worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services,' Google said. European consumer group BEUC hailed the court's decision, saying it shows how the bloc's competition law 'remains highly relevant' in digital markets. 'It is a good outcome for all European consumers at the end of the day,' Director General Agustín Reyna said in an interview. 'It means that many smaller companies or rivals will be able to go to different comparison shopping sites. They don't need to depend on Google to reach out to customers.' Google is still appealing its two other EU antitrust cases: a 2018 fine of $4.55 billion involving its Android operating system and a 2019 penalty of $1.64 billion over its AdSense advertising platform. Despite the amounts of money involved, the adverse rulings will leave a small financial dent in one of the world's richest and most profitable companies. The combined bill of $17 billion facing Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent company, represents 0.3% of their combined market value of $5.2 trillion. Those three cases foreshadowed expanded efforts by regulators worldwide to crack down on the tech industry. The EU has since opened more investigations into Big Tech companies and drew up a new law to prevent them from cornering online markets, known as the Digital Markets Act. Google is also now facing pressure over its lucrative digital advertising business from the EU and Britain, which are carrying out separate investigations, and the United States, where the Department of Justice is taking the company to federal court over its alleged dominance in ad tech. Apple failed in its last bid to avoid repaying its Irish taxes Tuesday after the Court of Justice upheld a lower court ruling against the company, in the dispute that dates back to 2016. The case drew outrage from Apple, with CEO Tim Cook calling it 'total political crap.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/google-apple-lose-court-fights-against-eu-owe-billions-in-fines-taxes-/7779133.html	2024-09-10T15:17:31-07:00	
US Assistant Secretary of State O'Brien: Georgia's leadership is 'in denial'	WASHINGTON — A controversial law on 'foreign influence transparency' is heading toward full implementation in Georgia, even though the country aspires to join the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization. September 2 was the deadline for Georgian nongovernmental organizations and media organizations receiving more than one-fifth of their funding from abroad to register as 'organizations serving the interests of a foreign power.' Only 1.6% of the country’s organizations chose to do so. Many organizations expect they will be forced to register and fined for allegedly serving foreign interests. Georgia’s so-called 'foreign agent' law has been labeled a 'Russian-style law' and heavily criticized by Georgia’s Western partners, who say it undermines the hope of most Georgians that their country will join European institutions. Georgia’s government, however, insists the law simply seeks to ensure 'transparency.' On October 26, Georgians will head to the polls to elect a new parliament, and the political opposition believes these elections will be a referendum on whether the country will continue to move toward integration with Europe. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs James O'Brien spoke with Voice of America’s Georgian Service about what the Biden administration will be most closely watching. VOA: The Georgian government is moving ahead with implementation of the Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence, which has triggered criticism and the imposition of travel restrictions against Georgian government officials by the U.S. and a pause in aid by both the U.S. and the EU. What message does the Biden administration have now for the Georgian leadership? Will the process of implementing the law affect whether the October parliamentary election will be seen as free and fair? U.S. Assistant Secretary of State James O'Brien: We want the Georgian people to be able to register their votes in a free and fair election. For that to happen, we need to see the whole process work well, all these organizations [being] able to work effectively over the next several months without fear of oppression or violence. This law, as we've said repeatedly, is flawed fundamentally. There are ways that European states protect their election systems. This law does not do that. Having a government agency essentially force a registration and have access to all the data in that organization is at odds with modern European practice. … It’s caused an enormous amount of damage to Georgia's prospects for joining the EU and NATO. The elections need to be free and fair. It's good that the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe will be able to have a mission to observe some parts [of the election], but it also depends on the community groups. All of that is one big system, and this law tries to kick one leg out from a three-legged stool. It doesn't work. And so, I'm worried that it means the elections will not be free and fair, and they certainly won't be seen as free and fair. Without that, Georgia can't make the next step forward. VOA: The U.S. and Georgia have been strategic partners for over three decades. The Biden administration has taken several steps, including visa restrictions, pausing aid and postponing joint military drills. What might the next steps be? What are the options on the table? O’Brien: We’ve already put in place restriction on travel to the U.S. that's affected dozens of people. We're not allowed to say who exactly. But it's a very significant step. We have suspended help, assistance to a range of the Georgian society. That's a shame, but it's necessary. And the EU’s said that the process of joining the EU is effectively suspended. We do not want to see a return to the kind of violence, harassment and oppression that we saw in the spring, where civil society groups, individuals were visited by often-thuggish groups with Russian accents, they were visited by members of the government. All of those things can't happen. VOA: Meanwhile, [ruling party] Georgian Dream leaders have promised to 'ban opposition parties' following the elections. How does this sound coming from the leadership of a country aspiring to EU and NATO membership, and what concerns does it raise about the ruling party’s intentions? O’Brien: It doesn't sound like a democracy. One party doesn't get to decide what other party gets to compete. It's for the citizens to decide what parties take their seats in parliament, according to fair rules that are understood in advance. So, I think that was a very revealing comment. And it suggests that this is not a government capable of bringing Georgia toward Europe. VOA: Russian intelligence services are accusing the U.S. of plotting 'regime change' in Georgia. Some Georgian Dream members also have accused U.S. organizations like the NDI or IRI [the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, both of which are American nongovernmental organizations funded by the U.S. government] of helping the opposition. What do you make of these accusations, and are you worried about possible Russian interference or malign influence in the Georgian elections? O’Brien: Well, anyone who believes the Russian security services, I think, is fooling themselves. The American organizations are very transparent. It's known who we work with, and we work to support the Georgian people so that they can organize themselves inside or outside government. That's the full goal. We don't pick winners and losers. We are for the Georgian people, most of whom, almost 90% of whom, want to move toward Europe, and it's this government with its very bad legal drafting — like it's just bad lawyering — that has caused this problem. And we would like them to fix it so that the Georgian people can organize themselves and could have a free and fair election. If the government succeeds in … denying access to resources by all these groups, the only ones left standing will be Russian sources of information. So, whatever the case has been till now, what the government is doing [now] makes it much easier for Russia to dominate Georgia's information space. VOA: After so many high-level engagements with the Georgian authorities, and Prime Minister [Irakli] Kobakhidze speaking about the need for 'resetting' the relationship, do you have any indication that they might be ready to change course? O’Brien: No. And they're in denial. They haven't noticed we’ve suspended $95 million in assistance. The EU is suspending a proportionate amount: They are saying you don't get to move toward Europe. And what Georgian Dream tries to tell its voters, and all Georgian citizens, is [that] everything is fine. It is not fine. Georgia wants to join the European Union. There are clear rules. The people responsible for those rules are saying you have made a mistake. You have written a bad law. They are on the verge of writing two new bad laws and those need to stop in order for the people of Georgia to get what they overwhelmingly want. We've said again and again to the Georgian officials: The transparency you say you want is readily available. All the American organizations are transparent. The European organizations are transparent. There are ways to achieve that. But they've chosen to do it in a way that lets the [Georgian] Ministry of Justice control your local neighborhood organization. And that's not democratic, and it's not part of Europe. We want them to turn back so that the Georgian people can be part of Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-assistant-secretary-of-state-o-brien-georgia-s-leadership-is-in-denial-/7779104.html	2024-09-10T14:47:15-07:00	
Dam overflow sparks new crisis in insurgency-hit Nigerian city	Maiduguri, Nigeria — Flood water from an overflowing dam has destroyed thousands of homes in Maiduguri, the capital city of Borno state in northeast Nigeria, and emergency officials fear the situation could get worse. Several aerial videos and photos shared by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) with AFP showed rows of houses submerged in murky water. An epicenter of more than a decade-long insurgency, Maiduguri serves as the hub for the responses to the humanitarian crisis in the northeast region. The United Nations refugee agency in Nigeria on its X account said it was the city's worst flooding in 30 years. 'It is an unprecedented incident,' NEMA spokesman Ezekiel Manzo told AFP on Tuesday. 'Some of the central parts of the city that have not witnessed flood in so many years are witnessing it today.' Thousands of homes have been submerged by the rapid rise of water after the rupture of the Alau Dam on the Ngadda River, 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Maiduguri. 'The last three days have over 150,000 individuals with over 23,000 households affected,' said NEMA zonal coordinator Surajo Garba. But with more locations being hit, 'we are sure the figure will be much over 200,000 individuals,' Garba forecast. 'The flood, which began over the weekend and worsened in the following days, was the direct result of excess water from the Alau Dam,' said Nigeria's Vice President Kashim Shettima, who hails from Maiduguri, as he visited the area. 'The collapse of the spillways unleashed a significant surge of water downstream, causing widespread flooding in the surrounding communities,' Shettima said. The flood also inundated the city's post office and main zoo, with authorities warning that deadly animals had been washed into communities. Manzo said forecasts did not prepare the emergency workers for the extent of the flooding, while also blaming the impact of climate change for the disaster. He told AFP there were deaths from the incident but declined to give a specific number because rescue workers continue rescue operations in the affected areas. With flooding still high in many parts of the city, authorities have opened three temporary shelters for the victims. 'Homes are submerged, schools shut down and businesses crippled as people evacuate with their belongings,' the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' Nigeria office said. Floods have killed at least 229 people and displaced around 380,000 more in parts of the country, according to NEMA, but mainly in the northern region. Some 110,000 hectares (280,000 acres) of farmland have also been affected, NEMA figures showed. Damage to farmland will worsen Nigeria's high rates of food insecurity, Save the Children warned last week. 'One in every six children across Nigeria faced hunger in June-August this year' – a 25% increase on the same period last year, the NGO said in a statement. Flooding, usually caused by abundant rains and poor infrastructure, has caused large-scale destruction in Africa's most populous country in the past. More than 360 people died and more than 2.1 million were displaced in 2012. In 2022, more than 500 people died and 1.4 million were displaced in the worst floods in a decade. Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu offered his 'condolences' to those affected in a statement, 'especially to the families that have lost their means of livelihood due to the disaster.' His office said earlier he is working with state authorities to 'address the immediate humanitarian needs of the affected people.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dam-overflow-sparks-new-crisis-in-insurgency-hit-nigerian-city/7778990.html	2024-09-10T14:16:41-07:00	
Abortion-rights measure will be on Missouri's November ballot, court rules	JEFFERSON CITY, Missouri — An amendment to restore abortion rights in Missouri will be on the ballot, the state's Supreme Court ruled Tuesday. The proposal to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution is expected to widely undo the state's 2022 near-total abortion ban if passed. Judges ruled hours before the Tuesday deadline for changes to be made to the November ballot. Supreme Court judges ordered Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft to put the measure back on the ballot. He had removed it Monday following a county circuit judge's ruling Friday. The order also directs Ashcroft, an abortion opponent, to 'take all steps necessary to ensure that it is on said ballot.' The court's full opinion on the case was not immediately released Tuesday. Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, the campaign backing the measure, lauded the decision. 'Missourians overwhelmingly support reproductive rights, including access to abortion, birth control, and miscarriage care,' campaign manager Rachel Sweet said in a statement. 'Now, they will have the chance to enshrine these protections in the Missouri Constitution on November 5.' Mary Catherine Martin, a lawyer for a group of Republican lawmakers and abortion opponents suing to remove the amendment, had told Supreme Court judges during rushed Tuesday arguments that the initiative petition 'misled voters' by not listing all the laws restricting abortion that it would effectively repeal. The amendment is part of a national push to have voters weigh in on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Missouri banned almost all abortions immediately after that Supreme Court ruling. Eight other states will consider constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights, including Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada and South Dakota. Most would guarantee a right to abortion until fetal viability and allow it later for the health of the pregnant woman, which is what the Missouri proposal would do. New York also has a ballot measure that proponents say would protect abortion rights, though there's a dispute about its impact. Voting on the polarizing issue could draw more people to the polls, potentially impacting results for the presidency in swing states, control of Congress and the outcomes for closely contested state offices. Missouri Democrats, for instance, hope to get a boost from abortion-rights supporters during the November election. Legal fights have sprung up across the country over whether to allow voters to decide these questions — and over the exact wording used on the ballots and explanatory material. In August, Arkansas' highest court upheld a decision to keep an abortion rights initiative off the state's November ballot, agreeing with election officials that the group behind the measure did not properly submit documentation regarding the signature gatherers it hired. Seven states have previously had abortion questions on their ballots since Roe was overturned, and voters have sided with abortion-rights supporters each time.	https://www.voanews.com/a/abortion-rights-measure-will-be-on-missouri-s-november-ballot-court-rules-/7779041.html	2024-09-10T14:13:19-07:00	
Jamaica to deploy 20 soldiers, 4 police to help fight gangs in Haiti	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness announced Tuesday that his country would send two dozen soldiers and police officers to Haiti this week to boost a United Nations-backed mission led by Kenya to fight violent gangs. The 20 soldiers and four police officers are scheduled to arrive Thursday and will join nearly 400 Kenyan police who arrived earlier this year and are working alongside Haitian police and military, said Vice Admiral Antonette Wemyss-Gorman, chief of defense staff for Jamaica's military. The Jamaicans will be responsible for providing command, planning and logistics support, Holness said at a news conference. Jamaica had pledged a total of 170 soldiers and 30 police officers, but Holness said it wasn't possible to deploy them all at once. 'It's not practical,' he said, adding that facilities to host those arriving and a command structure need to be in place before the full number pledged is deployed. 'We want a very successful operation.' The initial number of police and soldiers announced by Holness surprised many and comes at a time when the U.S. government has warned that the Kenyan-led mission lacks money and personnel as it considers a U.N. peacekeeping mission as one way to secure more resources. In recent days, the U.N. and Ecuador circulated a draft resolution obtained by The Associated Press asking the U.N. to start planning for a peacekeeping operation to replace the current mission. Such a proposal would have to be decided by the U.N. Security Council, which experts do not believe would approve it. On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said 'it's very strange' that there is apparently no money available to support the Kenyan-led mission. 'I think countries should assume responsibilities and should come and provide the necessary funding,' he said. Holness did not comment on the possibility of a U.N. peacekeeping mission but said the current mission 'can be a long and extended process.' He added that the mission is not the only or final solution to problems in Haiti, where gangs control 80% of the capital of Port-au-Prince. The violence has spread to other areas across the country, with more than 3,200 people killed from January to May, according to the U.N. The ongoing violence also has left more than half a million people homeless in recent years. 'Haiti is the example of what could happen if states and governments do not take the problem seriously and put in place the measures and resources necessary to bring the problem under control,' Holness said. Overall, the mission is expected to have a total of 2,500 personnel, with the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin and Chad also pledging to send police and soldiers, although it wasn't clear when that would happen. On Saturday, the Bahamas' foreign affairs minister, Fred Mitchell, told reporters that while the government hasn't wavered in its pledge, it's unclear when it will deploy troops to Haiti given that the mission's dynamics have changed. 'One of the things the Bahamas has to consider is the new position of the U.S.,' he said. The mission is expected to cost roughly $600 million a year, although the U.N. has received only $68 million out of $85 million pledged so far. The U.S. and Canada have provided most of the funds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jamaica-to-deploy-20-soldiers-4-police-to-help-fight-gangs-in-haiti/7778997.html	2024-09-10T13:16:22-07:00

Blinken, Lammy stress importance of Taiwan Strait status quo in US-UK talks	State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy addressed Indo-Pacific security and highlighted the need to maintain the status quo on the Taiwan Strait during their U.S.-U.K. Strategic Dialogue, underscoring its global significance. 'We also discussed joint efforts to ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and freedom of navigation and overflight of the South China Sea. For both of us, maintaining peace and stability, preserving the status quo is essential,' Blinken told reporters during a joint press conference with Lammy in London. 'It's essential not just to us; it’s, again, essential to countries all around the world,' Blinken added. U.S. officials have stressed the need to keep open high-level communication between Washington and Beijing to clear up misperceptions and prevent their competition from escalating into conflict. Earlier this week, the United States and China held theater-level commander talks for the first time in an effort to stabilize military relations. The video teleconference Monday, between Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and General Wu Yanan, commander of the People's Liberation Army's Southern Theater Command, was aimed at preventing misunderstandings, particularly in regional hotspots like the South China Sea. According to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Paparo emphasized the Chinese military’s responsibility to adhere to international laws and norms to ensure operational safety. 'Paparo also urged the PLA to reconsider its use of dangerous, coercive, and potentially escalatory tactics in the South China Sea and beyond.' In Beijing, China’s Ministry of National Defense issued a press release Tuesday stating the two commanders exchanged views on matters of mutual concern, but did not provide further details about the discussion. Washington has been seeking to establish new channels for regular military communication with Beijing after relations hit a historic low when the U.S. downed a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon last year. The theater-level commander talks differ from the broader discussions between U.S. and Chinese defense chiefs, which cover all strategic issues impacting both nations, Ryan Haas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA. The theater-level talks provide a platform for more focused discussions on operational issues, crisis management, and deconfliction at an operator-to-operator level, added Haas, a former senior official on the White House National Security Council from 2013 to 2017. The virtual meeting between Paparo and Wu followed a meeting last month in Beijing, where U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s top military adviser agreed to the talks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-lammy-stress-importance-of-taiwan-strait-status-quo-in-us-uk-talks/7778934.html	2024-09-10T12:27:55-07:00	
Political startups bleed support in India-administered Kashmir over suspected Delhi ties	Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir — New political parties formed after the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special autonomy five years ago appear to be bleeding support ahead of the first regional elections since then. Analysts see perceived ties to the central government in New Delhi as a factor. Typical of the trend is former lawmaker Noor Mohammad Sheikh, who recently resigned from the Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party, or JKAP, a political group he had joined a few years ago in Indian-administrated Kashmir. Established in 2020 by Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari, a businessman-turned-politician, and Ghulam Hassan Mir, a veteran politician from north Kashmir, JKAP aimed to build a bridge between the local population and New Delhi after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reduced the Himalayan region to a federally controlled territory in August 2019. Bukhari and Mir successfully recruited over 50 politicians, including Sheikh, from various pro-India parties, giving JKAP a promising start. The party was expected to reshape the political landscape of the region by challenging the dominance of the two main parties — the National Conference, or NC, and the People’s Democratic Party, or PDP. 'Bukhari took the initiative to engage with the government of India during a time of complete silence in the Kashmir Valley,' Sheikh told VOA. 'I chose to join the party because I believed I could represent my people when no one else was doing so.' JKAP, however, suffered an abrupt downfall after a disappointing performance during Indian general elections held earlier this year. With the announcement of the first assembly elections since Indian Kashmir became a union territory scheduled to begin September 18, JKAP began to unravel. Core members of the group started leaving one after another, causing the party to fragment. 'My workers did not support me, so I chose to leave the [JKAP] after three years,' Sheikh said. 'My supporters and I held a protest on August 5, and on that very day I decided to contest the election as an independent candidate.' Noor Ahmad Baba, a prominent Srinagar-based political analyst and professor, told VOA that the central government tried to reshape the politics in Kashmir from above by promoting new political groups in the region, but they couldn’t push aside traditional parties, especially the NC. 'It’s hard to achieve such goals in a country like India. Even a dictator wouldn’t be able to do it. Over time, people have become more politically aware and can analyze things and respond accordingly,' Baba said. 'The parliamentary elections indicated that building a new political party takes time and sacrifices and cannot be imposed from above.' Multiple parties that formed after the region lost its semiautonomous status have faced similar challenges. The Democratic Progressive Azad Party, established by former Chief Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad in September 2022, has lost over a dozen lawmakers, including co-founder Taj Mohiuddin. Azad, once a close aide to India’s opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, faced criticism from the locals who suspect that he, like lawmakers among other regional upstart parties, has a covert alliance with Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The suspicion was fueled by Modi’s praise for Azad following his exit from the Indian National Congress. Azad, however, dismisses these claims as attempts to undermine his new political role. Similarly, the much longer established Jammu Kashmir Peoples Conference, or JKPC, led by separatist-turned-mainstream politician Sajad Lone, is losing ground. Many attribute its decline to Lone’s alleged closeness to Modi. Many politicians who left these upstart parties are now running as independent candidates. They say that elections attract 'new combinations and shifting allegiances.' 'I left JKPC for my own survival,' Nizam Ud Din Bhat, a former lawmaker from north Kashmir’s Bandipora district, told VOA. 'My voters and workers wanted me to contest election from my home district as an independent candidate.' Muzamil Maqbool, another analyst and a political commentator, believes that public pressure has forced many individuals to run independently. 'People like the work done by some of these candidates but they do not like the political party they represented,' he said. 'However, we cannot ignore the fact that these independent candidates could join hands with any leading political party in the assembly elections by October this year,' he said. 'Horse trading in politics is not a new thing and in Kashmir; it is often the only way for politicians to secure their future and survive.' Professor Baba believes that those who switched parties during tough times and aligned with New Delhi may face difficulties. 'People now understand that such individuals are motivated by a desire to cling to power,' Baba said. 'I believe it might cost them in the upcoming elections.' JKAP co-founder Hassan Mir told VOA that emotional politics played by other parties has impacted people for decades. 'Every political party is referred to by various names, but if the vision and agenda are clear, it’s crucial to persuade people regardless of the labels attached,' he said. 'Some members departed because they sought power and realized we couldn’t provide it while others left due to unmet expectations regarding their mandates.'

US senator blocks promotion of top aide to Defense Secretary Austin	washington — Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville is blocking the quick promotion of the top military aide to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin over concerns that he and other senior staff did not immediately notify President Joe Biden when Austin was hospitalized with complications from cancer treatment earlier this year. Biden in July nominated Lieutenant General Ronald Clark to become commander of U.S. Army forces in the Pacific. But Clark has faced criticism from Republicans over his role as one of Austin's top aides when the defense secretary was in the hospital in January and did not tell Biden or other U.S. leaders. Republicans said the fact that Biden was kept in the dark about Austin not being in command for days could have meant confusion or delays in military action, even though decision-making authorities had been transferred to the deputy defense secretary. Tuberville's hold comes a year after he came under intense criticism from colleagues in both parties for holding up hundreds of military promotions over a Pentagon abortion policy. The Senate finally approved 425 military promotions and nominations in November after Tuberville relented. Republican colleagues said they agreed with Tuberville on the abortion policy but openly pressured him to drop the holds, voicing concern about military readiness and the toll it was taking on service members and their families who had nothing to do with the regulations. A spokeswoman for Tuberville, Hannah Eddins, said Tuesday that the senator has concerns about Clark's role during Austin's hospitalization, including that he did not inform Biden. She said that Tuberville is waiting on an a report from the Pentagon's inspector general that will review the matter. 'As a senior commissioned officer, Lieutenant General Clark's oath requires him to notify POTUS when the chain of command is compromised,' Eddins said, using an acronym for the president of the United States. Majority Democrats could still bring Clark's nomination up for a vote, but Tuberville's hold likely delays his confirmation because several days of floor time would be needed to confirm him. The nomination will expire with the end of the congressional session and the next president would have to renominate Clark or someone else to the post if he is not confirmed by early January. Pentagon spokesperson James Adams said that Tuberville's new hold, which was first reported by The Washington Post, 'undermines our military readiness.' 'Lt. Gen. Clark is highly qualified and was nominated for this critical position because of his experience and strategic expertise,' Adams said in a statement. 'We urge the Senate to confirm all of our qualified nominees.' Austin has come under bipartisan criticism for initially keeping Biden in the dark about his health issues and hospitalization. Austin was admitted to intensive care for complications from prostate cancer surgery on January 1, but the White House was not told until January 4. Austin's senior staff were notified on January 2. The defense secretary later said he takes full responsibility and had apologized to Biden. Still, Austin insisted that there were no gaps in control of the department or the nation's security because 'at all times, either I or the deputy secretary was in a position to conduct the duties of my office.' An earlier Pentagon review of the matter blamed privacy restrictions and staff hesitancy for the secrecy, and called for improved procedures, which have been made. The White House also laid out a new set of guidelines to ensure it will be informed any time a Cabinet head cannot carry out their job. The new guidelines include a half-dozen instructions for Cabinet agencies to follow when there is a 'delegation of authority,' or when secretaries temporarily transfer their authority to a deputy when unreachable due to medical issues, travel or other reasons.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lone-us-senator-blocks-quick-promotion-of-top-aide-to-defense-secretary-austin/7778883.html	2024-09-10T12:04:45-07:00	
Zimbabwe rolls out hefty fines for poor telecommunications services	Harare, Zimbabwe — Zimbabwe’s government has introduced hefty fines of up to $5,000 for poor service in the country's telecommunications industry. In a statement Tuesday, Zimbabwe’s ICT Minister Tatenda Mavetera said the government will levy fines of between $200 and $5,000 per infringement for telecommunications companies and internet providers who fail to give reliable service. Willard Shoko, an independent high-speed internet consultant, said the new fines could result in a solid telecom industry that can compete in the entire southern African region. 'The motive behind that is to improve internet for the end user. But I think they should also consider improving the infrastructure sharing and also collaboration to improve internet, not only for the region but also for Zimbabwe, because this is the foundation of the digital economy,' Shoko said. 'I think they should also think about how the internet can be improved and the partnership that can help improve the internet.' Fungai Mandiveyi, media and corporate affairs executive at Econet Wireless, Zimbabwe’s biggest telecommunications company, said the new regulations will be easier to comply with than those that existed before. 'The new provisions introduce a new model of penalties, unlike the blanket penalty that existed in the previous statutory instrument,' Mandiveyi said. 'The new penalties are now linked to specific quality of service breaches, that have also been clearly spelled out. There is now more clarity in what constitutes a service breach, and what penalty goes with a specific breach of the quality of service.' However, Christopher Musodza, an independent digital policy consultant, said the pressure to maintain internet service during Zimbabwe’s frequent power outages may present challenges for telecom companies. 'For the telecoms provider, it’s going to be tough,' he said. 'The economy is not performing as anyone would want. We have got issues to do with long hours of load shedding, so service providers have to power their base stations for long hours to ensure that they meet the key performance indicators. So, imagine running generators for most of the day to ensure that you avoid a fine. (I’m) not sure what will cost more; trying to keep up with these economic factors or just paying the fine.' Zimbabweans have long complained about poor and expensive telecommunication service. Shoko said that is the reason they are welcoming the government's decision this month to approve Starlink’s license to operate in Zimbabwe. The U.S.-based satellite company, owned by Elon Musk, has established a presence in several other African countries, including Botswana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Zambia. 'They can now easily get internet anywhere in Zimbabwe at an affordable price, thereby bridging the digital divide. That’s one major thing for the end user,' Shoko said of Starlink’s presence. 'For the local ISPs [internet service providers], there is massive opportunity that Zimbabwe can take advantage of — investment in ground infrastructure,' he added. 'Currently in Africa, Nigeria has only two ground stations that are servicing the whole of Africa. If the Zimbabwe government and local ISPs can work together with Starlink to provide ground stations in Zimbabwe, this will allow local ISPs to provide internet to Starlink, and provide better latencies in the region. So this will improve Starlink internet for local Zimbabweans, as well as the region.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-rolls-out-hefty-fines-for-poor-telecommunication-services/7778769.html	2024-09-10T10:25:07-07:00

Betrayed' rural Thais no longer guarantee votes for Shinawatra clan	Bangkok/Surin, Thailand — Rural voters may have permanently turned away from the Shinawatra family and its Pheu Thai party, former loyalists warn, after Thailand’s dominant political clan welcomed a fresh cohort of conservative one-time rivals into its coalition Cabinet. These include prominent royalists who have backed coups and deadly crackdowns on the Red Shirt protest movement, which emerged to protest a 2006 coup that deposed then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Tycoons and royalist generals have fought for two decades for control of the country’s politics and the economic spoils. In that time, political violence has claimed the lives of scores, if not hundreds, of people in clashes between rival factions. Red Shirts paid the highest price during a 2010 army crackdown on their rallies in Bangkok. Rivalry at the top has been set aside — for now — by a government led by Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the daughter of divisive billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra, who still wields vast influence over Thai politics despite having no formal role. Now, many Red Shirts say they feel abandoned by Thaksin, a figurehead they once adored. 'I used to feel sorry for Thaksin for all the things the establishment did to him and his family. But now that they’ve betrayed us, I’m heartsick,' said Napassorn Boonree, 61, a Red Shirt from Ubon Ratchathani, recalling the 2010 crackdown by security forces on demonstrators in Bangkok. 'People died for [the Shinawatra family], but they no longer care for us. Now we see their true colors. They’ve done everything all along only for their own gain.' Paetongtarn Shinawatra’s government has a new mission: to defeat the new reform movement which won the last polls in 2023 and has become the biggest threat to the political and economic interests of the establishment since Thaksin himself won his first election in 2001. The Move Forward Party was blocked from taking control of the government and subsequently dissolved by a court ruling. Its key executives were banned from politics. But it has been rebranded as the People’s Party and is determined to win the 2027 election. Too late for Pheu Thai? Thaksin’s daughter, Thailand’s youngest premier at age 38, is due to give her first policy briefing on September 12. She is expected to announce a timeframe for cash handouts of 10,00 baht ($295) to 50 million citizens alongside debt-reduction plans, hoping to renew faith in Pheu Thai among a poor, rural base who once voted unquestioningly for any Shinawatra candidate. But it may be too late. Red Shirts 'will express their disappointment at the ballot box,' predicted Thida Thavornseth on Thai TV, describing the 'merger' between Pheu Thai and its former enemies as the same as a business deal between tycoons. In any case, Paetongtarn’s government first must survive to contest the next polls. Coming into office after the shock court dismissal of predecessor Srettha Thavisin in an ethics probe last month, Paetongtarn will have to deal with powerful establishment enemies accumulated by her family over the years. 'Having Shinawatra as a last name is always a danger. ... The name is synonymous with political conflict in modern Thai history,' said Stithorn Thananithichot, director of the Office of Innovation for Democracy at King Prajadhipok's Institute. Thaksin was deposed in a 2006 coup, and the administration of his sister Yingluck was taken out by the army in 2014. Srettha last month joined a growing list of Shinawatra-backed premiers to be picked off by the conservative courts. 'We are seeing enemies becoming allies against a bigger threat — [the] People’s Party. The conservative elite has no other option than to use Thaksin’s service,' Stithorn told VOA. But Paetongtarn has 'to move fast,' he warned, to prove her government can win over an electorate burned by the seeming betrayal of their shifting alliances. A by-election on September 15 for a seat vacated by a banned Move Forward member may provide an early test of Pheu Thai’s popularity. Money problems Throughout villages of northeastern and northern Thailand, household debt is commonly sky high, and many working-age adults have migrated to cities or overseas for jobs that pay more than farm work. The COVID pandemic sank Thailand’s most vulnerable deeper into financial trouble. Previous Shinawatra governments gave generous farm subsidies, better education and access to basic healthcare and were rewarded with landslide poll victories in 2001, 2005 and 2011. Former Red Shirt Singthong Chaichuay says he is so tired of Thailand’s political turmoil that principles no longer matter. He just wants a better quality of life for the country’s poorest. 'Thai people are very forgiving, and if our country is really moving forward, then I don’t have a problem which side Pheu Thai joins, even if it is with former enemies,' the 61-year-old told VOA from his village in Surin, near the Cambodian border. 'Whoever can make our lives better is the answer for us now.' But there is a divergence with younger people. In the 2023 election, they voted in vast numbers for Move Forward, taking seats from Pheu Thai across what was once home ground for Shinawatra-linked lawmakers. 'During Thaksin times, it was the golden era for farmers. Everyone was driving new tractors, the price of rice was also high,' said Chatupat Sriwong, 31, who like many of her peers leaves her young child to be raised at home while working abroad. 'Fast forward to today … and we’re developing very little here. My only focus now is to make money and that means working overseas because there’s no way I can do that here.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/betrayed-rural-thais-no-longer-guarantee-votes-for-shinawatra-clan/7778707.html	2024-09-10T10:12:09-07:00	
Vietnamese immigrants and their children divided on US border policy	More than 1.2 million Vietnamese immigrants live in the United States, many of them having settled after the Vietnam war.

African nations boost gold reserves amid economic uncertainty	Nairobi, Kenya — Central banks in Africa are turning to gold to protect themselves from economic and geopolitical instability and to diversify their financial portfolios. In September 2023, the price of gold per ounce was $1,900. A year later, it is selling for $2,500. According to the World Gold Council, an international trade association for the gold industry, demand for the metal is expected to increase in the next 10 months despite the soaring prices. Some experts, such as Carlos Lopes, a professor at the Nelson Mandela School of Public Governance in South Africa, attribute the African central banks’ gold rush to the need to protect their local currencies. 'In the last few years, because of inflation and all these movements for stimulation packages and the rest, the returns are extremely low,' Lopes said. 'On the other hand, gold is going up in terms of price because these big banks are also going after gold as a protection. So, it is a very good investment to go to gold.' It helps that African gold production has grown by 60% since 2010, according to the World Gold Council, higher than a global increase of 26%. In 2022, Zimbabwe launched a gold-backed currency to curb inflation and volatility in foreign exchange rates. Ghana and Uganda have been buying gold from artisanal miners to bolster their shrinking foreign currency reserves. Ghana, Africa's largest gold producer, plans to buy oil from other countries and pay them in gold to ease pressure on local currency and lower high fuel prices. Some economists say gold cannot solve the economic problems of some African countries. According to the World Gold Council, countries should hold onto gold for its long-term value, performance during crises and its role as an effective portfolio diversifier. Bright Oppong Afum, a senior lecturer at the University of Mines and Technology in Ghana, said some African countries want to use gold to reduce their reliance on the global financial system. 'If sanctions are laid on you, an African country, we know the devastating effects that it will have,' he said. 'The African countries are developing, or they are young, and they do not want to receive some harsh sanctions that will negatively or strongly impact the economics. And because of that, they are strategically reducing their dependencies on these external countries.' Afum said that although some Africans know and understand the value of gold, many trade away the metal to satisfy their daily needs. 'So, they just find a mere buyer who will ... exploit them,' he said. The African Continental Free Trade Area introduced the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System, enabling countries to trade in local currencies. Experts say some continental payment systems, if implemented, can ease the economic pressures some countries are grappling with. That, in turn, might make them less dependent on gold.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-nations-boost-gold-reserve-amid-economic-uncertainty/7778680.html	2024-09-10T09:55:54-07:00	
Russia, China kick off joint military exercises, challenging US-led coalition	Taipei, Taiwan — Russia says it launched massive naval and air drills Tuesday that span a huge swath of oceans and involve more than 400 naval vessels, at least 120 military aircraft and upwards of 90,000 troops. The large-scale military exercise, dubbed 'Ocean-2024,' includes forces from China and will run until September 16 with at least 15 countries invited to observe the maneuvers, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia pays 'special attention' to strengthening military cooperation with 'friendly states' and warned the United States not to try and outgun Moscow in Asia. 'Under the pretext of countering the allegedly existing Russian threat and containing the People's Republic of China, the United States and its satellites are increasing their military presence near Russia's western borders, in the Arctic, and in the Asia-Pacific region,' Putin said in a televised remark to Russian military officials on Tuesday. He said Washington and its allies are 'openly declaring their plans to deploy medium- and shorter-range missiles in the so-called forward zones.' Analysts say the joint naval and air drills are an effort by Russia and China to deepen military ties and counter increased security coordination between the United States and its allies in the Indo-Pacific region. 'Russia wants to demonstrate that they can engage in a full-scale war with Ukraine while deploying resources to the Indo-Pacific region and China wants to show that they can deepen its relationship with Russia and cause problems in the region, primarily in the South China Sea but also around Japan,' said Stephen Nagy, a regional security expert at the International Christian University in Japan. On Monday, the Chinese defense ministry said both countries would conduct joint naval and aerial exercises aimed at deepening bilateral strategic cooperation and strengthening their ability to respond to security threats in the waters and airspace near the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk. In addition to the joint exercise near Japan, the Chinese defense ministry said Chinese and Russian naval fleets will conduct their fifth joint patrol in the Pacific Ocean as part of the 'Ocean-2024' strategic exercise. 'Russia hopes to increase pressure on the United States on the Pacific front through the joint military exercise with China, which may force Washington to reduce its military deployment to Europe,' said Lin Ying-yu, a military expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan. On the other hand, he added that China hopes to divert Japan’s attention from waters near the Taiwan Strait through its closer military partnership with Russia. 'Japan will have to prioritize threats to their security so they won’t have more bandwidth to focus on the situation across the Taiwan Strait,' Lin told VOA in a phone interview. China and Russia’s increased military cooperation near Japan in recent years has prompted Tokyo to characterize their joint activities as a 'grave concern.' 'These repeated joint activities are clearly intended for demonstration of force against Japan and are a grave concern from the perspective of the national security of Japan,' the Japanese defense ministry wrote in its annual defense white paper, which was released in July. For now, Nagy said Japan is more concerned with how the military cooperation may evolve, adding that there are still limits to what the two can do together when they conduct exercises. 'Japan will be concerned about whether the coordination between China and Russia will be used to destabilize sea lines of communication, to prop up North Korea, or to move towards some kind of forced reunification with Taiwan,' he told VOA in a phone interview. 'The Russians and Chinese will sail beside each other, fly next to each other, or coordinate how their boats move around but they haven’t developed interoperability and inter-command.' Enhancing logistics, communication collaboration While there are limits to their cooperation, other analysts say Russia and China will still use joint military exercises to enhance their cooperation in logistics, such as exchanging parts, fuel, or services or sharing data or communication channels. 'The ability for the Chinese and Russian armies to better understand one another and better support each other in the field is an important capability to develop for both countries,' Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, told VOA by phone. In addition to that, Lin in Taipei said China could also enhance its forces’ combat capabilities through joint military exercises with Russia since the Russian forces have accumulated real combat experiences from Moscow’s war in Ukraine. 'Since Russia’s navies have dealt with drone or anti-ship missile attacks launched by Ukraine, the Chinese navy could learn about how to deal with similar attacks in a potential war across the Taiwan Strait from their Russian counterparts,' he told VOA. Pushing back against NATO China and Russia’s upcoming military exercise near Japan is part of their growing efforts to push back against the United States and NATO allies. Since July, Beijing and Moscow have held at least three joint military drills in different parts of the world, including the South China Sea, the skies off coastal Alaska, and the Gulf of Finland. 'These increased military drills all over the world are part of Beijing and Moscow’s efforts to counter the deepening defense coordination between the U.S. and its allies, both in Europe and in the Pacific,' Sari Arho Havren, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told VOA in a phone interview. Despite their attempt to challenge the U.S. and NATO through closer military cooperation, Nagy said China and Russia are unlikely to let their partnership escalate out of proportion. 'Russia and China will continue to reciprocate what the U.S. and its allies are doing, but not escalate since Beijing wants to maintain its narrative to the Global South that they are not a hegemonic power,' he told VOA. On Tuesday, Chinese authorities said the United States and China held theater-level commander talks for the first time when Admiral Sam Paparo, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, held a video telephone call with his counterpart Wu Yanan of the Southern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army. The Indo-Pacific Command focuses on enhancing security and stability in the Asia Pacific region and hotspots including the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-russia-exercises-aim-to-challenge-us-led-indo-pacific-coalition-analysts-say/7778700.html	2024-09-10T09:28:14-07:00	
US imposes sanctions on Iran over supply of ballistic missiles to Russia	London — Washington is imposing new sanctions on Iran over its supply of missiles to Russia for use in Moscow's illegal invasion of Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Tuesday. The U.S. State Department said the sanctions aimed to further constrain 'Iran's destabilizing activities' and target individuals and businesses based in Iran and Russia, including Iran's flagship airline, Iran Air, which the U.S. said was involved in the weapons transfer. Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder confirmed that Iran had transferred shipments of Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles to Russia, and that they could be employed against Ukraine 'within weeks.' Prior to the transfer, Russian military personnel were trained in Iran to use this system, he said. Ryder called Iran's transfer of the short-range missiles, which can hit targets up to 120 kilometers away, a 'concerning development' that deepens Russia's military arsenal. 'One has to assume that if Iran is providing Russia with these types of missiles, that it's very likely it would not be a one-time deal [and] that this would be a source of capability that Russia would seek to tap in the future,' he added. Speaking in London, Blinken said the growing cooperation between Russia and Iran 'threatens European security and demonstrates how Iran's destabilizing influence reaches far beyond the Middle East.' 'For its part, Russia is sharing technology that Iran seeks,' Blinken told reporters. 'This is a two-way street, including on nuclear issues, as well as some space information.' Blinken added that Russian President Vladimir Putin was now relying increasingly on help from Iran and North Korea to get weapons, a clear violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions, and was also getting aid from China. 'One of the reasons that Putin is able to continue this aggression is because of the provision of support from the People's Republic of China, the biggest supplier of machine tools, the biggest supplier of microelectronics, all of which are helping Russia sustain its defense industrial base.' Without specifically identifying ballistic missiles, Moscow confirmed Monday that Russia and Iran are cooperating in the 'most sensitive' areas. 'Iran is our important partner,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a phone call. 'We are developing our cooperation and dialogue in all possible areas, including the most sensitive ones.' When Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy visit Kyiv this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will likely push for the Western allies to allow Kyiv to use their long-range missiles on targets inside Russia, said analyst Garret Martin, co-director of the Transatlantic Policy Center at American University in Washington. 'Generally, the U.K. has been often more at the forefront, maybe more at the vanguard, of being more supportive of Ukraine,' he told VOA. 'So, it's a question here — especially if you're thinking about the debates over long-range strikes — are they able now to come up on a sort of similar position?' Speaking to Sky News on Tuesday ahead of the visit to Kyiv, Blinken said that U.S. President Joe Biden is 'not ruling out' allowing Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike targets inside Russia. Ukraine has had 'what it needed, when it needed it, to be effective in repelling the Russian aggression,' Blinken said. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due to visit Biden in Washington Friday, with Ukraine and the Middle East at the top of the agenda. 'Particularly for Ukraine and for the Middle East, the next few weeks and months are critically important,' Starmer told the BBC on Sunday. 'And therefore, it's important for me to speak to President Biden about our shared response, the response of our allies to the pressing, immediate issues, but also to the more strategic long-term issues.' Last week, Britain announced the suspension of some arms sales to Israel over concerns its attacks on Hamas targets in Gaza breach humanitarian law, which Israel denies. The U.S. is continuing to supply weapons and says it does not believe Israel is breaking international law.

Alleged killer of Ugandan Olympian dies from burns, hospital says	Eldoret, Kenya — The man accused of dousing in gasoline and setting afire Olympic runner Rebecca Cheptegei has died from burns sustained during the fatal attack on the Ugandan athlete, a hospital official said on Tuesday. Cheptegei, 33, who competed in the marathon at the Paris Olympics, suffered burns to more than 75% of her body in the Sept. 1 attack and died four days later. Her former boyfriend, Dickson Ndiema Marangach, died at 1530 GMT on Monday, said Philip Kirwa, chief executive officer of the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret in western Kenya where Marangach was being treated and where Cheptegei also died. 'He developed respiratory failure as a result of the severe airway burns and sepsis that led to his eventual death,' Kirwa said in a statement. Kirwa said Marangach had suffered over 41% burns following his assault on Cheptegei, which local media reported to have happened after she returned home from church with her children. Cheptegei, who finished 44th in Paris, is the third elite sportswoman to be killed in Kenya since October 2021. Her death has put the spotlight on domestic violence in the East African country, particularly within its running community. 'This guy is dead because he killed my daughter. He has died because of his actions,' Cheptegei's father, Joseph Cheptegei, told Reuters. Rights groups say female athletes in Kenya, where many international runners train in the high-altitude highlands, are at a high risk of exploitation and violence at the hands of men drawn to their prize money, which far exceeds local incomes. 'Justice really would have been for him to sit in jail and think about what he had done. This is not positive news whatsoever,' said Viola Cheptoo, co-founder of Tirop's Angels, a support group for survivors of domestic violence in Kenya's athletic community. 'The shock of Rebecca's death is still fresh,' Cheptoo told Reuters. Cheptoo co-founded Tirop's Angels in memory of Agnes Tirop, a rising star in Kenya's highly competitive athletics scene, who was found dead in her home in the town of Iten in October 2021, with multiple stab wounds to the neck. Ibrahim Rotich, Tirop's husband, was charged with her murder and has pleaded not guilty. The case is ongoing. Nearly 34% of Kenyan girls and women aged 15-49 years have suffered physical violence, according to government data from 2022, with married women at particular risk. The 2022 survey found that 41% of married women had faced violence. Globally, a woman is killed by someone in her own family every 11 minutes, according to a 2023 U.N. Women study. 'I don't wish bad things on anyone, but of course I would have loved for him to face the law as an example for others so that these attacks on women can stop,' Beatrice Ayikoru, secretary-general of the Uganda Olympic Committee, told Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/alleged-killer-of-ugandan-olympian-dies-from-burns-hospital-says/7778550.html	2024-09-10T07:51:56-07:00	
First doses of mpox vaccine from US arrive in DR Congo	KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo — Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo said that 50,000 doses of mpox vaccine from the United States arrived in the country on Tuesday, a week after the first batch arrived from the European Union. Adults in Equateur, South Kivu and Sankuru, the three most-affected provinces, will be vaccinated first, starting on October 2, said Cris Kacita Osako, coordinator of the DRC's Monkeypox Response Committee. Last week, the first batch of mpox vaccines arrived in the capital, Kinshasa, the center of the outbreak. The 100,000 doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine, manufactured by the Danish company Bavarian Nordic, were donated by the EU through HERA, the bloc's agency for health emergencies. Another 100,000 were delivered over the weekend. The 50,000 doses from the U.S. will be of the same JYNNEOS vaccine. The 250,000 doses are just a fraction of the 3 million doses authorities have said are needed to end the mpox outbreaks in the DRC, the epicenter of the global health emergency. EU countries pledged to donate more than 500,000 others, but the timeline for their delivery remained unclear. Since the start of 2024, there have been 5,549 confirmed mpox cases across the continent, with 643 associated deaths, representing a sharp escalation in infections and fatalities compared with previous years. The cases in the DRC constituted 91% of the total number. Most mpox infections in the DRC and Burundi, the second-most-affected country, are in children under age 15. Last week, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization launched a continentwide response plan to the outbreak of mpox, three weeks after the World Health Organization declared outbreaks in 12 African countries a global emergency. The DRC issued an emergency approval of the vaccine, which has already been used in Europe and the United States in adults. For the moment, the rollout will be reserved for adults, with priority groups being those who have been in close contact with infected people and sex workers, Africa CDC Director-General Dr. Jean Kaseya told reporters last week. The European Medicines Agency is examining additional data to be able to administer it to children ranging in age from 12 to 17, which could happen at the end of the month, HERA Director-General Laurent Muschel said. The next batch of mpox vaccines will come from Japan and could arrive as early as this weekend, Kacita Osako told the AP, without specifying how many doses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/first-doses-of-mpox-vaccine-from-us-arrive-in-dr-congo/7778489.html	2024-09-10T07:15:44-07:00	
Turkey aims to become major naval power, alarming neighbors	Turkey is undertaking a massive expansion of its navy to make it one of Europe's largest naval powers.

Google loses final EU court appeal against $2.7 billion fine in antitrust shopping case	London — Google lost its final legal challenge on Tuesday against a European Union penalty for giving its own shopping recommendations an illegal advantage over rivals in search results, ending a long-running antitrust case that came with a whopping fine. The European Union’s Court of Justice upheld a lower court’s decision, rejecting the company’s appeal against the $2.7 billion penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top antitrust enforcer. 'By today’s judgment, the Court of Justice dismisses the appeal and thus upholds the judgment of the General Court,' the court said in a press release summarizing its decision. The commission's punished the Silicon Valley giant in 2017 for unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service to the detriment of competitors. It was one of three multibillion-dollar fines that the commission imposed on Google in the previous decade as Brussels started ramping up its crackdown on the tech industry. 'We are disappointed with the decision of the Court, which relates to a very specific set of facts,' Google said in a brief statement. The company said it made changes in 2017 to comply with the commission’s decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. It started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services. 'Our approach has worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services,' Google said. At the same time, the company appealed the decision to the courts. But the EU General Court, the tribunal's lower section, rejected its challenge in 2021 and the Court of Justice’s adviser later recommended rejecting the appeal. European consumer group BEUC hailed the court's decision, saying it shows how the bloc's competition law 'remains highly relevant' in digital markets. 'Google harmed millions of European consumers by ensuring that rival comparison shopping services were virtually invisible,' director general Agustín Reyna said. 'Google’s illegal practices prevented consumers from accessing potentially cheaper prices and useful product information from rival comparison shopping services on all sorts of products, from clothes to washing machines.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/google-loses-final-eu-court-appeal-against-2-7-billion-fine-in-antitrust-shopping-case-/7778300.html	2024-09-10T04:31:49-07:00

Francis will be only the second pope to visit Singapore, one of the wealthiest nations	SINGAPORE — When Pope Francis arrives Wednesday in Asia's financial powerhouse Singapore for the last leg of a four-nation tour, he is expected to bring his message of unity and hope to one of the world's richest nations. The 11-day trip, which earlier took him to Indonesia,Papua New Guinea and East Timor, is the longest for the 87-year-old pontiff since becoming head of the Catholic Church in 2013. Francis will be the second pope to visit Singapore, after a five-hour stopover by the late John Paul II in 1986. Here's what to know about Pope Francis' three-day stay in Singapore: Why is Francis visiting Singapore? Singapore was originally part of Francis' travel plans to the region in 2020 but it was derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The island city-state at the tip of the Malay peninsula has a small population of just under 6 million people and lacks natural resources, but it is a heavyweight in regional and international affairs. Astute leadership, its strategic location and reputation as one of the most open and least corrupt economies had transformed Singapore into a bustling financial giant and maritime and aviation hubs in just 59 years after independence. Singapore is a strategic U.S. partner but also maintains close ties with China. Ethnic Chinese account for about three-quarters of its residents followed by minority Muslims and Indians. According to a 2020 Singapore population census, Buddhists make up about 31%. About a fifth of the population claimed no religious belief, while Christians account for almost 19% and Muslims about 15%. Singapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil, reflecting its multicultural identity and heritage. 'Singapore and the Holy See share a common interest in promoting interfaith dialogue and understanding. Pope Francis' state visit is also the first papal visit to Singapore in almost 40 years,' Singapore's Foreign Ministry said. In a city ranked as one of the most expensive to live in, Singapore's Cardinal William Goh said that key themes frequently emphasized by Francis such as human dignity, inclusiveness, interreligious dialogue, family values, the need to manage artificial intelligence responsibly and care for the environment were of particular relevance. 'As such, Pope Francis' visit is highly anticipated and warmly welcomed not only by the Catholic faithful, but also by the wider society.' Goh said in a written response to The Associated Press. 'After the apostolic visit is done, I pray that Singapore will be filled with hope — a profound, divine hope.' What's on the pope's itinerary? After flying in from Dili, East Timor, on Wednesday, Pope Francis will hold a private meeting with members of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). On Thursday, he will receive an official welcome at Parliament House and meet Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and President Tharman Shanmugaratnam. He will also meet government officials, civil society and the diplomatic corps at the National University of Singapore. The highlight will be a public Mass at the 55,000-seat National Stadium in the evening. Those attending include Catholics from neighboring Malaysia and Brunei. Francis will make a tour around the stadium pitch to greet the faithful in his Popemobile before delivering his homily. On the last day, Francis will visit elderly residents at the St. Theresa's Home. He will also hold an interreligious meeting with youths at the Catholic Junior College. How influential is the church in Singapore? The church marked 200 years in Singapore in 2021. The Archdiocese of Singapore was formed in 1972, seven years after Singapore's independence. Diplomatic relations with the Holy See were established in 1981. In Singapore's early years, Cardinal Goh said the church's work in education and health care were important contributors to national development. 'Many of the country's top leaders in both the public and private spheres were formed in Catholic schools; and many basic health care needs were provided by Church-run health care institutions,' he wrote on the Vatican News website. The church supports 395,000 Catholics in Singapore with its 29 parish churches, three devotional churches, 53 schools, 47 humanitarian organizations and two health care institutions. Goh said the church holds frequent dialogue with the government, which views it as an important contributor and shaper of Singapore's social fabric. Goh, Singapore's first cardinal installed by Francis in 2022, is a member of two Presidential Councils that advise the government on matters relating to racial and religious harmony and minority rights. 'As the final stop on this apostolic journey, Singapore stands as a testament to peaceful coexistence in a modern, multicultural, and multi-religious society,' Goh wrote in his reply to the AP. 'This reflects the spirit of unity and diversity that Pope Francis has emphasized throughout his pontification.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/francis-will-be-only-the-second-pope-to-visit-singapore-one-of-the-wealthiest-nations/7778210.html	2024-09-10T01:55:43-07:00	
Australia plans age limit to ban children from social media	SYDNEY — Australia will ban children from using social media with a minimum age limit as high as 16, the prime minister said Tuesday, vowing to get kids off their devices and 'onto the footy fields.' Federal legislation to keep children off social media will be introduced this year, Anthony Albanese said, describing the impact of the sites on young people as a 'scourge.' The minimum age for children to log into sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok has not been decided but is expected to be between 14 and 16 years, Albanese said. The prime minister said his own preference would be a block on users aged below 16. Age verification trials are being held over the coming months, the center-left leader said, though analysts said they doubted it was technically possible to enforce an online age limit. 'I want to see kids off their devices and onto the footy fields and the swimming pools and the tennis courts,' Albanese said. 'We want them to have real experiences with real people because we know that social media is causing social harm,' he told national broadcaster ABC. 'This is a scourge. We know that there is mental health consequences for what many of the young people have had to deal with,' he said. Australia's conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton said he would support an age limit. 'Every day of delay leaves young kids vulnerable to the harms of social media and the time for relying on tech companies to enforce age limits,' he said. 'Easy to circumvent' But it is not clear that the technology exists to reliably enforce such bans, said the University of Melbourne's associate professor in computing and information technology, Toby Murray. 'We already know that present age verification methods are unreliable, too easy to circumvent, or risk user privacy,' he said. Analysts warned that an age limit may not in any case help troubled children. It 'threatens to create serious harm by excluding young people from meaningful, healthy participation in the digital world,' said Daniel Angus, who leads the digital media research centre at Queensland University of Technology. 'There is logic in establishing boundaries that limit young people's access,' said Samantha Schulz, senior sociologist of education at the University of Adelaide. 'However, young people are not the problem and regulating youth misses the more urgent task of regulating irresponsible social media platforms. Social media is an unavoidable part of young people's lives.' The prime minister said parents expected a response to online bullying and harmful material present on social media. 'These social media companies think they're above everyone,' he told a radio interviewer. 'Well, they have a social responsibility and at the moment, they're not exercising it. And we're determined to make sure that they do,' he said. Australia has been at the forefront of global efforts to regulate social media platforms, with its online safety watchdog bumping heads notably with Elon Musk's X over the content it carries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-plans-age-limit-to-ban-children-from-social-media/7778205.html	2024-09-10T01:47:03-07:00	
Top US, Chinese military brass hold first call to stabilize ties	BEIJING — The United States and China held theater-level commander talks for the first time on Tuesday, Chinese authorities said, amid efforts to stabilize military ties and avoid misunderstandings, especially in regional hot spots such as the South China Sea. Washington seeks to open new channels of regular military communication with Beijing since ties sank to a historic low after the United States downed a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon last year. Admiral Sam Paparo, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, held a video telephone call with his counterpart Wu Yanan of the Southern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command's areas of responsibility include the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, two hot spots for regional tension that are also flashpoints in U.S.-China bilateral ties. Both sides had an 'in depth exchange of views on issues of common concern,' the Chinese defense ministry said in a readout. Paparo urged the PLA 'to reconsider its use of dangerous, coercive, and potentially escalatory tactics in the South China Sea and beyond,' the Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement that described the exchange as 'constructive and respectful.' He also stressed the importance of continued talks to clarify intent and reduce the risk of misperception or miscalculation. The call followed a meeting in Beijing last month between U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's leading military adviser, at which the talks were agreed. U.S. and Chinese troops were also taking part in large-scale military exercises led by the Brazilian Armed Forces this week in the Brazilian city of Formosa in the state of Goiás. American and Chinese troops had not trained side by side since 2016, when Beijing participated in the Rim of the Pacific Exercise, or Rimpac, led by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. Most two-way military engagements between the U.S. and China were suspended for almost two years after Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in August 2022. 'I certainly worry about an unintended conflict between our military forces, an accident, an accidental collision,' Nicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador to China, told the magazine Foreign Policy in an online interview. Later this week, the United States plans to send a senior Pentagon official to a major security forum in China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-us-chinese-military-brass-hold-first-call-to-stabilize-ties/7778191.html	2024-09-10T01:15:47-07:00	
Typhoon Yagi leaves 40 missing, 63 dead in Vietnam	HANOI, VIETNAM — Emergency workers raced to evacuate thousands of people from severe floods Tuesday after Typhoon Yagi swept through northern Vietnam, killing 63 people and leaving 40 missing. Yagi struck Saturday with winds in excess of 149 kilometers per hour, making it the most powerful typhoon to hit northern Vietnam in 30 years according to meteorologists. The storm downed bridges, tore roofs off buildings, damaged factories and triggered widespread flooding and landslides. The north of the country, densely populated and a major manufacturing hub for global tech firms including Samsung, is now battling historic flooding, meteorologists said. Authorities have issued flood and landslide warnings for 429 communes across 17 northern provinces. One-story homes in parts of Thai Nguyen and Yen Bai cities were almost completely submerged in the early hours of Tuesday, with residents waiting on the roofs for help. Rescue forces were trying to reach residential areas to retrieve older people and children. On social media, relatives of those stuck in floodwater posted desperate pleas for help and supplies. In Hanoi, communities along the swollen and fast-moving Red River, which flows through the capital, were also partially under water, with people forced to evacuate in boats. Downtown Hoan Kiem District was forced to relocate 460 people on Tuesday. Crops including bananas, guavas and corn, which are usually sold in nearby markets, were all flooded. 'Lost everything' Phan Thi Tuyet, 50, who lives close to the river, said she had never experienced such high water. 'I have lost everything, all gone,' she told AFP, clutching her two dogs. 'I had to come to higher ground to save our lives. We can not bring with us any of the furniture. Everything is under water now.' As well as the dead and missing, flooding and landslides have also injured at least 752 people, officials at the ministry of agriculture said Tuesday. Authorities stopped heavy vehicles crossing a major bridge over the Red River in central Hanoi Tuesday and suspended a train line across Long Bien bridge as the water level rose. The action followed the dramatic collapse of a bridge higher up the river in northern Phu Tho province Monday. Pictures showed half of the 375-meter Phong Chau bridge gone. Five people who were crossing the bridge at the time have been rescued, but eight others were still missing Tuesday, authorities said. Forecasters warned central Hanoi would be affected by flooding later Tuesday. Hanoi authorities said more than 25,000 trees in the city had been uprooted in the storm. Huge trunks blocked key roads in the city centre, creating large traffic jams. At least 24 people were killed as Yagi tore through southern China and the Philippines before hitting Vietnam. Typhoons in the region are forming closer to the coast, intensifying more rapidly, and staying over land longer due to climate change, according to a study published in July.	https://www.voanews.com/a/typhoon-yagi-leaves-40-missing-63-dead-in-vietnam/7778183.html	2024-09-10T00:39:43-07:00

North Korea's Kim vows to put his nuclear force ready for combat with US	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to redouble efforts to make his nuclear force fully ready for combat with the United States and its allies, state media reported Tuesday, after the country disclosed a new platform likely designed to fire more powerful intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the mainland U.S. Kim has repeatedly made similar pledges, but his latest threat comes as outside experts believe Kim will perform provocative weapons tests ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. In recent days, North Korea has also resumed launches of trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea. In a speech marking the 76th founding anniversary for his government on Monday, Kim said North Korea faces 'a grave threat' because of what he called 'the reckless expansion' of a U.S.-led regional military bloc that is now developing into a nuclear-based one. Kim said such a development is pushing North Korea to boost its military capability, according to the official Korean Central News Agency. Kim said North Korea will 'redouble its measures and efforts to make all the armed forces of the state including the nuclear force fully ready for combat,' KCNA said. North Korea has been protesting the July signing of a new U.S.-South Korean defense guideline meant to integrate U.S. nuclear weapons and South Korean conventional weapons to cope with growing North Korean nuclear threats. North Korea said the guideline revealed its adversaries' plots to invade the country. U.S. and South Korean officials have repeatedly said they don't intend to attack the country. Since 2022, North Korea has significantly accelerated its weapons testing activities in a bid to perfect its capabilities to launch strikes on the U.S. and South Korea. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding military drills that North Korea calls invasion rehearsals. Many analysts believe North Korea has some last remaining technological barriers to overcome to acquire long-range nuclear missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland, though it likely already possesses missiles that can hit key targets in South Korea and Japan. South Korean officials and experts say North Korea could conduct nuclear tests or ICBM test-launches before the U.S. election to increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the U.S. Observers say North Korea likely thinks a greater nuclear capability would help it win U.S. concessions like sanctions relief. North Korea as of Tuesday morning did not appear to have staged any major military demonstration to mark this year's anniversary. But the North's main Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Sunday published a photo of Kim inspecting what appeared to be a 12-axle missile launch vehicle, which would be the largest the country has shown so far, during a visit to a munitions plant. This sparked speculation that the North could be developing a new ICBM that is bigger than its current Hwasong-17 ICBM, which is launched on an 11-axle vehicle. When asked about the photo on Monday, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder refused to provide a specific assessment of North Korea's missile capabilities and reiterated that Washington was working closely with Seoul, Tokyo and other partners to preserve regional security and deter potential attacks. 'It's not unusual for North Korea to use media reports and imagery to try to telegraph, you know, to the world,' he said. North Korea flew hundreds of huge balloons carrying rubbish toward South Korea for five straight days through Sunday, extending a Cold War-style psychological warfare campaign that has further stoked animosities on the Korean Peninsula. The balloons largely contained waste papers and vinyl, and there has been no repots of major damage. North Korea began its balloon campaign in late May, calling it a response to South Korean civilians flying propaganda leaflets across the border via their own balloons. South Korea later restarted its anti-Pyongyang propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts along the rivals' tense land border. Observers say North Korea is extremely sensitive to South Korean leafleting activities and loudspeaker broadcasts as they could hamper its efforts to ban foreign news to its 26 million people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-vows-to-put-his-nuclear-force-ready-for-combat-with-us/7778103.html	2024-09-09T18:40:13-07:00

Poland thanks military dogs for their service, giving them army ranks	NOWY DWOR MAZOWIECKI, Poland — The new privates received their ranks amid military pomp in a town near Warsaw where a Napoleonic fortress attests to a long military history. The group was made up of a German shepherd, a Dutch shepherd and two Belgian Malinois. The dogs — Einar, Eliot, Enzo and Emi — were bestowed with their ranks Friday as part of a new Polish program aimed at honoring the service of dogs used to detect explosives, a job valued for its role in protecting human life. General Wiesław Kukuła, chief of the general staff of the Polish army, decided last year that dogs serving in the army would qualify for six military ranks ranging from private through corporal to sergeant. The change has been welcomed by their loyal human handlers. 'The rank is meant to honor the hard work of the dog in service,' said Lance Corporal Daniel Kęsicki, who recently completed a five-month training course with Eliot, a 2-year-old Belgian Malinois. 'To me it’s a symbolic recognition that the dog is serving the homeland.' The dogs honored Friday belong to the 2nd Mazovian Engineer Regiment, which in 2007 became the first unit of Poland’s armed forces to introduce dogs into service, according to spokesperson Captain Dominik Płaza. He said none have died in action. During the ceremony, each dog's handler was handed a badge with the animal's rank, which was attached to the dog's harness. The ceremony occurred during the commemoration of the regiment's 80th anniversary. The dogs were given their ranks for having completed basic training and having served for more than a year. The ranks are a largely symbolic recognition 'so that we, too, are aware that such a dog is a member of the armed forces,' Płaza said. 'It is not just a tool for detecting explosives, but it is a living being,' he said. The unit was recently deployed to Paris for the Summer Olympic Games and the Paralympics, where the regiment's soldiers and four of its 16 dogs reinforced French security efforts in scanning facilities for explosives. Everything passed off peacefully. Polish army dogs have carried out service elsewhere in international missions, including Iraq and Afghanistan as part of the NATO nation's support for U.S.-led efforts. Poland, a close ally and neighbor of Ukraine, earlier this summer also announced that it was sending 12 trained dogs to support the Ukrainian military in clearing mines. The soldiers who work with the dogs volunteer for the assignment, and it becomes a commitment that lasts for the rest of the dog's life. Soldiers who were with their dogs Friday explained that they select their dogs, train with them, live with them, and care for them even after their four-legged charges retire. Kęsicki described Eliot as an obedient companion who has become integrated into his family life. 'The dog can already do a lot after the beginning course alone, and we still have a few more years of service ahead of us,' he said. Płaza, the spokesperson, laughed when asked if a dog could ever outrank his handler — or if a soldier might have to salute a dog. 'Soldiers do not salute dogs,' Płaza said. 'The handler will always be of a higher rank than his dog. It is simply impossible for a service dog to have a higher rank than his handler.' Though the master-dog hierarchy is preserved, great love and appreciation are clearly shown to creatures in Poland, where pets are everywhere and some even lay their beloved companions to rest in special pet cemeteries. The Polish government has in recent years also ensured retirement benefits to dogs and horses working in the police, border guard and fire departments. On Friday, as the sun beat down on a hot square in the middle of town, Kukuła interrupted the ceremony and ordered the overheated dogs removed — even as human soldiers continued to stand there in their uniforms and boots. Staff Sergeant Michał Młynarczyk served in Afghanistan with a dog named Elvis starting in 2011. Together they checked vehicles arriving at the base of an international force for explosives. Elvis died in 2018. Now Młynarczyk is paired with Kobalt, a German shepherd who received his private rank in April. Private Kobalt goes home with him at night and plays with his children. While he loves the entire family, he never loses sight of who is the master. 'All of the work the dog does is done for me,' Młynarczyk said. 'It’s a bond, it’s a friendship.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-thanks-military-dogs-for-their-service-giving-them-army-ranks/7778065.html	2024-09-09T17:24:21-07:00	
Colombia is the deadliest country for environmentalists, rights group says	BOGOTA, Colombia — Colombia, host nation for this year's United Nations COP16 biodiversity conference, was the deadliest country for environmentalists and land rights defenders in 2023, with a record 79 killed according to U.K. advocacy group Global Witness. The number of murdered environmental activists was the highest Global Witness has ever recorded for a single country in any given year since it started monitoring such killings in 2012, it said in its annual report published on Monday. 'The figure is really chilling,' Laura Furones, senior adviser to Global Witness' land and environmental defenders campaign, said, adding that the report's findings were conservative and figures likely incomplete. Globally, 196 environmentalists and land activists were killed in 2023, Global Witness said, with Latin America overwhelmingly leading the way, accounting for 85% of the slayings. The findings on Colombia are a sharp contrast to promises from the government of President Gustavo Petro, who took office in 2022 and has pledged to end the country's 60-year conflict and pursue environmental justice for communities. Peace processes with various armed groups — which are sometimes implicated in environmentalists' killings — have faltered, and though deforestation fell to a 23-year low last year, the environment ministry has warned of an increase in 2024. Colombia was also the deadliest country for environmentalists in 2022, according to Global Witness, when at least 60 were killed. 'The figure is very embarrassing for us in the country,' said Astrid Torres, coordinator for Somos Defensores, a Colombian human rights group. Torres said the issue was not just the responsibility of the sitting government but also of state institutions, such as prosecutors and local authorities. A spokesperson for Colombia's government said it was working on a response. Last year a Reuters investigation found that murders of environmentalists in Colombia resulted in long-lasting negative effects on conservation and that some municipalities where activists were killed saw significant spikes in deforestation. At an event to launch the COP 16 agenda in Bogota in July, Colombia's vice president, Francia Marquez — a winner of the Goldman Environmental prize for activism in 2018 — said the conference would honor those killed. 'It fills my heart with emotion to see this dream that was held for so many years by environmental leaders, many who are not with us today, who were sadly murdered in our country,' she said. 'This global event is a tribute to those voices.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombia-is-the-deadliest-country-for-environmentalists-rights-group-says/7778061.html	2024-09-09T17:05:41-07:00	
Experts applaud US steps to disrupt Russian disinformation	washington — The U.S. Justice Department announced September 4 that two Russian nationals, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, had been charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act and conspiracy to commit money laundering in the Southern District of New York. 'The Justice Department has charged two employees of RT, a Russian state-controlled media outlet, in a $10 million scheme to create and distribute content to U.S. audiences with hidden Russian government messaging,' said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. 'The Justice Department will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to exploit our country’s free exchange of ideas in order to covertly further its own propaganda efforts, and our investigation into this matter remains ongoing.' That same day, the Justice Department announced the seizure of 32 internet domains used in the Russian government-directed 'Doppelganger' foreign malign influence campaign, which it said violated U.S. money-laundering and criminal trademark laws. Experts who study disinformation say disrupting the paid-influencer campaign is an important step in efforts to counter the Kremlin’s broader disinformation strategy of spreading propaganda that undermines support for Ukraine and stokes American political divisions. Disrupting the Doppelganger campaign 'Persistent efforts to impersonate authoritative news websites and promote their content at scale in a coordinated manner can have a tangible impact, casting propaganda narratives far and wide consistently,' wrote Roman Osadchuk and Eto Buziashvili, researchers at the Disinformation Research Lab of the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank. According to an FBI affidavit, Russia’s 'Doppelganger' campaign created domains impersonating legitimate media sites, produced fake social media profiles and deployed 'influencers' worldwide. According to the Atlantic Council researchers, the primary method used by those involved in 'Doppelganger' is to post, on X and other social media platforms, links to fake news sites in replies to posts by politicians, celebrities, influencers and others with large audiences. Osadchuk told VOA that while the FBI's measures are unlikely to stop Russian influence activities, they will make them more costly, noting those involved in the Russian influence campaign will be forced 'to rewrite scripts, change the operation's infrastructure, etc.' At the same time, according to Osadchuk, the U.S. government’s moves against those involved in the influence campaign, which were widely covered in the U.S. and international media, will educate a broader audience. 'Researchers of the Russian disinformation have known about the Doppelganger campaign for some time,' he said. 'Now, Americans and people in other countries have learned about it and maybe will become more aware that not all information they consume is coming from legitimate sources and hopefully will be more attentive to the domain names and other signs that might indicate that the page they are reading is not The Washington Post or Fox News but a fake created by Kremlin-linked entities.' Influencers will be more aware In a statement it released after indicting the two RT employees, the Justice Department said that 'over at least the past year, RT and its employees, including Kalashnikov and Afanasyeva, deployed nearly $10 million to covertly finance and direct a Tennessee-based online content creation company [U.S. Company-1],' and that 'U.S. Company-1' had 'published English-language videos on multiple social media channels, including TikTok, Instagram, X and YouTube.' While the Justice Department did not specifically identify 'U.S. Company-1,' it is thought to refer to Tenet Media, a Tennessee company co-founded by entrepreneur Lauren Chen, who recruited six popular U.S. influencers with a large following. YouTube subsequently took down Tenet Media’s channel on the platform, along with four other channels that YouTube said were operated by Chen. Bret Schafer, a disinformation researcher at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a political advocacy group set up under the auspices of the German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank, told VOA that by financing the U.S. content creation company, Russia was able to create an information channel with a large audience, and to use it for such messages as blaming the U.S. and Ukraine for the March terrorist attack at a Moscow concert hall. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack. Shutting down that Russian information channel sent a powerful message to influencers and content creators to do 'due diligence about people funding their work and to try to figure out who's behind these companies and their motives,' Schafer added. Ben Dubow, a disinformation researcher affiliated with the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington-based research group, believes that influencers contracted by Tenet Media are unlikely to lose their existing followers, but that they might have difficulty attracting new ones. 'Hopefully, people who might otherwise explore those influencers will recognize their names and understand them as untrustworthy now,' he told VOA. The Justice Department’s indictment quotes RT’s editor-in-chief, Margarita Simonian, as saying in an interview on Russian television that RT built 'an enormous network, an entire empire of covert projects,' to influence Western audiences. The FBI affidavit also revealed that one of the sanctioned Russian companies had a list of 2,800 people active on social media in the U.S. and 80 other countries, including 'television and radio hosts, politicians, bloggers, journalists, businessmen, professors, think-tank analysts, veterans, professors and comedians,' whom the company refers to as 'influencers.' Concrete steps and good timing Several experts commended the U.S. government for taking concrete steps. 'They are sanctioning individuals and disrupting the supply chain of influence available to these threat actors,' noted Olga Belogolova, director of the Emerging Technologies Initiative at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. 'Punitive measures absolutely have to be part of the package,' said Jakub Kalenský, a senior analyst at the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki. 'Otherwise, the aggressors have a free hand to continue their aggression unopposed. And in order to identify those who deserve to be punished, a proper investigation from the authorities is necessary.' Experts also said that the Justice Department's actions were taken early enough to prevent influence in the November U.S. elections and to signal to Russia and other foreign actors that the U.S. government is monitoring their actions and will respond aggressively. 'Of course, that was what the Obama administration was concerned about in 2016 and led to them not being as transparent as they probably should have been with the American public about what they knew about Russian interference,' Schafer said. In announcing their actions against the Russian disinformation campaign, U.S. government representatives did not mention which political party or candidate they thought that the Russians were trying to assist. 'I know that the U.S. government, including agencies and the Foreign Malign Influence Center at ODNI [Office of the Director of National Intelligence], have been doing a lot of thinking over the last few years about how to strategically communicate these actions without unintentionally amplifying the very campaigns they are trying to thwart or politicizing the topic. And I think they've actually done a good job of striking that balance, at least from what I've seen thus far,' Belogolova said. Ihor Solovey, who heads the Ukrainian government’s Center for Strategic Communication and Information Security, welcomed the U.S. government's actions but told VOA that more steps are needed to thwart Russian activities on social media. 'X, TikTok or even more so the Russian Telegram - they are unlikely to want to spend on the fight against bots, troll farms or planned disinformation,' he said, adding that only pressure by a state, or even a coalition of states, will be able to force these social media platforms to block intruders and malicious content.

Exiled Iran opposition group says Sweden offices firebombed	STOCKHOLM — An exiled Iranian opposition group said Monday that its offices in Stockholm were firebombed overnight, with police saying they had opened an investigation into arson. According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), the political wing of the People's Mujahedeen of Iran (MEK), the building had been hit 'with several Molotov cocktails' in what the group dubbed a 'terrorist attack.' 'Several windows of the building were shattered, and the outer wall caught fire,' the NCRI said in a statement. It said residents put out the fire and 'no one was injured.' Police said in a statement they had opened an investigation into arson, but police spokeswoman Anna Westberg told AFP she could not comment on details about how the fire was started. 'We are still gathering information, and a technical examination will be done during the day,' Westberg said, adding that no arrests had been made. In its statement, the NCRI accused agents of Iran's intelligence service of carrying out the attack. The MEK backed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the 1979 revolution that ousted the shah but swiftly went into opposition and was blamed for a series of deadly attacks that rocked Iran in the early 1980s. The MEK has been exiled from Iran since then. It is far from having universal support among the Iranian diaspora but is backed by several high-profile former U.S. and European officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exiled-iran-opposition-group-says-sweden-offices-firebombed-/7777691.html	2024-09-09T15:37:08-07:00	
Smoke from Brazil fires cloud major cities, neighboring countries	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil — Smoke from intense wildfires in the Amazon rainforest and other parts of Brazil was choking major cities like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro on Monday, and wafting into neighboring countries. Karla Longo, a researcher at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), said that satellite images showed that 60% of Latin America's largest country had been affected by smoke. 'If we consider the areas affected in neighboring countries and in the Atlantic Ocean, the area affected on Sunday was around 10 million km2 [3.8 million square miles],' she added. Authorities in Argentina and Uruguay reported smoke from Brazil's fires impacting parts of their countries on Monday. Sao Paulo, the biggest city in Latin America, on Monday topped the ranking of the world's most polluted major cities, according to the air quality monitoring company IQAir. The rate of fine particles in the air — a measure of air quality — reached 69 micrograms per cubic meter, almost 14 times higher than the limit recommended by the World Health Organization. Residents of seaside city Rio de Janeiro were grappling with fine particle rates at five times the recommended limit. Authorities blame human action for most of the recent fires in the country, which are often linked to agricultural activity. The situation has been aggravated by the country's worst drought in seven decades, which experts attribute to climate change. Satellite images from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed a thick cloud of gray smoke along the Andes Mountain range toward the south of the continent on Monday. This is due to the 'wind that channels the smoke towards the south,' meteorologist Estael Sias told AFP. According to data from INPE, the number of fires in the Amazon since the beginning of the year has almost doubled compared to the same period in 2023. Other regions of Brazil have been battling terrible wildfires in recent days. The vast Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park, known for its numerous dramatic waterfalls some 250 kilometers (155 miles) outside the capital Brasilia, has lost some 10,000 hectares of vegetation to flames in recent days. Sias said the situation is not expected to improve 'without regular rainfall,' which is not likely 'before October or November.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/smoke-from-brazil-fires-cloud-major-cities-neighboring-countries/7777681.html	2024-09-09T15:31:09-07:00	
China's Xi, Spain's Sanchez seek to ease EU-China trade disputes	beijing — Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday urged visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to play a 'constructive role' in improving strained ties between Bejing and the European Union. Sanchez for his part said he hoped the EU could avoid a trade war with China, even as Brussels weighs imposing tariffs on China-manufactured electric vehicles. In their meeting, Xi also talked up deepening commercial ties between China and Spain in sectors such as artificial intelligence, digital economy, new energy and other high-tech fields. The Chinese leader said Beijing wanted to work with Brussels to further develop a China-EU relationship where the two maintain their independence and autonomy but also succeed together and bring benefit to the world, a Chinese readout said. 'It is hoped Spain will continue to play a constructive role in this regard,' Xi added. Sanchez responded: 'Spain wants to work constructively so that relations between the two are closer, richer and more balanced.' Beijing in June said that frictions with the EU over its plans to impose tariffs of up to 36.3% on its electric vehicles (EVs) could trigger a trade conflict, days after China announced a retaliatory anti-dumping probe into European pork imports. China in August then raised the stakes by opening an investigation into the bloc's dairy subsidies. Prior to meeting Xi, Sanchez said at business events that Spain would work for a negotiated consensus to the EV dispute within the World Trade Organization and that a 'trade war would benefit no one,' a government source said. Spain in 2023 exported $1.5 billion worth of the pork products that China will investigate, Chinese customs data showed, dwarfing the outbound shipments from the Netherlands and Denmark, which rank second and third. Spain also sold just under $50 million worth of targeted dairy products to China last year. But in a promising sign for Spain's pork producers, a separate source with direct access to Xi's meeting with Sanchez said the two leaders had 'found harmony and understanding,' when asked about possible curbs on Spain's outbound pork shipments. 'The meeting went extremely well,' the source said, adding that both defended their positions while seeking agreements. Fair trade 'We want to build bridges together to defend a trade order that's fair,' Sanchez told China's second-ranking official, Premier Li Qiang, before meeting Xi. Spain had a trade deficit of 17.27 billion euros ($19.07 billion) in the first half of this year, according to government statistics. Sanchez will also want reassurance that China will not strike back at Brussels by raising its own tariffs on imported large-engined gasoline-powered vehicles, as state Chinese media have suggested it might. Spain could also be impacted by the Chinese EV tariffs. Last week SEAT-CUPRA's CEO said that an electric vehicle made in China and designed in Spain by CUPRA, which is owned by Germany's Volkswagen, would be 'wiped out' if the European Commission followed through with planned import tariffs on Chinese-made vehicles. Sanchez on Tuesday is expected to meet representatives of SAIC Motor, one of the Chinese automakers most affected by the EU tariffs, and sign a Memorandum of Understanding with greentech company Envision, which is building an EV battery plant in Spain. 'In this increasingly geopolitical and economic context, as you have pointed out, we must work together to resolve differences through negotiation,' Sanchez told Xi. In an advisory vote in July, Spain, France and Italy supported the European Commission's proposal to adopt additional duties on Chinese-made EVs on top of the bloc's standard 10% tariff. But Beijing has been urging the EU's member states to reject the curbs at a final vote on it in October. The tariffs would be implemented in addition to the EU's standard 10% import tariff unless a qualified majority of 15 EU members representing 65% of the EU population vote against them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-spain-s-sanchez-seek-to-ease-eu-china-trade-disputes-/7777680.html	2024-09-09T15:24:08-07:00	
IAEA chief hopes to hold talks with Iranian president by November	VIENNA — U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi hopes to hold talks with new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian by November on improving Iran's cooperation with his agency, he said Monday. Several long-standing issues are dogging relations between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency, including Tehran's barring of uranium-enrichment experts on the inspection team and its failure for years to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. 'He (Pezeshkian) agreed to meet with me at an appropriate juncture,' Grossi said in a statement to a quarterly meeting of his agency's 35-nation Board of Governors, referring to an exchange after Pezeshkian's election in July. 'I encourage Iran to facilitate such a meeting in the not-too-distant future so that we can establish a constructive dialog that leads swiftly to real results,' he said. With nuclear diplomacy largely stalled between the Iranian presidential election and the U.S. one on November 5, Grossi said he wanted to make real progress soon. Asked at a news conference if his reference to the 'not-too-distant future' meant before or after the U.S. election, Grossi said: 'No, hopefully before that.' IAEA board resolutions ordering Iran to cooperate urgently with the investigation into the uranium traces and calling on it to reverse its barring of inspectors have brought little change, and quarterly IAEA reports seen by Reuters on August 29 showed no progress. Iran responded to the latest resolution in June by announcing an expansion of its enrichment capacity, installing more centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium, at its Natanz and Fordow sites. At its Fordow site dug into a mountain where it is enriching to up to 60% purity, close to the 90% of weapons grade, it installed two of the eight new cascades, or clusters, of advanced IR-6 centrifuges within days of informing the IAEA of its plan. Two weeks later, it installed another two. By the end of the quarter, the latest IAEA reports showed Iran had completed installation of all eight new cascades but still not brought them online. At its larger underground site at Natanz, which is enriching to up to 5% purity, it had brought 15 new cascades of other advanced models online. 'What we see is that there is some work, but nothing that indicates a rush to a fast implementation of a big increase in terms of enrichment production,' Grossi said. Iran has stepped up nuclear work since 2019, after then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned an agreement reached under his predecessor Barack Obama under which Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Western diplomats say there are plans for talks on fresh restrictions should Democrat Kamala Harris win the election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-chief-hopes-to-hold-talks-with-iranian-president-by-november-/7777642.html	2024-09-09T14:58:51-07:00	
China announces joint naval, air drills with Russia	Beijing — China’s Defense Ministry on Monday announced joint naval and air drills with Russia starting this month, underscoring the closeness between their militaries as Russia presses its grinding invasion of Ukraine. The ministry said the 'Northern United-2024' exercises would take place in the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk farther north, but gave no details. It said the naval and air drills aimed to improve strategic cooperation between the two countries and 'strengthen their ability to jointly deal with security threats.' The notice also said the two navies would cruise together in the Pacific, the fifth time they have done so, and together take part in Russia’s 'Great Ocean-24' exercise. No details were given. China has refused to criticize Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now in its third year, and blamed the U.S. and NATO for provoking President Vladimir Putin. While China has not directly provided Russia with arms, it has become a crucial economic lifeline as a top customer for Russian oil and gas as well as a supplier of electronics and other items with both civilian and military uses. Russia and China, along with other U.S. critics such as Iran, have aligned their foreign policies to challenge and potentially overturn the Western-led liberal democratic order. With joint exercises, Russia has sought Chinese help in achieving its long-cherished aim of becoming a Pacific power, while Moscow has backed China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and elsewhere. That has increasingly included the 180-kilometer (110-mile) wide Taiwan Strait that divides mainland China from the self-governing island democracy that Beijing considers its own territory and threatens to invade. Based on that claim, the Taiwan Strait is Chinese. Though it is not opposed to navigation by others through one of the world's most heavily trafficked sea ways, China is 'firmly opposed to provocations by countries that jeopardize China’s sovereignty and security under the banner of freedom of navigation,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing on Friday. Mao was responding to a report that a pair of German navy ships were to pass through the strait this month for the first time in more than two decades. The U.S. and virtually every other country, along with Taiwan, considers the strait international waters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-announces-joint-naval-air-drills-with-russia/7777648.html	2024-09-09T14:57:52-07:00	
UN: Taliban’s morality laws targeting women deepen Afghanistan’s isolation	Islamabad, Pakistan — The United Nations rights chief expressed his 'abhorrence' Monday at the recent promulgation of 'so-called morality laws' in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan that silence women or order them to cover their faces and bodies in public. Volker Türk told a U.N. Human Rights Council session in Geneva that the new laws were implemented alongside bans on Afghan girls attending secondary school, prohibiting female students from accessing university education, and severely curtailing women's access to public life and employment opportunities. 'I shudder to think what is next for the women and girls of Afghanistan. This repressive control over half the population in the country is unparalleled in today’s world,' the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner stated. Türk denounced the morality laws as outrageous and amounting 'to systematic gender persecution.' He warned that the intensifying curbs on women are 'propelling Afghanistan further down a path of isolation, pain, and hardship.' It would also jeopardize the country’s future by 'massively stifling its development,' he added. Richard Bennett, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of Afghan human rights, also spoke and informed Monday’s session in Geneva that the Taliban had lately barred him from visiting the country to conduct assessments in line with his mandate. He added that the morality law 'marks a new phase in the ongoing repression of respect for human rights' since the Taliban regained control of the country three years ago. The 114-page, 35-article law enacted by the Taliban last month outlines various actions and specific conduct that the Taliban consider mandatory or prohibited for Afghan men and women in line with their strict interpretation of the Islamic law of Sharia. The restrictions prohibit Afghan women from traveling without a male guardian, require them to be silent in public, enforce mandatory covering of females from head to toe, including their faces, and forbid eye contact between women and unrelated men. The law empowers the Taliban’s contentious Ministry for Promoting Virtue and Preventing Vice to enforce it strictly. Ministry enforcers are ordered to discipline offenders, and penalties may include anything from a verbal warning to fines to imprisonment for offenses such as adultery, extramarital sex, lesbianism, taking pictures of living objects, and befriending non-Muslims. Taliban leaders did not comment on Monday’s U.N. assertions, but they have rejected previous international criticism of the morality laws. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesperson, recently stated that 'non-Muslims should educate themselves about Islamic laws and respect Islamic values' before rejecting or raising objections to them. 'We find it blasphemous to our Islamic Sharia when objections are raised without understanding it,' he said. No country has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan, citing human rights concerns, particularly the harsh treatment of women. 'Any normalization of engagement with the de facto authorities must be based on demonstrated, measurable, and independently verifiable improvements in human rights,' Bennett stressed in his speech Monday, urging the Islamist Taliban to reverse current policies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-taliban-s-morality-laws-targeting-women-deepen-afghanistan-s-isolation/7777637.html	2024-09-09T14:39:14-07:00	
US: Transfer of ballistic missiles from Iran to Russia would be 'dramatic escalation'	Washington — The transfer of ballistic missiles from Iran to Russia would signify a 'dramatic escalation' of Tehran's support for Moscow, and the United States is prepared to respond with 'significant consequences,' the State Department said Monday. U.S. media outlets reported last week that Washington believed Iran had transferred the weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine, and the European Union has said allies shared 'credible' intelligence that Tehran had done so. 'Any transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,' State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel told journalists. 'We have been clear ... that we're prepared to deliver significant consequences,' he said. Tehran has rejected the accusation that it transferred the missiles, but the Kremlin has not explicitly denied it. Faced with punishing Western sanctions, Moscow has turned to Iran and North Korea for weapons supplies to keep its war machine going in Ukraine. Ukraine says it has been attacked with Iranian-designed Shahed drones on an almost daily basis from Russia and has found fragments of North Korean missiles on its territory. The reported delivery of missiles to Russia comes as the Kremlin has once again stepped up its bombing campaign against Ukraine's key infrastructure ahead of winter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-transfer-of-ballistic-missiles-from-iran-to-russia-would-be-dramatic-escalation-/7777611.html	2024-09-09T14:13:09-07:00	
HRW calls for stronger Sudan arms embargo as UN weighs sanctions	Nairobi, Kenya — The United Nations Security Council is expected to vote Wednesday on whether to renew existing sanctions that prevent the transfer of military equipment to Sudan’s western Darfur region. The pending vote comes as Human Rights Watch calls on the council to expand an existing arms embargo, currently on the restive region, to the rest of the country. The western Darfur region has been the epicenter of Sudan’s current civil war, which pits the Sudanese armed forces, or SAF, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, and other militias against each other. U.N. agencies and rights groups say the parties involved have committed war crimes and other human rights violations during the conflict, which has lasted nearly 18 months. Ahead of Wednesday’s vote, Human Rights Watch is urging the council to consider imposing an arms ban on the entire country to stop the ongoing rights violations and the suffering of the people. The Sudanese government opposes expansion of the embargo. Human Rights Watch investigators found that some of the weapons being used in the conflict were acquired after the civil war broke out in April of last year. Jean-Baptiste Gallopin is a senior researcher in Human Rights Watch's crisis, conflict, and arms division. 'We based our research on an analysis of photos and videos posted on social media and primarily taken by the fighters themselves, showing them in possession and using equipment such as attack drones, drone jammers, anti-tank guided missiles, as well as truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers systems and mortar munitions,' said Gallopin. The rights group’s report shows some of the mortars fired were manufactured in China last year. Companies in Iran, Russia, Serbia, and the United Arab Emirates have also produced some of the weapons used, according to the organization. In 2004, a year after the start of another Darfur conflict between ethnic militias and government-backed militias known as the Janjaweed, the U.N. imposed the arms embargo on Darfur. The embargo originally applied to non-governmental entities and was later extended to all parties in the conflict, including the Sudanese government. Ahmed Hashi is a Horn of Africa political and security commentator. He said the regional and international community is doing little to end the conflict, and said that in fact, RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedi, is receiving strong foreign support. 'I think the United Arab Emirates and other proxy states are arming Mr. Hamedi. I think that the rebellion inside Sudan is foreign-led. I think that the people who caused the Janjaweed and caused international human rights, international crime are fighting in Sudan. I'm afraid that terrorism will rear its ugly head. It is the tragic human rights issue of the 21st century. And we are all, including me, ashamed as Africans that we have not done anything,' he said. The UAE has denied arming the RSF. Gallopin said imposing an arms ban in one region would not solve the conflict. He said a ban is needed nationwide. 'We believe that the existing embargo is not sufficient, that there needs to be a wholesale embargo on the sale of armed and military equipment to the whole of Sudan, because we documented, we and others documented very serious abuses carried out by the warring parties since last year, including widespread war crimes, crimes against humanity. We know we published a report on Darfur showing that ethnic cleansing was committed. And so we think it's urgent for the Security Council to broaden that arms embargo,' he said. The group also is calling on the Security Council to condemn governments that are violating the existing arms embargo on Darfur and take urgent measures to sanction individuals and entities that are also doing so.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hrw-calls-for-stronger-sudan-arms-embargo-as-un-weighs-sanctions/7777277.html	2024-09-09T12:59:29-07:00	
Kenya begins 3-day mourning over deaths of 21 children in school fire	Nairobi, Kenya — Kenya begins three days of national mourning Monday following the deaths of at least 21 students in a boarding school inferno in central Kenya. Distraught parents and relatives gathered to give samples for DNA testing Monday at the Naromoru hospital in Kenya, four days after the fire at Hillside Endarasha Academy, where some of the deceased were burned beyond recognition. The dormitory housed 156 students, the majority of whom escaped. However, officials say 17 children remain unaccounted for following the tragedy, which has devastated the school community. John Mwangi said he still does not know the whereabouts of his child, a student at the school. 'At least it’ll be a reprieve to 20 parents. I might be among them, I don’t know … that’s why we are here. We are hanging on hope,' he said. Some parents and relatives have been camping at the school to demand answers. Chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor said DNA testing will help families get closure. 'We’ll be undergoing a process of DNA collection from them at the hospital by the government chemist, then on Tuesday, we’ll start the autopsy,' Oduor said. 'During the autopsy, we’ll be documenting the cause of death and also taking samples for DNA which will later be reconciled so that at the end of the day, we’ll be able to unite the parents to their children.' The Red Cross and ministry of health have been offering support to those affected. 'We have the emergency disaster preparedness and response team,' said Deborah Barasa, Kenya's cabinet secretary for health. 'We have the counselors, or the mental health and psychosocial support. We have forensic teams on the ground and they are supporting in every way.' Officials have yet to determine the cause of the fire, with investigations ongoing. There have been a number of incidents of fires at Kenyan boarding schools in recent years, prompting national concerns about safety standards. A report released in 2020 by the country’s auditor general said many schools lack proper equipment to handle fires and many dormitories are not constructed in accordance with government regulations. Education cabinet secretary Julius Ogamba said a review of the rules is needed. 'Perhaps as a country it has reached that time when we need to relook at those rules and regulations, which are policies, and find out whether it is time for us to move them a step further and make them laws so that there are penalties that will attach to any person who violates them,' Ogamba said. Kenya’s deadliest school fire was in 2001 when at least 67 students died in a dormitory inferno at Kyanguli high school in the southeast of the country. As the country marks three days of mourning for another school fire, experts say the government needs to do more to ensure the safety of learners.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-begins-3-day-mourning-over-deaths-of-21-children-in-school-fire/7777284.html	2024-09-09T12:58:38-07:00

4 migrants dead, others missing after boat capsizes off Senegal	DAKAR, Senegal — A boat carrying migrants capsized off the coast of Senegal over the weekend, leaving at least four people dead and several others missing, local authorities said Monday. The artisanal fishing boat left the town of Mbour, nearly 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the capital, Dakar, heading to Europe on Sunday afternoon before capsizing a few miles off the coast, Amadou Diop, the district's prefect, told The Associated Press. Local fishermen rescued three people who were brought back to shore by naval authorities. Senegal’s navy is looking for those missing, Diop said, adding that the exact number of passengers remained unknown. In recent years, the number of migrants leaving West Africa through Senegal has surged with many fleeing conflicts, poverty and the lack of job opportunities. Most head to the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off the coast of West Africa, which is used as a stepping stone to continental Europe. Since the beginning of the year, more than 22,300 people have landed on the Canary Islands, 126% more than the same period last year, according to statistics released by Spain’s Interior Ministry. Last month, the Senegalese army said it had arrested 453 migrants and 'members of smuggling networks' as part of a 12-day operation patrolling the coastline. More than half of the arrested were Senegalese nationals, the army said. In July, a boat carrying 300 migrants, mostly from Gambia and Senegal, capsized off Mauritania. More than a dozen died and at least 150 others went missing. The Atlantic route from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. While there is no accurate death toll because of the lack of information on departures from West Africa, the Spanish migrant rights group Walking Borders estimates the victims are in the thousands this year alone. Migrant boats that get lost or run into problems often vanish in the Atlantic, with some drifting across the ocean for months until they are found in the Caribbean and Latin America carrying only human remains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrants-dead-others-missing-after-boat-capsizes-off-senegal/7777308.html	2024-09-09T11:22:47-07:00	
Flooding in Morocco, Algeria kills more than a dozen people	RABAT, Morocco — Torrential downpours hit North Africa's normally arid mountains and deserts over the weekend, causing flooding that killed more than a dozen people in Morocco and Algeria and destroyed homes and critical infrastructure. In Morocco, officials said the two days of storms surpassed historic averages, in some cases exceeding the annual average rainfall. The downpours affected some of the regions that experienced a deadly earthquake one year ago. Meteorologists had predicted that a rare deluge could strike North Africa’s Sahara Desert, where many areas receive less than an inch of rain a year. Officials in Morocco said 11 people were killed in rural areas where infrastructure has historically been lacking, and 24 homes collapsed. Nine people were missing. Drinking water and electrical infrastructure were damaged, along with major roads. Rachid El Khalfi, Morocco’s Interior Ministry spokesperson, said Sunday in a statement that the government was working to restore communication and access to flooded regions in the 'exceptional situation' and urged people to use caution. In neighboring Algeria, which held a presidential election over the weekend, authorities said at least five died in the country's desert provinces. Interior Minister Brahim Merad called the situation 'catastrophic' on state-owned television. Algeria’s state-run news service APS said the government had sent thousands of civil protection and military officers to help with emergency response efforts and rescue families stuck in their homes. The floods also damaged bridges and trains in the area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/flooding-in-morocco-algeria-kills-more-than-a-dozen-people/7777179.html	2024-09-09T09:25:26-07:00

Under Yoon, calls for South Korean nukes 'normalized'	Seoul, South Korea — Less than two years after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol pledged his country would not seek nuclear weapons, his newly appointed defense minister is openly envisioning scenarios in which South Korea might reconsider that stance. The comments by Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, who took office on Friday, are the latest evidence that the once-taboo idea of nuclear armament has gone mainstream in Seoul, amid growing concerns about North Korea's rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal and the long-term reliability of U.S. protection. As an academic and retired military officer, Kim has long argued that South Korea may need nuclear weapons in some form to counter North Korea. In recently unearthed footage from a 2020 seminar, Kim warned South Korea has 'no survival or future' without such a deterrent. During his confirmation process last week, Kim stood by those comments, saying 'all options' should remain open if the U.S. nuclear umbrella proves insufficient. It appears to be the first time a sitting South Korean defense minister has publicly entertained the possibility of acquiring nuclear weapons, and marks a sharp departure from his predecessor, who repeatedly and firmly rejected the proposal under any condition. Contacted by VOA, a South Korean defense ministry spokesperson maintained there has been 'no change in the principle or position' that Seoul relies on U.S. extended deterrence and the U.S.-South Korea alliance to address the North Korean nuclear threat. 'However, if we cannot guarantee the survival and security of the state, all means and methods are open,' the spokesperson added, emphasizing the need to work closely with the United States. A spokesperson for Yoon’s presidential office declined to comment for this story. Most observers doubt South Korea will pursue nuclear weapons any time soon due to the massive economic and national security risks it would entail. Not only would South Korea risk enraging China, but Seoul could upend its alliance with the United States and invite painful international sanctions, all while possibly encouraging others in the region to consider nuclear weapons of their own. Despite the risks, Yoon continues to drive the once unthinkable idea further into the mainstream, raising concerns that the proposal could become more acceptable — and eventually turn into reality. Nuke calls now routine Yoon himself suggested last January that South Korea could develop nuclear arms if the North Korean threat escalated – raising alarm in Washington, where non-proliferation has long been a priority. Three months later, Yoon and U.S. President Joe Biden signed what is known as the Washington Declaration, which bolstered U.S. defense assurances while reaffirming South Korea’s commitments under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Yoon’s appointment of Kim, however, appears to contradict the spirit of that agreement, said Lee Sang-sin, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification. What stands out most, Lee said, is the lack of public reaction to Kim’s remarks. Kim’s appointment has drawn little attention from South Korean media and been largely ignored by Western outlets — a possible indication that calls for South Korea’s nuclear armament have become routine. 'That’s what I have warned about,' said Lee. '[This conversation] has been normalized.' When contacted by VOA, the White House National Security Council declined to directly comment on Kim's statements, instead emphasizing South Korea’s pledge under the non-proliferation treaty as outlined in the Washington Declaration. 'We will continue to work with our ROK allies to strengthen our alliance and ensure we are well-positioned to deter nuclear threats,' an NSC spokesman added. Driving the conversation Polls have long suggested a majority of South Koreans support acquiring nuclear weapons, although such views were once confined to the political fringes. Under Yoon’s presidency, the debate has become so entrenched that even some state-backed research institutions are exploring the possibility of nuclear armament. A June report by the state-run Institute for National Security Strategy recommended that Seoul consider government reviews and public debates on various options, including the redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons, NATO-style nuclear sharing, and South Korea developing its own arsenal. Such calls are not only coming from Seoul. A growing number of former Trump officials have expressed an openness to the idea, with some even highlighting the geopolitical advantages of South Korea getting its own weapons – an idea that Trump himself once teased. The possibility of Trump’s return, along with his 'America First' stance, has fueled concerns in Seoul that U.S. protection may be less reliable long-term, further accelerating the nuclear debate. Some in South Korea appear eager to capitalize on the trend. In an opinion piece this month, Choi Kang, president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, an influential conservative research group, argued South Korean nuclear weapons should be presented as beneficial to the U.S.-South Korea alliance. 'If a South Korean nuclear arsenal aligned with U.S. security interests and came to be regarded as a ‘common asset’ of the alliance, then the United States might accept it or even support it,' Choi wrote. Reality check? But many analysts caution that such statements downplay the risks of nuclear armament. 'There really needs to be greater questioning of whether more nukes and more countries with nukes truly increases any country’s security situation and a serious examination of what Seoul stands to lose by choosing that path,' said Jenny Town, a North Korea specialist with the Washington-based Stimson Center. Others, like Mason Richey, who teaches international politics at Seoul’s Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, argue it is unlikely South Korea would pursue nuclear weapons barring profound U.S.-South Korea alliance problems and/or severe regional instability. 'That said, every elite policymaker who engages the South Korea nuclear debate makes it easier to continue down the slippery slope of thinking about nuclear weapons, studying how to develop them, assuring a latent capability, deciding to develop them, and then actually building them,' he added. White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/under-yoon-calls-for-south-korean-nukes-normalized/7777068.html	2024-09-09T08:14:25-07:00	
Mourners attend funeral for American activist witness says was shot dead by Israeli troops	NABLUS, West Bank — The Western-backed Palestinian Authority held a funeral procession Monday for a U.S.-Turkish dual national activist who a witness says was shot and killed by Israeli forces while demonstrating against settlements in the occupied West Bank. Dozens of mourners — including several leading PA officials — attended the procession. Security forces carried the body of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi which was draped in a Palestinian flag while a traditional black-and-white checkered scarf covered her face. The 26-year-old's body was then placed into the back of a Palestinian ambulance. Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Oncu Keceli said Turkey was working on repatriating Eygi's remains for burial in the Aegean coastal town of Didim as per her family's wishes, but 'because the land crossing from the Palestinian territories to Jordan was closed as of Sunday, the ministry was trying to have the body flown directly to Turkey.' U.S. officials did not respond to a request for comment. Jonathan Pollak, an Israeli peace activist who participated in Friday's protest, said Israeli forces shot her on Friday in the city of Nablus while posing no threat, adding that the killing happened during a period of calm after clashes between soldiers and Palestinian protesters. Pollak said he then saw two Israeli soldiers mount the roof of a nearby home, train a gun in the group's direction and fired, with one of the bullets striking Eygi in the head. The Israeli military said it was looking into reports that troops had killed a foreign national while firing at an 'instigator of violent activity' in the area of the protest. The West Bank has seen a surge of violence since the Israel-Hamas war began in October, with increasing Israeli raids, attacks by Palestinian militants on Israelis, and attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mourners-attend-funeral-for-american-activist-witness-say-was-shot-dead-by-israeli-troops-/7776965.html	2024-09-09T07:29:42-07:00	
Attempts to keep up exchanges between Taiwanese, Chinese face obstacles	Taipei, Taiwan — Efforts to maintain exchanges between Taiwanese and Chinese citizens face new challenges after Beijing last month sentenced a Taiwanese activist to nine years in jail, a move that analysts say will create a chilling effect within Taiwan’s civil society. On September 6, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) confirmed that a court in the eastern city of Wenzhou earlier had sentenced Taiwanese political activist Yang Chih-yuan to nine years in jail under secession charges. TAO said Yang, who was arrested in 2022 while teaching and participating in competitions for the board game Go, has long been involved in secessionist activities, playing a key role in organizations that advocate Taiwan’s independence. 'His acts are egregious and the court reached the decision according to law,' the office said in a statement. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, which oversees cross-strait exchanges, condemned the Chinese court’s ruling and asked Beijing to make public the verdict and the evidence that supports the charges. 'Beijing is trying to use Yang’s case to intimidate Taiwanese people and use the pretext of penalizing Taiwan independence as a way to exercise long-arm jurisdiction,' the MAC wrote in a statement released last week. Yang’s case marks the first time that China used secession charges against Taiwanese people. It comes after Beijing in June introduced 22 new guidelines to punish what they called 'die-hard Taiwan independence activists.' The maximum sentence could be the death penalty. Analysts say the sentencing of Yang represents Beijing’s attempt to take a 'more hardline stance' against Taiwanese who promote the island’s sovereignty. His case 'shows that Beijing means business when it comes to using legal instruments to crack down on what it regards as ‘separatism,’' said J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow at the Global Taiwan Institute. 'This will inevitably affect people-to-people and civil society exchanges [between Taiwan and China,]' Cole told VOA in a written statement. Indefinite delay of cross-strait academic exchanges, city-to-city forum Meanwhile, the scheduled visits by two academic delegations from China’s Xiamen University have reportedly been postponed as Taiwanese authorities review their paperwork. While some local media outlets said the postponement may be caused by 'obstacles' imposed by Taiwanese authorities, Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said the review of the Chinese delegations’ applications is based on existing procedures, adding that Taipei has no intention to prevent certain groups from visiting Taiwan. Despite clarification from Taiwanese officials, China’s state-run tabloid Global Times characterized the postponement as the Taiwanese government’s attempt to 'block' the Chinese delegations from visiting Taiwan. 'The Xiamen University delegations have completed the preparations in terms of formalities and materials, but related ‘security authorities’ in Taiwan have put ‘a technical hold’ in place while they carry out a review,' Zhang Wensheng, deputy dean of the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, told the Global Times in an interview. Some experts say the delay in the Chinese delegation’s trips to Taiwan shows the Taiwanese government may be reviewing how to facilitate cross-strait exchanges amid growing military and political pressure from Beijing. 'In light of Beijing’s heightened pressure against Taiwan, the Taiwanese government may be reviewing what might be a more reciprocal approach to manage cross-strait academic exchanges,' Wen-ti Sung, a Taipei-based political scientist for the Australian National University, told VOA by phone. In addition to the delay of cross-strait academic exchanges, the annual Shanghai-Taipei City Forum, which remains one of the few occasions for municipal officials from Taiwan and China to meet, has yet to announce a date for a potential 2024 gathering. When asked in August about the forum, Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an told Taiwanese media outlets that at a time when cross-strait tensions are high, it is more necessary for Taiwan and China to maintain communication. 'Such delays serve as a clear reminder that even lower-level engagement is difficult to sustain when one side rejects core aspects of the other’s existence,' Timothy Rich, a political scientist at Western Kentucky University, told VOA in a written response. Since Taiwan President Lai Ching-te took office in May, Beijing has increased military pressure against Taiwan. Against this backdrop, Cole in Taipei said the lack of engagement between Taipei and Beijing may increase the risks of miscalculation, which could lead to accidents and escalation. In his view, Beijing will likely maintain a two-pronged approach against Taiwan in the near future. They will uphold 'a suspension of official dialogue with the Taiwanese government led by the Democratic Progressive Party while keeping the door open to sub-state interaction with other elements of Taiwan’s society, with the aim of dividing both,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/attempts-to-keep-up-exchanges-between-taiwanese-chinese-face-obstacles/7776929.html	2024-09-09T06:31:54-07:00	
Rubble and grief: Morocco’s High Atlas marks one year since record earthquake	IMI N'TALA, Morocco — The rescue crews and bystanders are long gone but the remnants of homes still sit in piles off to the side of the jagged roads. A year after nearly 3,000 people died when a record earthquake shook communities throughout Morocco's High Atlas, it still looks like a bomb just went off in villages like Imi N'tala, where dozens of residents died after a chunk of mountainside cracked off and flattened the majority of buildings. Broken bricks, bent rods of rebar and pieces of kitchen floors remain but have been swept into neater piles alongside plastic tents where the displaced now live. Some await funds to reconstruct their homes. Others await approval of their blueprints. The region shaken by the earthquake is full of impoverished agricultural villages like Imi N’tala, accessible only via bumpy, unmaintained roads. Associated Press reporters revisited half a dozen of them last week ahead of the first anniversary. In some places, residents who say they're awaiting governmental action have begun reconstructing buildings on an ad hoc basis. Elsewhere, people tired of the stuffiness of plastic tents have moved back into their cracked homes or decamped to larger cities, abandoning their old lives. Streets have been neatly swept in towns like Amizmiz and Moulay Brahim, although cracked buildings and piles of rubble remain, much as they were in the days after the quake. The rhythms of normal life have somewhat resumed in some of the province’s larger towns, where rebuilding efforts on roads, homes, schools and businesses are underway and some residents have been provided metal container homes. But many of those displaced from the more than 55,000 homes destroyed by the temblor remain vulnerable to summer’s heat and winter’s cold, living in plastic tents, impatient to return. Mohamed Soumer, a 69-year-old retiree who lost his son in last year's earthquake, is angry because local authorities have forbidden him from rebuilding his home on the same steep mountainside due to safety concerns. He now spends his days with his wife in a plastic tent near his now-rubbled home and fears moving elsewhere and restarting his life in a larger, more expensive area. 'Residents want to stay here because they have land where they grow vegetables to make a living,' he said. 'If they go somewhere else and abandon this place, they will not be able to live there.' The government early on promised households monthly stipends in the aftermath of the earthquake and additional funds for seismically safe reconstruction. It said last week that both had been provided to the majority of eligible families and households. 'Specific solutions are being deployed on the ground for difficult cases,' Morocco's Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. But on the ground, its disbursal has been uneven, residents say, with many still waiting for funds or reconstruction to commence. Anger has mounted against local authorities in towns like Amizmiz and villages like Talat N'Yaqoub, where residents have protested against their living conditions. They have criticized the slow pace of reconstruction and demanded more investment in social services and infrastructure, which has long gone neglected in contrast with Morocco's urban centers and coastline. Officials have said rebuilding will cost 120 billion dirhams ($12 billion) and take about five years. The government has rebuilt some stretches of rural roads, health centers and schools but last week the commission tasked with reconstruction acknowledged the need to speed up some home rebuilding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubble-and-grief-morocco-s-high-atlas-marks-one-year-since-record-earthquake-/7775893.html	2024-09-09T05:38:18-07:00	
Bomb blast hits Pakistan polio team amid national immunization drive	Islamabad — Authorities in northwestern Pakistan said Monday that a roadside bomb explosion injured at least 10 people, including anti-polio vaccinators and police personnel escorting them. The bombing in the South Waziristan district near the border with Afghanistan targeted a convoy carrying polio workers and their guards on the opening day of a nationwide immunization campaign. Area security and hospital officials reported that three health workers and six security personnel were among the victims. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the violence in a region where security forces are fighting militants linked to the outlawed Pakistani Taliban. Last week, Pakistan reported its 17th wild poliovirus case of the year from Islamabad, saying it paralyzed a child and marked the first infection in 16 years in the national capital. Pakistani health officials said in the lead-up to Monday’s polio campaign that it is designed to vaccinate more than 33 million children under five in 115 districts nationwide. Muhammad Anwarul Haq, coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Center for Polio Eradication, stated that the immunization drive would primarily focus on districts where 'the virus has been detected and the risk of continued transmission and spread is really high.' Haq encouraged all parents and caregivers to ensure their children get vaccinated, lamenting that 'parents have not always welcomed and opened their doors to the vaccinators when they visit their homes.' Pakistan and Afghanistan, which reported nine paralytic polio cases so far in 2024, are the only two remaining polio-endemic countries globally. Polio immunization campaigns have long faced multiple challenges in both countries, such as security and vaccine boycotts, dealing setbacks to the goal of eradicating the virus from the world.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bomb-blast-hits-pakistan-polio-team-amid-national-immunization-drive-/7776763.html	2024-09-09T04:13:30-07:00	
South America's rivers hit record lows as Brazil drought impact spreads	ASUNCION — South America's Paraguay River, a key thoroughfare for grains, has hit a record low in Paraguay's capital Asuncion, with water levels depleted by a severe drought upriver in Brazil that has hindered navigation along waterways in the Amazon. The depth of the Paraguay River, measured versus a 'zero' index rather than the riverbed, has dropped below minus 0.82 meter, breaking the previous record low in October 2021, data from the national Meteorology and Hydrology Directorate shows. The body expects the river will keep falling with no rain forecast. The Parana River in Argentina is also near year lows around grains hub Rosario. Both the Paraguay and Parana rivers start in Brazil, eventually joining and flowing into the sea near Buenos Aires. They are important routes for soy, corn and other trade. 'In the northern section [of the Paraguay waterway], navigation is practically halted due to the extreme drop in water levels,' the Paraguayan oilseed and grain crushing chamber CAPPRO told Reuters in written comments. The chamber, whose grain-trader members handle some 60% of Paraguay's soybean exports, said the low river was hitting shipments, though the impact was capped as it was not peak trading season. 'Vessels have had to transport volumes below the average of their normal cargo capacity,' said CAPPRO. 'This has generated delays and made travel times longer.' The chamber's members include ADM, Bunge and Cargill. Expected rains not enough The Paraguay-Parana system is a waterway of more than 3,400 kilometers that runs through Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, as well as landlocked Paraguay and Bolivia. Paraguay is the world's No. 3 soybean exporter and roughly 80% of grains travel along waterways to seaports downriver. Argentina is the top exporter of processed soy, most of which goes down the Parana from around river port city Rosario. Paraguay's deputy director for the Meteorology and Hydrology Directorate, Jorge Sanchez, said the outlook for river levels in the coming months was not encouraging, even with the traditional October-November rainy season ahead. 'This would alleviate the level of the river, but it's not expected to be enough,' Sanchez said. Less rain than normal is expected in the second half of the year due to the La Nina weather phenomenon, which brings drier, cooler conditions in Paraguay and Argentina, though it usually heralds wetter weather farther north in Brazil. Sanchez said this year, however, La Nina was delayed and its effects would be seen only between October and November. 'There is a lot of variability due to climate change,' he added. In Brazil, where record wildfires have also occurred, the low water levels are leaving some communities in the Amazon isolated, as well as hitting soy and corn shipments in center-west states such as Mato Grosso, Brazil's number one grains growing area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-america-s-rivers-hit-record-lows-as-brazil-drought-impact-spreads-/7776746.html	2024-09-09T04:04:14-07:00	
El Salvador police director, accused embezzler killed in helicopter crash	SAN SALVADOR — The head of El Salvador's police forces and a man accused of a multi-million dollar embezzlement were killed when the military helicopter in which they were traveling crashed on Sunday night, the government said. Police director Mauricio Arriaza was escorting former cooperative manager Manuel Coto back to El Salvador. Coto, who was is accused of embezzling $35 million, had been arrested earlier on Sunday in Honduras after attempting to flee to the United States. He was subsequently handed over to Salvadoran police. According to the Salvadoran Armed Forces, the helicopter crashed in the Pasaquina district, in the southeast of the country near the border with Honduras. The total number of people in the helicopter when it crashed remains unknown. President Nayib Bukele said on X: 'What happened cannot remain a simple 'accident'. It must be investigated thoroughly and to the last consequences.' He praised Arriaza for his significant contribution to national security and his roles in various police operations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/el-salvador-police-director-accused-embezzler-killed-in-helicopter-crash-/7776737.html	2024-09-09T03:47:35-07:00

US Congress takes up a series of bills targeting China, from drones to drugs	WASHINGTON — How to curb and counter China's influence and power — through its biotech companies, drones and electric vehicles — will dominate the U.S. House's first week back from summer break, with lawmakers taking up a series of measures targeting Beijing. Washington views Beijing as its biggest geopolitical rival, and the legislation is touted as ensuring the U.S. prevails in the competition. Many of the bills scheduled for a vote this week appear to have both Republican and Democratic support, reflecting strong consensus that congressional actions are needed to counter China. The legislation 'will take meaningful steps to counter the military, economic and ideological threat of the Chinese Communist Party,' said Rep. John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and a Michigan Republican. 'There's a bipartisan goal to win this competition.' Advocacy groups worry about the impact, warning against rhetoric that hurts Asian Americans and could create 'an atmosphere of guilt by association or fuel divisiveness,' said Christine Chen, executive director of Asian & Pacific Islander American Vote. The Chinese Embassy in Washington called the legislation 'new McCarthyism' that hypes the tensions in an election year. If passed, the bills 'will cause serious interference to China-U.S. relations and mutually beneficial cooperation, and will inevitably damage the U.S.'s own interests, image and credibility,' spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a statement. Among the bills are efforts to reduce U.S. reliance on Chinese biotech companies, ban Chinese EVs and drones, restrict Chinese nationals from buying farmland, toughen export restrictions and revive a program to root out spying on U.S. intellectual property. If approved, the measures would still need to clear the Senate. Here's a look at the key legislation: Targeting Beijing-linked biotech A bill seeks to ban a group of five biotechnology companies with Chinese ties from working with anyone that receives federal money. The companies include those that work to help doctors detect genetic causes for cancer or do research and manufacturing for American drugmakers, considered a key step in developing new medications. America's biotech companies have said the bill would disrupt their partnerships with Chinese contractors, resulting in delays in clinical trials for new drugs and higher costs. Supporters say the legislation is necessary to protect U.S. health care data and reduce the country's reliance on China for its medical supply chain. 'American patients cannot be in a position where we rely on China for genomic testing or basic medical supplies,' said Rep. Brad Wenstrup, an Ohio Republican who sponsored the bill. He called it 'the first step' in protecting Americans' genetic data. BGI, one of the Chinese companies named in the bill, called it 'a false flag targeting companies under the premise of national security.' The company, which offers genetic sequencing for research purposes in the U.S., said it follows the law and has no access to Americans' personal data. Banning Chinese drones Another bill would dub drones made by the Chinese company DJI, which dominates the global drone market, 'an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security' and cut its products from U.S. communications networks over data security concerns. The bill would protect Americans' data and critical infrastructure, said Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, who introduced it. 'Congress must use every tool at our disposal to stop' China's 'monopolistic control over the drone market,' she said. DJI argues that users have to 'opt in' to share data such as flight logs, photos and videos with the company. If users don't do so, the company said it won't have data to share with any government when compelled. It also has rejected allegations that it is a Chinese military company and has aided the persecution of members of ethnic Muslim minorities. Adam Bry, co-founder and CEO of major U.S. drone maker Skydio, told a congressional committee in June about losing business to China, where 'the Chinese government has tried to control the drone industry, pouring resources into national champions and taking aim at competitors in the U.S. and the West, tilting the playing field in China's favor.' Protecting intellectual property A challenge is likely against an attempt to revive a Trump-era program described as a way to stop Chinese efforts to steal intellectual property and spy on industry and research. The bill would direct the Justice Department to curb spying by Beijing on U.S. intellectual property and academic institutions and go after people engaged in theft of trade secrets, hacking and economic espionage. The Trump-era program, called the China Initiative, ended in 2022 after multiple unsuccessful prosecutions of researchers and concerns that it had prompted racial and ethnic profiling. Critics also say it chilled cooperation between the U.S. and China in science and technology meant to benefit the greater good. 'Our colleagues in the Republican Party sought to reinstate this failed program because they wanted to look like they were solving problems. But in reality, they were only stoking fear and hatred,' several Democratic lawmakers said in a statement in March, when they fought off another effort to restart the program. Restricting farm sales Another bill, which says it will protect U.S. farmland from foreign adversaries, has raised concerns about discrimination. It would add the agriculture secretary to the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, which reviews the national security implications of foreign transactions. The bill also flags as 'reportable' land sales involving citizens from China, North Korea, Russia and Iran. 'Food security is national security, and for too long, the federal government has allowed the Chinese Communist Party to put our security at risk by turning a blind eye to their steadily increasing purchases of American farmland,' said Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington state, who introduced the bill. The National Agricultural Law Center estimates 24 states ban or limit foreigners without residency and foreign businesses or governments from owning private farmland. The interest emerged after a Chinese billionaire bought more than 130,000 acres near a U.S. Air Force base in Texas and another Chinese company sought to build a corn plant near an Air Force base in North Dakota.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congress-takes-up-a-series-of-bills-targeting-china-from-drones-to-drugs/7776621.html	2024-09-08T21:49:26-07:00	
Republicans fault Biden administration in new report about Afghanistan withdrawal	WASHINGTON — Republicans on a U.S. House of Representatives committee issued a report Sunday criticizing the Biden administration for the chaotic August 2021 U.S. military and diplomatic withdrawal from Afghanistan after a nearly 20-year war. The report faulted President Joe Biden for failing to 'mitigate the likely consequences of the decision' to withdraw, while ignoring warnings that Taliban fighters were seizing key cities in Afghanistan faster than U.S. officials expected. In the last days of the withdrawal, a suicide bombing attack by an Islamic State terrorist killed 13 U.S. soldiers and about 170 Afghan civilians at the Kabul airport. Many Afghans clinging to the underbellies of departing aircraft leaving Afghanistan fell to their deaths. Former President Donald Trump initiated the withdrawal process in February 2020 by signing an agreement with the Taliban, a pact that Biden honored as he looked to end America’s longest war. The fateful withdrawal also played a role in Biden’s political fortunes. Until that time, Americans in national surveys approved of Biden’s performance during the first seven months of his presidency. But his approval rating dipped into negative territory after the chaotic troop withdrawal and the deaths of the 13 soldiers and has never again advanced into a favorable standing. The report from Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee followed a three-year investigation and includes accusations that the Biden administration did not have adequate plans or security in place to safely carry out the withdrawal. Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said the Biden administration 'had the information and opportunity to take necessary steps to plan for the inevitable collapse of the Afghan government, so we could safely evacuate U.S. personnel, American citizens, green card holders, and our brave Afghan allies.' Previous investigations have faulted multiple U.S. administrations, including a 2023 report by the U.S. government watchdog for the U.S. in Afghanistan which cited both Trump’s and Biden’s determination to go forward with the withdrawal despite the Taliban breaking key commitments the militants made in the 2020 agreement. Congressman Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the committee, said in a letter to colleagues that Republicans 'cherry-picked witness testimony to exclude anything unhelpful to a predetermined, partisan narrative about the Afghanistan withdrawal.' In a lengthy statement, the U.S. State Department said, 'There are valid and important criticisms of the two-decade-long war in Afghanistan and how it concluded.' But the country’s top diplomatic agency said it 'has remained focused on evolving and growing from this moment, learning important lessons and making sustainable changes to crisis operations.' The State Department said the U.S. government successfully evacuated 120,000 Americans, Afghans, and third-country nationals from Afghanistan in the final two weeks of August 2021 and has resettled 165,000 Afghans across the U.S. The State Department said it 'stands ready to work alongside' lawmakers who have a 'serious interest' in finding legislative and administrative solutions to avoid the chaos of the withdrawal from the Afghan war zone. But the State Department said it would 'not stand by silently' as the agency and 'its workforce are used to further partisan agendas.' Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/house-republicans-release-partisan-report-blaming-biden-for-chaotic-end-to-us-war-in-afghanistan/7776571.html	2024-09-08T18:13:49-07:00	
Germany’s Scholz calls for faster progress ending Russia's war on Ukraine	FRANKFURT, Germany — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agree that Russia should be included in a future peace conference aimed at ending Russia's war against Ukraine. He called for stepped up efforts to solve the conflict. A previous peace conference June 15-16 in Switzerland ended with 78 countries expressing support for Ukraine’s 'territorial integrity' but otherwise left the path forward unclear. Russia did not participate. 'I believe that now is the moment when we must discuss how we get out of this war situation faster than the current impression is,' Scholz said in an interview with Germany's ZDF public television aired Sunday. 'There will certainly be a further peace conference, and the president and I agree that it must be one with Russia present,' Scholz said. Scholz is facing more political discontent at home over his government's support including money and weapons for Ukraine after populist parties that oppose arming Ukraine did well in state elections Sept. 1 at the expense of parties in his three-party governing coalition. Some members of his Social Democratic Party have also called for more emphasis on diplomacy toward Russia. Zelenskyy has presented a 10-point peace formula that calls for the expulsion of all Russian forces from Ukrainian territory and accountability for war crimes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-s-scholz-calls-for-faster-progress-ending-russia-s-war-on-ukraine-/7776563.html	2024-09-08T17:43:15-07:00	
China’s Xi, Russia's Putin send greetings to North Korea's Kim Jong Un, KCNA says	Seoul, South Korea — Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin sent greetings to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on the occasion of North Korea's founding anniversary, state media KCNA said on Monday. 'I am sure that the comprehensive strategic partnership between Russia and the DPRK will be strengthened in a planned way thanks to our joint efforts,' Putin said, according to KCNA. DPRK is short for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name. Xi called for deeper strategic communication and cooperation with North Korea in his message, KCNA said. Last year, Kim marked the country's founding day on Sept. 9 with a parade of paramilitary groups and diplomatic exchanges in which he vowed to deepen ties with China and Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-russia-s-putin-send-greetings-to-north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-kcna-says/7776548.html	2024-09-08T17:13:04-07:00	
K-pop takes socialist Cuba by storm	Havana, Cuba — Socialist Cuba, the birthplace of salsa and other rhythms that have conquered the world, is now surrendering to the invasion of South Korean pop music. Thirteen thousand kilometers of distance separate the Asian nation and the communist-run island, as well as a different language and cultural traditions. However, all of these barriers would seem to vanish in a split second thanks to K-pop's infectious beat and elaborate choreography. Korean popular music, or K-pop, has spread far and wide from its Asian roots as boy bands like BTS and NCT and their female counterpart Blackpink rival Taylor Swift for downloads and album sales globally. But it was slow to catch on in Cuba, where salsa is king and internet speeds were glacial until recently. On Saturday, far from Seoul, dozens of teenagers clad in plaid, prep school skirts, baggy bomber pants and heavy black eyeliner busted their best moves as images of the genre's idols were projected on a large screen of a Havana dance club. 'K-pop has opened a new world to me,' said 24-year-old Fransico Piedra, who when not working with his father as a blacksmith dreams up meticulous dance steps. Known by his artistic name Ken he one day aspires to be a professional K-pop choreographer. 'It's a place where I can be myself, and share with friends the joy of laughter, song and dance.' Many of the teenagers hope to follow in the footsteps of two Cuban groups — Limitless and LTX — that before the pandemic traveled to South Korea to partake in the K-POP World Festival, an annual talent competition. K-pop — a catch all for musical styles ranging from R&B to rock — first penetrated the island when Cubans fell in love with South Korean soap operas about a decade ago. As internet speeds improved, and government controls eased, more young Cubans got online and started streaming videos like teenagers everywhere. While Cuban kids may be mesmerized by K-pop, an older generation of leaders have had frostier ties to South Korea. The two countries only restored diplomatic relations that were severed following the 1959 Cuban revolution this year and have yet to exchange ambassadors. Meanwhile, Cuba remains a staunch ally of North Korea, which views K-pop as a dangerous form of propaganda from a capitalist enemy with whom is has been locked in a military standoff since the 1950s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/k-pop-takes-socialist-cuba-by-storm/7776232.html	2024-09-08T16:54:56-07:00	
Russian troops take Ukrainian town in advance on Pokrovsk	Moscow — Russia said on Sunday its forces had taken full control of a town in eastern Ukraine as Moscow's forces advance on the strategically important city of Pokrovsk and seek to pierce the Ukrainian defensive front lines. Russian forces, which control about a fifth of Ukraine since invading in February 2022, are advancing in eastern Ukraine in an attempt to take the whole of the Donbas, which is about half the size of the U.S. state of Ohio. Russia's defense ministry said its forces had taken the town of Novohrodivka, which lies 12 kilometers from Pokrovsk, an important rail and road hub for Ukrainian forces in the area. The town had a population of 14,000 before the war. Yuri Podolyaka, an influential Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger, published maps showing Russian forces attacking beyond Novohrodivka in at least two places less than 7 kilometers from Pokrovsk. The General Staff of the Ukrainian military, in a report issued on Sunday evening, gave details of fighting throughout the Pokrovsk sector, including Novohrodivka. It said 29 attempted Russian advances had been repelled, with seven skirmishes continuing. 'Our troops are taking measures to maintain designated positions,' it said. But an interview with a Ukrainian officer broadcast last week by U.S.-funded Radio Liberty said Ukrainian forces had abandoned Novohrodivka on grounds that the positions there were not favorable for defending it. Popular Ukrainian war blog DeepState said Russian forces had captured the village of Nevelske, to the southeast. Reuters was unable to immediately verify battlefield reports from either side due to restrictions on reporting in the war. President Vladimir Putin said last week that a Ukrainian incursion into the Russian region of Kursk had failed to slow Russia's own advance in eastern Ukraine and had weakened Kyiv's defenses along the front line in a boost to Moscow. Ukraine's top military commander said on Thursday that Kyiv's incursion into the Kursk region was working. Russian forces, he said, had made no progress in their advance on Pokrovsk for the previous six days. He said that one of the objectives of the Kursk incursion was to divert Russian forces from other areas, primarily Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Russia had diverted large numbers to Kursk but was also strengthening the Pokrovsk front, he added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said the Kursk operation was also to prevent Russian forces from crossing the border in the opposite direction. Russia currently controls about 80% of the Donbas. Given the speed of recent Russian advances in the east, some Russian war bloggers have raised concern about the army overreaching itself. Putin ordered tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine more than two and a half years ago in what he calls a special military operation. Ukraine and its Western backers have vowed to defeat Russian forces and expel all Russian troops.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-troops-take-ukrainian-town-in-advance-on-pokrovsk/7776225.html	2024-09-08T16:14:32-07:00

India isolates 'suspected mpox case'	New Delhi — India reported Sunday that it had put a 'suspected mpox case' into isolation, assuring that the world's most populous nation had 'robust measures' in place, the health ministry said in a statement. There have been no confirmed cases of mpox in India, a country of 1.4 billion people. 'A young male patient, who recently traveled from a country currently experiencing mpox transmission, has been identified as a suspect case of mpox,' the health ministry said in a statement. 'The patient has been isolated in a designated hospital and is currently stable,' it said, adding the samples 'are being tested to confirm the presence of mpox.' It gave no further details of where he may have contracted the disease. 'There is no cause of any undue concern,' the statement added. 'The country is fully prepared to deal with such (an) isolated travel related case and has robust measures in place to manage and mitigate any potential risk.' Mpox's resurgence and the detection in the Democratic Republic of Congo of a new strain, dubbed Clade 1b, prompted the World Health Organization to declare its highest international alert level on August 14. Mpox has also been detected in Asia and Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-isolates-suspected-mpox-case/7776214.html	2024-09-08T15:12:31-07:00	
Massive opposition rally in Pakistan calls for release of jailed ex-PM Khan	Islamabad — Thousands of supporters of Pakistan's imprisoned former prime minister, Imran Khan, rallied on the outskirts of Islamabad Sunday to denounce his 'illegal' incarceration and demand his immediate release. Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party organized the public gathering, one of the largest in the Pakistani capital's history. The strong turnout came despite the police blocking the officially designated route for rally participants with shipping containers in an apparent bid to restrict convoys from other cities from reaching the venue. The administration also deployed riot police to prevent possible unrest. Social media videos and images showed PTI workers and leaders from elsewhere in Pakistan marching toward Islamabad. PTI activists were seen successfully removing containers to clear the way at several entry points. Police briefly clashed with and fired tear gas shells on PTI workers en route to the rally. Authorities later reported injuries to several police personnel due to stone pelting allegedly from Khan supporters, charges party leaders rejected. 'We will continue our efforts until Khan is freed from prison,' Hammad Azhar, a central PTI leader, told the rally. Critics observed that Sunday’s rally demonstrated once again that the 71-year-old former cricket star-turned-prime minister remains Pakistan’s most popular politician despite facing a series of state-backed criminal prosecutions and lawsuits. 'Strong turnout for PTI rally despite the state's tactics to limit numbers through roadblocks and containers, and despite the risk of violent crackdowns and arrests,' Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at Washington’s Wilson Center, said on X. 'Its size and popularity ensure its mobilization capabilities remain intact despite relentless attempts to curb it,' Kugelman wrote. Khan completed 400 days in prison on Sunday. The charges against him range from corruption to sedition to stoking violent anti-army protests. He rejects all the allegations as politically motivated and asserts that the powerful Pakistani military is behind them to block his return to power. Subsequently, appeals courts have overturned or suspended all his convictions for lack of evidence, but authorities quickly launched new charges to prevent him from leaving prison. The United Nations in July declared Khan’s detention arbitrary, saying there was no legal basis for keeping him in prison. Mushahid Hussain, who recently retired from Pakistan’s Senate, the upper house of parliament, criticized Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government for 'barricading Islamabad' through containers and coercion and for creating an 'atmosphere of fear & force' in its attempt to block Sunday’s political rally. Hussain warned through a post on X that such efforts would impede political stability and economic recovery. '’Common Sense’ can be quite Uncommon!' he wrote. Sunday’s rally by the PTI in Islamabad was its first since parliamentary elections on February 8. Khan’s convictions at the time barred him from running, but his party candidates emerged winners of most seats in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, but not enough to form the government. The PTI alleged the vote was massively rigged to prevent its candidates from sweeping the polls. This allowed military-backed rival political parties to form a coalition administration with Sharif as prime minister. Hundreds of PTI workers and leaders, including women, have been jailed or under trial on charges defense attorneys reject as baseless and part of the state crackdown on the party. Khan served as Pakistan’s prime minister from 2018 until April 2022, when he was ousted through an opposition parliamentary no-confidence vote he alleges was planned by the military. Successive Pakistani governments and military officials have denied the allegations. Last month, his party announced that Khan had formally applied to run for chancellor of the University of Oxford in Britain from his prison cell. The election university website states that the new chancellor will be elected through an unprecedented online ballot process beginning on October 28. Khan, an Oxford graduate, served as the chancellor of University of Bradford from 2005 to 2014.	https://www.voanews.com/a/massive-opposition-rally-in-pakistan-calls-for-release-of-jailed-ex-pm-khan/7776212.html	2024-09-08T14:56:28-07:00	
China plans to allow wholly foreign-owned hospitals in some areas	Beijing — China said Sunday it would allow the establishment of wholly foreign-owned hospitals in nine areas of the country including the capital, as Beijing tries to attract more foreign investment to boost its flagging economy. In a document on the official website of China's commerce ministry, it said the new policy was a pilot project designed to implement a pledge the ruling Communist Party's Central Committee led by President Xi Jinping made at its July plenum meeting held roughly every five years. 'In order to ... introduce foreign investment to promote the high-quality development of China's medical-related fields, and better meet the medical and health needs of the people, it is planned to carry out pilot work of expanding opening-up in the medical field,' according to the document. The project will allow the establishment of such hospitals in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hainan — all relatively wealthy cities or provinces in eastern or southern China. The new policy excludes hospitals practicing traditional Chinese medicine and 'mergers and acquisitions of public hospitals,' the document read, adding that the specific conditions, requirements and procedures for setting up such foreign-owned hospitals would be detailed soon. The policy also allows companies with foreign investors to engage in the development and application of gene and human stem cell technologies for treatment and diagnosis in the pilot free-trade zones of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hainan. This includes registration, marketing and production of products that can be bought nationwide, according to the document. The removal of restrictions on foreign investment in these fields comes as the world's second-largest economy faces growing headwinds with flagging foreign business sentiment, one of the issues threatening growth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-plans-to-allow-wholly-foreign-owned-hospitals-in-some-areas/7776190.html	2024-09-08T13:53:24-07:00	
Thousands protest Mexican judicial reform	Mexico City — Thousands of Mexicans, mainly court employees and law students, protested in the capital Sunday against a controversial judicial reform that would see judges elected by popular vote. They gathered in Mexico City as the Senate prepared to debate the initiative pushed by outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and approved by the lower house, called the Chamber of Deputies, in which the ruling party holds sway. The proposed reform, which would see the election of judges of the Supreme Court and other tribunals as well as magistrates, has sparked diplomatic tensions with the United States, prompted protests by opponents, and upset financial markets. 'The judiciary will not fall,' changed protesters who marched on the Senate, expected to vote on the proposal Wednesday. Striking judicial workers have asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the matter, a request that Lopez Obrador has said had no legal basis. The United States, Mexico's main trading partner, has warned that the reforms would threaten a relationship that relies on investor confidence in the Mexican legal framework. Lopez Obrador, who will be replaced by his ally Claudia Sheinbaum on October 1, argues that the change was warranted because courts serve the interests of the political and economic elite.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-protest-mexican-judicial-reform/7776191.html	2024-09-08T13:52:13-07:00	
Iran's president to visit Iraq on first foreign trip	Tehran, Iran — Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian will visit neighboring Iraq on Wednesday, state media reported Sunday, in what will be his first trip abroad since he took office in July. Pezeshkian will head a high-ranking Iranians delegation to Baghdad to meet senior Iraqi officials. The visit comes at the invitation of Iraq's premier, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, the official IRNA news agency quoted Iran's ambassador to Baghdad Mohammad Kazem Al-Sadegh as saying. The two countries will sign memoranda of understanding on cooperation and security, Sadegh said, without elaborating. He said the agreements were to have been signed during a planned visit to Iraq by Iran's late president, Ebrahim Raisi. But Raisi was killed in May along with the then-foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, when their helicopter crashed on a fog-shrouded mountainside in northern Iran. Since taking office, Pezeshkian has vowed to 'prioritize' strengthening ties with the Islamic republic's neighbors. Relations between Iran and Iraq, both Shiite-majority countries, have grown closer over the past two decades. Tehran is one of Iraq's leading trade partners and wields considerable political influence in Baghdad, where its Iraqi allies dominate parliament and the current government. In March 2023 the two countries signed a security agreement covering their common border, months after Tehran struck Kurdish opposition groups in Iraq's north. They have since agreed to disarm Iranian Kurdish rebel groups and remove them from border areas. Tehran accuses the groups of importing arms from Iraq and of fomenting 2022 protests that erupted after the death in custody of Iranian-Kurd woman Mahsa Amini. In January, Iran launched a deadly strike in northern Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, saying it had targeted a site used by 'spies of the Zionist regime (Mossad),' an apparent reference to Israel. On Saturday, an exiled Iranian Kurdish group said one of its activists, Behzad Khosrawi, had been arrested in Iraq's northern city of Sulaimaniyah and handed over to 'Iranian intelligence.' Local Asayesh security forces said Khosrawi was arrested 'because he did not have residency' in the Kurdish region, and denied he had any connection to 'political activism.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-president-to-visit-iraq-on-first-foreign-trip/7776182.html	2024-09-08T13:42:21-07:00

At least 48 killed in Nigerian fuel truck explosion	MAIDUGURI — At least 48 people were killed Sunday in a fuel tanker truck explosion following a collision with another vehicle in Niger state in north-central Nigeria, the state's disaster management agency said. The State Emergency Management Agency in north-central Niger state said the fuel truck collided with a truck carrying travelers and cattle. Several other vehicles were also caught up in the accident, it said. Local media reported that two of the other vehicles — a crane truck and a pickup van —were involved in the accident and caught in the fire. The emergency management agency's spokesperson Hussaini Ibrahim put the death toll at 48 and officials were still trying to clear the scene of the incident. Nigeria's state-owned firm NNPC Ltd last week hiked the price of gasoline by at least 39%, the second major increase in more than a year but shortages have continued, forcing motorists to queue for hours in the country's major cities and towns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-48-killed-in-nigerian-fuel-truck-explosion-/7776114.html	2024-09-08T11:02:43-07:00

President Abdelmadjid Tebboune elected to serve second term leading gas-rich Algeria	ALGIERS — President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has been named the winner of Algeria's presidential election, granting him another term leading the gas-rich North African nation five years after pro-democracy protests led to the ouster of his predecessor. In a result that surprised few observers internationally or in Algeria, the country's independent election authority on Sunday announced that Tebboune had won 94% of the vote, far outpacing his challengers Islamist Abdelali Hassani Cherif, who won 3% and socialist Youcef Aouchiche, who won 2.1%. Election officials reported less than six million of the country's 24 million voters had turned out to vote on Saturday, perpetuating the low voter turnout rates that marred Tebboune's first term and raised questions about his popular support. Algeria is Africa's largest country by area and, with almost 45 million people, it's the continent's second most populous after South Africa to hold presidential elections in 2024 — a year in which more than 50 elections are being held worldwide, encompassing more than half the world's population. Throughout the campaign, activists and international organizations, including Amnesty International, railed against the campaign season's repressive atmosphere and the harassment and prosecutions of those involved in opposition parties, media organizations and civil society groups. Some denounced this election as a rubber stamp exercise that can only entrench the status quo. But Tebboune and his two challengers each urged political participation and specifically made overtures to the Algerian youth, who make up a majority of the population and disproportionately suffer from poverty and unemployment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/president-abdelmadjid-tebboune-elected-to-serve-second-term-leading-gas-rich-algeria-/7776077.html	2024-09-08T10:13:59-07:00	
For many leaving China, it's Japan — not the US — that's the bigger draw	TOKYO — One by one, the students, lawyers and others filed into a classroom in a central Tokyo university for a lecture by a Chinese journalist on Taiwan and democracy — taboo topics that can't be discussed publicly back home in China. 'Taiwan's modern-day democracy took struggle and bloodshed, there's no question about that,' said Jia Jia, a columnist and guest lecturer at the University of Tokyo who was briefly detained in China eight years ago on suspicion of penning a call for China's top leader to resign. He is one of tens of thousands of intellectuals, investors and other Chinese who have relocated to Japan in recent years, part of a larger exodus of people from China. Their backgrounds vary widely, and they're leaving for all sorts of reasons. Some are very poor, others are very rich. Some leave for economic reasons, as opportunities dry up with the end of China's boom. Some flee for personal reasons, as even limited freedoms are eroded. Chinese migrants are flowing to all corners of the world, from workers seeking to start businesses of their own in Mexico to burned-out students heading to Thailand. Those choosing Japan tend to be well-off or highly educated, drawn to the country's ease of living, rich culture and immigration policies that favor highly skilled professionals, with less of the sharp anti-immigrant backlash sometimes seen in Western countries. Jia initially intended to move to the U.S., not Japan. But after experiencing the coronavirus outbreak in China, he was anxious to leave and his American visa application was stuck in processing. So he chose Japan instead. 'In the United States, illegal immigration is particularly controversial. When I went to Japan, I was a little surprised. I found that their immigration policy is actually more relaxed than I thought,' Jia told The Associated Press. 'I found that Japan is better than the U.S.' It's tough to enter the U.S. these days. Tens of thousands of Chinese were arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border over the past year, and Chinese students have been grilled at customs as trade frictions fan suspicions of possible industrial espionage. Some U.S. states passed legislation that restricts Chinese citizens from owning property. 'The U.S. is shutting out those Chinese that are friendliest to them, that most share its values,' said Li Jinxing, a Christian human rights lawyer who moved to Japan in 2022. Li sees parallels to about a century ago, when Chinese intellectuals such as Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of modern China, moved to Japan to study how the country modernized so quickly. 'On one hand, we hope to find inspiration and direction in history,' Li said of himself and like-minded Chinese in Japan. 'On the other hand, we also want to observe what a democratic country with rule of law is like. We're studying Japan. How does its economy work, its government work?' Over the past decade, Tokyo has softened its once-rigid stance against immigration, driven by low birthrates and an aging population. Foreigners now make up about 2% of its population of 125 million. That's expected to jump to 12% by 2070, according to the Tokyo-based National Institute of Population and Social Security Research. Chinese are the most numerous newcomers, at 822,000 last year among more than 3 million foreigners living in Japan, according to government data. That's up from 762,000 a year ago and 649,000 a decade ago. In 2022, the lockdowns under China's 'zero COVID' policies led many of the country's youth or most affluent citizens to hit the exits. There's even a buzzword for that: 'runxue,' using the English word 'run' to evoke 'running away' to places seen as safer and more prosperous. For intellectuals like Li and Jia, Japan offers greater freedoms than under Chinese leader Xi Jinping's increasingly repressive rule. But for others, such as wealthy investors and business people, Japan offers something else: property protections. A report by investment migration firm Henley & Partners says nearly 14,000 millionaires left China last year, the most of any country in the world, with Japan a popular destination. A major driver is worries about the security of their wealth in China or Hong Kong, said Q. Edward Wang, a professor of Asian studies at Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey. 'Protection of private property, which is the cornerstone of a capitalist society, that piece is missing in China,' Wang said. The weakening yen makes buying property and other local assets in Japan a bargain. And while the Japanese economy has stagnated, China's once-sizzling economy is also in a rut, with the property sector in crisis and stock prices stuck at the level they were in the late 2000s. 'If you are just going to Japan to preserve your money,' Wang said, 'then definitely you will enjoy your time in Japan.' Dot.com entrepreneurs are among those leaving China after Communist Party crackdowns on the technology industry, including billionaire Jack Ma, a founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, who took a professorship at Tokyo College, part of the prestigious University of Tokyo. So many wealthy Chinese have bought apartments in Tokyo's luxury high-rises that some areas have been dubbed 'Chinatowns,' or 'Digital Chinatowns' — a nod to the many owners' work in high-tech industries. 'Life in Japan is good,' said Guo Yu, an engineer who retired early after working at ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. Guo doesn't concern himself with politics. He's keen on Japan's powdery snow in the winter and is a 'superfan' of its beautiful hot springs. He owns homes in Tokyo, as well as near a ski resort and a hot spring. He owns several cars, including a Porsche, a Mercedes, a Tesla and a Toyota. Guo keeps busy with a new social media startup in Tokyo and a travel agency specializing in 'onsen,' Japan's hot springs. Most of his employees are Chinese, he said. Like Guo, many Chinese moving to Japan are wealthy and educated. That's for good reason: Japan remains unwelcoming to refugees and many other types of foreigners. The government has been strategic about who it allows to stay, generally focusing on people to fill labor shortages for factories, construction and elder care. 'It is crucial that Japan becomes an attractive country for foreign talent so they will choose to work here,' Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said earlier this year, announcing efforts to relax Japan's stringent immigration restrictions. That kind of opportunity is exactly what Chinese ballet dancer Du Hai said he has found. Leading a class of a dozen Japanese students in a suburban Tokyo studio one recent weekend, Du demonstrated positions and spins to the women dressed in leotards and toe shoes. Du was drawn to Japan's huge ballet scene, filled with professional troupes and talented dancers, he said, but worried about warnings he got about unfriendly Japanese. That turned out to be false, he said with a laugh. Now, Du is considering getting Japanese citizenship. 'Of course, I enjoy living in Japan very much now,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/for-many-leaving-china-it-s-japan-not-the-us-that-s-the-bigger-draw/7772102.html	2024-09-08T09:52:10-07:00

Venezuela opposition leader Gonzalez lands in Spain seeking asylum	CARACAS/MADRID — Venezuelan opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez flew into Spain on Sunday to seek asylum, Madrid said, hours after quitting his country amid a political and diplomatic crisis over July's disputed election. Gonzalez — who has challenged President Nicolas Maduro's declaration of victory — arrived at the Torrejon de Ardoz military base with his wife, Spain's foreign ministry said in a statement. The exit of the 75-year-old — seen by the U.S., the EU and other powers in the region as the winner of the vote — came a week after Venezuelan authorities issued an arrest warrant for him, accusing him of conspiracy and other crimes. 'Today is a sad day for democracy in Venezuela,' European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement. 'In a democracy, no political leader should be forced to seek asylum in another country.' Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said on Instagram authorities had given Gonzalez safe passage in a bid to restore 'political peace.' He left Venezuela after 'voluntarily seeking refuge in the Spanish embassy in Caracas several days ago,' she wrote. Spain's foreign ministry said there had been no talks between the Spanish and the Venezuelan governments on Gonzalez's exit. Venezuela's opposition say the July 28 election resulted in a resounding victory for Gonzalez, and published vote tallies online that they say show he won. Maduro has dismissed all such assertions and says there was a right-wing plot to sabotage his government. Gonzalez's move to Spain marked another jolting shift in the fortunes of the former diplomat who came out of retirement and took over the candidacy in March, initially as a placeholder after opposition leader Maria Corina Machado and then another replacement could not stand. Machado confirmed on X that Gonzalez was now in Spain, adding he had fled to protect his 'freedom, his integrity and his life.' 'The increasing threats, summons, arrest warrants and even the attempts at blackmail and coercion to which he has been subjected show that the regime has no scruples or limits in its obsession to silence him and try to break him,' she wrote. Gonzalez would continue to fight for the opposition from Spain, while she would continue to do so within Venezuela, Machado said, and vowed that on 10 January 2025, he would be sworn in as the country's president. Carmen Beatriz, a political communication and public opinion analyst at the University of Navarra told Reuters Gonzalez's role was important, but Machado is the leader of the process. 'He can become an articulator of international initiatives and interlocutor from the outside,' she said. Spain's foreign ministry said Gonzalez's asylum process would now start - 'the resolution of which will be favorable in view of Spain's commitment to the political rights and physical integrity of all Venezuelan men and women, especially political leaders.' Gonzalez had sought refuge in the Dutch and then the Spanish embassy in Venezuela after the election, Dutch and Venezuelan officials said. Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said in a letter to his parliament on Sunday that Gonzalez had urgently requested refuge in the Dutch embassy the day after the election. 'At the beginning of September, Edmundo Gonzalez indicated that he ... wanted to leave and continue his fight from Spain,' Veldkamp added. Spanish officials, including former Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, linked to diplomatic relations in the South American country in the past, were involved in a week of negotiations with Venezuelan authorities for Gonzalez to leave the country, a source with knowledge of the talks told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Opposition to keep protesting That Maduro allowed Gonzalez's departure despite the arrest warrant he was facing may soften some harsh recent international criticism of him. Machado, though, remains subject of an investigation and has largely been sequestered at an unknown location since the vote, emerging only occasionally to lead rallies. Gonzalez's departure came less than 24 hours after security forces surrounded Argentina's former embassy in Caracas, now being protected by Brazil, where six opposition staffers have been sheltering since warrants were issued for them in March. Attorney General Tarek Saab, who met with Gonzalez's lawyer this week and who has been one of the opposition's most strident accusers, is set to hold a press conference later on Sunday. The opposition is pressing for more street protests and international pressure for its victory to be recognized, but so far those tactics have borne no fruit, with military leaders lining up behind Maduro, and no stepped-up sanctions or other international action since the vote amid waning attendance at anti-government rallies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-revokes-brazil-s-authorization-to-represent-argentine-interests-in-the-country-/7775494.html	2024-09-08T09:10:22-07:00

NATO member Romania says Russian drone violated its airspace	Kyiv, Ukraine — A Russian drone violated Romania's airspace during nighttime attacks on neighboring Ukraine, the NATO member reported Sunday, urging Moscow to stop what it described as an escalation. The incident occurred as Russia carried out attacks on 'civilian targets and port infrastructure' across the Danube River in Ukraine, Romania's Ministry of National Defense said. Romania deployed F-16 warplanes to monitor its airspace, and NATO allies were kept informed, the ministry said. Romanian emergency authorities also issued text alerts to residents of two eastern regions. Preliminary data indicates there may be an 'impact zone' in an uninhabited area near the Romanian village of Periprava, the ministry said. It added that an investigation is underway. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Romania has confirmed drone fragments on its territory on several occasions and as recently as July this year. The Romanian Defense Ministry strongly condemned the Russian attacks on Ukraine, calling them 'unjustified and in serious contradiction with the norms of international law.' Mircea Geoana, NATO's outgoing deputy secretary-general and Romania's former top diplomat, said the military alliance also condemned Russia’s violation of Romanian airspace. 'While we have no information indicating an intentional attack by Russia against Allies, these acts are irresponsible and potentially dangerous,' he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Civilians reported killed in Ukraine In Ukraine, two civilians died and four more suffered wounds in a nighttime Russian airstrike on the northern city of Sumy, the regional military administration reported. Two children were among those wounded, the administration said. In the Kharkiv region in the east, overnight shelling killed two elderly women, according to local Governor Oleh Syniehubov. During the night, Ukrainian air defenses shot down one of four cruise missiles and 15 of 23 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Russia, Ukraine's air force reported. It added that none of the cruise missiles had hit targets. Later Sunday, three women were killed after Russian forces shelled a village in the eastern Donetsk region, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on the Telegram messaging app. Elsewhere in the province, rescue teams pulled the bodies of two men from the rubble of a hotel that was destroyed Saturday evening in a Russian airstrike, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service. That same day, the death toll rose to 58 from the massive Russian missile strike that blasted a military academy Tuesday and a nearby hospital in the eastern city of Poltava, regional Governor Filip Pronin reported. More than 320 others were wounded. Since it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, the Russian military has repeatedly used missiles to smash civilian targets, sometimes killing scores of people in a single attack. Poltava is about 350 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, on the main highway and rail route between Kyiv and Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, which is close to the Russian border. The attack happened as Ukrainian forces sought to carve out their holdings in Russia’s Kursk border region after a surprise incursion that began Aug. 6, as the Russian army hacks its way deeper into eastern Ukraine. Russian forces continued their monthslong grinding push toward the city of Pokrovsk, and ramped up attacks near the town of Kurakhove farther south, Ukraine's General Staff reported. Russia's Defense Ministry said Sunday its troops had taken Novohrodivka, a small town some 19 kilometers (11 miles) southeast of Pokrovsk. An update published Saturday evening by DeepState, a Ukrainian battlefield analysis site, said Russian forces had 'advanced' in Novohrodivka and captured Nevelske, a village in the southeast of the Pokrovsk district. Pokrovsk, which had a prewar population of about 60,000, is one of Ukraine’s main defensive strongholds and a key logistics hub in the Donetsk region. Its capture would compromise Ukraine’s defense and supply routes and would bring Russia closer to its stated aim of capturing the entire Donetsk region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-member-romania-says-russian-drone-violated-its-airspace/7775995.html	2024-09-08T08:12:07-07:00	
UN official says Sudan's war has killed at least 20,000 people	Cairo — More than 16 months of war in Sudan has killed more than 20,000 people, a senior United Nations official said Sunday, a grim figure amid a devastating conflict that has wrecked the northeastern African country. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, gave the tally at a news conference in Sudan’s Red Sea city of Port Sudan, which serves as the seat of the internationally recognized, military-backed government. He said the death toll could be much higher. 'Sudan is suffering through a perfect storm of crisis,' Tedros said as he wrapped up his two-day visit to Sudan. 'The scale of the emergency is shocking, as is the insufficient action being taken to curtail the conflict.' Sudan was plunged into chaos in April last year when simmering tensions between the military and a powerful paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, exploded into open warfare across the country. The conflict has turned the capital, Khartoum, and other urban areas into battlefields, wrecking civilian infrastructure and an already battered health care system. Without the basics, many hospitals and medical facilities have closed their doors. The conflict has created the world’s largest displacement crisis. More than 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes since fighting began, according to the International Organization for Migration. They include over 2.3 million who have fled to neighboring countries as refugees. The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the U.N. and international rights groups. On Friday, U.N.-backed human rights investigators urged the creation of an 'independent and impartial force' to protect civilians, blaming both sides for war crimes including murder, mutilation and torture. Devastating seasonal floods in recent weeks have compounded the misery. Dozens of people have been killed and critical infrastructure has been washed away in 12 of Sudan’s 18 provinces, according to local authorities. A cholera outbreak is the latest calamity for the country. The disease has killed at least 165 and sickened about 4,200 others in recent weeks, the health ministry said in its latest update Friday. 'We are calling on the world to wake up and help Sudan out of the nightmare it’s living through,' Tedros said, adding that an immediate cease-fire is urgently required. 'The best medicine is peace,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-rejects-un-call-for-impartial-force-to-protect-civilians-/7775918.html	2024-09-08T05:50:57-07:00	
Sudan rejects UN call for 'impartial force' to protect civilians	Port Sudan, Sudan — Sudan has rejected a call by U.N. experts for the deployment of an 'independent and impartial force' to protect millions of civilians driven from their homes by more than a year of war. The conflict since April last year, pitting the army against paramilitary forces, has killed tens of thousands of people and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The independent U.N. experts said Friday their fact-finding mission had uncovered 'harrowing' violations by both sides, 'which may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. They called for 'an independent and impartial force with a mandate to safeguard civilians' to be deployed 'without delay.' The Sudanese foreign ministry, which is loyal to the army under General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said in a statement late Saturday that 'the Sudanese government rejects in their entirety the recommendations of the U.N. mission.' It called the U.N. Human Rights Council, which created the fact-finding mission last year, 'a political and illegal body', and the panel's recommendations 'a flagrant violation of their mandate.' The U.N. experts said eight million civilians have been displaced and another two million people have fled to neighboring countries. More than 25 million people upwards of half the country's population — face acute food shortages. World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on a visit to Sudan on Sunday, said: 'The scale of the emergency is shocking, as is the insufficient action being taken to curtail the conflict and respond to the suffering it is causing.' In Port Sudan, where government offices and the United Nations have relocated to due to the intense fighting in the capital Khartoum, Tedros called on the 'world to wake up and help Sudan out of the nightmare it is living through'. The Sudanese foreign ministry statement accused the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by Burhan's former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, of 'systematically targeting civilians and civilian institutions'. 'The protection of civilians remains an absolute priority for the Sudanese government,' it said. The statement added that the U.N. Human Rights Council's role should be 'to support the national process, rather than seek to impose a different exterior mechanism'. It also rejected the experts' call for an arms embargo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-rejects-un-call-for-impartial-force-to-protect-civilians/7776853.html	2024-09-08T05:50:21-07:00	
Family keeps up Beirut dessert tradition	Beirut — At a shop nestled in a busy, crowded Beirut district, Hasan El-Makary is weighing out containers of warm, fragrant mufataka, a traditional sweet in the Lebanese capital that is rarely found in stores. 'I've been in this shop for 50 years, but we started specializing in mufataka 30 years ago,' Makary said from the humble shop with its aging decor and low ceiling. A kind of rice pudding made with turmeric, tahini sesame paste, sugar and pine nuts, mufataka is traditional in Beirut but less known even outside the city. Makary, 73, said he used to sell other sweets but as demand grew for mufataka, he abandoned the rest and now he and his cousin – who is also his business partner – just make the yellow pudding. 'At the beginning you add turmeric, that's the main thing, then tahini, sugar and rice ... we cook it slowly on fire,' he said. The rice must be soaked overnight, and Makary said he comes to the shop at 5:00 a.m. to make the dish, which takes around four hours and requires regular stirring. He said his father started making mufataka despite initially believing people would not pay money for a dish that is normally prepared at home. Plastic containers of the pudding, which is eaten with a spoon, dotted trays and tables across the shop, waiting for customers who peered through a window to place their order from the busy street outside. Customer Iman Chehab, 55, was picking up mufataka for her mother, who used to make it herself. 'She is elderly now and she can't stir ... it takes a lot of work,' said Chehab, who works in human resources management. The dish is 'something traditional for us who are from Beirut,' she told AFP. Places like Makary's shop 'are the old face of Beirut that we love and always want to remember,' she added. 'Heritage' A few bustling neighborhoods away, Samir Makari, 35, is carrying on the family tradition. At a gleaming shop also selling Arabic sweets like baklava, Makari attends to a huge copper pot of mufataka behind the counter, stirring it with a long, wooden-handled implement. He weighs out and mixes the sugar, tahini paste and pine nuts in a second pot, later combining it all. Mufataka used to be made just once a year on the last Wednesday in April, with families gathering by the sea at Beirut's public beach, father and son said. The occasion was 'Job's Wednesday,' a reference to the biblical figure also mentioned in the Koran and who is renowned for his patience, the younger Makari said, noting the virtue is also required for making mufataka. On the wall of his shop, which he runs with his brother, were photos of his father and his grandfather at work. He said he sometimes makes mufataka twice a day depending on demand, with some customers taking it outside Beirut to introduce it to those who do not know the dish. At the original store, the elder Makary said he was happy his children had kept up the tradition. Mufataka is part of 'my heritage,' he said, and the family has 'taken it from generation to generation.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/family-keeps-up-beirut-dessert-tradition/7771087.html	2024-09-08T03:32:08-07:00	
Pakistan hasn't learned lessons from 2022 deadly floods, experts say	ISLAMABAD — Millions of people in Pakistan continue to live along the path of floodwaters, showing neither people nor the government have learned lessons from the 2022 devastating floods that killed 1,737 people, experts said Thursday, as an aid group said half of the 300 victims killed by rains since July are children. Heavy rainfall is drenching those areas that were badly hit by the deluges two years ago. The charity Save the Children said in a statement that floods and heavy rains have killed more than 150 children in Pakistan since the start of the monsoon season, making up more than half of all deaths in rain-affected areas. The group said that 200 children have also been injured in Pakistan because of rains, which have also displaced thousands of people. Save the Children also said that people affected by floods were living in a relief camp in Sanghar, a district in the southern Sindh province, which was massively hit by floods two years ago. 'The rains and floods have destroyed 80% of cotton crops in Sanghar, the primary source of income for farmers, and killed hundreds of livestock,' the charity said, and added that it's supporting the affected people with help from a local partner. Khuram Gondal, the country director for Save the Children in Pakistan, said that children were always the most affected in a disaster. 'We need to ensure that the immediate impacts of the floods and heavy rains do not become long-term problems. In Sindh province alone, more than 72,000 children have seen their education disrupted,' he said. Another charity, U.K.-based Islamic Relief, also said weeks of torrential rains in Pakistan have again triggered displacement and suffering among communities that were already devastated by the 2022 floods and are still in the process of rebuilding their lives and livelihoods. Asif Sherazi, the group's country director, said his organization is reaching out to flood-affected people. There was no immediate response from the country’s ministry of climate change and national disaster management authority. Pakistan has yet to undertake major reconstruction work because the government didn't receive most of the funds out of the $9 billion that were pledged by the international community at last year's donors' conference in Geneva. 'We learned no lessons from that 2022 floods. Millions of people have built mud-brick homes on the paths of rivers, which usually remain dry,' said Mohsin Leghari, who served as irrigation minister years ago. Leghari said that less rain is predicted for Pakistan for monsoon season compared with 2022, when climate-induced floods caused $30 billion in damage to the country's economy. 'But the floodwater has inundated several villages in my own Dera Ghazi Khan district in the Punjab province,' Leghari said. 'Floods have affected farmers, and my own land has once again come under the floodwater.' Wasim Ehsan, an architect, said Pakistan was still not prepared to handle any 2022-like situation mainly because people ignore construction laws while building homes and even hotels in urban and rural areas. He said the floods in 2022 caused damage in the northwest because people had built homes and hotels after slightly diverting a river. 'This is reason that a hotel was destroyed by the Swat River in 2022,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-hasn-t-learned-lessons-from-2022-deadly-floods-experts-say/7772534.html	2024-09-08T03:27:02-07:00	
Shooting attack at the West Bank-Jordan border crossing kills 3 Israelis	ALLENBY CROSSING, West Bank — Three Israelis were shot and killed Sunday at the border crossing between the West Bank and Jordan, Israeli officials said, in what appeared to be an attack linked to the 11-month-old war in Gaza. The military said the gunman approached the Allenby Bridge Crossing from the Jordanian side in a truck and opened fire at Israeli security forces, who killed the assailant in a shootout. It said the three people killed were Israeli civilians. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said they were all men in their 50s. Jordan is investigating the shooting, its state-run Petra News Agency reported. The Western-allied Arab country made peace with Israel in 1994, but is deeply critical of its policies toward the Palestinians. Jordan has a large Palestinian population and has seen mass protests against Israel over the war in Gaza. The Allenby crossing over the Jordan River, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, is mainly used by Israelis, Palestinians and international tourists. Authorities in Israel and Jordan said the crossing was closed until further notice, and Israel later announced the closure of both of its land crossings with Jordan, near Beit Shean in the north and Eilat in the south. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attack and linked it to Israel's larger conflict with Iran and allied militant groups, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Israeli-occupied West Bank has seen a surge of violence since Hamas' October 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. Israel has launched near-daily military arrest raids into dense Palestinian residential areas, and there has also been a rise in settler violence and Palestinian attacks on Israelis. In Gaza, meanwhile, an Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed five people, including two women, two children and a senior official in the Civil Defense — first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government. The Civil Defense said the strike targeted the home of its deputy director for north Gaza, Mohammed Morsi, in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The army says it tries to avoid harming civilians and only targets militants. Gaza's Health Ministry says over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began. It does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their October 7 attack into southern Israel. They abducted another 250 and are still holding around 100 of them after releasing most of the rest in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire last November. Around a third of the remaining hostages inside Gaza are believed to be dead. The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent months trying to broker a cease-fire and the return of the hostages, but the negotiations have repeatedly bogged down. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem — territories the Palestinians want for a future state — in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintained control over its airspace, coastline and most of its land crossings. Along with Egypt, it imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shooting-attack-at-the-west-bank-jordan-border-crossing-kills-3-israelis/7775829.html	2024-09-08T01:45:02-07:00	
Typhoon Yagi kills 14 in Vietnam as officials warn of heavy rain that can cause flooding	HANOI, Vietnam — At least 14 people have died and 176 others injured in Vietnam after Typhoon Yagi slammed the country's north, state media said Sunday, as officials warned of heavy downpours despite its waning power. Described by Vietnamese officials as one of the most powerful typhoons to hit the region over the last decade, Yagi left more than 3 million people without electricity in northern Vietnam. It also damaged vital agricultural land, nearly 116,192 hectares where rice and fruits are mostly grown. Hundreds of flights were canceled after four airports were closed. The typhoon made landfall in Vietnam's northern coastal provinces of Quang Ninh and Haiphong with wind speeds of up to 149 kilometers per hour on Saturday afternoon. It raged for roughly 15 hours before gradually weakening into a tropical depression early Sunday morning. Vietnam's meteorological department predicted heavy rain in northern and central provinces and warned of floods in low-lying areas, flash floods in streams and landslides on steep slopes. Municipal workers along with army and police forces were busy in the capital, Hanoi, clearing uprooted trees, fallen billboards, toppled electricity poles and rooftops that were swept away, while assessing damaged buildings. Yagi was still a storm when it blew out of the northwestern Philippines into the South China Sea on Wednesday, leaving at least 20 people dead and 26 others missing mostly in landslides and widespread flooding in the acrchipelago nation. It then made its way to China, killing three people and injuring nearly a hundred others, before landing in Vietnam. Storms like Typhoon Yagi were 'getting stronger due to climate change, primarily because warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel the storms, leading to increased wind speeds and heavier rainfall,' said Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore.	https://www.voanews.com/a/typhoon-yagi-weakens-after-killing-dozens-in-vietnam-china-philippines/7775815.html	2024-09-07T23:53:26-07:00

Brazil's X ban provokes Bolsonaro supporters to rally for 'freedom'	SAO PAULO — Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro began flooding Sao Paulo's main boulevard for an Independence Day rally Saturday, buoyed by the government's blocking of tech billionaire Elon Musk's X platform, a ban they say is proof of their political persecution. A few thousand demonstrators, clad in the yellow-and-green colors of Brazil's flag, poured onto Avednia Paulista. References to the ban on X and images of Musk abounded. 'Thank you for defending our freedom,' read one banner praising the tech entrepreneur. Saturday's march is a test of Bolsonaro's capacity to mobilize turnout ahead of the October municipal elections, even though Brazil's electoral court has barred him from running for office until 2030. It's also something of a referendum on X, whose suspension has raised eyebrows even among some of Bolsonaro's opponents all the while stoking the flames of Brazil's deep-seated political polarization. 'A country without liberty can't celebrate anything this day,' Bolsonaro wrote on his Instagram account September 4, urging Brazilians to stay away from official Independence Day parades and instead join him in Sao Paulo. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered X's nationwide ban on Aug. 30 after months of feuding with Musk over the limits of free speech. The powerful judge has spearheaded efforts to ban far-right users from spreading misinformation on social media, and he ramped up his clampdown after die-hard Bolsonaro supporters ransacked Congress and the presidential palace on January 8, 2023, to overturn Bolsonaro's defeat in the presidential election. The ban is red meat to Bolsonaro's allies, who have accused the judiciary and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government of colluding to silence their movement. 'Elon Musk has been a warrior for freedom of speech,' staunch Bolsonaro ally and lawmaker Bia Kicis said in an interview. 'The right is being oppressed, massacred, because the left doesn't want the right to exist.' 'Our liberties are in danger; we need to make our voices heard. De Moraes is a tyrant, he should be impeached, and people on the streets is the only thing that will convince politicians to do it,' said retiree Amaro Santos as he walked down the thoroughfare Saturday, Musk, a self-proclaimed 'free speech absolutist,' has also urged Brazilians to turn out in droves for the rally, resharing someone else's post claiming that X's ban had awakened people 'to the fact that freedom isn't free and needs to be fought for.' He's also created an X account, named for the controversial jurist, to publish sealed court orders directing X to shut down accounts deemed unlawful. But De Moraes' decision to ban X was far from arbitrary, having been upheld by fellow Supreme Court justices. And while expression, online and elsewhere, is more easily censored under Brazil's laws than it is in the U.S., Musk has emerged as both a cause celebre and a mouthpiece for unrestricted free speech. Since 2019, X has shut down 226 accounts of far-right activities accused of undermining Brazil's democracy, including those of lawmakers affiliated with Bolsonaro's party, according to court records. But when it refused to act on some accounts, de Moraes warned last month that its legal representative could be arrested, prompting X to disband its local office. The U.S.-based company refused to name a new representative — as required to receive court notices — and de Moraes ordered its nationwide suspension until it did so. A Supreme Court panel unanimously upheld de Moraes' decision to block X days later, undermining Musk's efforts to cast him as an authoritarian bent on censoring political speech. The more controversial component of his ruling was the levy of a whopping $9,000 daily fine for regular Brazilians using virtual private networks (VPNs) to access X. 'Some of these measures that have been adopted by the Supreme Court appear to be quite onerous and abusive,' said Andrei Roman, CEO of Brazil-based pollster Atlas Intel. In the lead-up to Saturday's protest, some right-wing politicians defied de Moraes' ban and brazenly used a VPN to publish posts on X, calling for people to partake in the protests. The march in Sao Paulo is organized in parallel to official events to celebrate Brazil's anniversary of independence from Portugal. Commemorations have been fraught with tension in recent years, as Bolsonaro used them while in office to rally supporters and show political strength. Three years ago, he threatened to plunge the country into a constitutional crisis when he declared he would no longer abide de Moraes' rulings. He has since toned down the attacks — a reflection of his own delicate legal situation. Bolsonaro has been indicted twice since his term ended in 2022, most recently for alleged money laundering in connection with undeclared diamonds from Saudi Arabia. De Moraes is overseeing an investigation into the Jan. 8 riot, including whether Bolsonaro had a role in inciting it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-s-x-ban-provokes-bolsonaro-supporters-to-rally-for-freedom-/7775518.html	2024-09-07T16:59:51-07:00	
Proposed UN peacekeeping plan could replace Kenya-led police mission in Haiti	UNITED NATIONS — The United States and Ecuador circulated a draft resolution Friday asking the United Nations to begin planning for a U.N. peacekeeping operation to replace the Kenya-led mission now in the Caribbean nation helping police to quell gang violence. The proposed Security Council resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, says U.N. peacekeepers are needed 'in order to sustain the gains' made by the U.N.-backed multinational mission which has seen almost 400 Kenyan police deploy since June to help the Haitian National Police. The circulation of the short resolution to all 15 council members follows U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Haiti on Thursday where he reaffirmed the U.S. government's commitment to the multinational mission and pushed for long-awaited general elections. America's top diplomat also said a U.N. peacekeeping force was an option to address a funding crisis for the Kenya-led mission, which depends on voluntary contributions. The U.S. and Canada have provided the bulk of funds so far. Peacekeeping operations, by contrast, are funded from a special U.N. budget. The United Nations has been involved in Haiti on and off since 1990. A 2004 rebellion had the country on the brink of collapse, leading to deployment of a U.N. force. It helped stabilize the impoverished nation after successful elections and a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed as many as 300,000 people and ended in October 2017. But U.N. peacekeepers left under a cloud, with troops from Nepal widely blamed for introducing cholera that has killed about 10,000 people in Haiti since 2010 and other troops implicated in sexual abuse, including rape and the targeting of hungry children. Since 2017, the U.N. has had a series of small missions in Haiti. The latest, political mission, BINUH, has a mandate to advance a Haitian-led political process toward elections, the rule of law and human rights. Many Haitians have rejected the proposal of another peacekeeping operation, given the introduction of cholera and sexual abuse cases that occurred when U.N. troops were last in Haiti. Some Haitians also see U.N. peacekeepers as an occupying force. Haiti asked for an international force to combat gangs in 2022, and U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres appealed for months for a country to lead the force before the Kenyans came forward and pledged 1,000 police. They are expected to be joined by police from the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin, Chad and Jamaica, bringing the multinational force to 2,500 personnel. They would be deployed in phases that would cost roughly $600 million a year. Currently, the U.N. has $85 million in pledges for the mission, out of which $68 million has been received. The gangs have grown in power since the July 7, 2021, assassination of President Jovenel Moïse and are now estimated to control up to 80% of the capital. The surge in killings, rapes and kidnappings has led to a violent uprising by civilian vigilante groups. In February, gangs launched coordinated attacks on police stations and the main international airport, which remained closed for nearly three months. They also stormed Haiti's two largest prisons, releasing more than 4,000 inmates. The violence subsided somewhat before the first contingent of Kenyan police arrived in late June, with Blinken noting that economic activity has restarted in some areas of Port-au-Prince, and that joint operations have led to successes including regaining control of Haiti's biggest public hospital. However, gangs continue to attack communities surrounding Port-au-Prince. The draft resolution would determine that 'the situation in Haiti continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security and to stability in the region.' Extending gratitude to Kenya, it would extend the mandate of the Multinational Security Support mission until Oct. 2, 2025, while the U.N. plans a transition to a peacekeeping operation. Security Council experts held their first meeting on the text of the resolution Friday afternoon and negotiations are expected to continue, a council diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because discussions were private. No date has been set for a vote. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric reiterated Friday that any new peacekeeping force requires approval from the Security Council. U.N. member nations must then volunteer troops and needed equipment, and the force then needs to be deployed — all of which takes time, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/proposed-un-peacekeeping-plan-could-replace-kenya-led-police-mission-in-haiti/7775525.html	2024-09-07T16:47:08-07:00	
Iran's secret service plots to kill Jews in Europe, says France	paris — A Paris court in May detained and charged a couple on accusations that they were involved in Iranian plots to kill Jews in Germany and France, police sources told Agence France-Presse. Authorities charged Abdelkrim S., 34, and his partner Sabrina B., 33, on May 4 with conspiring with a criminal terrorist organization and placed them in pretrial detention. The case, known as 'Marco Polo' and revealed Thursday by French news website Mediapart, signals a revival in Iranian state-sponsored terrorism in Europe, according to a report by France's General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) seen by AFP. 'Since 2015, the Iranian (secret) services have resumed a targeted killing policy,' the French security agency wrote, adding that 'the threat has worsened again in the context of the Israel-Hamas war.' The alleged objective for Iranian intelligence was to target civilians and sow fear in Europe among the country's political opposition as well as among Jews and Israelis. Iran is accused of recruiting criminals, including drug lords, to conduct such operations. Abdelkrim S. was previously sentenced to 10 years in prison in a killing in Marseille and released on probation in July 2023. He is accused of being the main France-based operative for an Iran-sponsored terrorist cell that planned acts of violence in France and Germany. A former fellow inmate is believed to have connected the suspect with the cell's coordinator, a major drug trafficker from the Lyon area who likely visited Iran in May, according to the DGSI. The group intended to attack a Paris-based former employee at an Israeli security firm and three of his colleagues residing in the Paris suburbs. Three Israeli-German citizens in Munich and Berlin were also among the targets. Investigators believe that Abdelkrim S., despite his probation, made multiple trips to Germany for scouting purposes, including travels to Berlin with his wife. He denied the accusations and said he simply had purchases to make. French authorities are also crediting the cell with plots to set fire to four Israeli-owned companies in the south of France between late December 2023 and early January 2024, said a police source. Abdelkrim S. rejected the claims, saying he had acted as a go-between on Telegram for the mastermind and other individuals involved in a planned insurance scam, the source added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-secret-service-plots-to-kill-jews-in-europe-says-france/7775516.html	2024-09-07T16:28:17-07:00	
Israeli strike kills three Lebanese medics, Hezbollah retaliates	cairo — Three Lebanese paramedics were killed and two others wounded, one critically, in an Israeli attack while they were extinguishing fires in the southern town of Faroun, Lebanon's health ministry said on Saturday. 'Israeli forces targeted a team from the Lebanese Civil Defense as they responded to fires sparked by recent Israeli airstrikes,' a ministry statement said, specifying that the strike hit a fire truck. The Israeli military said: 'Earlier today, the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) struck and eliminated terrorists from the Amal terrorist organization that operated within a Hezbollah military structure in the area of Froun in southern Lebanon.' Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack as a violation of international law and announced an emergency meeting on Monday with Western ambassadors and international organizations to address the ongoing hostilities. 'To date, because of Israel's aggression, 25 paramedics from various ambulance teams have been killed, along with two health workers, and 94 paramedics and health workers have been injured,' the health ministry statement added. The health ministry also condemned the attack as a 'blatant strike' on an official Lebanese state apparatus, marking the second such attack on an emergency team in less than 12 hours. Hezbollah issued a statement, saying it launched a 'squadron of missiles' in response to the Faroun attack, targeting an Israeli military headquarters, causing casualties. Around 140 civilians have been killed by Israeli bombardment of Lebanon since October 8, when hostilities broke out between the Israeli military and Hezbollah in parallel with the war in Gaza. The intensity of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel has ratcheted up steadily, displacing tens of thousands of people on either side of the Lebanese Israeli frontier. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, between October 8, 2023, and August 26, at least 133 civilians have been killed. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health, the total number of casualties stands at 2,412, including 564 fatalities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strike-kills-three-lebanese-medics-hezbollah-retaliates-/7775513.html	2024-09-07T16:04:39-07:00	
Fierce border clashes erupt between Pakistan and Afghanistan	Islamabad — Border security forces of Pakistan and Afghanistan were engaged in intense clashes Saturday, reportedly resulting in several casualties on both sides. The war zone is located between the southeastern Afghan border province of Khost and the adjoining Pakistani district of Kurram, as reported by security officials and residents on both sides. The conflict reportedly broke out when Taliban forces attempted to construct a security outpost on the Afghan side, prompting Pakistani troops to open fire to force the other side to stop the activity. Pakistani officials maintain neither side can construct new posts unilaterally under mutual agreements regarding the nearly 2,600-kilometer border between the two countries. Multiple sources reported that ongoing heavy clashes had injured at least five Pakistani soldiers, including an officer, and more than four Afghan border guards. Pakistan and Afghanistan authorities have not commented immediately on the fighting. This is the second time in as many days that the two countries have clashed over the construction of the disputed Afghan border outpost. The military tensions come amid Pakistan's persistent allegations that militants linked to the outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, have taken shelter on Afghan soil and are being facilitated by the country's Taliban leaders in orchestrating cross-border terrorist attacks. 'We have, on numerous occasions, presented evidence of the activities of these terror groups, which have hideouts and sanctuaries inside Afghanistan,' Mumtaz Baloch, the Pakistani foreign ministry spokesperson, reiterated Thursday. 'We urge the government of Afghanistan to take action against these terror groups and to ensure that these terror groups do not stage terror attacks against Pakistan,' she told a weekly news conference in Islamabad. Taliban authorities deny foreign militant groups, including TTP, are present in Afghanistan, saying no one is being allowed to threaten neighboring countries from their territory. However, recent United Nations assessments disputed the Taliban claims and backed Pakistan's concerns that TTP operatives had intensified cross-border violence with the help of the de facto Afghan government in Kabul, which no country has officially recognized. Since the Taliban regained power three years ago, bilateral ties have been strained due to increasing TTP attacks inside Pakistan and occasional border skirmishes, significantly undermining trade and transit ties between Pakistan and landlocked Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fierce-border-clashes-erupt-between-pakistan-and-afghanistan/7775511.html	2024-09-07T15:56:01-07:00

Ukraine voices concern at reports of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia	KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukraine's foreign ministry said Saturday it was deeply concerned by reports about a possible impending transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia. In a statement emailed to reporters, the ministry said the deepening military cooperation between Tehran and Moscow was a threat to Ukraine, Europe and the Middle East, and called on the international community to increase pressure on Iran and Russia. CNN and The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Iran had transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Russia, citing unidentified sources. Reuters reported in August that Russia was expecting the imminent delivery of hundreds of Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles from Iran and that dozens of Russian military personnel were being trained in Iran on the satellite-guided weapons for eventual use in the war in Ukraine. On Friday, the United States, a key ally of Ukraine, also voiced concern about the potential transfer of missiles. 'Any transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,' White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said. Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York said Friday that Tehran's position on the Ukraine conflict was unchanged. 'Iran considers the provision of military assistance to the parties engaged in the conflict — which leads to increased human casualties, destruction of infrastructure, and a distancing from cease-fire negotiations — to be inhumane,' it said. 'Thus, not only does Iran abstain from engaging in such actions itself, but it also calls upon other countries to cease the supply of weapons to the sides involved in the conflict.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-voices-concern-at-reports-of-iranian-ballistic-missiles-to-russia/7775391.html	2024-09-07T10:18:34-07:00	
Chrysler-parent Stellantis recalls 1.46 million vehicles worldwide	WASHINGTON — Chrysler parent Stellantis said Saturday it is recalling 1.46 million vehicles worldwide due to a software malfunction in the anti-lock brake system that can increase the risk of a crash. The recall includes nearly 1.23 million Ram 1500 trucks from the 2019 and 2021-2024 model years in the United States, as well as about 159,000 vehicles in Canada, 13,000 in Mexico and 61,000 outside North America. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said a software malfunction might result in the anti-lock brake system control module disabling the electronic stability control system. The issue means the vehicles do not comply with a federal motor vehicle safety standard on electric stability control systems. Stellantis said if the issue occurs, the ABS, ESC, adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning indicator lights will be illuminated at vehicle start up, indicating the systems are not working. Foundational braking would be working, it added. The company said it is unaware of any related injuries or crashes. Stellantis also said Saturday it is recalling about 33,000 Jeep Gladiator models from 2020-2024 and Jeep Wrangler vehicles from 2018-2024 due to a potential internal short circuit issue in the instrument panel cluster.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chrysler-parent-stellantis-recalls-1-46-million-vehicles-worldwide/7775333.html	2024-09-07T08:39:10-07:00

Chinese activist risks deportation after Denmark rejects asylum bid	STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN — Chinese dissident Liu Dongling is at risk of deportation back to China after Denmark rejected her asylum application in June, a situation some rights advocates say reflects challenges Chinese dissidents face when seeking refuge abroad, especially in Europe. Liu has been leading the 'Ban the Great Firewall' online campaign against China’s internet censorship regime since August 2023, when founder Qiao Xinxin was deported back to China from Laos and detained on subversion charges. Danish immigration authorities informed Liu in June they rejected her asylum application following a two-year review and would repatriate her back to China in seven days. Fearing similar charges if deported to China, Liu fled to Sweden with her teenage son the next day. 'I’ve been in Sweden for more than two months, and I still can’t work here since I don’t have a proper legal status,' she told VOA in an interview in Stockholm. Lui cannot apply for asylum in Sweden due to the Dublin Regulation, an agreement between European Union countries that establishes that a single country is responsible for examining an applicant's request for asylum. Contacted by VOA, the Danish Immigration Service and Danish Return Agency said they could not comment on individual cases, citing confidentiality required by law. Human rights advocates contacted by VOA said that based on Qiao’s detention, Liu will likely face imprisonment if the Danish authorities deport her. 'Apart from leading the online free speech campaign, Liu has also been collecting information about human rights violations for the China Human Rights Accountability Database, so she would definitely be given prison sentences if she were sent back to China,' Lin Shengliang, a Chinese activist based in the Netherlands and the founder of the human rights database, told VOA by phone. Seeking asylum in Denmark Liu has been an activist since 2014, when she helped forced eviction victims seek compensation through legal channels. She said she started being followed and her son started being banned by teachers from participating in activities he enjoyed. 'My son began to refuse to go to school so I decided to move to Thailand and let him go to school there,' Liu told VOA. In June 2019, she began documenting human rights violations for the Chinese news website Boxun, which covers activism and human rights violations in China. But soon, Chinese prosecutors in China’s Henan province started repeatedly contacting her, increasing her concern over her safety. She nevertheless returned to China twice in 2019 to renew her Thai visa. At the time, she wasn’t arrested or detained by local authorities. In June 2022, fearing deportation back to China considering the Thai detention and repatriation of Chinese dissidents, Liu applied for a Danish tourist visa and flew there with her son, applying for asylum when they arrived. As Danish authorities began to review her asylum application in March 2023, she also became involved with the online free speech campaign. She tried to spread information about how to bypass China’s internet censorship through virtual private networks to Chinese people while informing Chinese people working in the cybersecurity sector that they might be assisting the Chinese government with violating Chinese people’s basic human rights. Two months after she joined the campaign, movement co-founder Qiao Xinxin went missing in Laos. In August 2023, his family confirmed he had been detained in a Chinese prison under subversion charges. Despite Qiao’s and her extensive history of activism, Liu said Danish authorities repeatedly questioned whether she was at risk of arrest if she returned to China, citing her successful returns to China in 2019 as proof that she could freely leave the country. 'The Refugee Appeals Board finds that the applicant left China legally for Thailand in 2018 and later, she traveled back and forth between China and Thailand legally twice without experiencing issues,' the Danish Refugee Appeals Board wrote in an official case document seen by VOA. The Danish immigration authorities ultimately determined that Liu had not provided 'credible evidence' to prove that she had faced persecution in China and that if she returned to China, she would be persecuted by Chinese authorities. Some analysts say while Liu has a long track record of criticizing the Chinese government and engaging in human rights issues, some missing pieces of evidence made it difficult for her to prove the authenticity of her claims to the Danish authorities. However, several human rights organizations, including Madrid-based Safeguard Defenders, are trying to push the Danish immigration authorities to reassess her case. 'We have prepared all the paperwork to support the reassessment of her case,' said Peter Dahlin, the director of Safeguard Defenders. He told VOA that Denmark’s rejection of Liu’s asylum application shows the need for Chinese dissidents to be well-prepared before applying for asylum in a foreign country. 'If Chinese dissidents are going to seek asylum abroad, they need to prepare all necessary paperwork and evidence to back up their claims,' he said in a phone interview. Dahlin said if the Danish authorities decided to follow through on deporting Liu to China, human rights organizations will consider filing an interim measure requesting the European Court of Human Rights to weigh in on the decision. 'I don't think Denmark wants the embarrassment of having been told by the European Court of Human Rights to stop their action,' he told VOA. While human rights organizations are pushing Danish authorities to reassess Liu’s initial asylum application, she and her son may need to wait months before the Danish government finishes reassessment of her case. 'They will live in Sweden with no legal rights, and that’s not an easy situation to be in especially when Sweden and Denmark are hardening their stance on asylum and immigration,' Dahlin said. Since it remains unclear whether Danish authorities would reassess her case, Liu said she is still haunted by her possible deportation back to China. 'I have no clue what my next step is, and the only thing I could do now is to lay low and wait to see if Danish authorities reassess my asylum application,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-activist-risks-deportation-after-denmark-rejects-asylum-bid/7775272.html	2024-09-07T07:33:00-07:00	
Kyrgyzstan follows regional trend, takes Taliban off terrorist list	washington — Shunned by the West for over three years, Afghanistan's Taliban scored a diplomatic victory of sorts this week when the small Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan quietly removed the group from its list of banned terrorist organizations. The move underscores warming ties between the Taliban, in power since August 2021, and the countries of Central Asia. While the United States has led an international campaign to deny the Taliban government legitimacy, over a dozen regional countries, led by China and Russia, have embraced the self-styled 'Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.' 'It fits with the broader trend of governments in the region and internationally warming up to the idea of having to work with the Taliban,' said Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism and a research fellow at the Soufan Center. 'Generally, there is a recognition that the Taliban is not going anywhere, so you have to work with whoever is ruling Afghanistan for economic and security reasons.' Taliban reaction The government of Kyrgyzstan, once considered a close U.S. ally in the region, did not publicize its decision to delist the Taliban, but the Taliban's Foreign Ministry quickly seized on it as the latest breakthrough in its regional diplomacy. 'Aligning with actions of other countries, the step taken by Kyrgyzstan signifies a growing political recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan on both regional and international levels, and removes a barrier to strengthening bilateral relations between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan & other countries,' it said Thursday in a statement. The Taliban, which first ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 before waging a 20-year insurgency, has appeared on various international terrorist lists over the years. While the U.S. has not officially labeled them a 'foreign terrorist organization,' it considers members 'specially designated global terrorists.' Kyrgyzstan is the second Central Asian country to delist the Taliban in recent months. In December, Kazakhstan took the group off its own terrorist list as part of its growing economic engagement with the Taliban. In May, Russia said it, too, was considering such a move as it decides whether to recognize the Taliban's government. Although no country has extended official recognition to the Taliban, more than a dozen, including all six of Afghanistan's neighbors, have allowed Taliban diplomats to take charge of Afghan embassies or consulates. Among them, three have accepted accredited Taliban envoys: China in January, followed by Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates last month. In pursuing ties with the Taliban, Central Asian countries are taking their cues from Russia and China, both of which have deepened their engagement with Afghanistan's de facto government in recent years. 'They're pursuing practical policies, and they're also given a kind of umbrella by two of the major great powers — Russia and China — who are working with the Taliban quite closely,' Webber said. A 'necessary evil' In a report on the Taliban's regional diplomacy, analysts at the International Crisis Group noted how various countries pursue disparate agendas. Afghanistan neighbors such as Iran, Pakistan and Uzbekistan view dealing with the Taliban as a 'necessary evil if they are to address core concerns,' the analysts wrote. Those concerns include extremist threats as well as trade. For Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, a planned project designed to carry surplus power to Afghanistan and Pakistan is a priority. Regional powers China, India and Russia use engagement to contain 'any spillover' from Afghanistan, the analysts said. Russia regards the Taliban as a bulwark against the Islamic State's local branch. And while China has signed lucrative investment deals with Afghanistan, it, too, is motivated by fear of terrorism. Countries farther afield, such as the UAE and Qatar, aim 'to challenge the Taliban's Islamic exceptionalism but [are] also spurred by the need to balance their own regional rivalries,' they wrote. Strategic interests vs. human rights Significantly, none of the countries that have established diplomatic ties with the Taliban were classified as 'free' by Freedom House, the freedom and democracy advocacy group. All but two are labeled 'not free,' according to a VOA review. Only Pakistan and Turkey are designated as 'partly free.' This suggests that the Taliban can ward off international isolation if enough countries prioritize strategic interests over human rights and democracy, according to experts. While human rights haven't always been a U.S. foreign policy priority, the Biden administration, along with its Western allies, have made Taliban recognition contingent on respect for human rights, women's rights and an inclusive government. 'Given the issues related to the treatment of women and other human rights issues, it's more difficult for liberal democratic governments to recognize and work with the Taliban than it is for less democratic governments or nondemocratic governments, where they can be more practical in terms of pursuing their national interests solely and then working with the Taliban on this basis,' Webber said. The implications for Afghanistan's future and U.S. diplomacy are immense. Increased political and economic engagement could embolden the Taliban to keep their harsh policies, such as their ban on girls' education after sixth grade, experts say. It could also force Washington to reassess its dual policy of engaging and isolating the Taliban. Since the Taliban takeover, U.S. and European diplomats have held ongoing talks with Taliban officials in Qatar, where they maintain their Afghanistan embassy operations. Biden administration officials have also reportedly weighed working with the Taliban to combat the Afghan-based Islamic State Khorasan terror group, even while refusing to establish diplomatic ties. 'There is going to be pressure as more governments recognize that this kind of resistance to working more closely with the Taliban doesn't hold up,' Webber said. 'But it will be hard to do so publicly and officially, given the humanitarian violations and problems that we see with the Taliban government.' The Biden administration defends its Afghanistan policy. Asked about the Taliban's growing diplomatic footprint, a State Department spokesperson noted that no country has said that it recognizes the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan. 'The Taliban seek recognition as Afghanistan's government,' the spokesperson said in a statement to VOA. 'The United States and the international community have been clear with the Taliban that our ability to take meaningful steps toward normalization will be based on the Taliban's own actions.' These include respecting the rights of women and minorities, fulfilling anti-terror obligations and starting a political process for inclusive governance, the spokesperson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kyrgyzstan-follows-regional-trend-takes-taliban-off-terrorist-list/7775060.html	2024-09-07T03:53:02-07:00	
China stops short of African debt relief at triennial summit	NAIROBI, KENYA/BEIJING — China stopped short of providing the debt relief sought by many African countries this week, but pledged $50.7 billion over three years in credit lines and investments. The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, or FOCAC, launched in 2000 took on an enhanced role after the 2013 inception of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to recreate the ancient Silk Road for the world's second-largest economy and biggest bilateral lender to Africa. 'China is moving back on to the front foot in terms of overseas deployment of capital in the emerging markets,' said Tellimer's Hasnain Malik, while adding it was not yet at pre-COVID levels. China has also sought to use FOCAC to counter growing competition in Africa from the United States, the European Union, Japan and others. In Beijing, diplomats and delegates from around the world mingled in the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square as leaders from more than 50 African countries and Chinese officials led by Xi gathered for a group photo. The new financial pledge is more than what Beijing promised at the last FOCAC, in 2021, but below the $60 billion of 2015 and 2018, which marked the peak of lending to Africa under the Belt and Road Initiative. During those peak years, Beijing bankrolled the construction of roads, railways and bridges. But a drying up of funds since 2019 has left Africa with stalled construction projects. The new funds will go toward 30 infrastructure projects to improve trade links, China said, without giving details. The 54-nation continent of more than 1 billion people has an annual infrastructure funding deficit estimated at $100 billion and needs transport links to make a new giant pan-African trade bloc a reality. Beijing has in recent years cut funding for such projects as it shifted focus to 'small and beautiful' projects, mainly due to its own domestic economic pressures and an increase in debt risks among African countries. Asked how the new commitments fit into China's current cautious overseas lending strategy, a foreign ministry spokesperson said there was no contradiction. 'The cooperation between China and African countries, including the specific implementation of projects, is discussed and determined by both sides,' Mao Ning, a foreign ministry spokesperson, told a news conference on Friday. China also said it will launch 30 clean-energy projects in Africa, offer cooperation on nuclear technology and tackle a power deficit that has delayed industrialization efforts. 'The outcomes of the FOCAC summit signal an impetus for green projects and especially for renewable energy installations,' said Goolam Ballim, head of research at South Africa's Standard Bank. China has become a global leader in wind and solar energy, Ballim said, controlling significant supply chains and reducing production costs. Others were skeptical. 'The issue is not so much about the size of the investments, it's been about the lack of transparency around the terms of the debt,' said Trang Nguyen, global head of emerging markets credit strategy at French bank BNP Paribas. Success was less clear-cut for countries owing a large share of their debt to China, which made no express offer of assistance to those struggling with repayments. Beijing instead urged other creditors 'to participate in the handling and restructuring of African countries' debts under the principle of joint actions and fair burden-sharing.' African leaders hoping to bask in large deals for their countries had to settle for less splashy announcements. Ethiopia and Mauritius announced new currency swap lines with China's central bank. Kenya said it made progress on talks to reopen the lending taps for key projects such as its modern railway to link the region. Still, there was optimism from some, as they welcomed China's increased commitments to Africa's security, humanitarian challenges and other nonfinancial affairs. 'After nearly 70 years of hard work, China-Africa relations are at their best in history,' Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu said on her X account.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-stops-short-of-african-debt-relief-at-triennial-summit/7775175.html	2024-09-07T03:41:02-07:00	
DR Congo leaders want more from Beijing than mineral sales	Kinshasa, DRC — Officials from the Democratic Republic of Congo will be heading home from the two-day Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing with limited success in their bid to expand economic relations beyond the mineral exports that have dominated trade, analysts say. 'The Chinese will continue to want to consolidate their position in Congo, including on minerals,' says Jean-Pierre Okenda, a Congolese consultant on mining issues. Although the DRC has a trade surplus with China, while most African countries have large deficits, almost all of it is from minerals China is buying to feed its manufacturers that are hungry for raw materials. The central African nation is the world’s largest producer of copper and cobalt, a metal used in electronics and a key material for batteries used in electric vehicles. The DRC has about 70% of the planet’s cobalt reserves. Expanding trade, investment? China’s customs authority shows trade flows to the DRC dropped 13% last year to $18.75 billion compared with 2022, the vast majority of it due to China's decreased imports from the DRC, which dropped by nearly 14% to $14.27 billion. While the drop was largely due to fluctuating prices, it underscored how deeply the DRC, one of the poorest countries in the world, relies on China. China is by far its largest single trading partner, representing nearly half of its merchandise exports and more than a quarter of its imports, according to 2022 data from the World Trade Organization. Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi was the first African leader to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of the conference. According to a statement from his office, Tshisekedi made it clear he wants to see bilateral trade expanded to other sectors 'such as agriculture, renewable energy and especially industrialization through the local processing of the DRC's mineral wealth.' China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said ahead of the forum that Xi declared his nation is ready to 'deepen cooperation in agriculture, mineral products processing, vocational training and other fields.' Many in the Congolese leadership were hoping to come away from the conference with large pledges of Chinese investment in the country. Julien Paluku, the DRC’s trade minister, on Thursday published a plea for Kinshasa to be given a large chunk of the $50 billion that Xi promised at the conference to invest in Africa over the next three years. 'We focused our arguments on DRC's pivotal role in the Belt and Road Initiative, highlighting its strategic location as a connectivity point from North to South and East to West across the African continent,' he wrote on X. Business climate Christian-Geraud Neema, a Congolese researcher on China-Africa relations and the Francophone Africa Editor of the China Global South Project, says complaints about the investment climate in the DRC are an issue. 'There is a sort of reluctance to increase projects,' he says, referring to Chinese investments in Congo. 'China will make promises, but not very committed promises.' The DRC is one of the most corrupt countries in the world, ranking 162 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s corruption perceptions index. Chinese businesses have also come under increasing pressure under Tshisekedi’s administration, with the government working to renegotiate long-standing deals with Chinese mining firms. In January, the Congolese government concluded talks on renegotiating a deal with the Chinese consortium running Sicomines, a copper-cobalt mine in Congo’s southeast. That renegotiation saw the investors behind the consortium agree to spend a massive $7 billion on developing infrastructure, such as badly needed roads and bridges, in the DRC. Another Chinese company, CMOC, which runs the largest copper-cobalt mine in the world, situated in the DRC, agreed to pay $2 billion to the Congolese state last year after a commercial dispute. Although many analysts believe those mining deals are still favorable to China, the uncertain business environment and the costs associated with rampant corruption have caused unease, say analysts. 'The operating conditions in Congo, everyone knows what they’re like,' says Okenda, explaining that Chinese firms were among the few willing to brave Congo’s tough business environment. Defense cooperation Defense is another area where some in the Congolese administration had been hoping for more cooperation in light of the country’s struggle to end the brutal conflict in eastern DRC. Tshisekedi’s office said that he discussed security concerns with Xi and that he 'praised China's influence on the lifting of the [U.N.] arms embargo on the DRC while it is unjustly attacked by Rwanda and M23 terrorists.' The M23, a Rwandan-backed rebel group, has captured swathes of territory in the region since launching a rebellion in late 2021 and displaced more than 1 million people from their homes. The DRC’s army, which critics say is weak and plagued with corruption, has struggled to fight back, losing battles and territory. But the DRC army did purchase nine high-tech Chinese CH-4 Rainbow attack drones, which it has used effectively in battle despite some being shot down. Jean-Pierre Bemba, who was the DRC’s defense minister before moving to the transport portfolio in April, said in Beijing this week that he hoped China and the DRC could go beyond their traditional areas of cooperation and work more closely on defense. Analysts are skeptical the defense relationship will go much further. Okenda, the mining consultant, said that 'China’s interest isn’t in defense,' and that Beijing's overriding concern was natural resources. Neema, the researcher, said that the prospect of a minerals-for-arms deal with Chinese firms had been a vague idea for years, but that Congolese leaders had never pursued it for fear of angering the United States, another important diplomatic partner. He said closer defense cooperation remained unlikely, unless the situation in the eastern DRC deteriorates further. 'Expediting military factors could push the Congolese government to make a deal,' he said. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in their statement on Xi’s meeting with Tshisekedi, indicated he made no reference to defense cooperation and gave only a boiler plate comment about working together for peace.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7775160.html	2024-09-07T01:57:18-07:00	
Typhoon Yagi kills at least 4 in Vietnam, 3 in China	HANOI, Vietnam — Vietnamese authorities say Typhoon Yagi has killed at least four people and injured 78 others after making landfall Saturday afternoon in the north of the country. The typhoon, described by Vietnamese meteorological officials as 'one of the most powerful typhoons in the region over the past decade,' made its way to the Southeast Asian country after it left three people dead and nearly a hundred others injured in the Chinese province of Hainan. Earlier, the government issued several alerts, and those vulnerable to floods or landslides were evacuated. Four airports were shuttered, including in the capital, Hanoi, and the city of Haiphong. Yagi landed at Vietnam's coastal provinces of Quang Ninh and Haiphong with wind speeds of up to 149 kilometers per hour (92 miles per hour), state media reported. Before landing, strong winds felled a tree, killing a woman in Hanoi, local media said Saturday. Quang Ninh is home to the UNESCO World Heritage site Ha Long Bay, known for its many towering limestone islands. Hundreds of cruises were canceled at the popular site before the typhoon landed, according to local media. Haiphong is an industrial hub, home to large factories, including electric vehicle maker VinFast and Apple supplier Pegatron. The typhoon also triggered power outages in large parts of Quang Ninh and Thai Binh provinces. Earlier, the government issued several alerts, and those vulnerable to floods or landslides were evacuated. Authorities pruned trees in Hanoi to make them less susceptible to falling, but wind and rain knocked over several along with billboards in northern cities. Local media reported that many moored boats were swept out to sea. China Yagi struck the Chinese city of Wenchang in Hainan province on Friday afternoon with wind speeds of up to about 245 kph (152 mph) near its center. Authorities said that the typhoon left three people dead and injured at least 95 others and that it affected over 1.2 million people as of noon Saturday, according to the local Global Times newspaper. Some 420,000 Hainan residents were relocated before the typhoon's landfall. Another half-a-million people in Guangdong province were evacuated before Yagi made a second landfall in the province's Xuwen County on Friday night. Meanwhile, the meteorological observatory of the city of Haikou downgraded its typhoon signal from red to orange on Saturday, as it moved further away. Before leaving Hong Kong, Yagi forced more than 270 people to seek refuge at temporary government shelters on Friday, and over 100 flights in the city were canceled due to the typhoon. Heavy rain and strong winds felled dozens of trees, and trading on the stock market, bank services and schools were halted. Philippines Yagi was still a storm when it blew out of the northwestern Philippines into the South China Sea on Wednesday, leaving at least 20 people dead and 26 others missing, mostly in landslides, and widespread flooding. More than 2.3 million people in northern and central provinces were affected. More than 82,200 people were displaced from their homes in Philippine provinces, and classes, work, inter-island ferry services and domestic flights were disrupted for days, including in the densely populated capital region, metropolitan Manila. Warm water in oceans power storms, and as they become warmer because of climate change, intense typhoons are becoming more common, especially in Southeast Asia, a U.N. climate change report warned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/super-typhoon-yagi-head-to-vietnam-2-reported-dead-in-china-s-hainan/7775139.html	2024-09-06T23:47:21-07:00	
US, UK spy chiefs urge support for Ukraine in joint essay	LONDON — The heads of the American and British foreign intelligence agencies said in a joint essay published Saturday that ongoing support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia is essential. They pledged to enhance cooperation between their agencies and address other global challenges. CIA Director William Burns and Richard Moore, head of Britain's MI6 secret intelligence service, wrote the opinion piece in the Financial Times newspaper. This marks the first time the leaders of the two agencies have co-written an essay. The spy chiefs highlighted that their partnership is a cornerstone of the 'special relationship' between the U.S. and Britain. They noted that their agencies have collaborated for 75 years and are united in opposing Russia's aggression against Ukraine. 'Staying the course in Ukraine is more vital than ever,' they wrote. Russian President Vladimir Putin, they said, 'will not succeed in extinguishing Ukraine's sovereignty and independence.' They committed to continuing support for Ukrainian intelligence. Russian forces are making slow progress in eastern Ukraine, while Ukrainian troops continue their activities in Russia's Kursk region. Kyiv has been seeking additional air defense support from the U.S. and its allies. The spy chiefs also addressed Russian intelligence operations, accusing them of sabotage and disinformation across Europe. Russia has denied those allegations. Burns and Moore said their agencies have reorganized to confront a growing challenge from China, which they described as the principal intelligence and geopolitical concern of the 21st century. They also emphasized their efforts to use intelligence to promote restraint and de-escalation in the Middle East, including working toward a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Burns is leading U.S. negotiations to resolve the conflict and address humanitarian issues. On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged military allies to provide more weaponry to strengthen Ukraine's defense as Russia continues its invasion. Speaking at Germany's Ramstein Airbase during the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting, Zelenskyy stressed the need for improved air defense systems and permission to use U.S.-supplied long-range weapons to target locations in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory. Zelenskyy highlighted the urgent need for additional air defense systems due to recent drone and missile attacks. He noted that while some support has been provided, several promised systems have not yet arrived. U.S. policy currently restricts Ukraine from using U.S. weapons to strike deep within Russia. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby confirmed that the policy remains unchanged but noted that discussions with Ukrainian officials are ongoing. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking at the UDCG meeting, reiterated support for Ukraine's immediate needs, including air defense and armor. He also emphasized the importance of Ukraine boosting its own defense production for long-term security. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, in a related development, called for continued military support for Ukraine, echoing Zelenskyy's appeal. He stressed that a strong Ukraine is crucial for ending the war and urged all allies to maintain their support during this critical period. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-us-spy-chiefs-call-for-staying-the-course-on-ukraine/7775130.html	2024-09-06T23:36:13-07:00

Cockpit audio indicates deicing system was failing before plane crashed in Brazil	sao paulo, brazil — The pilots of a Brazilian passenger plane that crashed last month, killing all 62 people aboard, reported failure in the system to remove ice from the plane, according to a preliminary report made public Friday by Brazilian authorities. Investigators were careful to avoid saying this was the cause of the accident, stressing there was more work to be done. Still, their report lent further credence to aviation experts' main hypothesis: that the lift loss had been caused by ice formation on the plane's wings and failure of its deicing system. Weather reports from the day of the accident predicted ice formation in the region where the plane went down. Audio from the cockpit's voice recorder included comments from pilots indicating ice was accumulating and the deicing system was failing, Paulo Froes, an investigator in the air force's center for the investigation and prevention of air accidents, told reporters in Brasilia. 'There are still many doubts. This accident shouldn't have happened, not in the conditions in which the plane was flying and was being operated. It had protection equipment,' Carlos Henrique Baldin, head of the center's investigation division, told reporters. Operated by the airline Voepass, the flight departed August 9 from the city of Cascavel, in Parana state, bound for Sao Paulo's Guarulhos international airport. It crashed into the backyard of a home in a gated community in the city of Vinhedo, about 80 kilometers northwest of Sao Paulo. Footage of the ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop plunging while in a flat spin horrified people across Brazil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cockpit-audio-indicates-deicing-system-was-failing-before-plane-crashed-in-brazil/7774776.html	2024-09-06T16:56:36-07:00	
Man charged with plotting shooting at NYC Jewish center on Hamas attack anniversary	new york — A Pakistani man was arrested in Canada this week for plotting a mass shooting at a Jewish center in Brooklyn on the one-year anniversary of the October 7 attack by Hamas that sparked the latest conflict in the Middle East, federal authorities announced Friday. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Muhammad Shahzeb Khan had attempted to travel from Canada, where he lives, to New York City with the 'stated goal of slaughtering, in the name of ISIS, as many Jewish people as possible.' The 20-year-old, who is also known as Shahzeb Jadoon, was apprehended on September 4 and charged with attempting to provide material support and resources to the terror group, which stands for the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham. 'As I said to Canada's minister of public safety yesterday, we are deeply grateful to our Canadian partners for their critical law enforcement actions in this matter,' Garland said in a statement. 'Jewish communities — like all communities in this country — should not have to fear that they will be targeted by a hate-fueled terrorist attack.' It was unclear if Khan has a lawyer. There was no listing for the case in the online federal court system. Edward Kim, a spokesperson for the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office, which is handling the case, declined to respond to follow-up questions, including where Khan was being held and when he would be brought to the U.S. to face the charges. He deferred to Canadian authorities, who didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment. U.S. authorities said Khan began sharing ISIS propaganda videos and expressing his support for the terror group in social media posts and communications with others on an encrypted messaging app last November. In conversations with two undercover law enforcement officers, he confirmed that he and another ISIS supporter based in the U.S. had been planning to carry out attacks against Jewish centers in America and needed to obtain AR-style assault rifles, ammunition and other materials, according to the Justice Department. Khan also provided details about how he would cross the border from Canada into the U.S. and that he was considering conducting the attacks on either the October 7 anniversary or on October 11, which is the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, authorities said. Then on August 20, he told the undercover officers that he had settled on targeting New York City because of its sizable Jewish population and sent a photograph of the specific area inside a Jewish center where he planned to carry out the attack, according to the Justice Department. Using three separate vehicles, Khan began traveling to the U.S. but was stopped around Ormstown, a town in the Canadian province of Quebec that is about 12 miles (19 kilometers) from the U.S. border, federal authorities said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-man-charged-in-alleged-new-york-city-plot-linked-to-islamic-state/7774703.html	2024-09-06T15:08:19-07:00	
US adversaries step up efforts to influence results of next election	washington — Russia, Iran and China are ramping up efforts to impact the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and down-ballot races, targeting American voters with an expanding array of sophisticated influence operations. The latest assessment from U.S. intelligence agencies, shared Friday, warns that Russia remains the preeminent threat, with Russian influence campaigns seeking to boost the chances of Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump over Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris. Russian actors, led by networks created by the Kremlin-backed media outlet RT, 'are supporting Moscow's efforts to influence voter preferences in favor of the former president and diminish the prospects of the vice president,' a senior intelligence official told reporters, briefing on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information. 'RT has built and used networks of U.S. and other Western personalities to create and disseminate Russia-friendly narratives while trying to mask the content in authentic Americans' free speech,' the official said. And RT, the official added, is just part of a growing Kremlin-directed campaign that is looking to impact not just the race for the White House, but smaller elections across the United States, with an added emphasis on swing states. 'Russia's influence apparatus is very large and it's worth highlighting that they have other entities that are active,' the official said. 'Russia is working up and down ballot races, as well as spreading divisive issues.' Tracking the Russian influence efforts has become more difficult, with U.S. officials saying that there is a greater degree of sophistication and an increased emphasis on amplifying American voices with pro-Russian views rather than seeding social media with narratives crafted in the Kremlin. 'It's not just about Russian bots and trolls and fake social media persona, although that's part of it,' White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told VOA Friday. 'We're not taking anything for granted,' he added. 'There's no question that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has every intent to try to sow discord here in the United States, to try to pump disinformation and Russian propaganda through to the American people, through what he believes were our credible sources, be they online or on television and we have to take that seriously.' The intelligence officials declined to share additional specifics about Russia's network of influence operations. But indictments Wednesday from the U.S. Justice Department have shed some light on the scope of the Kremlin's recent operations. In one case, the U.S. charged two employees of RT with using fake personas and shell companies to funnel almost $10 million to Tenet Media, a Tennessee-based company producing videos and podcasts for a stable of conservative political influencers. The aim, prosecutors said, was to produce and disseminate content promoting what Moscow viewed as pro-Russian policies. In a separate action, the U.S. seized 32 internet domains linked to an operation directed by a key aide to Putin. The aim, U.S. officials said, was to mimic legitimate U.S. news sites to spread Russian-created propaganda. RT publicly ridiculed the allegations while some of the influencers working with Tenet posted statements on the X social media platform saying they were unaware of the company's links to Moscow. As for the latest U.S. intelligence allegations, the Russian Embassy in Washington has yet to respond to VOA's request for comments, though it has described previous accusations as 'Russophobic.' Requests for comment to the Trump and Harris campaigns have also, so far, gone unanswered. But earlier U.S. intelligence assertions of Russian support for Trump have raised the ire of the Trump campaign, which has pointed to public statements by Russia's Putin supporting Trump's opponents. 'When President Trump was in the Oval Office, Russia and all of America's adversaries were deterred, because they feared how the United States would respond,' national press secretary for the Trump campaign, Karoline Leavitt, told VOA in an email this past July. U.S. intelligence officials, however, said it would be a mistake to put any faith in Putin's words, including public comments Thursday expressing support for Harris. The U.S. intelligence community 'does not take Putin's public statements as representative of Russia's covert intentions,' the senior official said. 'There are many examples over the past several years where Putin's public statements do not align with Russian actions. For example, his comments that he would not invade Ukraine.' Experts say Iran, China trying to influence results U.S. intelligence agencies Friday emphasized Russia is not alone in its effort to shape the outcome of the U.S. elections in November, warning both Tehran and Beijing are sharpening their influence campaigns with just about 60 days until America voters go to the polls. 'Iran is making a greater effort than in the past to influence this year's elections, even as its tactics and approaches are similar to prior cycles,' the intelligence official said, describing a 'multi-pronged approach to stoke internal divisions and undermine voter confidence in the U.S. democratic system. U.S. intelligence agencies previously assessed that Iran has focused part of its efforts on denigrating the Trump campaign, seeing his election as likely to worsen tensions between Tehran and Washington. U.S. officials last month also blamed Iran for a hack-and-leak operation targeting the Trump campaign, though they said that Iran-linked actors have also sought to infiltrate the Harris campaign. As for China, U.S. intelligence officials said it appears Beijing is still content to stay out of the U.S. presidential race, seeing little difference between Trump and Harris. But there are indications China is accelerating its efforts to impact other political races. U.S. intelligence 'is aware of PRC [People's Republic of China] attempts to influence U.S. down-ballot races by focusing on candidates it views as particularly threatening to core PRC security interests,' the official said. 'PRC online influence actors have also continued small scale efforts on social media to engage U.S. audiences on divisive political issues, including protests about the Israel-Gaza conflict and promote negative stories about both political parties,' the official added. 'Malicious speculations against China' The Chinese Embassy in Washington, Friday, rejected the U.S. intelligence assessment. 'China has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election, and we hope that the U.S. side will not make an issue of China in the election,' spokesperson Liu Pengyu told VOA in an email. Liu added that accusations Beijing is using social media to sway U.S. public opinion 'are full of malicious speculations against China, which China firmly opposes.' While U.S. intelligence officials have identified Russia, Iran and China, as the most prominent purveyors of disinformation, they are not alone. Officials have said countries like Cuba are also engaging in influence operations, though at a much smaller scale. And other countries are edging closer to crossing that line. 'We are seeing a number of countries considering activities that, at a minimum, test the boundaries of election influence,' according to the U.S. assessment. 'Such activities include lobbying political figures to try to curry favor with them in the event they are elected to office.' Misha Komadovsky contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-adversaries-step-up-efforts-to-influence-results-of-next-election/7774626.html	2024-09-06T14:21:43-07:00	
Sergio Mendes, Grammy-winning Brazilian music legend, dies at 83	RIO DE JANEIRO — Sergio Mendes, the celebrated Brazilian musician whose 1966 hit 'Mas Que Nada' made him a global superstar and helped launch a long, Grammy-winning career, has died after months battling the effects of long COVID. He was 83. The death Thursday of the Brazilian pianist, songwriter and arranger was confirmed in a statement by his family. 'His wife and musical partner for the past 54 years, Gracinha Leporace Mendes, was by his side, as were his loving children,' the statement said Friday. 'Mendes last performed in November 2023 to sold out and wildly enthusiastic houses in Paris, London and Barcelona.' Mendes was born in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro's sister city, and studied classical music at a conservatory before joining jazz groups. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he began playing Bossa Nova as the genre was heating up in Rio's nightclub scene with Antonio Carlos Jobim, Joao Gilberto and others. In 1962, they traveled to New York for a Bossa Nova festival at Carnegie Hall. During the trip, Cannonball Adderley invited Mendes to collaborate on the album 'Cannonball Adderley and The Bossa Rio Sextet,' leading to his first American record, 'The Swinger from Rio,' after signing with Atlantic Records. Two years later, Mendes moved to California and formed Brazil '64, which evolved into Brazil '66 after he added two female vocalists. The group's debut album, produced by Herb Alpert, featured 'Mas Que Nada.' Sung entirely in Portuguese, 'Mas Que Nada' was a mid-tempo Samba number originally released in 1963 by composer Jorge Ben Sor and updated three years later by Mendes, who had been playing the song in clubs and gave it a jazzier, more hard-hitting feel. 'I put a band together called Brasil '66,' he told The Guardian in 2019. 'I'd always had instrumental groups, but when I added the two female singers — Lani Hall and Bibi Vogel — it made a different kind of sound. We recorded the song in Los Angeles, with me, the drums, bass and guitar all performing live.' Mendes' version was a worldwide hit that helped perpetuate the Brazilian music boom of the 1960s. In 2006, a modern version of the song topped U.S. charts, as performed by the Black Eyed Peas. It was included in his album 'Timeless,' produced by will.i.am and also featuring Stevie Wonder, Justin Timberlake and John Legend, among others. 'Sergio Mendes was my brother from another country,' trumpet player Alpert wrote on Facebook, along with a photo from decades ago, sitting next to Mendes at the piano. 'He was a true friend and extremely gifted musician who brought Brazilian music in all its iterations to the entire world with elegance.' Mendes' other hits were an eclectic blend ranging from covers of the Beatles' 'The Fool on the Hill' and 'With a Little Help from My Friends,' to his own Brazilian chant, 'Magalenha.' Mendes also composed the soundtrack for the film 'Pele,' featuring saxophonist Gerry Mulligan, and even produced an album recorded by the great Brazilian soccer player. Mendes won the 1992 Grammy Award for Best World Music Album for 'Brasileiro' and two Latin Grammy Awards. He also received an Oscar nomination in 2012 for Best Original Song for 'Real in Rio,' from the animated film 'Rio.' 'Brazilian soul was there,' pianist, singer, and songwriter Marcos Valle told GloboNews about Mendes' music. Valle also noted that it was Mendes who helped open doors for other Brazilian artists of his generation, including himself, to reach foreign audiences.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sergio-mendes-grammy-winning-brazilian-music-legend-dies-at-83/7774658.html	2024-09-06T14:15:13-07:00	
US to continue to enforce sanctions after aircraft linked to Venezuela’s Maduro seized, Blinken says	Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday that the United States will continue enforcing sanctions against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro following the seizure and investigation of two aircraft linked to him earlier this week in the Dominican Republic. On Friday, Blinken held discussions with Dominican President Luis Abinader during his first official visit to Santo Domingo as the top U.S. diplomat. Blinken underscored the U.S. commitment to continued collaboration with the Dominican Republic to promote inclusive economic growth, strengthen democratic institutions, uphold human rights, and improve governance and security. On Monday, U.S. authorities seized a plane used by Maduro, the equivalent to the U.S. Air Force One. The aircraft, undergoing maintenance in the Dominican Republic, was seized for being illegally purchased through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States, violating U.S. export control and sanctions laws. After the controversial reelection of Maduro on July 28, Venezuela suspended commercial flights to and from the Dominican Republic. A second plane linked to Maduro is under investigation in the Dominican Republic. This aircraft is similar to the one seized on Monday and is listed among the sanctioned assets by the U.S. Treasury as belonging to Maduro. 'With regard to the plane seizures, we've been very clear. We'll implement our sanctions, and if we find violations of them, we will act. That's what we did, and that's what we'll continue to do,' Blinken told reporters during a joint press conference with Abinader at the National Palace. The Dominican Republic will host the 2025 Summit of the Americas, where Western Hemisphere leaders will address shared challenges and policy issues facing the region. On August 16, Abinader was sworn in for a second four-year term, vowing to enhance security by increasing police training over the next four years. His administration has also implemented policies barring migrants from neighboring Haiti. The U.S. has urged the Dominican Republic to establish a path toward normalization with Haiti, as border tensions continue to escalate. Blinken said he and Abinader are committed to support the Haitians to build security and 'make sure the people are treated humanely.' Abinader told reporters his country will continue moving forward and normalizing the relationship with Haiti, such as opening air flights, but the security and safety of citizens of the Dominican Republic is still the priority. The U.S. and the Dominican Republic signed a historic Open Skies agreement on August 2. Once in effect, the agreement will expand opportunities for airlines, travel companies and people-to-people exchanges. More than 4 million U.S. citizens visit the Dominican Republic each year. The Dominican Republic is a crucial partner for the U.S. in hemispheric affairs, due to its position as the second-largest economy in the Caribbean, after Cuba, and the third-largest country by population, behind Cuba and Haiti. The U.S. is its primary trading partner. Additionally, the Dominican Republic is home to Pueblo Viejo, one of the world’s largest gold mines, and serves as a major global supplier of ferronickel, used for making stainless steel. The Dominican Republic and the United States, along with five Central American countries, are parties to the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement, known as CAFTA-DR. This agreement enhances economic opportunities by eliminating tariffs, opening markets, reducing barriers to services and promoting transparency. The U.S. Agency for International Development is investing more than $9.5 million to strengthen the Dominican Republic’s existing justice system and to reduce crime and violence. Blinken also announced on Friday 'the first phase of a supply chain investment through USAID, an initial $3 million that will help the Dominican government improve its workforce training, build industrial parks, attract high-tech industries here to the Dominican Republic.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-continue-to-enforce-sanctions-after-aircraft-linked-to-venezuela-s-maduro-seized-blinken-says/7774618.html	2024-09-06T13:40:08-07:00	
Death of persecuted journalist brings attention to Turkmenistan’s media repression	Washington — The death of a former journalist who experienced beatings and inhumane treatment in prison shows the harassment that media workers and their families endure in Turkmenistan, analysts said. Khudayberdy Allashov was 35 years old when he died in August, after what watchdogs said was eight years of persecution and physical assault by Turkmen authorities. No cause of death was listed on his death certificate. 'The beatings and torture that Allashov was subjected to and the impossibility of providing him with rehabilitation and medical care led to the death of a brave and honest man,' Farid Tuhbatullin, the head of the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights, told VOA via email. Known as one of the most closed-off countries, Turkmenistan has little space for independent reporting. Nearly all media outlets are state-owned, and ministries monitor content, according to watchdogs. Journalists such as Allashov who try to report independently — and their families — are subject to arrest and harassment, according to Reporters Without Borders, or RSF. Azatlyk, which is run by VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Turkmen Service, provides a rare source of news. When Allashov was initially detained in 2016, he had been working for Azatlyk for about three months. That reporting was critical of the government, focusing on social problems such as food shortages, salary delays and forced labor, according to an Amnesty International report published at the time of Allashov’s first arrest. 'All of this is forbidden to be mentioned in the local media,' Tuhbatullin told VOA in an email. 'The very word ‘problem’ is taboo.' He, too, had been arrested and exiled from Turkmenistan. Allashov, his mother and his wife were all arrested under charges of possessing chewing tobacco, a commonly used substance in Turkmenistan. There are no other known criminal charges of possessing chewing tobacco; the maximum punishment is typically a fine, Farruh Yusupov, director of Azatlyk, told VOA. In captivity, Allashov was tortured with electric shock. The severity of the torture during Allashov’s 74-day arrest caused him to declare he would no longer work as a journalist. But even after his release and quitting the profession, authorities continually detained and harassed him up until his death, journalists and experts who spoke with VOA said. He faced violent interrogations in 2019, 2020 and 2023. 'Authorities never left him or his family alone,' Yusupov told VOA. 'They told him they would not relent until they chased him to his grave. They were true to their promise.' The Turkmenistan Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA’s email requesting comment. Despite having ceased his reporting, Allashov was denied any medical treatment due to his status as a target of the authorities, according to RSF. He leaves a wife and two children. RSF condemned the targeted harassment of independent journalists. 'Allashov should never have lived through this nightmare,' Jeanne Cavelier of RSF said in a statement. 'Under the Turkmen dictatorship, the lives of journalists and former journalists — and the lives of their families — continue to be at risk because of their work.' Turkmenistan ranks 175 out of 180 countries on the RSF World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media environment. 'This is a country where the authorities can do anything to any citizen who expresses any form of dissent,' Gulnoza Said, a program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, told VOA. Yusupov told VOA that while there are no 'concrete numbers' available for how many journalists have been attacked by authorities, there are many well-documented instances. In 2006, reporter Ogulsapar Muradova died in prison after being denied legal representation. The United Nations recognized the Turkmen government as the responsible party in her death. In 2013, authorities detained journalist Rovshen Yazmuhamedov without cause, according to RSF. Most recently, in 2023, journalist Soltan Achilova was beaten by police officers and banned from leaving the country. Only a small number of independent journalists still operate in the country, and those who do all work under pseudonyms, said Tuhbatullin of the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights. Turkmen authorities also harass the families of journalists. Allashov’s wife and mother were arrested with him in 2016, and his mother was detained for three months and beaten. She was taken in for questioning again in 2019, when she was beaten and passed away two days later from heart failure, according to Yusupov. Authorities also harassed the mother of journalist Yazmuhamedov, banning her from leaving the country to see her other children. 'This is one of the tools authoritarian governments use to silence independent reporting,' Said told VOA. The Committee to Protect Journalists has reached out to Turkmen authorities after every government attack on a journalist. The government has never responded, Said told VOA. Yusupov told VOA that government repression 'makes the work of journalists like Allashov even more important.' 'It’s important to tell the truth in the face of an oppressive regime and provide independent reporting to society,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-of-persecuted-journalist-brings-attention-to-turkmenistan-s-media-repression/7774539.html	2024-09-06T13:02:21-07:00	
At UN, growing calls for reversal of latest Taliban edict against women	New York — A dozen U.N. Security Council ambassadors strongly condemned on Friday the Afghan Taliban’s recent 'morality law' which further erodes the rights of women and girls in that country and called for its reversal. 'On top of the existing edicts, this new directive confirms and extends wide-ranging and far-reaching restrictions on personal conduct and provides inspectors with broad powers of enforcement, thus deepening the already unacceptable restrictions on the enjoyment by all Afghans of human rights and fundamental freedoms,' said Japan’s U.N. ambassador, Yamazaki Kazuyuki. 'Day by day, Afghan women and girls lose their opportunities and hope for their future,' he added. 'This is unacceptable.' Envoys from Ecuador, France, Guyana, Malta, Mozambique, Republic of Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States joined him as he read the statement before reporters. The only Security Council members not to lend their support to the statement were Algeria, China and Russia. On August 21, the Taliban announced the ratification of a detailed 'Law on the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice,' which includes among its restrictions a prohibition on Afghan women using their voices in public and orders them to completely cover their bodies and faces outdoors. Women are also forbidden from interacting with non-Muslims, using public transport alone, and looking at men who are not their husband or blood relative. The Taliban government, which is officially not recognized by any country, has dismissed U.N.-led foreign criticism of the law as offensive. Zabihullah Mujahid, the chief Taliban spokesperson, asserted this week that 'non-Muslims should first educate themselves about Islamic laws and respect Islamic values' before expressing concerns or rejecting the law. 'We find it blasphemous to our Islamic Sharia when objections are raised without understanding it,' he said. The United States, European Union, United Nations and others have condemned the edict, the latest in a series that have eroded the rights of Afghan women and girls. 'Today, we once again urge the Taliban to swiftly reverse all the policies and practices that restrict the enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights and fundamental freedoms,' Ambassador Kazuyuki said. 'The Taliban need to listen and respond to the voices of Afghan women and girls by respecting their rights to education and for women to work, as well as the freedoms of expression and movement. It is a prerequisite for a stable, peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan.' The Japanese envoy noted that the 15-nation Security Council has repeatedly discussed the worsening human rights situation in Afghanistan since the Taliban took over in August 2021 and have 'raised a united voice on multiple occasions.' Last year, the council unanimously adopted Resolution 2681 which calls for the full, equal, meaningful and safe participation of women and girls in Afghanistan. The 12 Security Council members also called on those countries with influence over the Taliban to promote the 'urgent reversal' of the policy, which violates Afghanistan’s obligations under international human rights treaties to which it is a signatory. They also urged the Taliban to allow the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan to visit the country. The Taliban have publicly said they will not allow Richard Bennett entry. The U.N.’s agency for gender equality and women’s empowerment, U.N. Women, warned in a statement on August 28 that the new law is 'effectively erasing women from public life and granting broad enforcement powers to the morality police.' U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo warned last month that the law would only impede Afghanistan’s return to the international fold. The Security Council plans to next discuss Afghanistan in a meeting on September 18.

Venezuela says detained US sailor entered 'without any type of document'	Caracas, Venezuela — A U.S. Navy sailor held in Venezuela since late last month was arrested for entering 'without any type of document,' the South American country's attorney general said Thursday. An American official on Wednesday announced the sailor had been detained at a time of soaring tensions between Washington and Caracas in the aftermath of disputed elections in Venezuela, with the opposition party claiming it can prove were stolen. In his first comments on the matter, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab said the sailor 'entered without any type of document, without any means of subsistence for what he came to do in the country.' He said the sailor held dual U.S. and Mexican nationalities. For its part, the Pentagon said the sailor had been in Venezuela on 'personal travel.' 'This wasn't something that was authorized,' Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters. 'The U.S. Navy is looking into this. We're working with the State Department,' she said, adding that: 'Of course, we'd like to see the sailor returned home.' Venezuela was rocked by protests after President Nicolas Maduro was declared the winner of a disputed July 28 election, with 25 civilians and two soldiers killed and more than 2,400 people arrested. The opposition claims it won by a landslide, and the United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries have refused to recognize Maduro's claimed victory without seeing detailed voting results. On Monday, Washington seized Maduro's plane in the Dominican Republic and flew it to Florida, a move the Venezuelan leader condemned as 'piracy' but which Washington said was necessary due to sanctions violations. The following day, Washington denounced an arrest warrant issued for opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia and warned of further action against Maduro. The U.S. State Department has warned Americans against traveling to Venezuela for reasons including crime, unrest and wrongful detention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-says-detained-us-sailor-entered-without-any-type-of-document-/7773758.html	2024-09-06T02:19:02-07:00	
Indian opposition parties name LGBTQ+ activists to key posts	NEW DELHI — India's main opposition Congress party this week set up a new internal group to promote LGBTQ+ rights while another party has named a person from the community as its spokesperson, in the first such political recognition after many setbacks. The country's top court in 2018 decriminalized homosexuality but greatly disappointed the LGBTQ+ community last year when it declined to legalize same-sex marriage and left it to parliament to decide. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has also said the legislature is the right platform to rule on the contentious issue, and this week invited the public to share views on how best to ensure that policies for the community are inclusive and effective. Same-sex relations are mostly a taboo in the largely conservative country of 1.42 billion people, and the government told the Supreme Court last year that such marriages were not 'comparable with the Indian family unit concept of a husband, a wife and children'. Congress, whose political clout has risen after doing much better than expected in the April-June general election, this week named LGBTQ+ activist Mario da Penha as the head of its new unit for the community under its All India Professionals’ Congress division. This follows Congress's poll promise to bring in a law to legalize civil unions between same-sex couples. Da Penha said on X it was the 'only representative framework for queer people within any recognised national political party in India'. Anish Gawande, who last month became the first person from the community to become the spokesperson for a big party, the opposition Nationalist Congress Party - Sharadchandra Pawar, said da Penha's appointment was 'a major moment for queer inclusion in Indian politics.' Gawande earlier said on social media of the Nationalist Congress appointment: 'If you'd told me 10 years ago that it would be possible to be out and in Indian politics, I would have scoffed in disbelief.' The federal government says it has taken a host of measures for the community, which includes enabling same-sex couples to access government food programs as families, open joint bank accounts and choose each other as nominees, and seek medical and other care without discrimination. The Department of Social Justice and Empowerment said in a statement on Sunday it had invited inputs from the public to ensure that policies and initiatives for the community are inclusive and effective. It did not mention any law to recognize marriages between same-sex couples. A spokesperson for the ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-opposition-parties-name-lgbtq-activists-to-key-posts/7773745.html	2024-09-06T01:45:18-07:00	
In Haiti, Blinken announces $45 million in new aid, calls for renewed security mission mandate	Port-au-Prince, Haiti — During a trip to Haiti on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $45 million in new humanitarian aid for the Caribbean nation, which has been wracked by violence for years. He also called for the renewal of the United Nations mandate for the Multinational Security Support, or MSS, mission to combat the armed gangs that dominate much of the capital. 'At this critical moment, you do need more funding. We do need more personnel to sustain and carry out the objectives of this mission,' Blinken told a news conference on a rare visit to Port-au-Prince. The top U.S. diplomat said he plans to convene a ministerial meeting at the coming U.N. General Assembly to encourage greater international contributions to address Haiti's security, economic, and humanitarian needs. The MSS mandate is set to expire at the beginning of October. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is reportedly exploring the possibility of changing the mission into a traditional U.N. peacekeeping operation, a move that would ease funding, provide more equipment and enable use of military forces rather than only police officers. Blinken said that while the MSS mission itself needs to be renewed, it also needs to ensure that it is 'reliable' and 'sustainable.' 'A peacekeeping operation would be one such option. I think there are others,' he told reporters on Thursday. Blinken's visit to Port-au-Prince underscores U.S. support for Haiti as the country grapples with gang violence. On Thursday, Blinken met with Edgard Leblanc Fils from Haiti's Transitional Presidential Council. 'Both concurred on the critical need to make timely advancements on election preparations,' State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. Apart from Fils, Blinken also held talks with Prime Minister Garry Conille, MSS head Godfrey Otunge and Normil Rameau, head of the Haitian National Police. The United States and Canada are the top funders of the MSS in Haiti. The first-year estimated cost for the mission is $589 million. The U.S. has already provided $309 million — $200 million toward the MSS mission base and $109 million in financial support. Gang-related violence and drug trafficking have fueled political instability and insecurity in Haiti, leading to unbearable conditions for Haitians. At least 80% of Port-au-Prince is no longer under Haitian authorities’ control, with violence spreading to other parts of the country. In the past year, displacement in Haiti has tripled as gang violence grips the Caribbean nation. The U.N. says at least 578,000 people have been displaced because of violence, including murders, kidnappings and rapes. The situation is further exacerbated by widespread hunger, with nearly half the 11.7 million population facing acute food insecurity. After Haiti, Blinken arrived in Santo Domingo later Thursday. His visit follows the start of Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader's second term in mid-August. The Dominican Republic will host the 2025 Summit of the Americas, where Western Hemisphere leaders will address shared challenges and policy issues facing the region. VOA's Liam Scott contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-haiti-blinken-announces-45-million-new-aid-calls-for-renewed-security-mission-mandate-/7773676.html	2024-09-05T20:40:05-07:00	
Sanctions complicate Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project	Islamabad — Pakistan Federal Minister for Petroleum Musadik Malik said Wednesday that international sanctions have caused complications for the Iran-Pakistan cross-border natural gas pipeline project. Media outlets reported that Iran had warned Pakistan to complete its part of the project or face an $18 billion penalty — news that sparked a debate days later in Pakistan's lower house, the National Assembly. Responding to a question by a lawmaker on the floor of the house regarding Iran's final notice, Malik said, 'This is a deeply complicated matter and involves international sanctions.' Malik did not provide more details about sanctions, but said the government is available to discuss the complications. He rejected the penalty figure of $18 billion, saying, 'I do not know where it has come from.' In response to a query regarding reports of Iran's notice, Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said last week that Pakistan had taken note of the development. 'Pakistan and Iran have robust channels of communications including this matter. We have always said that we would like to resolve all issues [with Iran] through friendly consultations,' she said during a briefing. Petroleum Minister Malik, during an informal conversation on the gas pipeline project with local journalists in March, confirmed that Pakistan would present its case to the U.S. and seek an exemption from sanctions. 'We cannot bear American sanctions. We will present our stance to the U.S. We want to complete this project but without any sanctions,' Malik told journalists. However, Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Baloch, also in March, said that the project is progressing 'in conformity with our commitment to the Iran-Pakistan pipeline.' She emphasized that Pakistan perceives no grounds for objections from external parties as the construction activities are confined within Pakistani territory. During a briefing Tuesday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that helping Pakistan address its energy shortage was a priority for the United States. He added, however, that 'we will continue to enforce our sanctions against Iran. We also advise anyone considering a business deal with Iran to be aware of its possible ramifications.' Pakistan experts say Pakistan failed to meet its commitment to build its part of the pipeline for several reasons, including a volatile security situation in Balochistan, where the pipeline is supposed to pass. Gas pipelines are not safe in restive Balochistan and Baloch insurgents frequently target gas pipelines in the resource-rich southwestern province bordering Iran. 'In my opinion, however, Pakistan’s real worry is U.S. sanctions,' said Naveed Hussain, an editor of the Pakistan English daily newspaper The Express Tribune. 'It has declared force majeure, but Iran says Pakistan had signed the agreement while being fully cognizant of [the] U.S. sanctions risk, especially when India had withdrawn from the project for the same reason.' Khaleeq Kiani, who writes about the economy for the Pakistan English daily newspaper Dawn, told VOA, 'The U.S. stance is clear, and recently it imposed sanctions on companies providing equipment to Pakistan missile programs, that was a clear indication to Pakistan to not proceed with the pipeline project.' In April, the U.S. imposed sanctions on four entities — one based in Belarus, and the other three in China — for supplying missile‐applicable items to Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, including its long-range missile program. Despite that precedent, Pakistan's foreign minister, Mohammad Ishaq Dar, said at a May press briefing that Pakistan would not succumb to international pressure on the pipeline project. 'We will not let anyone use their veto,' Dar said, without naming the United States. Dar's remarks came weeks after Donald Lu, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian Affairs, told a U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing that importing gas from Iran would expose Pakistan to U.S. sanctions. Pakistan is facing gas shortages and relies on subsidized gas, putting pressure on the national exchequer, Petroleum Minister Malik said on the house floor Wednesday. Originally envisaged as the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline, the project was reduced to a bilateral agreement after India pulled out in 2008. Tehran and Islamabad signed a 25-year contract in 2009 to export gas from Iran through a 2,400-kilometer gas pipeline to be built jointly by both countries. While Iran has completed its pipeline section, Pakistan keeps dragging its feet on the project. In 2019, the two countries revised their contract, and Islamabad committed to building its portion of the pipeline by 2024.

Excessive rain, changing patterns, dozens of deaths mark Pakistan monsoon	ISLAMABAD — As monsoon season nears its end in Pakistan, higher than average rainfall and rain-related accidents leave behind a trail of deaths, nearly half of them children. Monsoon season runs from July to September in Pakistan. Since the beginning of July, the country has counted at least 337 rain-related deaths, according to the National Disaster Management Authority. One-hundred-seventy children are among the dead. Thousands also have been displaced as floodwaters inundated villages. Pakistan’s meteorological department recorded rains 60% higher than average in the first two months of the monsoon season. August saw 137% more rain than the month’s average after slightly below average rainfall in July. Weather officials expect mostly normal rainfall in September. The data shows that rainfall patterns in Pakistan are changing. 'The shift that we are seeing is that monsoon used to go to the upper areas, that trend is lessening a bit,' Sahibzad Khan, director general of PMD, told VOA. 'Now it’s shifting more to the south.' Rain that was twice as heavy as normal battered Pakistan’s two southern provinces, Sindh and Balochistan, over the last two months, while the northern, mountainous regions saw average-to-below-average rain, according to the national weather agency. Just in Sindh, 72,000 children saw their education disrupted by the severe weather, Save the Children said in a statement Wednesday. Despite heavy rains, flooding, and displacement in parts of the country, experts say Pakistan escaped extensive damage this monsoon season, partly because of lessons learned from the devastating floods in 2022. 'We are working more on anticipatory approaches. Looking at past patterns, we are predicting the scale and velocity of upcoming floods,' said Shafqat Munir Ahmad, deputy executive director of the Resilience Development Program and Policy Outreach at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute in Islamabad. In 2022, historic rains submerged nearly a third of the country at one time, affecting 33 million Pakistanis and causing nearly $30 billion in damage. Since then, Pakistan incorporated technology to plan scenarios and issue early severe weather warnings to communities, said Ahmad, adding that improved coordination and response time also reduced damage. This year, Pakistan also used lightning detectors that China provided last year. 'China has collaborated with us. With their help, we have 26 lightning detector stations that tell us about the type and severity of lightning and thunder,' said weather chief Khan. Pakistan still lacks sufficient long-term planning, however, to tackle the impact of climate change, experts say. The Germany-based Global Climate Risk Index ranks Pakistan the 8th most vulnerable country. A web app created at the University of Maryland that predicts what a city’s weather will be like in 60 years shows summers and winters in several Pakistani cities will be much warmer than they are at present. While projects to mitigate climate change may attract funding, Ahmad said efforts to help vulnerable communities adapt to changing climate lack necessary financial support in Pakistan. Several communities across the South Asian nation are still awaiting funds to rebuild homes devastated by the 2022 weather calamity. Just last July, the Asian Development Bank approved a $400 million loan to fund the reconstruction of homes and infrastructure in Sindh. At a donor conference in January 2023, donors pledged more than $9 billion to help Pakistan build back after the 2022 floods. Still, the country has barely tapped the funds that were largely designated as project loans. As authorities and charitable organizations rush to provide food, water and shelter to communities displaced by this year’s rains and floods, Save the Children urged increased support to prevent the current impact of the floods from becoming long-term problems. 'Governments must tackle the underlying causes of these climate driven disasters, including channeling funding and support to children and their families in Pakistan to adapt, recover and rebuild their lives,' the statement said, quoting country director Khuram Gondal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/excessive-rain-changing-patterns-dozens-of-deaths-mark-pakistan-monsoon/7772643.html	2024-09-05T08:33:00-07:00	
At least 81 killed in Nigeria in suspected Boko Haram attack, officials say	Kano, Nigeria — At least 81 people died and several were missing after an attack by suspected Boko Haram militants in Nigeria's northeastern Yobe State, local officials told AFP on Tuesday. 'Around 150 suspected Boko Haram terrorists armed with rifles and RPGs [rocket-propelled grenades] attacked Mafa ward on more than 50 motorcycles around 1600 hours on Sunday,' said Abdulkarim Dungus, a Yobe state police spokesperson. 'They killed many people and burnt many shops and houses. We are yet to ascertain the actual number of those killed in the attack.' Dungus said it appeared to be a revenge attack 'for the killing of two Boko Haram terrorists by vigilantes from the village.' Bulama Jalaluddeen, a local official, said at least 81 people were killed in the attack. Fifteen bodies had already been buried by their relations by the time soldiers reached Mafa for the evacuation of the corpses, said the official. 'In addition to these, some unspecified number of dead victims from nearby villages who were caught up in the attack were taken and buried by their kinsmen before the arrival of the soldiers,' added the official. 'Many people are still missing and their whereabouts unknown.' Boko Haram and other extremist groups have waged a 15-year insurgency in northeastern Nigeria that has killed more than 40,000 people. Central and northwestern Nigeria have been plagued for years by gangs of criminals known as 'bandits' who raid villages, kill and abduct residents, and burn homes after looting them. By working alongside these gangs, militant groups have increasingly established a presence in central Niger state, officials and analysts say.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-81-killed-in-nigeria-in-suspected-boko-haram-attack-officials-say-/7770651.html	2024-09-03T18:46:50-07:00	
Iran court upholds death penalty for Guard volunteer in protest killing	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran's Supreme Court has upheld a death sentence imposed on a member of the all-volunteer wing of the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard who stormed a house during the 2022 protests over the death of Mahsa Amini and killed a 60-year-old man, a lawyer said Tuesday. The sentence imposed on the Basij member marks a rare moment for Iran to hold accountable its security forces, who waged a bloody, monthslong crackdown on all dissent over Amini's death. More than 500 people were killed and more than 22,000 were detained. Since then, Iran has put to death multiple protesters who were detained in the crackdown and accused of killing security forces, after closed-door trials criticized by activists abroad. Lawyer Payam Derafshan, who represented a protester detained in 2022, told The Associated Press that the Supreme Court reached its verdict on August 26 over the killing of Mohammad Jamehbozorg, a carpet seller in the city of Karaj. The convicted Basij member and others stormed Jamehbozorg's home in Karaj, some 40 kilometers northwest of the capital, Tehran, looking for demonstrators taking part in the Amini protests, including his son. The Basij member, identified only by initials, shot Jamehbozorg in the head, killing him. Two other Guard members also received prison sentences. Iran's government and state media did not report the ruling. Amini, 22, died after being arrested by Iran's morality police over allegedly improperly wearing her hijab, or headscarf. In March, a United Nations fact-finding mission said Iran was responsible for the 'physical violence' that led to Amini's death and concluded that Tehran committed 'crimes against humanity' through its actions in suppressing the protests. There has been another case of a security force member receiving the death penalty over a killing in the Amini protests. In 2023, a military court sentenced Colonel Jafar Javanmardi, the police chief of northern port city of Bandar Anzali, for killing a young man while not observing the country's laws related for using live ammo. The Supreme Court is still reviewing Javanmardi's initial death sentence. Cases involving security forces accused of brutality have been a particular focus of Iran's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian. Last week, Pezeshkian ordered an investigation into the death of a man in custody after activists alleged he had been tortured to death by police officers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-court-upholds-death-penalty-for-guard-volunteer-in-protest-killing-/7770161.html	2024-09-03T14:00:38-07:00

UN experts: Iran executed more than 400 people this year	Geneva — U.N. experts voiced alarm Monday at a surge in executions in Iran last month that pushed the total in the country so far this year to over 400. At least 81 people were put to death in Iran in August alone, significantly more than the 45 reported in July, a group of 11 independent United Nations rights experts said in a statement. The reported number of executions since the start of 2024 rose above 400, including those of 15 women, they said. 'We are deeply concerned by this sharp rise in executions,' said the experts, who are appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council but do not speak on behalf of the United Nations. Iran executes more people per year than any other nation except China, according to rights groups including Amnesty International. The U.N. experts, including the special rapporteurs on the rights situation in Iran and on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions, said 41 of the executions last month had been of people convicted of drug offenses. 'Executions for drug offences violate international standards,' they said. The experts lamented a substantial rise in executions for drug offences in Iran since 2021, with more than 400 drug-related executions carried out last year alone. They also said they had received reports indicating that death penalty trials in Iran often fail to meet due-process guarantees. They pointed to the case of Reza Rasaei, a Kurdish protester, who was executed on August 6 for the murder of an Islamic Revolution Guards Corps member at an event where he had brandished a sign reading: 'Women, Life, Freedom.' His conviction was based on a confession reportedly obtained through torture, and despite co-defendants retracting their testimonies implicating him in the murder and forensic evidence challenging his involvement, the experts said. 'Reports of serious violations of fair trial and due process rights mean that the death penalty as it is currently practiced in the Islamic Republic of Iran amounts to unlawful execution,' they said. The experts said they were 'extremely concerned that innocent individuals may have been executed' and called for a halt to executions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-experts-iran-executed-more-than-400-people-this-year/7768808.html	2024-09-02T15:46:19-07:00	
Iran brings new charges against jailed reformist	Tehran — Jailed Iranian activist and former Cabinet member Mostafa Tajzadeh, a prominent figure of the Islamic Republic's reformist camp, has been charged with 'propaganda' against the state, local media said Monday. Tajzadeh, jailed since July 2022 in Tehran's notorious Evin prison, served as deputy interior minister under the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, a reformist who oversaw a rapprochement with the West between 1997 and 2005. He was sentenced to five years in prison in October 2022 on charges of 'plotting against state security' among others, his lawyer said at the time. Reformist daily Ham-Mihan said Monday that new charges had been brought against Tajzadeh, accusing him again 'of plotting against state security' and 'propaganda against the Islamic Republic.' He had already spent a total of seven years behind bars, having been arrested in 2009 alongside other reformist leaders following the reelection of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in a vote contested by the opposition. Tajzadeh, an outspoken commentator on national politics via social media channels operated by his relatives, said in a letter 'that he would not appear in court' in the new case, according to Ham-Mihan. If convicted, Ham-Mihan said, Tajzadeh could face up to six more years in jail. In recent years, he has urged democratization and called on authorities to enact 'structural changes' in the Iranian political system.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-brings-new-charges-against-jailed-reformist/7768408.html	2024-09-02T09:28:33-07:00	
Iranians loom over Paralympic sitting volleyball competition	Paris — Sitting volleyball is a Paralympic sport played close to the ground: Players scoot around the court and hit over a net that stands jus 1.15 meters tall. So having the world’s second-tallest man at the front of that net can make quite the difference for an already-dominant Iranian team. Standing at 2.46 meters and measuring 1.8 meters seated with his arms raised, Morteza Mehrzadselakjani has helped Iran cruise to the sitting volleyball semifinals in Paris. Iran will begin the semifinals Thursday at North Paris Arena. The International Paralympic Committee says Mehrzadselakjani, the tallest ever Paralympian, was diagnosed with acromegaly, a condition that stems from excessive growth hormone. An injury from a bicycle accident when he was 15 caused his right leg to stop growing, and it is now 15 centimeters shorter than his left leg. The Iranians have yet to lose a set in two matches, beating Brazil in three straight sets Sunday after doing the same to Ukraine on Friday to open group play. Iran, now sitting atop its group with six points, gets one more group match against Germany before chasing a third straight gold medal in the sport. It would also be Iran’s eighth Paralympic gold since it started competing in sitting volleyball 10 Paralympics ago. Zubkovska makes it 5 straight golds in long jump Ukraine's Oksana Zubkovska’s long jump career has stretched over 17 years, but she said the fifth gold she has won since Beijing in 2008 stood out. 'Every medal I have won is very important, but this one is special because of what is happening back home,' she said. Her best five jumps exceeded the marks of any of her opponents, and her winning mark was 5.78 meters. Zubkovska competes in the T12 classification, for individuals with partial vision impairment. US wheelchair basketball closes pool play undefeated The United States men's wheelchair basketball team finished pool play with a 76-69 victory over Australia. This marked the third victory for the Americans, two-time defending gold medalists who have outscored opponents 202-159 over the course of the tournament. 'We came to finish our group play strong,' said player Fabian Romo. 'But our focus is quarterfinals. Now, whoever it may be, we just have to make sure that we’re ready.' The Americans' quarterfinal opponent depends on the outcome of matches Sunday and Monday but France is a possibility. 'If it turns out to [be] France, what a great environment, said American veteran Nate Hinze. 'I mean, it has been fantastic already. Paris is doing a fantastic job filling the stadium and making it loud. The opportunity to play a host country is always fun, we did it in (London) 2012 for a bronze medal. We did it in 2020 in Tokyo so it’s always fun to play the host country.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iranians-loom-over-paralympic-sitting-volleyball-competition/7767481.html	2024-09-01T13:35:00-07:00	
7 US troops hurt in joint raid with Iraqi forces that killed 15 IS operatives	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The U.S. military and Iraq launched a joint raid targeting suspected Islamic State militants in the country's western desert that killed at least 15 people and saw seven American troops hurt, officials said Saturday. For years after dislodging the militants from their self-declared caliphate across Iraq and Syria, U.S. forces have fought the Islamic State group, although the casualties from this raid were higher than in previous ones. The U.S. military's Central Command alleged the militants were armed with 'numerous weapons, grenades, and explosive ‘suicide’ belts' during the attack Thursday, which Iraqi forces said happened in the country's Anbar Desert. 'This operation targeted ISIS leaders to disrupt and degrade ISIS’ ability to plan, organize, and conduct attacks against Iraqi civilians, as well as U.S. citizens, allies, and partners throughout the region and beyond,' Central Command said, using an acronym for the militant group. 'Iraqi Security Forces continue to further exploit the locations raided.' It added, 'There is no indication of civilian casualties.' An Iraqi military statement said, 'Airstrikes targeted the hideouts, followed by an airborne operation. 'Among the dead were key ISIS leaders,' Iraq's military said, without identifying them. 'All hideouts, weapons and logistical support were destroyed, explosive belts were safely detonated, and important documents, identification papers and communication devices were seized.' A U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the operation yet to be made public, told The Associated Press that five American troops were wounded in the raid, while two others suffered injuries from falls during the operation. One who suffered a fall was transported out of the region, while one of the wounded was evacuated for further treatment, the official said. 'All personnel are in stable condition,' the official said. It wasn’t immediately clear why it took two days for the U.S. to acknowledge it took part in the raid. Iraq did not say the U.S. took part in the operation when initially announcing it, as politicians debate the future of having American troops in the country. There are approximately 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq. Since the U.S. toppled dictator Saddam Hussein with its 2003 invasion of Iraq, the country has struggled to balance relations between America and neighboring Iran. Since the Israel-Hamas war broke out, Iraqi militias allied with Iran have targeted U.S. forces there, leading to American airstrikes targeting them. At its peak, the Islamic State group ruled an area half the size of the U.K. It attempted to enforce its extreme interpretation of Islam, which included attacks on religious minority groups and harsh punishment of Muslims deemed to be apostates. A coalition of more than 80 countries led by the United States was formed to fight the group, which lost its hold on the territory it controlled in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria in 2019. However, the militants have continued to operate in the Anbar Desert in Iraq and Syria, while claiming attacks carried out by others elsewhere in the world inspired by the group. That includes the two suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna. Meanwhile, the IS branch in Afghanistan is known to carry out intensely bloody assaults. Last month, the U.S. military said the number of attacks claimed by IS in Syria and Iraq was on track to double this year, compared with the year before. IS claimed 153 attacks in the two countries in the first six months of 2024, compared with 121 attacks in all of 2023. Iraqi officials say that they can keep the IS threat under control with their own forces and have entered into talks with the U.S. aimed at winding down the mission of the U.S.-led military coalition in Iraq. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza last October, U.S. military presence in the region has become particularly contentious. An umbrella group of Iran-backed militias calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has periodically launched drone attacks on bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria, which they said was in retaliation for Washington’s support of Israel in the ongoing war in Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/raid-by-us-iraqi-forces-kills-15-is-operatives-in-west-iraq/7766367.html	2024-08-30T21:15:53-07:00	
Houthi video shows Yemeni rebels rigging bombs on oil tanker	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen's Houthi rebels released footage on Thursday showing their fighters boarded and placed explosives on a Greek-flagged tanker, setting off blasts that put the Red Sea at risk of a major oil spill. The vessel was abandoned earlier, after the Houthis repeatedly attacked it. In the video, the Iran-backed Houthis chant their motto as the bombs detonated aboard the oil tanker Sounion: 'God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse the Jews; victory to Islam.' The blasts capped the most-serious attack in weeks by the Houthis in their campaign disrupting the $1 trillion in goods that pass through the Red Sea each year over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, as well as halting some aid shipments to conflict-ravaged Sudan and Yemen. The Sounion carried about 1 million barrels of oil when the Houthis initially attacked it on August 21 with small-arms fire, projectiles and a drone boat. A French destroyer operating as part of the European Union's Operation Aspides rescued the Sounion's crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, after they abandoned the vessel and took them to nearby Djibouti. The footage released Thursday shows masked Houthi fighters carrying Kalashnikov-style rifles boarding the Sounion after it was abandoned. The bridge appeared ransacked. Fighters then rigged explosives over hatches on its deck leading to the oil tankers below. At least six simultaneous blasts could be seen in the footage. The footage, as well as comments by the Houthi's mysterious leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi, confirmed an earlier analysis by The Associated Press that the Houthis boarded and planted explosives on the Sounion. The Houthi-controlled SABA news agency described al-Houthi as saying the Sounion attack shows America 'is lying in its claims regarding any deterrence of Yemeni operations supporting Palestine.' 'The effectiveness of our operations and their control of the situation is acknowledged by the enemies,' al-Houthi said. Western countries and the United Nations have warned that any oil spill from the Sounion could devastate the coral reefs and wildlife that call the Red Sea home. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the new Houthi footage. However, the EU's naval force in the region says it has yet to see any oil spill from the Sounion. Operation Aspides 'is preparing to facilitate any courses of action, in coordination with European authorities and neighboring countries, to avert a catastrophic environmental crisis,' the EU mission said. 'Together, we can protect the environment and maintain stability in the region.' On Wednesday, the Houthis suggested they may allow the Sounion to be salvaged, although the rebels earlier blocked crews trying to reach the abandoned vessel, the U.S. military said. The Houthis have targeted more than 80 vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/houthi-video-shows-yemeni-rebels-rigging-bombs-on-oil-tanker/7764376.html	2024-08-29T12:39:44-07:00	
Pakistan security officials in 'Taliban' captivity appeal for help	ISLAMABAD — Militants in northwestern Pakistan released video Thursday of an army colonel and his brother, a senior civilian security officer, showing them in captivity and requesting authorities help secure their freedom. The officers are part of a group of four people, including their third brother and a nephew, whom gunmen abducted Wednesday evening while attending their father's funeral in the militancy-hit Dera Ismail Khan district. The outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for kidnapping the four men but did not share their demands publicly. 'We are safe and well and in the custody of the Taliban in a remote area where the Pakistani government has no control,' Lieutenant Colonel Khalid Amir stated in the 35-second video. Two men dressed in traditional attire, holding assault rifles, are seen in the background with their faces deliberately kept out of the video frame. 'We appeal to the government and our higher authorities to promptly accept the Taliban’s demands for our release,' Amir said without elaborating. The brother of the army officer, Asif Amir, a police assistant commissioner, made a similar statement and urged his relatives to pressure Pakistani authorities to secure their freedom. Area security officials confirmed the identities of the hostages and the authenticity of the video to VOA on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to discuss the matter with the media. The fate of the other two hostages was not immediately known. The TTP sources claimed that they do not produce videos of civilian captives who are not associated with the Pakistani military and law enforcement agencies. The Pakistani Taliban routinely carry out hit-and-run attacks against security forces and government targets in Dera Ismail Khan and other districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan. Pakistan maintains that the TTP, a globally designated terrorist group, orchestrates deadly cross-border attacks from sanctuaries on Afghan territory and receives growing support from the Islamist Taliban leaders of the neighboring country. The violence has killed hundreds of Pakistanis, primarily security forces, in recent months, straining Islamabad’s ties with Kabul’s de facto Afghan rulers. Taliban officials reject the Pakistani allegations, saying the TTP is not present in Afghanistan. However, recent United Nations security reports disputed Taliban claims and described the TTP as 'the largest terrorist group in Afghanistan,' being trained and equipped in al-Qaida-run training camps in areas near the border with Pakistan. The U.N. assessments also noted that Afghan Taliban fighters are participating in TTP-led cross-border attacks in Pakistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-security-officials-in-taliban-captivity-appeal-for-help/7764072.html	2024-08-29T09:34:16-07:00
