Far-right's fate in German regional vote could break Scholz -- or remake him	berlin — Weeks after topping a state vote for the first time and nearly winning another, Germany's far-right is taking aim at Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD) in another regional election that could shape his political future. Sunday's tight-looking vote in Brandenburg, the swampy lakeland round the capital Berlin, takes place in a region the SPD has ruled since reunification more than three decades ago. The Alternative for Germany (AfD), with its nationalist demands for halts to immigration, windfarm construction and arming Ukraine, has a narrow roughly three-point lead in polls with nearly 30% of voting intentions. The SPD has been battered by the federal government's unpopularity amid high inflation, the Ukraine war impact and high migrant influxes, but it has closed the gap recently in Brandenburg polling. 'Brandenburg is historically an SPD stronghold,' said Philipp Thomeczek, politics professor at Potsdam University. 'If they don't win here that would be a massive break.' Coming a year ahead of a national election, the vote could trigger a party backlash against Scholz or, if the SPD holds the state, confirm him as their candidate for 2025. His conservative opponents are far ahead with their bloc commanding around a third of the vote in most nationwide polls, while the SPD and AfD vie for a distant second. The conservatives this week settled on their chancellor candidate for next year: Friedrich Merz, a sharp-tongued arch-conservative. But Scholz and many Social Democrats believe the gaffe-prone Merz's low personal popularity gives them a chance. Though none will yet say it openly, some in Scholz's party believe he should follow his idol Joe Biden and step aside for a more charismatic champion like defense minister Boris Pistorius. But a win in Scholz's home state -- his constituency is in the state capital Potsdam and his wife is a Brandenburg minister -- may quell the murmurs against him. The party has made barely any mention of Scholz in the campaign, relying instead on the popularity of state premier Dietmar Woidke, a trained food chemist. He said that if the AfD wins most votes he would step aside and not even offer himself as a candidate to lead any potential coalition. 'The aim is to stop the AfD from winning,' he said. 'Mordor' windmills Unable to form a coalition despite winning most votes in Thuringia state earlier this month, the AfD has almost no chance of forming a regional or federal government given every other party refuses to work with a movement security services class as extremist. The AfD has faced -- and denies -- accusations of racism and of harboring agents for China and Russia. Brandenburg presents a mixed economic picture: it is home to Tesla's first factory in Europe and has wealthy parts within the Berlin commuter belt. But some of its outlying villages and farmscapes have been shrinking for decades. As well as concern over Ukraine and migration, the AfD has channeled public anxiety over energy transition: its state head Hans-Christoph Berndt likened windfarms to 'unbearable horror landscapes like Mordor,' the fictional land of evil. He provoked mockery -- but also some approval -- when in one debate he reinterpreted religious doctrine to say: 'As a Catholic I think loving your neighbor means looking out for your own countrymen.' Should the SPD struggle on Sunday, that could open the way for Merz's Christian Democrats to form a coalition in Brandenburg, perhaps with the backing of a new party, the socially conservative, economically left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, and others. Unseating the SPD in its stronghold would be a boost for Merz, fresh from his anointment, and could tip an already restive SPD into open revolt against the chancellor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/far-right-s-fate-in-german-regional-vote-could-break-scholz----or-remake-him/7790224.html	2024-09-19T02:15:11-07:00	
Cuban dissident leader wins Norwegian human rights award	OSLO, Norway — A Norwegian human rights foundation gave its annual prize on Thursday to jailed Cuban dissident leader Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara for his 'fearless opposition to authoritarianism through art.' Four past laureates of the Rafto prize — Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi, East Timor's Jose Ramos-Horta, South Korea's Kim Dae-jung and Iran's Shirin Ebadi — later went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize. This year's Peace Prize will be announced on Oct. 11 in Oslo. 'The 2024 Rafto prize aims to highlight the importance of the work of Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara and other artists in challenging power structures and defending democracy and human rights, both in Cuba and globally,' the Norwegian foundation said in a statement. A Cuban court sentenced the artist-dissident in 2022 to five years in jail in a high-profile case that human rights groups branded a 'farce' but that Cuban state media said was a fair trial over 'common crimes.' The 36-year-old artist was a prominent member of the Havana-based San Isidro Movement, an artists collective that led a number of protests over two years. Many of the group have since left Cuba, alleging government repression. On Thursday, the Rafto foundation called on the Cuban government to release him, joining similar calls by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. The laureate is awarded a diploma and prize money of $20,000.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cuban-dissident-leader-wins-norwegian-human-rights-award/7790222.html	2024-09-19T01:43:47-07:00	
Thailand pushing for talks to repair key Myanmar highway	Bangkok — Thailand wants to work with warring sides in Myanmar to repair a key highway cutting through the conflict-ridden country as it seeks to stabilise borders areas and keep trade routes open, Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa said on Thursday. Thailand has the support of the ASEAN regional bloc and India in the push to rebuild parts of the Asian Highway 1 (AH-1) that has been damaged by recent fighting, he told reporters. Laos, the current chair of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, has also asked Thailand to host a regional meeting on Myanmar before the end of the year, he said, without providing further details. 'I don't think Myanmar problems can be addressed militarily, but through constructive dialogue,' Maris said. Myanmar has been in turmoil since February 2021, when its powerful generals ousted an elected civilian government, triggering a protest movement that has morphed into an armed rebellion against the ruling junta. The military government has lost control of swathes of the country and the economy has been crippled. ASEAN has barred the generals from attending its summits until progress is achieved on a 2021 peace plan devised by the bloc, which the junta agreed to but has failed to follow. That agreement includes dialogue between all sides in the conflict. An important trade route, the AH1 stretches more than 1,500 km (932 miles) from Myawaddy on the Thai-Myanmar frontier to Tamu on Myanmar's border with India. The area around Myawaddy, previously a conduit for more than $1 billion of annual border trade, saw fierce fighting earlier this year as rebel fighters pushed the junta out of the frontier town.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-pushing-for-talks-to-repair-key-myanmar-highway/7790194.html	2024-09-18T23:35:30-07:00

Crisis-hit Sri Lanka's poor hope new president will change their fortunes	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lankan housewife Lankika Dilrukshi says she is tired of the daily struggle needed to provide for her children. On Saturday, she is voting in a presidential poll she sees as key to securing a better future for herself, and her nation. Dilrukshi, 31, is one of the millions of people barely able to make ends meet since the island nation's economy in 2022 plunged into its worst financial crisis in decades. 'Life has become so difficult, we need change,' she said. 'We need a leader who will work for the poor.' The economic recovery is at the core of the three-way election battle between President Ranil Wickremesinghe, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, and Marxist-leaning politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The three are frontrunners and have promised new strategies to rescue the economy, lower taxes and support businesses. Sri Lanka's poor and middle class want an equitable economic recovery that will support their aspirations, said Umesh Moramudali, who teaches economics at the University of Colombo. 'The poor are really, really struggling,’’ Moramudali said. ‘’Higher prices hurt them most, especially higher food prices.' Although inflation cooled to 0.5% last month and GDP is forecast to grow 3% in 2024, for the first time in three years, the change is slow and yet to trickle down. Sri Lankans were hit hard by the 2022 economic crisis, which was triggered by a severe shortfall of foreign currency that added to problems caused by the pandemic. Inflation soared to 70%, the rupee depreciated 45% and the economy shrank by 7.3%, forcing the government to seek an International Monetary Fund bailout. The latest government data shows that in 2023, 7 million people - almost one-third of the total population - were considered poor. By mid-2023, about nearly half of all families had limited their food intake, data from 10,000 households gathered by Colombo think tank LIRNEasia showed. Rising food insecurity also led to malnutrition in children, with the number of those with stunted growth increasing to over 17% in 2023 from 12% in 2021. Burdened by new taxes and fewer high-earning jobs, migration has skyrocketed. More than 600,000 people left the country for work over the last two years, compared to 122,264 in 2021, according to government data. Fruit seller Nancy Hemalatha, 61, borrowed $495 to fund her business, and says she barely has $6.50 left every day after repaying the loan. 'My two youngest sons want to migrate. That is their focus now,' Hemalatha said. As for housewife Dilrukshi, whose laborer husband earns about $8 daily, frugality is the only way to survive. She keeps poultry and fish out of meals to funnel funds towards her 13-year-old daughter's education and borrows small amounts from neighbors. 'I want everyone to have a better future...so that my daughter can become a doctor,' she said. 'That is what I want to see happen.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/crisis-hit-sri-lanka-s-poor-hope-new-president-will-change-their-fortunes/7790183.html	2024-09-18T23:12:30-07:00	
Airbus investing in Chinese firm that supplies Myanmar military: report	BANGKOK — A new report from Burmese activist groups is calling on French-based airline manufacturer Airbus to use its influence with Aviation Industry Corporation of China, or AVIC, to pressure the Chinese firm to end its arms sales to the Myanmar junta. AVIC is one of the world’s biggest defense contractors, and the Chinese aviation firm supplies aircraft and weapons to Myanmar’s military junta that are being used in airstrikes in the war-torn country. The report, which was released Monday, says Airbus has not only maintained but increased investment in companies controlled by the Chinese firm. According to the report, Airbus is 'heavily' invested in AVIC’s Hong Kong-listed holding company, AviChina, a strategic partner of AVIC China. An Airbus spokesperson denies allegations that the company could be in violation of international sanctions. In its report titled #AIRBUSTED How Airbus’ close partner AVIC is supplying arms to the Myanmar military and what Airbus should do about it, Justice for Myanmar, and Info Birmanie, a non-profit organization in Paris that focuses on Myanmar, say they have uncovered evidence that AVIC is continuing to supply aircraft and weapons to the Myanmar military, which they say have been used to commit war crimes throughout the country. The report’s authors have called on Airbus to 'use its leverage over AVIC and its subsidiaries so they halt all ongoing and planned transfers of military aircraft, arms and associated equipment to the Myanmar military,' as well as maintenance, training and technical support for the country’s air force. 'Because of these known risks, Airbus should conduct heightened due diligence on any current and future partnerships with AVIC and its subsidiaries and make that due diligence public,' the report said. The report also called on Airbus to divest and end its relationship with AVIC if the company refuses to end its relationship and all business with Myanmar’s military. Philippe Gmerek, a spokesperson for Airbus, told VOA in an email that the French airline manufacturer is compliant with sanctions on Myanmar and within international law with its relationship with AVIC. 'Airbus has not supplied defence products to Myanmar or its armed forces. Airbus is committed to conducting its business ethically and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. This includes the delivery of defence products in accordance with export control laws and in full transparency and alignment with authorities and relevant stakeholders,' Gmerek said in the emailed statement. He added that 'Airbus' relationship with Chinese companies, including AVIC, is fully compliant with all European and international laws and regulations, notably with regards to the existing arms embargo on China. As such, Airbus' industrial and technology partnerships in China are exclusively focused on civil aerospace and services.' AVIC, one of the world’s largest military contractors, has been under U.S. sanctions since 2020 and is listed by Washington as a potential national security threat because of its links to the Chinese military. Those sanctions prohibit any American organization or individuals from dealing with firms that have links to the Chinese PLA. Myanmar has been in chaos since military leader General Min Aung Hlaing and his military forces overthrew the democratically elected government in February 2021. The coup sparked widespread armed resistance to military rule, led by ethnic armed groups and forces loyal to a civilian-led shadow government. Upwards of 5,600 people have been killed by the military and millions displaced since the coup, according to rights groups. In a joint statement at the U.N. Security Council in February, France joined Britain, Ecuador, Japan, Malta, South Korea, Slovenia, Switzerland and the United States in strongly condemning the military’s violent attacks on civilians in Myanmar, including its 'continued use of indiscriminate airstrikes.' The governments of France, Germany and Spain all hold major shares in Airbus through holding companies. VOA reached out to Christian Lechervy, France’s ambassador to Myanmar, and AVIC for comment but has yet to receive a reply. Johanna Chardonnieras, coordinator for Info Burmie, said the French government, among others, should act. 'The French, Spanish and German governments have a responsibility and a duty to act when Airbus’ partner and investee is linked to war crimes,' Chardonnieras said. 'Today they have the opportunity to show their capacity for action, in line with their statements, values and sanctions.' Yadanar Maung, the Justice for Myanmar spokesperson, called for the U.S. to take action should Airbus continue its business ties with AVIC. 'We call on the U.S. government to conduct due diligence on any business activities and links it currently has with Airbus and encourage U.S. citizens and entities to do the same. Airbus' decision to continue its business relationship with AviChina should be subject to consequences, including restricting market opportunities in the U.S.,' she told VOA. Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington who focuses on Southeast Asia politics and security, says the report could tarnish Airbus’ reputation, though it is unclear how much of an impact it could have beyond that. 'Airbus will obviously try to make the case that they only partner with AVIC in the commercial aircraft, but obviously there’s a lot of dual use technology,' Abuza said. 'The biggest hit to the firm is reputational damage. I am not sure Myanmar is a large enough issue, or it’s a priority for European leaders, or there’s a significant and politically powerful diaspora to demand changes,' he told VOA. The U.S., Canada, Britain and the EU have all imposed a variety of sanctions on Myanmar’s military regime and its entities in recent years in a bid to end its violent crackdown.	https://www.voanews.com/a/airbus-investing-in-chinese-firm-that-supplies-myanmar-military-report/7790180.html	2024-09-18T22:52:22-07:00	
Haitian American news site faces harassment over post-debate Ohio coverage	NEW YORK — Journalists at a news site that covers the Haitian community in the United States say they've been harassed and intimidated with racist messages for covering a fake story about immigrants eating the pets of people in an Ohio town. One editor at the Haitian Times, a 25-year-old online publication, was 'swatted' this week with police turning up at her home to investigate a false report of a gruesome crime. The news site canceled a community forum it had planned for Springfield, Ohio, and has shut down public comments on its stories about the issue because of threats and vile posts. The Times, which had the Committee to Protect Journalists conduct safety training for its journalists in Haiti, has now asked for advice on how to protect staff in the United States, said Garry Pierre-Pierre, founder and publisher. 'We've never faced anything like this,' Pierre-Pierre said Wednesday. Site says it isn't backing down The Times has debunked and aggressively covered the aftermath of the story about immigrants supposedly eating the dogs and cats of other Springfield residents, as it was spread by Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's Republican running mate in the presidential election, and Trump himself in his debate with Democrat Kamala Harris. Despite receiving hundreds of these messages, the site isn't backing down, said Pierre-Pierre, a former reporter at The New York Times who echoed a mission statement from his old employer in making that promise. 'We do not want to hibernate,' he said. 'We're taking the precautions that are necessary. But our first duty is to tell the truth without fear or favor, and we have no fear.' Pierre-Pierre, who emigrated to the United States in 1975, started the Haitian Times to cover issues involving first- and second-generation Haitians in the United States, along with reporting on what is happening in their ancestral home. It started as a print publication that went online only in 2012 and now averages 10,000 to 15,000 visitors a day, although its readership has expanded in recent weeks. Macollvie Neel, the New York-based special projects editor, was the staff member who had police officers show up at her doorstep on Monday. It was triggered when a Haitian advocacy group received an email about a crime at Neel's address. They, in turn, notified police who showed up to investigate. Not only did the instigators know where Neel lived, they covered their tracks by funneling the report through another organization, she said. Neel said she had a feeling something like this might happen, based on hateful messages she received. But it's still intimidating, made more so because the police who responded were not aware of the concept of doxxing, or tracing people online for the purpose of harassment. She said police searched her home and left. She was always aware that journalism, by its nature, can make people unhappy with you. This takes the threat to an entirely new level. Racist hate groups who are ready to seize on any issue are sophisticated and well-funded, she said. 'This is a new form of domestic terrorism,' she said, 'and we have to treat it as such.' 'It’s outrageous’ Katherine Jacobsen, the Committee to Protect Journalists' U.S., Canada and Caribbean program coordinator, said it's a particularly acute case of journalists being harassed in retaliation for their coverage of a story. 'It's outrageous,' she said. 'We should not be having this conversation. Yet we are.' Even before Springfield received national attention in recent weeks, the Haitian Times had been covering the influx of immigrants to the Midwest in search of jobs and a lower cost of living, Pierre-Pierre said. A story currently on its site about Springfield details how the furor 'reflects America's age-old battle with newcomers it desperately needs to survive.' Another article on the site talks about the NAACP, Haitian American groups and other activists from across the country coming to the aid of Springfield residents caught in the middle of the story. Similarly, the Times has heard from several other journalists — including from Pierre-Pierre's old employer — who have offered support. 'I'm deeply touched,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haitian-american-news-site-faces-harassment-over-post-debate-ohio-coverage/7790172.html	2024-09-18T22:33:02-07:00

North Korea tests new ballistic missiles with super-large warhead, KCNA says	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea tested new tactical ballistic missiles using super-large warheads and modified cruise missiles on Wednesday as leader Kim Jong Un called for stronger conventional weapons and nuclear capabilities, state news agency KCNA reported. The tests to improve weapons capabilities are required because of the grave threat posed by outside forces to the security of the country, Kim, who led the tests, was quoted as saying. The account followed the firing of multiple short-range ballistic missiles on Wednesday reported by the South Korean military, which was the second time the North test-launched missiles in a week. Last week, North Korea also unveiled a uranium enrichment facility, in its first such public report. Kim stressed 'the need to continue to bolster the nuclear force and have the strongest military technical capability and overwhelming offensive capability in the field of conventional weapons too,' KCNA said. Wednesday's tests involved the new tactical ballistic Hwasongpho-11-Da-4.5 missiles, KCNA said, indicating it was part of a series of short-range ballistic missiles it had been developing. The missile was mounted with a 4.5-ton super-large conventional warhead, KCNA said. North Korea's state media reported the tests of missiles with the same name in July, which was considered a partial success. On Thursday, state media released photographs of a projectile striking a target in a hilly area. South Korea's military said on Thursday two ballistic missiles landed in a mountainous area in the North's northeast. Such a missile launch test with an intention to hit an inland target is likely unprecedented, said Shin Seung-ki, who is the head of research on North Korea's military at the state-run Korea Institute for Defense Analyses in Seoul. North Korea routinely test-launches missiles to drop in the sea or on an uninhabited island. The particular missile with the Hwasongpho-11-Da-4.5 designation is still under development but Russia may want it soon if its performance and reliability can be guaranteed through further testing, Shin said. 'North Korea will want to shorten that time as much as possible,' he said. Kyiv officials and independent experts have said there were signs some of the missiles used by Russia in the war against Ukraine were North Korean-made, including some that were produced this year. Moscow and Pyongyang both deny any illicit arms trade or shipments. The North's military also tested a strategic cruise missile that has been upgraded for combat use, KCNA said. North Korea has criticized military drills by the South Korean and U.S. militaries, including a large-scale exercise conducted this summer, as preparations for war on the Korean peninsula. The allies say the drills are defensive in nature and aimed at maintaining readiness against any North Korean aggression.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-tests-new-ballistic-missiles-with-super-large-warhead-kcna-says/7790151.html	2024-09-18T20:57:32-07:00

Lawyers question if drugged French woman was unconscious, consented	AVIGNON, France — Lawyers for some of the men accused of raping an unconscious French woman who had been drugged by her husband questioned her Wednesday about her habits, personal life and sex life, and even questioned whether she was truly unconscious during the encounters. Gisèle Pelicot's testimony came a day after her ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, told the court that for nearly 10 years, he drugged her and invited dozens of men to rape her as she lay defenseless. She fiercely rejected any suggestion that she was anything but an unwitting victim. 'Since I've arrived in this courtroom, I've felt humiliated. I am treated like an alcoholic, an accomplice. ... I have heard it all,' she said at the start of the day's proceedings, breaking at times with the remarkable calm and stoicism she has shown throughout the often harrowing trial that has gripped France. Gisèle Pelicot, who was married to her husband for 50 years and shares three children with him, has become a hero to many rape victims and a symbol of the fight against sexual violence in France for waiving her anonymity in the case, letting the trial be public and appearing openly in front of the media. Her ex-husband and the 50 other men on trial, who range in age from 26 to 74, face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Many of the defendants deny having raped Gisèle Pelicot. Some claim they were tricked by Dominique Pelicot, others say they believed she was consenting, and others argue that her husband's consent was sufficient. Gisèle Pelicot and her lawyers say the preponderance of evidence — thousands of videos and photos taken by her ex-husband of men having sex with her while she appeared to be unconscious — should be enough to prove she was a victim and was entirely unaware of what Dominique Pelicot was subjecting her to from at least 2011 until 2020. But on Wednesday, defense lawyers focused their questions on the notion of consent and whether she was aware of what was happening at any point during some of the 90 sexual encounters that prosecutors believe were rapes. 'Don't you have tendencies that you are not comfortable with?' one lawyer asked Gisèle Pelicot. 'I'm not even going to answer this question, which I find insulting,' she responded, her voice breaking. 'I understand why victims of rape don't press charges. We really spill everything out into the open to humiliate the victim.' Another lawyer asked whether she was indeed unconscious during one of the encounters captured on video. 'I didn't give my consent to Mr. Pelicot or these men behind me for one second,' she said, referring to her ex-husband's co-defendants. 'In the state I was in, I could not respond to anybody. I was in a state of coma — the videos will attest to it.' The line of questioning upset her. 'Since when can a man decide for his wife?' she said, stressing that only one of her ex-husband's 50 co-defendants had refused his invitation to rape her. That man met Dominique Pelicot online and invited him to rape his own wife, who was also drugged, authorities contend. 'What are these men? Are they degenerates?' she said angrily. 'They have committed rapes. That's all I have to say.' Another questioned the time and date stamps on the videos, and whether she thought the sexual acts lasted as long as the stamps suggested. 'Rape is not a question of time,' she said. 'To talk of minutes, seconds. ... It does not matter how long they spent. It's so degrading, humiliating what I am hearing in this room,' she said. At one point, Dominique Pelicot, who already said during the trial that all of the accusations against him are true, came out in support of his ex-wife, saying, 'Stop suspecting her all the time ... I did many things without her knowing.' On Tuesday, he testified that all of his co-defendants knew exactly what they were doing when he had them over, saying, 'They knew everything. They can't say otherwise.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/lawyers-question-if-drugged-french-woman-was-unconscious-consented/7790114.html	2024-09-18T19:24:05-07:00	
Indian-controlled Kashmir sees brisk voting for local government	SRINAGAR, India — Voting in the first phase of a staggered election to choose a local government concluded Wednesday in Indian-controlled Kashmir, the first such vote since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government stripped the disputed region of its special status five years ago. Turnout was about 59%, the region's chief electoral officer said in a statement, as voting was 'incident-free and peaceful.' Authorities had deployed thousands of additional police and paramilitary soldiers for security in the seven southern districts of the region, which has been roiled by an insurgency against Indian rule for decades. More than 2.3 million residents are eligible to vote to choose 24 lawmakers out of 219 candidates in the first phase of the election. Wearing riot gear and carrying assault rifles, troops set up checkpoints and patrolled constituencies as long lines of voters stretched around the polling booths. The second and third phases are scheduled for September 25 and October 1. The process is staggered for logistical reasons and to allow troops to move around to stop potential violence in the Himalayan region. For the first time, authorities limited access to polling stations for foreign media and denied press credentials to most journalists working with international media, including to The Associated Press, without citing any reason. India and Pakistan each administer part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi's rule since 1989. Most Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels' goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and most Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. The vote is the first in a decade, and the first since Modi's Hindu nationalist government in 2019 scrapped the Muslim-majority region's semi-autonomy, downgraded the former state to a federally governed territory and stripped its separate constitution and inherited protections on land and jobs. It was also divided into two federal territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir, ruled directly by New Delhi, allowing it to appoint administrators to run the territories along with unelected bureaucrats and security personnel. Many people said they knew their votes won't solve the dispute over Kashmir but provided a rare window to express their frustration with direct Indian control. Aamir Ahmed, a first-time voter in Pulwama town, said it was important to elect a local representative 'who does not condone wrongdoing.' 'We have witnessed a lot of suffering in the last 10 years,' Ahmed said. Another voter, 80-year-old farmer Ali Mohammad Alai, said he had been 'reduced to penury by the Modi government' after authorities took away his land given to him decades ago for cultivation by the local administration. 'All I want is to get that land back,' he said. 'Our own government can do that.' The multistage election will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a local legislature, called an assembly, instead of remaining under New Delhi's direct rule. A chief minister will head a council of ministers in the government. However, there will be a limited transition of power from New Delhi to the local assembly as Kashmir will continue to be a 'Union Territory' — directly controlled by the federal government — with India's Parliament remaining its main legislator. The elected government will have partial control over areas like education, culture and taxation but not over the police. Kashmir's statehood must be restored for the new government to have powers similar to other states of India. Multiple local parties have campaigned on promises to fight for reversal of 2019 changes and address other key issues like rising unemployment and inflation in the region where locals have struggled amid curtailed civil liberties particularly after the revocation of the special status. India's ruling BJP, however, has vowed to block any move aimed at undoing those changes but promised to help in the region's economic development.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-controlled-kashmir-sees-brisk-voting-for-local-government/7790111.html	2024-09-18T19:06:12-07:00	
At least 12 soldiers killed in recent Niger attacks, army says	Niamey, Niger — A series of ambushes and explosions across military-run Niger killed at least 12 soldiers and wounded 30 others recently, the army announced on state-run television Wednesday. In the first attack, in western Tillaberi region on Sunday, 'a horde of criminals who arrived in their hundreds' killed five soldiers and wounded 25 more, according to the army. The ground and air response killed 'more than 100' attackers, the army said, without giving further details about them. On Monday, in the restive southwest Diffa region where there are frequent attacks by Boko Haram and the West African branch of the Islamic State group, five patrolling soldiers were killed by an improvised explosive device. A 'surgical strike' in retaliation 'killed several terrorists' responsible, the army said. In the latest attack, militants from a new resistance group called the Patriotic Movement for Freedom and Justice (MPLJ) claimed an operation against a military outpost in the Agadez region in the north. The army said two soldiers were killed and six wounded in Tuesday's attack. 'A pursuit operation was immediately launched to track down the fleeing assailants, who were heading for the Libyan border,' the army added. The MPLJ claimed to have killed 14 soldiers and two gendarmes in the attack, and to have lost two of its own fighters. Created in August, the MPLJ is an offshoot of the Patriotic Liberation Front (FPL) armed group, which is fighting the junta for the release of ousted President Mohamed Bazoum. Democratically elected Bazoum was overthrown in a coup in July 2023 and has since then been held at the presidential palace. While the military justified its power grab by citing the deteriorating security situation, violence persists. According to the independent Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project, about 1,500 civilians and soldiers in Niger have been killed in militant attacks over the past year, compared with 650 between July 2022 and 2023 when Bazoum was in charge.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-12-soldiers-killed-in-recent-niger-attacks-army-says-/7790105.html	2024-09-18T18:56:08-07:00	
Uzbekistan opens free economic zone on Afghan border	Termez, Uzbekistan — Afghans longing for closer connections with the outside world are finding an outlet in the border city of Termez, where neighboring Uzbekistan invites them to visit a new international trade center aimed at boosting regional trade and creating business opportunities. 'It’s uplifting to be here, as we’ve been dreaming about creating a common market for so long. Perhaps this is the beginning of it, despite all the challenges,' said Ajmalik Nader Saghpi, a visitor from Afghanistan’s Laghman Province. Nearby, other Afghan men approach along a dedicated corridor leading from the border control area and lounge on a green lawn in front of a prayer hall. Branded as the Airitom Free Zone, the facility sits on the banks of the Amu Darya, a river marking the border between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan and feeding much of Central Asia. Airitom is a neighborhood in Termez, the administrative center of Uzbekistan’s Surkhandarya region, which also borders Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. Built at a cost of around $70 million, the zone spans 36 hectares and is guarded by special forces and police. It features a customs office and storage area capable of handling 100,000 trucks and 900,000 tons of goods a year. It also includes a Hilton Garden Inn, a high-tech hospital, an academic campus, Uzbek and Turkish restaurants, and 50,000 square meters of business space, along with banking and legal services. It is separate from the nearby Termez Cargo Center, an international transport and logistics hub. When VOA toured the zone in August and saw the model, managers said the site, once fully functional, is projected to generate $1.2 billion in trade and attract 1.5 million visitors a year. 'We’re not fantasizing,' said Bakhtiyor Rahimov, the zone’s manager, acknowledging challenges in the region. 'We believe this is realistic because we have studied the neighboring country and others around us, surveyed businesses, and discussed our vision with Afghan leaders. We know they are keen to work with us.' Those high hopes have been echoed by high-profile visitors including Uzbek Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov, Taliban’s acting Prime Minister Abdul Ghani Baradar, and cabinet members from Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan. Any foreigner can stay in the zone for two weeks visa-free. Visitors can conduct commerce in any currency, customs-free. President Shavkat Mirziyoyev instructed that 40% of the space be allocated to Afghan manufacturers and traders, and up to 30% of the projected 5,000 jobs can go to them. Hakim Yar, a businessman from Balkh, the nearby Afghan province, plans to open a couple of offices here for export-import and for an agricultural firm he runs in the Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif. He is satisfied with what’s available in the zone and is among those Afghans already occupying 5% of the space. Qari Shergulan, from Nangarhar, envisions that more Afghans will come if entrepreneurs like him return home with positive experiences. He says his people are eager to seize opportunities wherever they find them and won’t waste any chance to grow. 'We have not lost our potential. We can still work, build, trade, earn, expand, and invest,' Shergulan told VOA when asked about the economic conditions in Afghanistan. None of the Afghan visitors VOA spoke with complained about the Taliban. Instead, they praised Kabul’s cooperation with the Uzbek government and its support for efforts like the new trade center. However, they mentioned electricity shortages, unemployment, diminishing manufacturing, and lack of opportunities across Afghanistan, particularly for youth. Tashkent-based Central Asian University is opening a campus in the zone, promising free education and residence for 200 Afghans, as well as business training for others. 'We will soon have a visa office here,' said Mirkhamid Mirpulatov, the zone’s CEO. 'Foreigners seeking work, study, or services here for a longer period can apply for visas. 'The special corridor on the border, once you cross the bridge over the Amu Darya, is only for our zone. The access is limited to this area. Those interested in doing business outside the Airitom Free Zone need additional permissions,' Mirpulatov explained. Airitom is on the main transportation route linking Pakistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia. This is a key factor for landlocked Uzbekistan, which is eager for access to ports on the Indian Ocean. The zone is also starting daily bus service between Airitom and Mazar-i-Sharif, about 60 kilometers away. The private hospital in the zone is a branch of Tashkent-based Akfa Medline. 'The costs here are lower than in the capital,' Mirpulatov said. 'Afghans have been patients for years, so offering health care here on the border simplifies everything for them.' With 315 staff members and state-of-the-art operating and treatment facilities, Akfa Medline has adjusted its services to mainly cater to Afghans, creating separate units for men and women, something it does not do in Tashkent. 'We’re doing this out of respect for our neighbor’s culture, just as we’re not allowing alcohol in the zone,' Mirpulatov said, denying that Airitom is run under Taliban rules. 'We do discuss business with them but make our own decisions.' Uzbek tycoon behind enterprise Jahongir Artikkhodjayev, an Uzbek business tycoon and former mayor of Tashkent, is the mastermind behind the Airitom Free Zone. Mirpulatov confirmed that the zone is under Akfa Group, one of the largest Uzbek industrial holdings, founded and run by Artikkhodjayev. As with other major projects in the country, President Mirziyoyev entrusted Artikkhodjayev with delivering this trade center, according to Mirpulatov, who calls Artikkhodjayev his mentor. Akfa Group secured the funds for the zone. There is no Western involvement so far, though South Asians, Russians, Chinese and Arabs have shown interest. US view on development When VOA asked U.S. Ambassador to Uzbekistan Jonathan Henick about the Airitom Free Zone, he underscored America’s overall position on Afghanistan and the Taliban. 'Broadly speaking, we support anything that helps ordinary Afghan people and contributes to stability along the border. We recognize that Uzbekistan has legitimate economic concerns that need to be addressed,' he said. 'That should be separate from the question of the Taliban’s desire for international recognition and access to funds. These issues must continue to be handled collectively by the international community through the Doha process,' under which some 30 countries have been discussing how to advance international engagement on Afghanistan. Henick added, 'We have a very strong dialogue with Uzbekistan about Afghanistan. Uzbekistan is an active participant in the Doha process. Our interests are closely aligned.' Other Western diplomats in Tashkent agreed with Henick that recognizing the regime in Kabul, based on human rights and governance conditions, is key to normalizing relations and attracting investment. The Taliban remain angry over a recent deal under which several dozen U.S. aircraft that were flown to Uzbekistan as the Taliban seized control in Afghanistan have been transferred to Uzbek control. But, Henick said, Washington and Tashkent maintain 'a robust military and security relationship.' At the same time, Henick told VOA: 'The U.S. is the largest contributor of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan to this day. We provide enormous amounts of aid because, like Uzbekistan, we have an interest in ensuring there is no humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uzbekistan-opens-free-economic-zone-on-afghan-border/7789564.html	2024-09-18T18:41:48-07:00	
Biden to host Quad leaders at Delaware home	washington — President Joe Biden has made it a priority to elevate the relationship of the Quad, four countries touched by the Indo-Pacific region, the White House said, as he prepares to host the leaders of Japan, India and Australia on Saturday at his Delaware home. The region stretches from the U.S. West Coast to the shores of India to the northeast waters of Japan to the waters around Australia, and includes the many tiny, diffuse islands of the Pacific. That swath of the globe, the U.S. Commerce Department says, holds more than half the world's people and two-thirds of its economy. And, administration officials said, this summit is personally important to Biden, as demonstrated by his decision to host the visitors in his private home in Wilmington, about 160 kilometers from the White House. 'The Biden-Harris administration has made elevating and institutionalizing the Quad a top priority,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. 'And this leaders' summit will focus on bolstering the strategic convergence among our countries, advancing our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, and delivering concrete benefits for our partners in the Indo-Pacific in key areas.' Officials say the leaders will act on the region's concerns and will announce moves on illegal fishing in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. 'We've moved forward substantially on efforts that basically allow for the Pacific and Southeast Asia to track — largely untracked to this point — illegal fishing fleets that are the scourge of these extraordinarily important fishing areas,' U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell told reporters Wednesday. 'Vast majority of those fishing fleets are Chinese. We think these capacities will be indeed very helpful in helping local governments repel illegal fishing in their home waters.' Biden often likes to say that the U.S. is at an inflection point — a fact he has stressed recently as American voters face a tense November election with two very different presidential candidates. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump disagree on how to maintain the crucial U.S.-China relationship. Trump is campaigning hard on harsh tariffs on China, saying, in a recent rally, 'I'm putting a 200% tariff on them,' while making false claims that Chinese automakers are putting up large factories in Mexico. And Harris is expected to continue Biden's more cautious policy of keeping lines of communication open even while competing forcefully in many areas. Beijing recently showed its sensitivity to hearing its name in U.S. election rhetoric, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying last week: 'The election is an internal affair of the U.S. I won't comment on election remarks. But we oppose the U.S. using the election to criticize China.' Analysts say pulling the leaders of four powerful democracies into one room gives them space to talk freely. 'So really, I think the real agenda is not spoken about. It's China,' said Rafiq Dossani, a senior economist at the RAND research corporation and a professor of policy analysis. 'It's how to manage the rivalry with China.' 'Each has their concerns about China,' he told VOA. 'That becomes, then, the text of the subtext or the background story.' But this group's interests extend far beyond China, analysts say. 'This is certainly not a Contain China club,' said Kathryn Paik of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'The primary objectives of the Quad have focused on health, on delivering infrastructure needs, on enhancing countries' ability to monitor their maritime domains and their maritime resources, and on people-to-people ties between these countries.' VOA State Department Bureau Chief Nike Ching and Kim Lewis contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-host-quad-leaders-at-delaware-home/7790088.html	2024-09-18T18:31:01-07:00	
Musk's X skirts Brazil ban, returns to some users with change to server access	RIO DE JANEIRO — Some Brazilian users regained access to X on Wednesday despite a nationwide ban put in place by the country's Supreme Court, a reunion apparently resulting from a change in the way the social network's servers are accessed. But the renewed access may be short-lived. Late last month, Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered X blocked nationwide after months of tension with the site's billionaire owner, Elon Musk, over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. De Moraes also set fines for anyone using virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access the platform. That rendered X effectively inaccessible in the country until Wednesday, when an Associated Press journalist was among those who regained access. The number of X posts made in Brazil rose from 939,000 Tuesday to more than 2 million by late afternoon Wednesday, data analysis company Bites said. Experts examining X's IP addresses — numeric designations that identify sites' locations on the internet — said there are indications the company has begun routing users through the servers of Cloudflare, a content delivery network, en route to its own. 'The service that Elon Musk's social network has started using works like a 'digital shield' that protects the company's servers,' said Pedro Diogenes, Latin America's technical director for CLM, a distributor that focuses on cybersecurity. It acts as a proxy between users and X's servers, filtering traffic and preventing the original IP address from being recognized, Diogenes told the AP. Brazilian telecommunications regulator Anatel said it is looking into the situation and will report its findings to the Supreme Court, noting that there has been no change to de Moraes' ruling. A panel of fellow justices later upheld his decision, though it hasn't yet gone before the court's full bench. His fine for VPN users in particular has faced blowback, including from the nation's bar association. The Supreme Court declined to comment on possible actions it could take. Musk, who often uses his platform to disparage de Moraes, hadn't commented on X by late afternoon. Former President Jair Bolsonaro celebrated the return of the social network. He has sided with Musk in the feud with de Moraes and sought to portray the ban as censorship from an overzealous judge. 'I congratulate you all for the pressure that makes the wheels turn in defense of democracy in Brazil,' Bolsonaro posted Wednesday on X. Some Brazilian X users trumpeted the platform's return — with several addressing de Moraes directly, vowing that they weren't using a VPN. There have been no reports of fines being levied against people using VPNs. Protection of controversial sites Cloudflare, a security company that prides itself on providing services to websites regardless of their content, has a history of protecting sites other companies won't touch — up to a point. In 2017, for instance, it dropped the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer as a customer following a deadly clash at a white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. And in 2022, it dropped the notorious stalking and harassment site Kiwi Farms, citing an 'immediate threat to human life.' But X is a mainstream social media platform — even if it may be home to some extremist content — and it is not yet clear whether Brazil's ban would be enough for San Francisco-based Cloudflare to abandon it. Cloudflare has a reputation for cooperating with governments, however, and so may comply with an order from the Supreme Court to cease serving as X's proxy, David Nemer, who specializes in the anthropology of technology at the University of Virginia, told the AP. Ordering internet service providers to block Cloudflare would be impossible since thousands of Brazilian companies depend on it, Nemer previously wrote on Bluesky, another social media platform. A person close to Cloudflare, who was not authorized to speak publicly about a business relationship, said the network services provider did not do anything specifically to help X get around Brazil's ban. Rather, X recently switched to Cloudflare from another provider, which could be a reason the block is not working. This person added that the workaround likely won't last long. De Moraes could also attempt to force Musk's hand by going after his satellite-based internet service provider Starlink, as he has done since the ban, said Rafael Mafei, a law professor at the University of Sao Paulo. On Friday, de Moraes seized about $3 million from bank accounts belonging to X and Starlink to collect what X owed in fines. Legal analysts have questioned de Moraes' prior decision to freeze Starlink's bank account until it paid for X's fines. While Musk owns both X and SpaceX, which operates Starlink, the two companies are separate entities. But de Moraes has shown that he considers the two companies to belong to the same economic group, Mafei said. 'Under normal circumstances, anyone else who openly took active steps to obstruct judicial measures and investigations, as Musk is doing, would possibly have already had their arrest decreed in Brazil,' Mafei said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/musk-s-x-skirts-brazil-ban-returns-to-some-users-with-change-to-server-access/7790072.html	2024-09-18T17:59:35-07:00	
UN: 'Immediate action' needed to halt fighting in Sudan's Darfur	united nations — A senior United Nations official warned Wednesday that 'immediate action' is needed to halt the fighting in the capital of Sudan's North Darfur region, where hundreds of thousands of civilians are at risk. 'We urge members of the Security Council to employ their collective leverage to help protect the population caught in the crossfire,' Martha Pobee, U.N. assistant secretary-general for Africa, told council members. A round of large-scale fighting erupted on September 12 between the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, who advanced on the capital of El Fasher from multiple directions, and the Sudanese Armed Forces, who are positioned inside the city. El Fasher is the only capital in the Darfur region that has not yet fallen to the rebel paramilitary. Civilians inside the large city, including an estimated 700,000 people displaced from other parts of Sudan, have been under siege for months with little outside assistance. Pobee urged exploring the possibility of local cease-fires. 'Prior to the deterioration of the situation in El Fasher, a local cease-fire protected the city's population for close to a year,' she said. 'A return to such an arrangement in El Fasher and similar short-term solutions in other locations must continue to be pursued.' War causes humanitarian crisis Sudan is experiencing a massive humanitarian crisis because of the war between two rival generals that began in April 2023. More than 10 million people have fled their homes in search of safety, and last month, international monitors confirmed famine in North Darfur. According to the United Nations, 26 million people are in crisis levels of hunger across the country. In June, the 15-nation Security Council adopted a resolution calling for 'an immediate halt to the fighting and for de-escalation in and around El Fasher,' but it has been totally ignored. During a news conference Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his frustration with the intransigence of Sudan's warring generals. 'I mean, the truth is that you have two generals, and you have two groups, one army and one paramilitary institution, that are fighting each other, without any consideration for the needs and the dramatic impacts of their people,' he said. 'The level of hunger is spreading terribly in Sudan. The number of people killed and maimed is increasing dramatically. And as a matter of fact, all this is done with total impunity.' On Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that both sides must pull back their forces, facilitate unhindered humanitarian access and re-engage in negotiations to end the war. The United States, Saudi Arabia and other partners have pressed for peace for months. While the U.S. and its partners have been successful in opening up some routes for humanitarian relief into Sudan, they so far have failed to silence the guns. Diplomats continue seeking solutions Next week, the head of the Sudanese Armed Forces and chairman of the Transitional Sovereignty Council, General Abdel Fattah Burhan, will be in New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly meetings. Diplomats say there will be multiple meetings on the sidelines of the General Assembly gathering to discuss the situation in Sudan, including a ministerial-level meeting to be hosted by the United States, France, Germany and the European Union. Burhan said Wednesday that the government 'remains resolute and fully committed to ending the suffering of our citizens' and is open to all constructive efforts aimed at ending the war. He said he looks forward to discussing it further during his trip to New York.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-immediate-action-needed-to-halt-fighting-in-sudan-s-darfur/7789778.html	2024-09-18T17:35:33-07:00	
US House Republicans fail to pass funding bill as shutdown approaches	washington — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives failed on Wednesday to pass a funding bill that included a controversial voting measure backed by Donald Trump, complicating efforts to avert a possible government shutdown at the end of the month. Despite urging from Trump, the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 presidential election, House Republicans were unable to muster enough votes to pass the package and send it on the Democratic-controlled Senate. With Democrats mostly united in opposition, the bill failed by a vote of 202-220, with 14 Republicans voting against and three Democrats in favor. House Speaker Mike Johnson said afterward that he would craft a new temporary spending bill that would keep the government running beyond Oct. 1, when current funding is set to expire. He did not provide details. 'Now we go back to the playbook, draw up another play and we'll come up with another solution,' Johnson said. 'I'm already talking to colleagues.' Democrats in the House and the Senate say they are eager to pass a stopgap spending bill to avert a disruptive shutdown that would furlough hundreds of thousands of federal workers. However, they opposed the version that Johnson brought to a vote on Wednesday, because it was paired with an unrelated voting bill that would require Americans to provide proof of citizenship when they register to vote and require states to purge non-citizens from their registration lists. Johnson also has to contend with a contingent of Republicans who typically vote against stopgap funding bills. Trump has made illegal immigration a central issue in his re-election bid and has falsely claimed that Democrats are registering illegal immigrants to vote, the latest in a long line of lies about election fraud. House Republicans say their bill is needed to ensure that only American citizens vote. It is already illegal for a noncitizen to vote in federal elections and in state elections in every state, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. 'It's already illegal for a minor to purchase alcohol, yet we still card them. We still enforce the law,' said Republican Representative Aaron Bean. Senate Democrats have refused to consider the Republican voting bill, saying it would risk disenfranchising legitimate voters while doing nothing to bolster election security. A 2017 study found 30 instances of suspected illegal immigrant votes out of more than 25 million cast. Democratic Representative Steny Hoyer predicted that Johnson would ultimately bring up a straightforward spending bill that could attract Democratic support — a dynamic that has played out repeatedly over the past year as Republicans have been paralyzed by infighting. 'We've seen this film before. Let's just skip to the ending today,' he said. Congress faces an even more critical deadline on Jan. 1, by which time lawmakers will have to raise the nation's debt ceiling or risk defaulting on more than $35 trillion in federal government debt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-republicans-fail-to-pass-funding-bill-as-shutdown-approaches/7790053.html	2024-09-18T17:15:57-07:00	
Intelligence suggests Iran sought to ensnare Trump, Biden in hack-and-leak	washington — Iran’s efforts to upend U.S. politics ahead of November’s presidential election by targeting the campaign of former President Donald Trump went well beyond a standard hack-and-leak operation. According to U.S. intelligence officials, Tehran sought to ensnare the campaign of Trump’s then-opponent, incumbent U.S. President Joe Biden. Information released late Wednesday by U.S. intelligence officials indicates Iranian cyber actors not only tried to leak stolen Trump campaign documents to media organizations but also tried to feed them to Biden campaign officials, hoping the Biden team might try to use them. 'Iranian malicious cyber actors in late June and early July sent unsolicited emails to individuals then associated with President Biden’s campaign that contained an excerpt taken from stolen, nonpublic material from former President Trump’s campaign as text in the emails,' according to a statement by the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. 'There is currently no information indicating those recipients replied,' the statement added, noting the Iranian hackers have continued to peddle the stolen information to U.S. media organizations. 'The FBI has been tracking this activity, has been in contact with the victims, and will continue to investigate and gather information in order to pursue and disrupt the threat actors responsible,' the statement said. Earlier this month, a U.S. intelligence official warned that Tehran is 'making a greater effort than in the past to influence this year's elections.' Those efforts included what the official described as a 'multipronged approach to stoke internal divisions and undermine voter confidence' that has included attacks on Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democrats’ presidential nominee after Biden ended his campaign in late July. Iran's mission to the United Nations has not yet responded to a request from VOA for comment. It has previously denied involvement in any attempts to interfere with U.S. elections. In an email to VOA, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt raised the possibility, without providing supporting evidence, that Harris and Biden may have used hacked material obtained from Iranians to try to hurt the Trump campaign. The Harris campaign told VOA in an email that it has cooperated with law enforcement since it was made aware of the Iranian activities. 'We’re not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign,' said campaign spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein. 'A few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt,' Finkelstein said. 'We condemn in the strongest terms any effort by foreign actors to interfere in U.S. elections, including this unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity.' The Trump campaign first announced the suspected hack last month, initially blaming 'foreign sources hostile to the United States.' U.S. intelligence officials attributed the attack to Iran about a week later. An unclassified U.S. assessment issued earlier this month cautioned, 'Iran has a suite of tools at its disposal.' 'Beyond attempts to hack and leak information, Iran is conducting covert social media operations using fake personas and using AI to help publish inauthentic news articles,' it added. Private technology companies have likewise warned about Iran’s activities. In a report issued just days before the Trump campaign said it had been hacked by Iran, Microsoft said Tehran-linked actors were already seeding the online space for influence operations and potential cyberattacks. But Microsoft President Brad Smith on Wednesday indicated Iranian preparations began even earlier. 'We've seen, starting in May, increasingly sophisticated Iranian activity to penetrate network accounts,' Smith told a cyber summit in Washington. 'It's a classic prelude to hack-and-leak operations. If you can steal the email in June, you can use it in October and you can even change the email.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/intelligence-suggests-iran-sought-to-ensnare-trump-biden-in-hack-and-leak/7789781.html	2024-09-18T17:12:02-07:00	
Pakistan, Russia expand economic ties amid Western sanctions	Islamabad/Washington — Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk met with Pakistani officials in Islamabad on Wednesday to deepen economic ties and expand cooperation 'across multiple sectors,' as Moscow grapples with U.S. and EU economic sanctions over its war against Ukraine. Overchuk’s visit comes after two days of meetings between John Bass, U.S. acting undersecretary of state for political affairs, and Pakistani army chief General Asim Munir and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar in Islamabad. During a joint press conference with his Russian counterpart Wednesday in Islamabad, Dar said discussions centered on expanding economic ties between the two countries. Pakistan’s bilateral trade with Russia reached an unprecedented $1 billion last year. The countries are committed to expanding trade ties by addressing logistical and related issues, Dar said. According to Dar, Pakistan and Russia are expanding ties in many fields, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) purchases. However, sanctions against Russia restrict cooperation between the two countries. 'Even today, we looked at how to expand our relationship, and overcome this constraint of the banking system, which you know are facing sanctions, which obviously constrains our relationship, the volume of our relationship could have been much bigger,' Dar said Dar said Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State had detailed discussions in October 2023, and American officials agreed to Pakistan's request to purchase Russian LNG, as long as a committee of U.S. trade officials determines the price. According to Dar, Pakistan views Russia as an important player in West, South and Central Asia. He said Pakistan aims to work with Moscow toward peace and stability in Afghanistan. Pakistan’s army media wing said in a statement on Wednesday that Russia’s Overchuk spoke with General Syed Asim Munir, chief of the army staff (COAS), in Rawalpindi. 'Both reiterated Pakistan's commitment to fostering traditional defense ties with Russia. Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to strengthen security and defense cooperation in multiple domains,' the statement says. Analysts say the Russian deputy prime minister's visit and the expansion of cooperation shows Moscow is expanding its influence in the region. 'In my view, a vacuum has emerged after the U.S. exit from Afghanistan, and Russia is positioning itself to fill that void. China is also making efforts in this direction. As a result, Pakistan is working under this policy framework to improve its relations with regional countries, including Russia,' professor Manzoor Afridi, a Pakistani academic on international relations, told VOA. Muhammad Taimur Fahad Khan, a Pakistani international affairs expert at Institute of Strategic Studies, Islamabad, told VOA, 'The primary goal during this period is to enhance trade, strengthen diplomatic ties, and develop infrastructure, particularly in the energy sector. However, the United States has restricted certain aspects of Pakistan's ballistic missile program, while tensions between Russia and Ukraine have escalated. In this context, Pakistan's relationship with Russia holds significance.' Pakistan received its first shipment of Russian liquefied petroleum gas in 2023. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif discussed the possibility of liquefied natural gas supplies earlier in July on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit at Astana, Kazakhstan.

Russia pledges to back Pakistan's BRICS membership	islamabad — Russia expressed support Wednesday for Pakistan's entry into the BRICS intergovernmental group of major emerging economies from the Global South. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk made the pledge after holding delegation-level talks in Islamabad with Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who is also the deputy prime minister. Pakistan announced last November that it had formally requested to join BRICS, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. 'We are happy that Pakistan has applied … and we would be supportive of that,' said the Russian deputy prime minister during a joint news conference with Dar when asked about Moscow’s position on Pakistan’s bid to join BRICS. 'At the same time, there is a consensus that needs to be built within the organization to make those decisions,' Overchuk said, noting that 'we have shared a very good relationship with Pakistan.' Moscow initially launched BRICS in 2009 to provide members with a conduit for challenging the world order dominated by the U.S. and its Western allies. South Africa joined in 2010, and the group expanded this year with new members from the Middle East and Africa. The Russian deputy prime minister said Wednesday that the organization acts as a platform for discussions 'based on quality, mutual respect and consensus' among member countries. 'It’s actually what is attracting many countries from throughout the world to BRICS,' he stated. Russia will host the 2024 BRICS Summit in Kazan on October 22-24. Overchuk said that Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin would attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, or SCO, heads of government meeting in the Pakistani capital next month. The SCO is a security, political and economic grouping launched by China, Russia and Central Asian states in 2001 as a counterweight to Western alliances. It expanded to nine countries after archrivals Pakistan and India joined in 2017 and Iran in 2023. In a post-talks statement Wednesday, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry quoted Dar as conveying to Overchuk Islamabad’s 'desire to intensify bilateral, political, economic and defense dialogue' with Moscow. The statement said the two sides 'agreed to pursue robust dialogue and cooperation' in trade, industry, energy, connectivity, science, technology and education.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-pledges-to-back-pakistan-s-brics-membership/7789762.html	2024-09-18T16:37:24-07:00	
Africa needs its own medical research for its health issues, experts say	Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — One of the hurdles to improving health care systems for African countries is the shortage of scientists and lack of meaningful medical research on the continent, experts say. An organization hopes to change that by enabling researchers and policymakers in three large African countries to develop more extensive and relevant research. According to a 2017 report by the World Economic Forum, Africa is home to 15% of the world’s population and 25% of the world’s disease burden — but produces just 2% of the world’s medical research. The report said of the medical research that does occur, much of it fails to prioritize diseases or health problems most pressing for Africans. A group of African health researchers and institutions are now pushing for the continent’s medical research to be more focused on the continent’s own medical problems. The African Population and Health Research Center is bringing together scientists, academics, policymakers and government officials from Ethiopia, Kenya and Nigeria. Their goal is to strengthen African leadership in research and development, ensuring that the findings from these researchers are relevant and accessible to decision-makers, leading to better health care systems across the continent. Catherine Kyobutungi, head of the organization, said African-led research can help solve health problems on the continent much more easily and quickly. 'If we want the research to be done by Africans in Africa on African issues, that is [how] the priorities for what research should be done are defined, not just by academics, but by the people who are going to use that research for decision-making,' she said. 'What we are trying to achieve is to shift what research is and what it is for and to create an army of African scientists that do research to solve African problems in real time, not after 50 years,' Kyobutungi said. Dr. Hadiza Galadanci, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Bayero University in Nigeria, said her country accounts for about 28% of maternal deaths worldwide each year. She and researchers from four African countries, Birmingham University in the United Kingdom and the World Health Organization published research on the best way to save women who were dying from postpartum hemorrhage, or excessive bleeding after childbirth. Their innovation — a calibrated obstetric drape, which is placed beneath a birthing mother — allows physicians to collect and precisely measure blood and fluid loss. 'The drape is just put under ... the woman when she's going to deliver. And then, as soon as she delivers, any blood that comes out goes to the drape. So, we have an objective assessment,' Galadanci explained, saying that the process allows for more specific treatment. 'When we did this, we found out that we could reduce the rate of severe [postpartum hemorrhage] leading to maternal death by 60%.' African researchers face challenges ranging from a lack of reliable data and funding to poor infrastructure to cultural and religious issues. With the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Africa Research Connect was developed to connect and enhance the visibility of scientists, institutions, policymakers and donors. Jude Igumbor, an associate professor at Wits School of Public Health in South Africa, wants to improve the visibility of African scientists and their work. 'What we give African scientists is they are able to find each other for collaboration,' he said. The African Population and Health Research Center is calling on donors to fund African institutions and researchers directly instead of going through other organizations, saying that doing so helps the money create opportunities and hone the skills of researchers on the continent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/africa-needs-its-own-medical-research-for-its-health-issues-experts-say/7789676.html	2024-09-18T15:04:35-07:00	
Uzbekistan free economic zone opens door for Afghan entrepreneurs	Termez, Uzbekistan — Afghans longing for closer connections with the outside world are finding an outlet in the border city of Termez, where neighboring Uzbekistan invites them to visit a new international trade center aimed at boosting regional trade and creating business opportunities. 'It’s uplifting to be here, as we’ve been dreaming about creating a common market for so long. Perhaps this is the beginning of it, despite all the challenges,' said Ajmalik Nader Saghpi, a visitor from Afghanistan’s Laghman Province. Nearby, other Afghan men approach along a dedicated corridor leading from the border control area and lounge on a green lawn in front of a prayer hall. Branded as the Airitom Free Zone, the facility sits on the banks of the Amu Darya, a river marking the border between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan and feeding much of Central Asia. Airitom is a neighborhood in Termez, the administrative center of Uzbekistan’s Surkhandarya region, which also borders Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. Built at a cost of around $70 million, the zone spans 36 hectares and is guarded by special forces and police. It features a customs office and storage area capable of handling 100,000 trucks and 900,000 tons of goods a year. It also includes a Hilton Garden Inn, a high-tech hospital, an academic campus, Uzbek and Turkish restaurants, and 50,000 square meters of business space, along with banking and legal services. It is separate from the nearby Termez Cargo Center, an international transport and logistics hub. When VOA toured the zone in August and saw the model, managers said the site, once fully functional, is projected to generate $1.2 billion in trade and attract 1.5 million visitors a year. 'We’re not fantasizing,' said Bakhtiyor Rahimov, the zone’s manager, acknowledging challenges in the region. 'We believe this is realistic because we have studied the neighboring country and others around us, surveyed businesses, and discussed our vision with Afghan leaders. We know they are keen to work with us.' Those high hopes have been echoed by high-profile visitors including Uzbek Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov, Taliban’s acting Prime Minister Abdul Ghani Baradar, and cabinet members from Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan. Any foreigner can stay in the zone for two weeks visa-free. Visitors can conduct commerce in any currency, customs-free. President Shavkat Mirziyoyev instructed that 40% of the space be allocated to Afghan manufacturers and traders, and up to 30% of the projected 5,000 jobs can go to them. Hakim Yar, a businessman from Balkh, the nearby Afghan province, plans to open a couple of offices here for export-import and for an agricultural firm he runs in the Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif. He is satisfied with what’s available in the zone and is among those Afghans already occupying 5% of the space. Qari Shergulan, from Nangarhar, envisions that more Afghans will come if entrepreneurs like him return home with positive experiences. He says his people are eager to seize opportunities wherever they find them and won’t waste any chance to grow. 'We have not lost our potential. We can still work, build, trade, earn, expand, and invest,' Shergulan told VOA when asked about the economic conditions in Afghanistan. None of the Afghan visitors VOA spoke with complained about the Taliban. Instead, they praised Kabul’s cooperation with the Uzbek government and its support for efforts like the new trade center. However, they mentioned electricity shortages, unemployment, diminishing manufacturing, and lack of opportunities across Afghanistan, particularly for youth. Tashkent-based Central Asian University is opening a campus in the zone, promising free education and residence for 200 Afghans, as well as business training for others. 'We will soon have a visa office here,' said Mirkhamid Mirpulatov, the zone’s CEO. 'Foreigners seeking work, study, or services here for a longer period can apply for visas. 'The special corridor on the border, once you cross the bridge over the Amu Darya, is only for our zone. The access is limited to this area. Those interested in doing business outside the Airitom Free Zone need additional permissions,' Mirpulatov explained. Airitom is on the main transportation route linking Pakistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia. This is a key factor for landlocked Uzbekistan, which is eager for access to ports on the Indian Ocean. The zone is also starting daily bus service between Airitom and Mazar-i-Sharif, about 60 kilometers away. The private hospital in the zone is a branch of Tashkent-based Akfa Medline. 'The costs here are lower than in the capital,' Mirpulatov said. 'Afghans have been patients for years, so offering health care here on the border simplifies everything for them.' With 315 staff members and state-of-the-art operating and treatment facilities, Akfa Medline has adjusted its services to mainly cater to Afghans, creating separate units for men and women, something it does not do in Tashkent. 'We’re doing this out of respect for our neighbor’s culture, just as we’re not allowing alcohol in the zone,' Mirpulatov said, denying that Airitom is run under Taliban rules. 'We do discuss business with them but make our own decisions.' Jahongir Artikkhodjayev, an Uzbek business tycoon and former mayor of Tashkent, is the mastermind behind the Airitom Free Zone. Mirpulatov confirmed that the zone is under Akfa Group, one of the largest Uzbek industrial holdings, founded and run by Artikkhodjayev. As with other major projects in the country, President Mirziyoyev entrusted Artikkhodjayev with delivering this trade center, according to Mirpulatov, who calls Artikkhodjayev his mentor. Akfa Group secured the funds for the zone. There is no Western involvement so far, though South Asians, Russians, Chinese and Arabs have shown interest. US view on development When VOA asked U.S. Ambassador to Uzbekistan Jonathan Henick about the Airitom Free Zone, he underscored America’s overall position on Afghanistan and the Taliban. 'Broadly speaking, we support anything that helps ordinary Afghan people and contributes to stability along the border. We recognize that Uzbekistan has legitimate economic concerns that need to be addressed,' he said. 'That should be separate from the question of the Taliban’s desire for international recognition and access to funds. These issues must continue to be handled collectively by the international community through the Doha process,' under which some 30 countries have been discussing how to advance international engagement on Afghanistan. Henick added, 'We have a very strong dialogue with Uzbekistan about Afghanistan. Uzbekistan is an active participant in the Doha process. Our interests are closely aligned.' Other Western diplomats in Tashkent agreed with Henick that recognizing the regime in Kabul, based on human rights and governance conditions, is key to normalizing relations and attracting investment. The Taliban remain angry over a recent deal under which several dozen U.S. aircraft that were flown to Uzbekistan as the Taliban seized control in Afghanistan have been transferred to Uzbek control. But, Henick said, Washington and Tashkent maintain 'a robust military and security relationship.' At the same time, Henick told VOA: 'The U.S. is the largest contributor of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan to this day. We provide enormous amounts of aid because, like Uzbekistan, we have an interest in ensuring there is no humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uzbekistan-free-economic-zone-opens-door-for-afghan-entrepreneurs/7789564.html	2024-09-18T15:01:20-07:00	
US official: China's support for Russia's war effort in Ukraine 'comes from very top'	state department — A senior U.S. State Department official said Wednesday that Beijing's support for Moscow’s defense industry comes directly from the top leadership of the People’s Republic of China, or PRC. The official also pointed out that chips supplied by China have significantly bolstered Russia's battlefield capabilities in its war against Ukraine. For months, U.S. officials have accused the PRC of actively aiding Russia's war effort. Washington has sanctioned Chinese firms providing crucial components to Russia's defense industry. On Wednesday, Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell told lawmakers that the U.S. had been slow to fully grasp the 'absolute intensity of engagement' between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. 'The most worrisome thing is that it [China’s support for Russia] comes from the very top,' Campbell said during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. He added that 'chips, some design features, some capacities associated with the making of explosives' have been enhancing Russia's battlefield operations. 'We see the role of UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones] and other capacities that are penetrating the Ukrainian airspace. Much of that has been supported surreptitiously by China, and it raises real concerns.' Chinese officials rejected Washington’s accusations, asserting that the U.S. should not 'smear or attack the normal relations between China and Russia' or infringe upon 'the legitimate rights and interests' of China and its companies. Beijing also continues to call for peace talks between Russia and Ukraine leading to a political settlement, more than two and a half years into the war. Some members of Congress have urged President Joe Biden’s administration to sanction Chinese banks for supporting Russia’s war on Ukraine. 'We've put many of their [PRC] financial institutions on watch. … We've got to have Europeans with us. I think we're beginning to make headway,' said Campbell. The State Department’s second-ranking diplomat said the challenges posed to the U.S. by the PRC exceed those of the Cold War, following a large-scale joint military exercise between China and Russia. Dubbed 'Ocean-2024,' the massive naval and air drills spanned a huge swath of ocean and involved more than 400 naval vessels, at least 120 military aircraft and upward of 90,000 troops, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Without naming specific countries, Chinese officials said that the military exercise between the two allies, which concluded Monday, was intended to address joint threats. Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, elaborated during a recent briefing in Beijing, saying, 'China and Russia [held] this joint exercise in order to deepen their mil-to-mil strategic coordination and strengthen the capacity to jointly address security threats.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-official-china-s-support-for-russia-s-war-effort-in-ukraine-comes-from-very-top/7789660.html	2024-09-18T14:25:30-07:00	
Haiti creates provisional electoral council to prepare for first vote since 2016	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Haiti's government on Wednesday created a provisional electoral council long sought by the international community to prepare the troubled Caribbean country for its first general elections since 2016. Smith Augustin, a member of the country's transitional presidential council, confirmed to The Associated Press that the electoral council was created, albeit with only seven of what by law is supposed to be a nine-member panel. He said the two other members would likely be announced in upcoming days. The electoral council, which represents groups including farmers, journalists, human rights activists and the Vodou community, is tasked with organizing the elections and helping create the legal framework to hold them. Haiti, which has not had a president since July 2021, last held elections in 2016. The previous electoral council had been dissolved in September 2021 by former Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who accused it of being 'partisan.' His move delayed elections planned for November 2021 and prompted critics to accuse him of holding on to power, accusations he rejected. A transitional leader, Henry was sworn in as prime minister roughly two weeks after former President Jovenel Moise was assassinated at his private home in July 2021. Henry repeatedly pledged to hold elections but blamed worsening gang violence for his failure to do so. Earlier this year, gangs that control 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, launched coordinated attacks on critical government infrastructure, a move that eventually led to Henry's resignation. A transitional presidential council was then created and tasked with holding presidential elections by February 2026. The assassination of Moise had left a political vacuum. In addition, the terms of 10 remaining senators expired in January 2023, stripping Haiti of its last democratically elected institution. The country had failed to hold legislative elections since October 2019, with Moise ruling by decree before he was killed. The newly formed provisional electoral council faces numerous obstacles, including persistent gang violence blamed for the killing of more than 3,200 people from January to May. Turf wars among gangs also have left more than half a million people homeless in recent years, with thousands of Haitians forced to flee their homes, abandoning essential documents including ID's needed to vote. Government officials have been visiting makeshift shelters to provide new IDs, but many Haitians remain without one. To help quell gang violence, nearly 400 Kenyan police arrived in Haiti earlier this year as part of a U.N.-backed mission that also expects to see the pledged deployment of soldiers and police from Jamaica, the Bahamas, Chad, Benin and Bangladesh.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-creates-provisional-electoral-council-to-prepare-for-first-vote-since-2016/7789665.html	2024-09-18T14:21:01-07:00	
Venezuela's Gonzalez says he was forced to sign letter accepting court ruling of Maduro victory	caracas, venezuela — Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez, who stood against President Nicolas Maduro in July's election, on Wednesday said he was forced to sign a letter accepting a ruling from the country's top court that recognized Maduro's victory. 'Either I signed or I faced the consequences,' he said in a statement. Gonzalez is currently in Spain, where he was granted political asylum earlier this month following the issue of a warrant for his arrest in Venezuela. The national electoral council proclaimed Maduro the victor of the July 28 presidential election, prompting allegations of fraud and widespread protest as the opposition published vote tallies online that they said showed Gonzalez had won. Earlier this week, a U.N. report said Maduro's government escalated repressive tactics to crush peaceful protests and keep power in the aftermath of the South American country's disputed election. The declaration by Venezuela's top electoral authority was approved by the country's Supreme Court, even though officials have not published vote tallies showing Maduro's victory. Gonzalez said he was met at the Spanish embassy in Caracas by Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez and her brother Jorge Rodriguez, president of the National Assembly, who gave him the letter to sign. 'There followed very tense hours of coercion, blackmail and pressure,' Gonzalez said, adding he felt he would be more useful in freedom than locked up. 'A document produced under duress is totally worthless, due to a serious lack of consent,' the statement added. In Caracas, Jorge Rodriguez presented a two-page letter signed by Gonzalez and said the former presidential candidate, 75, had 24 hours to retract his claims. 'If you don't deny that in 24 hours, I'm going to release the audios, it's up to you, Mr. Gonzalez,' Rodriguez said, referring to the meetings he and his sister held with Gonzalez.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-s-gonzalez-says-he-was-forced-to-sign-letter-accepting-court-ruling-of-maduro-victory-/7789652.html	2024-09-18T14:19:55-07:00	
Man who sold fentanyl-laced pill liable for $5.8 million in death of young female customer	LOS ANGELES — In 2019, Brandon McDowell was contacted by a sophomore in college who asked to buy Percocet, a prescription painkiller. What the 20-year-old sold her instead were counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid that can be lethal in a dose as small as 2 milligrams. Hours later, Alexandra Capelouto, also 20, was dead in her Temecula, California, home. It is an increasingly common scenario as fentanyl overdoses have become a leading cause of death for minors in the last five years, with more than 74,000 people dying in the U.S. from a synthetic opioid in 2023, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. McDowell has been behind bars since 2022 with a fentanyl possession conviction. But the Capeloutos have now won an additional $5.8 million judgment against him for the death of their daughter. 'We've won the battle but not the war,' said Matt Capelouto, Alexandra's father. 'We still have a long ways to go in terms of holding drug dealers accountable for deaths.' Baruch Cohen, the Capeloutos' lawyer, said this was the first time a drug dealer has been held liable civilly for someone's death, to his knowledge. 'Here's the hope that this judgment will be the shot that's heard around the world, so to speak,' Cohen said. 'Because if it inhibits another drug deal from going down, where the drug dealer ... realizes that, besides the jail sentence, he is liable for millions of dollars of damages, maybe he'll think twice.' McDowell, now 25, first pleaded guilty in California federal court in 2022 for possession with intent to distribute fentanyl, a charge that carries a 20-year minimum sentence if linked to death or serious injury and convicted by a jury. McDowell was sentenced to nine years in prison. Alexandra's father felt that wasn't enough. He and his wife, who was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer that year and has been battling it since, decided to sue McDowell for wrongful death. 'For taking somebody's life, that was not a fair sentence,' he said. 'I was going to pursue every means possible to make sure justice was served.' While McDowell filed for bankruptcy, the Capeloutos won a judgment of about $5 million against him. The Superior Court of Riverside County found he sold harmful narcotics with 'willful and malicious' intent that led to Alexandra Capelouto's death. A few months later, the Capeloutos filed another case in federal bankruptcy court to ensure that McDowell could not escape his debt under bankruptcy. 'Bankruptcy is designed for honest debtors, not crooked criminal debtors,' Cohen said. 'This judgment will haunt him the rest of his life, and when he does make money, we'll garnish it. When he does buy property, we'll put a lien on it.' Judge Mark Houle ruled in the Capeloutos' favor, ordering a $5.8 million judgment against Brandon McDowell that includes a year and half of interest in addition to the initial $5 million. Since his daughter's death, Matt Capelouto founded the non-profit Stop Drug Homicide to advocate for families and push for more legislation to hold drug dealers accountable. One is Alexandra's Law, which would require a formal warning be given to anyone with a drug-related conviction to inform them of the dangers of dealing drugs and that they could be charged with murder if they distribute drugs that lead to someone's death. In California, it can be difficult for prosecutors to charge drug dealers with someone's death because they must prove the dealer had knowledge that the drugs could cause death, Capelouto said. Having an admonishment on the record for dealers who have been convicted of a drug-related crime could be used as evidence in future cases if someone dies from the drugs they sold. Alexandra's Law is included in Proposition 36, a tough-on-crime ballot measure that Californians will vote on in November. Capelouto is also part of a group of 60 families suing Snapchat for its role in the distribution of deadly narcotics. Alexandra Capelouto and Brandon McDowell had communicated over Snapchat when she bought pills from him. Justin McDowell, Brandon's father, said it is unfair for his son to take all the blame. He said his son was struggling with drug abuse and had been in rehab, and he didn't live with him at the time because the McDowells had younger children. 'My son is no drug dealer at all. They were both users. They both had an addiction,' he said. 'He was a stupid 20-year-old kid.' Justin McDowell said he felt like the Capeloutos were seeking revenge through their lawsuits, and he did not have the money and resources to fight on his son's behalf in court. Brandon McDowell was being held at the federal prison in San Pedro during the lawsuit and did not have lawyers to defend himself in civil or bankruptcy court. 'I think that's sad, that shouldn't be allowed,' Justin McDowell said. 'We'll wait for him to get out of prison, give him a hug, and figure out how to deal with the situation ... the kid's never going to make $5.8 million in his life.' Matt Capelouto said there was no evidence of his daughter having a drug addiction, and Brandon McDowell's addiction does not absolve him of responsibility in her death. 'When you go from drug user to drug dealer, you cross a line from needing help to needing to be held accountable,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-who-sold-fentanyl-laced-pill-liable-for-5-8-million-in-death-of-young-female-customer/7789604.html	2024-09-18T13:07:09-07:00	
Teamsters union declines to endorse Trump or Harris	WASHINGTON — The International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined Wednesday to endorse Kamala Harris or Donald Trump for president, saying neither candidate had sufficient support from the 1.3 million-member union. 'Unfortunately, neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before big business,' Teamsters President Sean O'Brien said in a statement. 'We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries — and to honor our members' right to strike — but were unable to secure those pledges.' Harris met Monday with a panel of Teamsters, having long courted organized labor and made support for the middle class her central policy goal. Trump also met with a panel of Teamsters and even invited O'Brien to speak at the Republican National Convention, where the union leader railed against corporate greed. The Teamsters said Wednesday that internal polling of its members showed Trump with an advantage over Harris. The Teamsters' choice to not endorse came just weeks ahead of the November 5 election, far later than other large unions such as the AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers, which have chosen to back Harris.	https://www.voanews.com/a/teamsters-union-declines-to-endorse-trump-or-harris/7789592.html	2024-09-18T12:59:26-07:00

Iran nuclear chief says country has no 'covert objectives'	Vienna, Austria — Iran has no 'covert objectives' when it comes to its nuclear program and the country is ready to resume its nuclear commitments once Western sanctions are lifted, the head of the country's Atomic Energy Organization told AFP. 'Uranium enrichment is not necessarily for weapons purposes,' Mohammad Eslami said on Wednesday in an interview with AFP on the sidelines of the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) general conference in Vienna. 'We are doing it for research and the production of various isotopes for nuclear industry applications,' he said. Tensions between Iran and the IAEA have repeatedly flared since a 2015 deal curbing Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for sanction relief fell apart. In recent years, Tehran has decreased its cooperation with the IAEA, while significantly ramping up its nuclear program, including amassing large stockpiles of uranium enriched to 60%, which is close to the 90% needed to develop an atomic bomb. The rapid expansion of Iran's nuclear program has no 'credible civilian justification,' according to the U.N. nuclear watchdog. Amid the impasse, the IAEA's board of governors in June adopted a resolution critical of Iran. Despite the restrictions on inspections since 2021 and the barring of U.N. inspectors, the IAEA continues to 'daily monitor' Iran's nuclear program, at a level that exists 'nowhere else in the world,' Eslami stressed. 'Our work is completely transparent. It is not as if we were producing a material with covert objectives,' Eslami told AFP. He said Iran was in discussions with IAEA chief Rafael Grossi to organize his visit to the country in the near future, where he is expected to meet President Masoud Pezeshkian. Since Pezeshkian's election in July, Iran has said it was willing to relaunch talks to revive the Iran nuclear deal it reached with world powers in 2015. The landmark deal — also known by the acronym JCPOA — started to unravel in 2018 when then U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from it and reimposed sanctions, and Iran retaliated by stepping up its nuclear activities. Efforts to revive the deal — bringing the United States back on board and Iran back into compliance — have so far been fruitless. Eslami, however, told AFP that 'the JCPOA is not dead.' 'As soon as the others resume their obligations, we will act accordingly,' he said, stressing that 'it is not possible for them to expect us to keep our commitments' when they themselves have reinstated sanctions. But Western powers have deplored the 'absence' of positive concrete signs from Tehran. 'Patience has its limits, and we will not stand by while Iran continues to obfuscate,' the United States, Britain, France and Germany warned in a joint statement last week. Experts say resumption of talks seems unlikely before the U.S. presidential elections, amid a sharp deterioration in Iran's relations with Europe and the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-nuclear-chief-says-country-has-no-covert-objectives-/7789543.html	2024-09-18T12:29:04-07:00	
Pressure grows on Britain ahead of Commonwealth summit to pay slavery reparations	London — Britain is facing growing pressure to address the issue of reparations for the transatlantic slave trade and other atrocities, as the former colonial power and many of its former colonies prepare to gather for the biennial Commonwealth heads of government meeting next month. The Commonwealth emerged from the ashes of Britain’s empire after World War II. The vast majority of its 56 members are former British colonies. The organization is set to choose a new secretary-general at its heads of government meeting October 21-25 in Samoa, as the term of incumbent Patricia Scotland comes to an end. All three candidates vying for the job — all of whom are from Africa — voiced strong support for reparations at a recent event at London’s Chatham House. Ghanaian Foreign Minister Shirley Botchwey said reparations could take various forms. 'Financial reparations is good. However, the conversation is now moving to other reparations in kind. And so, either way it's fine, but I stand for reparations,' she said. 'Whether or not the Commonwealth has a role to play will depend on the heads of government who will give the secretary-general her marching orders: that we want you involved in the conversation of reparations, we want you to put forward a common voice on behalf of all Commonwealth countries,' Botchwey added. Joshua Setipa, a candidate from Lesotho, said the Commonwealth was the right forum to address the issue. 'I support the idea of reparative justice, and I would not wait to be asked to participate,' said Setipa, a former trade minister. 'More than half of the members around the table are calling for this to be addressed.' Mamadou Tangara, Gambia’s candidate for Commonwealth secretary-general who is currently serving as the country’s foreign minister, agreed. 'I am fully in support of reparatory justice. But this is a cause, a noble cause, that has to be championed by member states. And the Commonwealth can use its convenient power to facilitate the dialogue and make it happen,' he said. At the last Commonwealth summit, in Rwanda in 2022, Britain’s then-Prince Charles — who is now king and therefore head of the Commonwealth — spoke of his deep sorrow over the slave trade. 'I want to acknowledge that the roots of our contemporary association run deep into the most painful period of our history,' Charles told delegates in Kigali. 'I cannot describe the depths of my personal sorrow at the suffering of so many as I continue to deepen my own understanding of slavery's enduring impact.' Britain, however, has rejected any form of reparations. The issue can no longer be dismissed, said Kingsley Abbott, director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London. 'In my view, sitting here in 2024, the fact of transatlantic slavery, the harm it caused, the harm it continues to cause, and the need for this to be addressed in some way meaningfully, can't really be ignored any longer. And these expressions of support from the candidates I think mirror the fact that the global movement for reparations is growing,' Abbott said. 'Reparations doesn't just equal monetary compensation under international law. It can take many forms, like restitution and compensation and rehabilitation and satisfaction, things like meaningful apologies, public acknowledgement, memorialization and things like that,' Abbott told VOA. 'And so, therefore, of course the Commonwealth has a role to play. What the Commonwealth can benefit from is the tremendous amount of very important, thoughtful work that's been done by people, including from Commonwealth states, on this very issue.' Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak argued in 2023 that 'trying to unpick our history is not the right way forward.' His successor, Keir Starmer, is yet to make his position on reparations clear.

Climate week talks to include critical minerals and seabed mining debate	Washington — When activists, policymakers and representatives from across the globe gather next week in New York to participate in climate week, one pressing issue on the agenda that is less frequently discussed and known will be the environmental impact of seabed mining. As countries look for ways to lower emissions, critical minerals are playing a key role in that transition. Critical minerals are used in all kinds of green technologies, from solar panels and wind turbines to batteries in electric vehicles. And one place where those mineral resources are abundant is deep under the sea. The debate over accessing seabed resources is heated. Supporters say the technology exists to safely access these critical minerals undersea, but environmentalists and activists say the potential of undiscovered biodiversity on the seafloor is too important to endanger. During climate week, which will take place on the sidelines of U.N. General Assembly meetings, organizers are expected to host a roundtable on the environmental impact of seabed mining and other discussions about critical minerals. The World Economic Forum says that if the globe wants to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, two-thirds of vehicles must be powered by electric batteries. And the International Energy Agency says that to reach that goal, the world needs six times more mineral resources by 2040 than it has today. Some of the largest mineral deposits are found on the ocean floor in the form of polymetallic nodules, or rocks. Ocean of resources According to the International Seabed Authority, or ISA, there are 21 billion tons of polymetallic nodules strewn across the seabed of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, or CCZ. Each nodule contains a combination of electric vehicle battery components such as nickel, manganese, copper and cobalt. The ISA plans to release regulations for mining in the international waters of the CCZ by 2025. The ISA has already awarded 17 exploration contracts for polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone – a large swath of the Pacific Ocean the size of the continental United States which sits between Hawaii and Mexico. Three of those exploration contracts went to The Metals Company, a Canadian deep-sea mining company. The Pacific Island Nations of Nauru, Kiribati and Tonga have sponsored The Metals Company’s efforts to develop a portion of the seabed. In an interview with VOA, CEO Gerard Barron said the company is ready to begin as soon as the ISA allows mining. 'Our collector methodology is to put a robot on the seafloor which crawls around the ocean floor and fires a jet of water at the nodule and it creates an inverse pressure and lifts the nodule up, and so we don’t go down and scour the seafloor,' said Barron via Zoom, adding that TMC has spent the past decade focused on testing this equipment and collecting data on its environmental impact as part of its permit application to the ISA. Moratorium needed Critics worry scooping up these mineral-rich rocks will disrupt important biodiversity – much of it still unnamed and some of it undiscovered. Researchers have found that 90% of the more than 5,000 species in the zone are new to science. Eddie Palu, president of the Tonga Fishery Association, wants a pause for more research. 'We demand a moratorium on the seabed mining until the environmental, economic and social risk are comprehensively understood,' he said during a panel discussion at the recent Pacific Islands Forum in Tonga. Shiva Gounden from Greenpeace Australia Pacific, who also sat on the panel, agreed. 'We know only very little of the deep sea, and the race for the final frontier could cause irreversible damages to the people and to the communities of our Pacific,' Gounden said. But scientists say no light and very little oxygen reaches the deep sea – limiting the life there to mostly bacteria and small invertebrates. The Metals Company’s Barron said combating climate change is a bigger threat to the planet than undersea mining, adding that the company’s environmental impact studies show that 'we can safely collect these nodules' and turn them into battery metals without having 'a negative impact on the ocean.' 'The notion that we can do any extraction with zero impact is a dream,' added Barron. 'The oceans are impacted by every single thing we do today, especially global warming. So, we need to address the main driver for climate change and reduce emissions.' Fueling innovation Still, the quest to do just that – access minerals on the seabed with minimal impact to the environment – has created competition between technology companies. U.S. tech startup Impossible Metals is testing a robot which can avoid nodules where it detects life and harvests those where it does not. 'The vehicle hovers above the seabed, uses the camera and it actually picks up the nodules one by one. So this really minimizes all of the negative concerns around big sediment plumes,' CEO Oliver Gunasekra told VOA in an interview. Gunaskera’s company spun off Viridian Biometals. Its technology bypasses energy-intensive processes such as smelting with bacteria which can separate metal ore from the rock around it. The process creates no emissions or waste. 'The bacteria need oxygen just like we do to breathe. And when there's not enough oxygen in the water around them, the bacteria have learned that there's oxygen in the rocks, and they have adapted to breathe that oxygen,' said Viridian CEO Eric Macris. Impossible Metals and Viridian Biometals say they are two to three years out from commercializing their technology, depending on funding. TMC says it could be ready to begin its collection operations as soon as international regulations are released next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/climate-week-talks-to-include-critical-minerals-and-seabed-mining-debate/7789523.html	2024-09-18T12:21:23-07:00	
Mississippi town moves Confederate monument that became an eyesore	grenada, mississippi — A Mississippi town has taken down a Confederate monument that stood on the courthouse square since 1910 — a figure that was tightly wrapped in tarps the past four years, symbolizing the community's enduring division over how to commemorate the past. Grenada's first Black mayor in two decades seems determined to follow through on the city's plans to relocate the monument to other public land, a concrete slab behind a fire station about 5.6 kilometers from the square. But a new fight might be developing. A Republican lawmaker from another part of Mississippi wrote to Grenada officials saying she believes the city is violating a state law that restricts the relocation of war memorials or monuments. The Grenada City Council voted to move the monument in 2020, weeks after police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis. The vote seemed timely: Mississippi legislators had just retired the last state flag in the U.S. that prominently featured the Confederate battle emblem. The tarps went up soon after the vote, shrouding the Confederate soldier and the pedestal he stood on. But even as people complained about the eyesore, the move was delayed by tight budgets, state bureaucracy or political foot-dragging. A new mayor and city council took office in May, prepared to take action. On Sept. 11, with little advance notice, police blocked traffic and a work crew disassembled and removed the 6.1-meter stone structure. 'I'm glad to see it move to a different location,' said Robin Whitfield, an artist with a studio just off Grenada's historic square. 'This represents that something has changed.' Still, Whitfield, who is white, said she wishes Grenada leaders had invited the community to engage in a discussion about the symbol, to bridge the gap between those who think moving it is erasing history and those who see it as a daily reminder of white supremacy. She was among the few people watching as a crane lifted parts of the monument onto a flatbed truck. 'No one ever talked about it, other than yelling on Facebook,' Whitfield said. Mayor Charles Latham said the monument has been 'quite a divisive figure' in the town of 12,300, where about 57% of residents are Black and 40% are white. 'I understand people had family ... fight and die in that war, and they should be proud of their family,' Latham said. 'But you've got to understand that there were those who were oppressed by this, by the Confederate flag on there. There's been a lot of hate and violence perpetrated against people of color, under the color of that flag.' The city received permission from the Mississippi Department of Archives and History to move the Confederate monument, as required. But Representative Stacey Hobgood-Wilkes of Picayune said the fire station site is inappropriate. 'We are prepared to pursue such avenues that may be necessary to ensure that the statue is relocated to a more suitable and appropriate location,' she wrote, suggesting a Confederate cemetery closer to the courthouse square as an alternative. She said the Ladies Cemetery Association is willing to deed a parcel to the city to make it happen. The Confederate monument in Grenada is one of hundreds in the South, most of which were dedicated during the early 20th century when groups such as the United Daughters of the Confederacy sought to shape the historical narrative by valorizing the Lost Cause mythology of the Civil War. The monuments, many of them outside courthouses, came under fresh scrutiny after an avowed white supremacist who had posed with Confederate flags in photos posted online killed nine Black people inside the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mississippi-town-moves-confederate-monument-that-became-an-eyesore-/7789486.html	2024-09-18T11:51:39-07:00	
AI enhances maternal health care in Kenya, experts say	Nairobi, Kenya — University students are developing technology that incorporates artificial intelligence to help reduce the maternal mortality rate in Kenya. Maternal mortality remains a key issue affecting women of reproductive age in Kenya. The Ministry of Health says more than 6,000 women die each year due to poor access to maternal health facilities. The new technology allows health care workers to remotely monitor the conditions of pregnant women and their fetuses without physical visits to a hospital. David Saruni, a computer science student at Kabarak University in Kenya’s Rift Valley region, is involved in developing the application, known as Mama’s Hub. 'The project objective is to prevent the onset of pre-eclampsia, which may cause death to mothers and even infants after their delivery,' Saruni said. 'So, this project is going to save lives.' The World Health Organization defines maternal health as the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. Despite a global decline in maternal mortality ratio over the past two decades, the WHO says the African region still lags. Africa accounts for more than two-thirds of maternal deaths worldwide. With the Mama’s Hub application, the expectant mother wears a smartwatch that monitors vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and temperature. The monitor is connected to a mobile phone that relays the information to a database. Health care workers at Mama’s Hub can review that information and refer women to nearby doctors if they are concerned. Artificial intelligence enters the picture here, as patients will also be able to obtain prescriptions through a chatbot, which is now in the testing stages. Moses Thiga, principal investigator of the Mama’s Hub project, said, 'If the onset of the condition is detected before 20 weeks, then there are interventions that can be instituted. The same case with others like gestation or diabetes. 'All this boils down to timely and accurate information about the mother.' The National Research Fund-supported technology also enables digitization of the prenatal care records of patients for easier access. It has been tested in prenatal clinics in the Rift Valley city of Nakuru, with the aim of rolling out to the rest of the country. Nakuru County chief nursing officer Wendy Tirop said the digitization has improved record tracing. 'It makes it very [easy] for the health care provider to be able to trace and identify mothers who have failed to come to the clinic and do a follow-up,' Tirop said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-enhances-maternal-health-care-in-kenya-experts-say/7789467.html	2024-09-18T11:51:29-07:00

US Federal Reserve cuts key rate by sizable half-point, signaling end to its inflation fight	Washington — The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large half-point, a dramatic shift after more than two years of high rates helped tame inflation but that also made borrowing painfully expensive for American consumers. The rate cut, the Fed's first in more than four years, reflects its new focus on bolstering the job market, which has shown clear signs of slowing. Coming just weeks before the presidential election, the Fed's move also has the potential to scramble the economic landscape just as Americans prepare to vote. The central bank's action lowered its key rate to roughly 4.8%, down from a two-decade high of 5.3%, where it had stood for 14 months as it struggled to curb the worst inflation streak in four decades. Inflation has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% in mid-2022 to a three-year low of 2.5% in August, not far above the Fed's 2% target. The Fed's policymakers also signaled that they expect to cut their key rate by an additional half-point in their final two meetings this year, in November and December. And they envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. In a statement, the Fed came closer than it has before to declaring victory over inflation: It said it 'has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.' Though the central bank now believes inflation is largely defeated, many Americans remain upset with still-high prices for groceries, gas, rent and other necessities. Former President Donald Trump blames the Biden-Harris administration for sparking an inflationary surge. Vice President Kamala Harris, in turn, has charged that Trump's promise to slap tariffs on all imports would raise prices for consumers even further. Rate cuts by the Fed should, over time, lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards, boosting Americans' finances and supporting more spending and growth. Homeowners will be able to refinance mortgages at lower rates, saving on monthly payments, and even shift credit card debt to lower-cost personal loans or home equity lines. Businesses may also borrow and invest more. Average mortgage rates have already dropped to an 18-month low of 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac, spurring a jump in demand for refinancings. The Fed's next policy meeting is Nov. 6-7 — immediately after the presidential election. By cutting rates this week, soon before the election, the Fed is risking attacks from Trump, who has argued that lowering rates now amounts to political interference. Yet Politico has reported that even some key Senate Republicans who were interviewed have expressed support for a Fed rate cut this week. The central bank's officials fought against high inflation by raising their key rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Wage growth has since slowed, removing a potential source of inflationary pressure. And oil and gas prices are falling, a sign that inflation should continue to cool in the months ahead. Consumers are also pushing back against high prices, forcing such companies as Target and McDonald's to dangle deals and discounts. Yet after several years of strong job growth, employers have slowed hiring, and the unemployment rate has risen nearly a full percentage point from its half-century low in April 2023 to a still-low 4.2%. Once unemployment rises that much, it tends to keep climbing. Fed officials and many economists note, though, that the rise in unemployment this time largely reflects an influx of people seeking jobs — notably new immigrants and recent college graduates — rather than layoffs. At issue in the Fed's deliberations is how fast it wants to lower its benchmark rate to a point where it's no longer acting as a brake on the economy — nor as an accelerant. Where that so-called 'neutral' level falls isn't clear, though many analysts peg it at 3% to 3.5%.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-federal-reserve-cuts-key-rate-by-sizable-half-point-signaling-end-to-its-inflation-fight/7789466.html	2024-09-18T11:40:56-07:00	
Sean 'Diddy' Combs makes fresh bid for bail in sex trafficking, conspiracy case	New York — Lawyers for Sean 'Diddy' Combs asked a judge Wednesday to let him await his sex trafficking trial at his luxury home on an island near Miami Beach, rather than a grim federal jail in Brooklyn. Combs' lawyers offered a $50 million bail package — using his mansion as collateral — in exchange for releasing him to home detention with GPS monitoring. A hearing on the request was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. On Tuesday, a U.S. magistrate judge in Manhattan ordered Combs held without bail. The hip-hop mogul whose career blossomed in the 1990s was arrested on Monday on charges contained in an indictment that accuses Combs of using his 'power and prestige' for 'sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for purposes of prostitution, drug offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.' It describes the inducement of female victims and male sex workers into drugged-up, elaborately produced sexual performances dubbed 'Freak Offs' that Combs arranged, directed, masturbated during and often recorded. The events would sometimes last days and require IVs to recover from, the indictment said. It alleges he coerced and abused women for years while using blackmail, including the videos he shot, and shocking acts of violence to keep his victims in line, coordinated and facilitated from the top down by a network of associates and employees. Combs' attorney Marc Agnifilo submitted a letter to Judge Andrew L. Carter on Wednesday seeking the release of Combs, 54, on conditions including home detention with GPS monitoring, along with a restriction on all visitors to his residences except for family, property caretakers and friends who are not considered co-conspirators. Combs' house is on Star Island, a man-made dollop of land in Biscayne Bay, reachable only by a causeway or boat. It is among the most expensive places to live in the United States. Combs' request echoes that of a long line of wealthy defendants who have offered to pay multimillion-dollar bails in exchange for home detention in luxurious surroundings. 'Sean Combs has never evaded, avoided, eluded or run from a challenge in his life,' the defense said in a court filing. 'He will not start now.' Combs was expected to reenter his not guilty plea in his initial appearance before Carter. So far, prosecutors have successfully argued that he is a danger to the community and a flight risk and should remain incarcerated until trial. For all the revelations that came with the unsealing of the indictment Tuesday, most of what it outlines had been described in a November lawsuit filed by his former longtime girlfriend and protege, the R&B singer Cassie, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura. The suit was settled the following day, but its allegations have followed Combs since. Its descriptions of beatings, sexual assaults, silencing tactics and 'Freak Offs' were echoed throughout the criminal indictment, though it did not use her name or the names of any other women. Agnifilo, also without naming Ventura but clearly referring to her, argued at Tuesday's arraignment that the entire criminal case is an outgrowth of one long-term, troubled-but-consensual relationship that faltered amid infidelity. The 'Freak Offs,' Agnifilo contended, were an expansion of that relationship, and not coercive. 'Is it sex trafficking?' Agnifilo asked. 'Not if everybody wants to be there.' Prosecutors, however, portrayed the scope as far larger. They said in court papers that they had interviewed more than 50 victims and witnesses and expect the number to grow. Like many aging hip-hop figures — including many of those he beefed with in the bicoastal rap feuds of the 1990s alongside the Notorious B.I.G. — the Bad Boy Records founder Combs had established a gentler, more worldly public image. The doting father of seven children was a respected international businessman, whose annual 'White Party' in the Hamptons was once a must-have invitation for the jet-setting elite. But prosecutors said he used the same companies, people and methods he used to build his business and cultural power to facilitate his crimes. They said they would prove it with financial, travel and billing records, electronic data and communications and videos of the 'Freak Offs' to prove their case. The AP does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Ventura did. Combs was arrested late Monday in a Manhattan hotel, roughly six months after federal authorities raided his luxurious homes in Los Angeles and Miami and revealed they were conducting a sex trafficking investigation. During the searches, law enforcement seized narcotics, videos of the 'Freak Offs' and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant, according to prosecutors. They said agents also seized firearms and ammunition, including three AR-15s with defaced serial numbers. The indictment portrays Combs as so violent that he caused injuries that often took days or weeks to heal. His employees and associates sometimes witnessed his violence and kept victims from leaving or tracked down those who tried, the indictment said. A conviction on every charge in the indictment would require a mandatory 15 years in prison with the possibility of a life sentence. Combs and his attorneys denied similar allegations made by others in a string of lawsuits filed after Ventura's.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sean-diddy-combs-makes-fresh-bid-for-bail-in-his-sex-trafficking-conspiracy-case/7789355.html	2024-09-18T10:33:50-07:00

False reports of explosives found in car near Trump rally spread online	New York — Law enforcement officials on Long Island worked quickly on Wednesday to publicly knock down social media posts falsely reporting that explosives had been found in a car near former President Donald Trump's planned rally in New York. The false reports of an explosive began circulating hours before the Republican presidential nominee's campaign event at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, just days after he was apparently the target of a second possible assassination attempt. Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder said police questioned and detained a person who 'may have been training a bomb detection dog,' near the site of the rally and 'falsely reported explosives being found.' Lt. Scott Skrynecki, a spokesperson for the county police, said in follow-up messages that the person, who police have not yet identified, was a civilian and not a member of a law enforcement agency. He also said the person was not working at or affiliated with the event, which is expected to draw thousands of Trump supporters to the arena that was formerly the home of the NHL's New York Islanders. The rally is Trump's first on Long Island, a suburban area just east of New York City, since 2017. In 2020, President Joe Biden defeated Trump by a roughly 4% margin on Long Island, besting him in Nassau County by about 60,000 votes, though Trump carried neighboring Suffolk County by more than 200 votes. Earlier Wednesday, Skrynecki and other county officials responded swiftly to knock down the online line claims, which appear to have started with a post from a reporter citing unnamed sources in the local police department. The claims were then shared widely on X, formerly Twitter, by a number of prominent accounts, including that of the company's owner, Elon Musk, which has nearly 200 million followers. Spokespersons for X didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. 'False,' Skrynecki texted the AP as the claims spread. 'No. Ridiculous. Zero validity,' said Christopher Boyle, spokesperson for Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman.	https://www.voanews.com/a/false-reports-of-explosives-found-in-a-car-near-trump-rally-spread-online/7789325.html	2024-09-18T10:14:35-07:00

Taiwan's coastal defenses questioned after Chinese man's illegal entry attempt	Taipei, Taiwan — A recent attempt by a Chinese man to illegally enter Taiwan after crossing the 180-kilometer-wide Taiwan Strait in a rubber boat is raising concerns on the island about its coastal defense capabilities and overall preparedness amid rising tensions between Beijing and Taipei. Last Saturday, a 30-year-old Chinese man surnamed Wang was spotted in a dinghy about 100 meters offshore near Taiwan’s northern Linkou District in New Taipei City at about 6:30 in the morning. After being treated for severe dehydration at a nearby hospital, Wang was detained by local authorities for illegally entering Taiwan. Wang told authorities that he was in debt in China and wanted to start a new life in Taiwan. Wang is one of 18 Chinese nationals who have tried to illegally enter Taiwan since July of last year. When reached for comment on the cases, Taiwan’s Coast Guard Administration declined to share how many of them were able to reach Taiwan’s shores, like Wang. In June, a former Chinese naval captain was able to reach the Tamsui ferry pier in Northern Taiwan on a speedboat, shocking many because of how far he was able to get before being detected. At the time, a Chinese man surnamed Ruan said he was fleeing to Taiwan seeking freedom after being threatened by Chinese police for sharing articles critical of the Chinese government. On Wednesday, however, a court in Taipei sentenced Ruan to eight months in prison for illegally entering Taiwan. He confessed to the crime but claimed his deep knowledge of the Chinese military could help Taiwan cope with threats posed by Beijing. Some experts say the two Chinese men’s attempts to illegally enter Taiwan expose loopholes in Taiwan’s coastal defense capabilities. 'Even though Taiwan’s defense ministry has highlighted the strategic importance of defending coastal areas in northern Taiwan, Taiwan’s coast guard, which is in charge of coastal defense, has not prioritized setting up advanced surveillance technologies, such as infrared thermal cameras, in these areas, which lead to their failure of detecting the two Chinese men before they reach Taiwanese shores,' said Chieh Chung, a military researcher at the National Policy Foundation in Taiwan. Some lawmakers from Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang, who favor friendly relations with China, say the two incidents show the Taiwanese government has failed to provide the coast guard with adequate funding and the right equipment to monitor attempted illegal entry. In response to opposition lawmakers’ criticism of underfunding the coast guard, Taiwan’s Premier Cho Jung-tai vowed to accelerate the review of the recent incidents and determine whether the coast guard needs more advanced technologies or personnel to support their work. Apart from accelerating the installation of advanced surveillance technologies along coastal areas in northern Taiwan, Chieh said Taiwan’s coast guard should consider strengthening coastal patrols by purchasing commercial drones and increasing coordination with Taiwanese fishermen. 'Taiwan’s coast guard can use commercial drones to help conduct patrols along coastal areas during the day and Taiwanese fishermen could immediately inform the coast guard if they spot any unusual vessels in waters near Taiwanese shores,' he told VOA in a phone interview. Growing gray zone challenges Intrusions into Taiwanese waters by Chinese coast guard vessels also are posing a problem for Taiwan’s Coast Guard Administration and raising questions about preparedness. This is particularly true in waters off Taiwan’s outlying Kinmen and Matsu islands, which are just a few kilometers from China’s coast. Late last week, Taiwan said four Chinese coast guard vessels entered restricted waters near Kinmen, prompting Taipei to deploy four coast guard vessels to drive away the Chinese vessels. The incident was the 39th incursion carried out by Chinese coast guard vessels this year, officials said. While Beijing describes the incursions, which include boarding Taiwanese vessels, as being part of 'law enforcement patrols,' analysts in Taiwan say they challenge Taipei’s territorial claims around its outlying islands and are unilaterally seeking to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. Chieh said since the Taiwanese government has focused on enhancing wartime coordination between the coast guard and the navy over the last few years, it has overlooked the need to strengthen the Taiwanese coast guard’s maritime law enforcement capabilities and upgrade its vessels and training. 'Some of the coast guard vessels that Taiwan purchased in previous years are not suitable to engage in close-range encounters with Chinese coast guard vessels because the structure of those vessels is not solid enough,' he told VOA. Some analysts suggest Taiwan should carry out a series of reforms to rapidly enhance the coast guard’s capabilities. 'The Taiwanese government should enhance the coast guard’s budget, increase their manpower, and strengthen their law enforcement capabilities by arranging exchanges with other countries’ coast guard,' Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research, told VOA by phone. Military analysts say China likely will maintain high-level pressure on Taiwan through repeated coast guard incursions in the coming months, and Taipei should ensure its coast guard has enough support to cope with the wide range of challenges that Beijing poses. 'Instead of letting the coast guard oversee both Taiwan’s maritime defense and coastal defense, the Taiwanese government should consider assigning some of the responsibilities to the army or the navy,' Lin Ying-yu, a military expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-coastal-defenses-questioned-after-chinese-man-illegal-entry-attempt/7789300.html	2024-09-18T09:56:30-07:00	
Boeing to start temporary furloughs amid Seattle strike	New York — Boeing said Wednesday it would start temporary furloughs of professional and white-collar staff as it seeks to conserve cash amid a labor strike that has shuttered Seattle manufacturing plants. The furloughs, which pertain to executives, managers and workers, will be initiated in the coming days and affect tens of thousands of Boeing employees, company officials said. Boeing plans for 'selected employees to take one week of furlough every four weeks on a rolling basis for the duration of the strike,' said a message to employees from CEO Kelly Ortberg. The new Boeing boss added that he and the rest of the leadership team 'will take a commensurate pay reduction for the duration of the strike.' Boeing had said that furloughs were on the table earlier in the week when it announced a hiring freeze, travel budget austerity measures and a reduction of supplier expenditures. About 33,000 Seattle-area Boeing workers with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 walked off the job Friday after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract renewal. The two sides resumed talks Tuesday with the assistance of mediators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The IAM blasted Boeing in a bargaining update posted late Tuesday. 'We are frustrated,' the IAM said. 'The company was not prepared and was unwilling to address the issues you've made clear are essential for ending this strike: Wages and Pension. The company doesn't seem to be taking mediation seriously.' Ortberg's message to employees reiterated his commitment to 'resetting our relationship with our represented employees and continuing discussions with the union to reach a new agreement that is good for all of our teammates and our company as soon as possible.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-to-start-temporary-furloughs-amid-seattle-strike/7789296.html	2024-09-18T09:54:06-07:00	
Two years after Mahsa Amini death, Western allies sanction a dozen Iranian officials	Washington — The U.S., Canada and Australia hit a group of Iranian officials with sanctions Wednesday for their participation in suppressing protests and detaining people in relation to the death of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian woman who died in the custody of Iran's morality police two years ago for improperly wearing a mandatory headscarf. Amini, 22, died on Sept. 16, 2022, in a hospital after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her mandatory headscarf, or hijab, to the liking of the authorities. Her death sparked nationwide protests against the country's hijab laws and its ruling theocracy. Included in Wednesday's sanctions are a dozen officials accused of killing and detaining protesters, suppressing protests in 2019 and 2022 and arresting journalists. The country's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian campaigned on a promise to halt the harassment of women by morality police. Still, since Amini's death, videos have emerged of women and girls being roughed up by officers. In 2023, a teenage Iranian girl was injured in a mysterious incident on Tehran's Metro while not wearing a headscarf and later died in the hospital. In July, activists say police opened fire on a woman fleeing a checkpoint in an attempt to avoid her car being impounded for her not wearing the hijab. U.S. Treasury official Bradley T. Smith said, 'Despite the Iranian people's peaceful calls for reform, Iran's leaders have doubled down on the regime's well-worn tactics of violence and coercion.' The U.S. and its allies 'will continue to take action to expose and hold accountable those responsible for carrying out the Iranian regime's cruel agenda,' Smith said. The sanctions, which block access to U.S. property and bank accounts and prevent the targeted people and companies from doing business with the U.S. are largely symbolic since many of the individuals do not interact with the U.S. In March, a United Nations fact-finding mission determined that Iran is responsible for the 'physical violence' that led to the death of Amini. It also found that the Islamic Republic employed 'unnecessary and disproportionate use of lethal force' to put down the demonstrations that erupted following Amini's death and that Iranian security forces sexually assaulted detainees. Increasingly, on the streets of Iranian cities, it's becoming more common to see a woman passing by without a mandatory headscarf.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-years-after-mahsa-amini-death-western-allies-sanction-a-dozen-iranian-officials-/7789207.html	2024-09-18T09:06:49-07:00	
Youth group exposes Turkey's Israel trade	A group of young activists in Turkey known as 1000 Youth for Palestine is posing a rare and potent challenge to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by using social media to expose Turkey's ongoing trade with Israel. This, despite Erdogan's public claims that he has imposed a strict trade embargo on Israel over the war in Gaza. As Dorian Jones reports from Istanbul, the group's message is crossing the deep political, social and religious divides of Turkey.	https://www.voanews.com/a/youth-group-exposes-turkey-s-israel-trade/7789200.html	2024-09-18T09:03:46-07:00	
US targets second major Chinese hacking group	Washington — The United States has identified and taken down a botnet campaign by China-directed hackers to further infiltrate American infrastructure as well as a variety of internet-connected devices. FBI Director Christopher Wray announced the disruption of what he called Flax Typhoon during a cyber summit Wednesday in Washington, describing it as part of a much larger campaign by Beijing. 'Flax Typhoon hijacked Internet-of-Things devices like cameras, video recorders and storage devices — things typically found across both big and small organizations,' Wray said. 'And about half of those hijacked devices were located here in the U.S.' Wray said the hackers, working under the guise of an information security company called the Integrity Technology Group, collected information from corporations, media organizations, universities and government agencies. 'They used internet-connected devices — this time, hundreds of thousands of them — to create a botnet that helped them compromise systems and exfiltrate confidential data,' he said. But Flax Typhoon’s operations were disrupted last week when the FBI, working with allies and under court orders, took control of the botnet and pursued the hackers when they tried to switch to a backup system. 'We think the bad guys finally realized that it was the FBI and our partners that they were up against,' Wray said. 'And with that realization, they essentially burned down their new infrastructure and abandoned their botnet.' Wray said Flax Typhoon appeared to build on the exploits and tactics of another China-linked hacking group, known as Volt Typhoon, which was identified by Microsoft in May of last year. Volt Typhoon used office network equipment, including routers, firewalls and VPN hardware, to infiltrate and disrupt communications infrastructure in Guam, home to key U.S. military facilities. VOA has reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment. The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have previously warned that Chinese-government directed hackers, like Volt Typhoon, have been positioning themselves to launch destructive cyberattacks that could jeopardize the physical safety of Americans. Following Wednesday’s announcement by the FBI, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) issued an advisory encouraging anyone with a device that was compromised by Flax Typhoon to apply needed patches. It said that as of this past June, the Flax Typhoon botnet was making use of more than 260,000 devices in North America, Europe, Africa and Southeast East. The NSA said almost half of the compromised devices were in the U.S. Another 18 countries, including Vietnam, Bangladesh, Albania, China, South Africa and India, were also impacted.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-targets-second-major-chinese-hacking-group-/7789181.html	2024-09-18T08:41:05-07:00	
Frenchwoman in mass rape case calls husband, other suspects 'degenerates'	AVIGNON, France — Gisele Pelicot, who was drugged and raped by dozens of men recruited by her husband, said on Wednesday 'forgiveness does not exist,' rejecting claims by him and one of his chief accomplices that they regretted harming the women they loved. The trial in the southern French town of Avignon of Dominique Pelicot and 50 other men accused of raping his wife has shocked the world. The case has also triggered protests across France in support of Gisele Pelicot, who has become a symbol of the fight against sexual violence. 'These men are degenerates. They committed rape,' Gisele Pelicot, 72, told the court after her now ex-husband Dominique and the accomplice, Jean-Pierre Marechal, gave testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. 'When they see a woman sleeping on her bed, no one thought to ask themselves a question? They don't have brains?' Dominique Pelicot, 71, is also accused of having raped Marechal's wife at her home after drugging her, with the collaboration of her husband. Gisele Pelicot insisted on a public trial to expose her former husband and the 50 men he is accused of inviting to rape her in a small village in southern France. 'Today forgiveness does not exist,' Gisele Pelicot told the court as she described how her former husband had taken mistresses without hiding the fact from her, and she defended herself from some of the criticisms leveled against her. 'I have felt humiliated while I've been in this courtroom. I have been called an alcoholic, a conspirator of Mr. Pelicot,' she said, adding her life had been 'destroyed' for 10 years. 'In the state I was in, I absolutely could not respond. I was in a comatose state; the videos show that.' The Pelicots' daughter Caroline, whose photographs were found on her father's devices along with images of her mother being raped, was on the verge of tears in the courtroom as her mother spoke. Dominique Pelicot has denied drugging or sexually abusing Caroline. She has told French media that she started publicly campaigning to fight drug-induced sexual assault to cope with the shock following her father's arrest. In court, Dominique Pelicot admitted orchestrating the mass rape of his then-wife. He asked for forgiveness and said he ultimately hoped to win back his former partner, who filed for divorce after learning of the rapes from investigators. Because of a skirmish between some supporters of Gisele Pelicot and some of the accused on Tuesday evening, the court told attendees not to boo the suspects in the case, telling them they were innocent until proven guilty. But the court also said it was not a problem if supporters applauded Gisele Pelicot when she emerged from the courtroom, as some have been doing. Earlier on Wednesday, Marechal, 63, admitted to working with Dominique Pelicot to drug and both rape Marechal's wife, Cilia, after the men met on a now-shuttered website. Marechal blamed his mentor and a troubled childhood for his actions. Marechal is not among those accused of raping Gisele Pelicot. 'I regret my actions. I love my wife,' Marechal said in the courtroom. 'If I had not met Mr. Pelicot, I would have never committed this act.' Marechal met Dominique Pelicot on a website called Coco, where Pelicot shared with him images of the rapes of his wife by the men he had recruited, describing how he had drugged her. Marechal said in the courtroom he stumbled across the website by accident and initially refused Pelicot's request to rape his own wife before acquiescing. Prosecutors say Pelicot drugged Marechal's wife and raped her while Marechal watched. Gisele Pelicot said Marechal's explanation of his childhood was insufficient to explain his actions. 'I've had trauma but I have not committed crimes,' she said. Dominique Pelicot acknowledged his guilt in raping Marechal's wife and said he regretted his actions, adding that he cut contact with them after she woke up while he was in her room. Prosecutors say Dominique Pelicot was recorded in at least three of 12 assaults against Marechal's wife Cilia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/frenchwoman-in-mass-rape-case-calls-husband-other-suspects-degenerates-/7789132.html	2024-09-18T08:13:23-07:00

US Justice Department sues over Baltimore bridge collapse and seeks $100 million in cleanup costs	BALTIMORE — The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday sued the owner and manager of the cargo ship that caused the Baltimore bridge collapse, seeking to recover more than $100 million that the government spent to clear the underwater debris and reopen the city's port. The lawsuit filed in Maryland alleges that the electrical and mechanical systems on the ship, the Dali, were improperly maintained, causing it to lose power and veer off course before striking a support column on the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March. 'This tragedy was entirely avoidable,' according to the lawsuit. The collapse snarled commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore for months before the channel was fully opened in June. 'With this civil claim, the Justice Department is working to ensure that the costs of clearing the channel and reopening the Port of Baltimore are borne by the companies that caused the crash, not by the American taxpayer,' Attorney General Merrick Garland said in written statement. The case was filed against Dali owner Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and manager Synergy Marine Group, both of Singapore. The companies filed a court petition days after the collapse seeking to limit their legal liability in what could become the most expensive marine casualty case in history. The ship was leaving Baltimore bound for Sri Lanka when its steering failed because of the power loss. Six members of a road work crew on the bridge were killed in the collapse. The men were working an overnight shift filling potholes on the bridge deck when it suddenly crumbled beneath them, sending them tumbling into the water. 'This accident happened because of the careless and grossly negligent decisions made by Grace Ocean and Synergy, who recklessly chose to send an unseaworthy vessel to navigate a critical waterway and ignored the risks to American lives and the nation's infrastructure,' said Chetan Patil, the acting deputy assistant attorney general. On Tuesday, the victims' families declared their intent to file a claim seeking to hold the ship's owner and manager fully liable for the disaster. Several other interested parties, including city officials and local businesses, have filed opposing claims accusing the companies of negligence. The families are also calling for more robust workplace protections, especially for immigrant workers. All the victims were Latino immigrants who came to the United States in search of better-paying jobs and opportunities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-justice-department-sues-over-baltimore-bridge-collapse-and-seeks-100-million-in-cleanup-costs-/7789092.html	2024-09-18T07:58:10-07:00

US now allows passport renewals online	WASHINGTON — Americans can now renew their passports online, bypassing a cumbersome mail-in paper application process that often caused delays. The U.S. State Department announced Wednesday that its online passport renewal system is now fully operational. 'By offering this online alternative to the traditional paper application process, the Department is embracing digital transformation to offer the most efficient and convenient passport renewal experience possible,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. After staffing shortages caused mainly by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lengthy passport processing delays, the department ramped up hiring and introduced other technological improvements that have reduced wait times by about one-third over last year. It says most applications are now completed in far less than the advertised six to eight weeks. The online renewal system is expected to further reduce that. The system will allow renewal applicants to skip the current process, which requires them to print out and send paper applications and a check by mail and submit their documents and payment through a secure website, www.Travel.State.Gov/renewonline.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-now-allows-passport-renewals-online/7788978.html	2024-09-18T06:34:23-07:00

Nigeria flags flood risk in 11 states as Cameroon releases dam water	LAGOS — Nigeria's hydrological services agency has warned of potential flooding in 11 states after neighboring Cameroon said it was starting to release water from one of its largest dams following recent heavy rainfall in West and Central Africa. The warning comes as Nigeria is already grappling with severe floods in northeastern Borno state where a dam burst its walls after heavy rains that have also caused floods in Cameroon, Chad, Mali and Niger — all part of Africa's Sahel region that usually receives little rain. The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) said it had been notified by authorities in Cameroon on Tuesday that they had started controlled water releases from Lagdo dam. Cameroon has several dams on the Benue River, which flows downstream to Nigeria. A spokesperson for Cameroon's utility ENEO, which manages the dam, told Reuters there was a possibility that the dam could be flooded, but the reservoirs had not been opened on Wednesday morning. The NIHSA said Lagdo dam managers would gradually release water in a way not to exceed the capacity of the Benue river downstream to prevent flooding. But 11 states, including Benue, Nasarawa and Kogi in the food producing central belt region and southern oil producing states of Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers were at risk, said NIHSA. It urged federal and state authorities in Nigeria 'to step up vigilance and deploy adequate preparedness measures to reduce possible impacts of flooding that may occur as a result of increase in flow levels of our major rivers at this period.' In 2022, Nigeria lost more than 600 people and farmlands to the worst flooding in a decade following heavy rain and after Cameroon released water from Lagdo dam. Experts said then that Nigeria's failure to complete a dam of its own that was supposed to backstop the Cameroonian one worsened the disaster. Nigeria, the most populous nation in Africa, is prone to flooding but critics say defective infrastructure and poor planning worsen the situation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-flags-flood-risk-in-11-states-as-cameroon-releases-dam-water-/7788860.html	2024-09-18T04:40:29-07:00	
France's new PM warns of 'very serious' financial situation	Paris — France's budgetary situation is 'very serious,' Prime Minister Michel Barnier told AFP on Wednesday, saying more information was needed to gauge the 'precise reality' of French public finances. France was placed on a formal procedure for violating European Union budgetary rules before Barnier was picked as head of government this month by President Emmanuel Macron. And the Bank of France warned this week that a projected return to EU deficit rules by 2027 was 'not realistic.' France's public-sector deficit is projected to reach around 5.6 percent of GDP this year and go over six percent in 2025, which compares with EU rules calling for a three-percent ceiling on deficits. 'I am discovering that the country's budgetary situation is very serious,' Barnier said in a statement to AFP. 'This situation requires more than just pretty statements. It requires responsible action,' he said. The new prime minister, who has yet to appoint a cabinet, is scheduled to submit a 2025 budget to parliament next month, in what is expected to be the first major test for the incoming administration. 'Out of the question' Within days of taking office in early September, Barnier said in an interview that 'French people want more justice' in terms of fiscal policy, while several politicians have reported the prime minister mentioning possible tax increases in private conversations. Such a move would be a red rag to allies of Macron, who oversaw cuts in the corporate tax rate from 33.3% to 25% as well as tax reductions for households, including the wealthiest taxpayers. Macron has claimed a reduction in the overall tax burden by 50 billion euros ($56 billion) since he became president in 2017. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, a staunch Macron ally, said Wednesday that it was 'out of the question' to join, or even back, a government that raised taxes. But years of extra spending during the Covid pandemic combined with sluggish growth have caused the French deficit to balloon, sparking the 'excessive deficit procedure' by the EU, which is designed to force a country to negotiate a plan with Brussels to get their deficit or debt levels back on track. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who is to be replaced soon, promised to bring the deficit back below three percent by 2027 but many analysts have dismissed the plan as implausible. France's central bank governor, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, said this week that the objective was 'not realistic' unless the government was willing to risk 'stopping growth in its tracks.' Apparently backing Barnier's approach, Villeroy de Galhau called for an 'exceptional and reasonable effort asked of some major companies and wealthy taxpayers' to help a recovery in finances. France, he said, could no longer afford 'unfunded' tax cuts. But tighter fiscal policies could put Barnier on a collision course with Macron, who appointed the experienced politician — best known internationally as the EU's former chief Brexit negotiator — in the hope that he can survive an early no-confidence vote in parliament. 'Dreadful error to go back' 'We want a stable fiscal policy that does not undermine policies that caused unemployment to fall and our country's attractiveness to rise,' said Jean-Rene Cazeneuve, a National Assembly deputy and Macron ally. 'It would be a dreadful error to go back on this.' Laurent Wauquiez, head of the conservative Les Republican (LR) parliamentary group on whom Barnier will depend for support, said last week that 'our conviction is that in a certain number of areas we need rightist policies'. This, he said, meant 'no tax rises.' The tax question is likely to deepen budding tensions between Macron and Barnier, who is said to have been irritated that the president did not consult him about nominating Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne to the EU Commission. 'Knowing where Michel Barnier stands on Europe and the loss of French influence, I think he's just suffered his first humiliation,' said one LR deputy on condition of anonymity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-new-pm-warns-of-very-serious-financial-situation/7788844.html	2024-09-18T04:23:06-07:00	
Deadly Portugal wildfires force new evacuations	Lisbon — Deadly wildfires raging in Portugal have forced more people to evacuate their homes as crews battled dozens of blazes on Wednesday in the nation's north. Stifling heat and strong winds have fanned a spate of forest fires across the north and centre of the country that have killed seven people dead since the weekend. Civil protection authorities listed 42 active fires on its website on Wednesday and said they had mobilized around 3,900 firefighters and over 1,000 vehicles. In the Gondomar municipality, just outside Porto, authorities carried out more evacuations on Tuesday night. Firefighters battling blazes in Arouca in the hard-hit Aveiro region told local media outlets the situation there was 'uncontrollable.' Around 20,000 hectares (49,400 acres) of vegetation have burned in the region, south of Porto, since Monday, according to data from the European Forest Fire Information System (Effis). A total of 15 separate fires have passed the 1,000-hectare threshold since the fires began over the weekend, Effis data also showed. Authorities in Aveiro said Tuesday evening that firefighters were on the verge of bringing one group of fires that had spread across a 100-kilometre (60-mile) perimeter under control. Three firefighters died on Tuesday when their vehicle was trapped by the flames, civil protection authorities said, bringing the fire-related toll up to seven, with some 50 injured. A 28-year-old Brazilian who worked for a forestry company died after he become trapped by the flames as he tried to collect some times. Two others suffered heart attacks and a volunteer firefighter died while taking a break from battling the flames. Lisbon has upped fire prevention funding ten-fold and doubled the budget to fight wildfires since deadly blazes in 2017 claimed hundreds of lives. The Iberian peninsula is particularly vulnerable to global warming, with heatwaves and drought exposing the region to blazes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-portugal-wildfires-force-new-evacuations/7788826.html	2024-09-18T04:05:45-07:00	
End of an era': UK to shut last coal-fired power plant	Ratcliffe on Soar, United Kingdom — Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station has dominated the landscape of the English East Midlands for nearly 60 years, looming over the small town of the same name and a landmark on the M1 motorway bisecting Derby and Nottingham. At the mainline railway station serving the nearby East Midlands Airport, its giant cooling towers rise up seemingly within touching distance of the track and platform. But at the end of this month, the site in central England will close its doors, signaling the end to polluting coal-powered electricity in the UK, in a landmark first for any G7 nation. 'It'll seem very strange because it has always been there,' said David Reynolds, a 74-year-old retiree who saw the site being built as a child before it began operations in 1967. 'When I was younger you could go down certain parts and you saw nothing but coal pits,' he told AFP. Energy transition Coal has played a vital part in British economic history, powering the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries that made the country a global superpower, and creating London's infamous choking smog. Even into the 1980s, it still represented 70% of the country's electricity mix before its share declined in the 1990s. In the last decade the fall has been even sharper, slumping to 38% in 2013, 5.0% in 2018 then just 1.0% last year. In 2015, the then Conservative government said that it intended to shut all coal-fired power stations by 2025 to reduce carbon emissions. Jess Ralston, head of energy at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit think-tank, said the UK's 2030 clean-energy target was 'very ambitious.' But she added: 'It sends a very strong message that the UK is taking climate change as a matter of great importance and also that this is only the first step.' By last year, natural gas represented a third of the UK's electricity production, while a quarter came from wind power and 13 percent from nuclear power, according to electricity operator National Grid ESO. 'The UK managed to phase coal out so quickly largely through a combination of economics and then regulations,' Ralston said. 'So larger power plants like coal plants had regulations put on them because of all the sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides, all the emissions coming from the plant and that meant that it was no longer economically attractive to invest in those sorts of plants.' The new Labour government launched its flagship green energy plan after its election win in July, with the creation of a publicly owned body to invest in offshore wind, tidal power and nuclear power. The aim is to make Britain a superpower once more, this time in 'clean energy.' As such, Ratcliffe-on-Soar's closure on September 30 is a symbolic step in the UK's ambition to decarbonize electricity by 2030, and become carbon neutral by 2050. It will make the country the first in the G7 of rich nations to do away entirely with coal power electricity. Italy plans to do so by next year, France in 2027, Canada in 2030 and Germany in 2038. Japan and the United States have no set dates. - 'End of an era' - In recent years, Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station, which had the potential to power two million homes, has been used only when big spikes in electricity use were expected, such as during a cold snap in 2022 or the 2023 heatwave. Its last delivery of 1,650 tons of coal at the start of this summer barely supplied 500,000 homes for eight hours. 'It's like the end of a era,' said Becky, 25, serving £4 pints behind the bar of the Red Lion pub in nearby Kegworth. Her father works at the power station and will be out of a job. September 30 is likely to stir up strong emotions for him and the other 350 remaining employees. 'It's their life,' she said. Nothing remains of the world's first coal-fired power station, which was built by Thomas Edison in central London in 1882, three years after his invention of the electric light bulb. The same fate is slated for Ratcliffe-on-Soar: the site's German owner, Uniper, said it will be completely dismantled 'by the end of the decade.' In its place will be a new development — a 'carbon-free technology and energy hub', the company said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/end-of-an-era-uk-to-shut-last-coal-fired-power-plant-/7788809.html	2024-09-18T03:49:12-07:00

EU court confirms Qualcomm's antitrust fine, with minor reduction	brussels — Europe's second-top court largely confirmed on Wednesday an EU antitrust fine imposed on U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm, revising it down slightly to $265.5 million from an initial $2.7 million. The European Commission imposed the fine in 2019, saying that Qualcomm sold its chipsets below cost between 2009 and 2011, in a practice known as predatory pricing, to thwart British phone software maker Icera, which is now part of Nvidia Corp. Qualcomm had argued that the 3G baseband chipsets singled out in the case accounted for just 0.7% of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) market and so it was not possible for it to exclude rivals from the chipset market. The Court made 'a detailed examination of all the pleas put forward by Qualcomm, rejecting them all in their entirety, with the exception of a plea concerning the calculation of the amount of the fine, which it finds to be well founded in part,' the Luxembourg-based General Court said. Qualcomm can appeal on points of law to the EU Court of Justice, Europe's highest. The chipmaker did not immediately reply to an emailed Reuters request for comment. The company convinced the same court two years ago to throw out a $1.1 billion antitrust fine handed down in 2018 for paying billions of dollars to Apple from 2011 to 2016 to use only its chips in all its iPhones and iPads in order to block out rivals such as Intel Corp. The EU watchdog subsequently declined to appeal the judgment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-court-confirms-qualcomm-s-antitrust-fine-with-minor-reduction/7788763.html	2024-09-18T02:35:16-07:00	
Google wins challenge against $1.66B EU antitrust fine	BRUSSELS — Alphabet unit Google won its challenge on Wednesday against a $1.66 billion antitrust fine imposed five years ago for hindering rivals in online search advertising, a week after it lost a much bigger case. The European Commission, in its 2019 decision, said Google had abused its dominance to prevent websites from using brokers other than its AdSense platform that provided search adverts. The practices it said were illegal took place from 2006 to 2016. The Luxembourg-based General Court mostly agreed with the European Union competition enforcer's assessments of the case, but annulled the fine. 'The court (...) upheld most of the commission's assessments, but annulled the decision imposing a fine of almost 1.5 billion euros ($1.66 billion) on Google, on the grounds in particular that it had failed to take into account all the relevant circumstances in its assessment of the duration of the contractual clauses that it had found to be unfair,' the judges said. The AdSense fine, one of a trio of fines that have cost Google a total of some $9 billion, was triggered by a complaint from Microsoft in 2010. Google has said it changed the targeted contracts in 2016 before the Commission's decision. The company last week lost its final fight against a $2.6 billion fine levied for using its price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.	https://www.voanews.com/a/google-wins-challenge-against-1-66b-eu-antitrust-fine/7788759.html	2024-09-18T02:30:32-07:00	
Sri Lanka's plantation workers live on the margins, but politicians want their votes	SPRING VALLEY, Sri Lanka — Whoever Sri Lanka's next president is, Muthuthevarkittan Manohari isn't expecting much to change in her daily struggle to feed the four children and elderly mother with whom she lives in a dilapidated room in a tea plantation. Both leading candidates in Saturday's presidential election are promising to give land to the country's hundreds of thousands of plantation workers, but Manohari says she's heard it all before. Sri Lanka's plantation workers are a long-marginalized group who frequently live in dire poverty, but they can swing elections by voting as a bloc. Mahohari and her family are descended from Indian indentured laborers who were brought in by the British during colonial rule to work on plantations that grew first coffee, and later tea and rubber. Those crops are still Sri Lanka's leading foreign exchange earners. For 200 years, the community has lived on the margins of Sri Lankan society. Soon after the country became independent in 1948, the new government stripped them of citizenship and voting rights. Around 400,000 people were deported to India under an agreement with Delhi, separating many families. The community fought for its rights, winning in stages until achieving full recognition as citizens in 2003. There are around 1.5 million descendants of plantation workers living in Sri Lanka today, including about 3.5% of the electorate, and some 470,000 people still live on plantations. The plantation community has the highest levels of poverty, malnutrition, anemia among women and alcoholism in the country, and some of the lowest levels of education. They're an important voting bloc, turned out by unions that double as political parties that ally with the country's major parties. Despite speaking the Tamil language, they’re treated as a distinct group from the island’s indigenous Tamils, who live mostly in the north and east. Still, they suffered during the 26-year civil war between government forces and Tamil Tiger separatists. Plantation workers and their descendants faced mob violence, arrests and imprisonment because of their ethnicity. Most plantation workers live in crowded dwellings called 'line houses,' owned by plantation companies. Tomoya Obokata, a U.N. special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, said after a visit in 2022 that five to ten people often share a single 3.05-by-3.6 meter room, often without windows, a proper kitchen, running water or electricity. Several families frequently share a single basic latrine. There are no proper medical facilities in the plantations, and the sick are attended to by so-called estate medical assistants who do not have medical degrees. 'These substandard living conditions, combined with the harsh working conditions, represent clear indicators of forced labor and may also amount to serfdom in some instances,' Obokata wrote in a report to the U.N. high commissioner for human rights. The government has made some efforts to improve conditions for the planation workers, but years of fiscal crisis and the resistance of powerful plantation companies have blunted progress. Access to education has improved, and a small group of entrepreneurs, professionals and academics descended from planation workers has emerged. This year, the government negotiated a raise in the minimum daily wage for a plantation worker to $4.50 per day, plus an additional dollar if a worker picks more than 22 kilos in a day. Workers say this target is almost impossible to achieve, in part because tea bushes are often neglected and grow sparsely. The government has built better houses for some families and the Indian government is helping to build more, said Periyasamy Muthulingam, executive director of Sri Lanka's Institute of Social Development, which works on plantation worker rights. But many promises have gone unfulfilled. 'All political parties have promised to build better houses during elections but they don’t implement it when they are in power,' Muthulingam said. Muthulingam says more than 90% of the plantation community is landless because they have been left out of the government's land distribution programs. In this election, sitting President Ranil Wickremesinghe, standing as an independent candidate, has promised to give the line houses and the land they stand on to the people who live in them, and help develop them into villages. The main opposition candidate, Sajith Premadasa, has promised to break up the plantations and distribute the land to the workers as small holdings. Both proposals will face resistance from the plantation companies. Manohari says she's not holding out hope. She's more concerned with what's going to happen to her 16-year-old son after he was forced to drop out of school due to lack of funds. 'The union leaders come every time promising us houses and land and I would like to have them,' she said. 'But they never happen as promised.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-s-plantation-workers-live-on-the-margins-but-politicians-want-their-votes-/7788751.html	2024-09-18T02:23:02-07:00	
Japan says Chinese carrier entered its contiguous waters for first time	TOKYO/TAIPEI — A Chinese aircraft carrier entered Japan's contiguous waters for the first time on Wednesday, Japan's defense ministry said, the latest in a string of military maneuvers that has ratcheted up tensions between the neighbors. The carrier, accompanied by two destroyers, sailed between Japan's southern Yonaguni and Iriomote islands, entering an area that extends up to 24 nautical miles from its coastline where Japan can exert some controls as defined by the United Nations. Japan's Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Moriya said Tokyo had conveyed its 'serious concerns' to Beijing, describing the incident as 'utterly unacceptable from the perspective of the security environment of Japan and the region.' 'We will continue to closely monitor Chinese naval vessels' activities in the waters around our country and will take all possible measures to gather information and conduct vigilance and surveillance,' Moriya told a news conference. Japan last month lodged a protest with China after one of its naval survey vessels entered Japanese waters, shortly after an airspace breach. In July, a Japanese navy destroyer made a rare entry into China's territorial waters near Taiwan, according to the Japanese media. An uptick in Chinese military activity near Japan and around Taiwan in recent years has stoked concerns in Tokyo. Japan has responded with a defense buildup it says aims to deter China from using military force to push its territorial claims in the region. Earlier on Wednesday, Taiwan's defense ministry said it had spotted the same Chinese aircraft carrier group sailing through waters off its east coast in the direction of Yonaguni, Japan's southernmost island, which is about 110 km east of Taiwan. China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its territory, has been staging regular exercises around the island for five years to pressure it to accept Beijing's claim of sovereignty, despite Taipei's strong objections. The ministry said the Chinese ships, led by Liaoning, the oldest of China's three aircraft carriers, were spotted in the early hours of the morning on Wednesday sailing through waters to the northeast of Taiwan. Taiwan tracked the ships and sent its forces to monitor, it said. China's defense ministry did not answer calls seeking comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-says-chinese-carrier-entered-its-contiguous-waters-for-first-time/7788746.html	2024-09-18T02:09:52-07:00

Britain looks to Italy for help amid surge in Channel migrants	LONDON — Human rights groups have urged Britain not to copy Italy’s approach in trying to reduce the number of migrants arriving on its shores. Their comments come after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer traveled to Rome this week to learn more about the country’s success in tackling irregular migration across the Mediterranean Sea. There has been a surge of migrants arriving in small boats from France on Britain’s southern shores. More than 800 people arrived on Saturday, pushing the total for the year so far to more than 22,000. Eight migrants drowned that same day after their inflatable dinghy hit rocks off the French coastline. The high number of migrant arrivals has become a major political issue that successive governments have struggled to solve. Starmer traveled to Italy on Monday for talks with his counterpart, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, to learn more about her country’s recent success in tackling migration across the Mediterranean Sea from north Africa. 'You've made remarkable progress working with countries along migration routes as equals, to address the drivers of migration at [the] source and to tackle the gangs. As a result, irregular arrivals to Italy by sea are down 60% since 2022. So, I am pleased that we are deepening our cooperation here,' Starmer told Meloni at a press conference after their meeting. Italy has struck deals with Libya and Tunisia worth millions of dollars to keep migrants from leaving their shores, through tougher policing on land and through the interception of boats offshore. Human rights groups accuse those countries of committing widespread abuses against migrants. Rome also signed an agreement with Albania last year to send up to 36,000 asylum-seekers annually to the Balkan country for processing. 'The model that the Italian Government has conceived of is based on centers to process asylum applications for those immigrants who disembark within Italian or EU jurisdiction, in a foreign country,' Meloni told reporters in Rome. 'That is a model that was never experimented with before. If it works — as I hope it will — everybody can understand that this can become a new way to deal with migration flow,' she added. Questions remain over the legality of Italy’s approach, said Sacha Deshmukh, CEO of the human rights group Amnesty International UK. 'Keir Starmer needs to be very careful about what lessons he thinks he should learn from Italy’s experience. Amnesty International has some deep concerns as to whether Italy is being compliant with its international legal obligations and its human rights obligations in elements of its approach, both in terms of its own practice, for example, of its migrant camps, but also in terms of Italy's deal that it struck with Albania,' Deshmukh told VOA. 'What we would hope for would be countries like the UK to have a functioning asylum system, one that considered claims properly but swiftly, and dealt humanely with people who are fleeing terrible situations in many cases,' he added. There are also doubts about whether Britain could replicate Italy’s agreement with Albania, according to Raphael Bossong, a migration expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. 'To think that this can be reproduced in other settings where you don't have these particular things coming together, and to expect that there are many other countries lining up? Albania already officially said ‘no’ to various other countries who tried to follow suit. Never say never, but I think it's a highly doubtful proposition,' Bossong told VOA. Britain is giving France nearly $600 million over three years to boost the policing of French shores. Despite increased patrols along the French coast, the number of migrants who have made the journey so far this year is higher than at the same point in 2023. Prime Minister Starmer said his focus would be on returning failed asylum-seekers to their countries of origin and on better intelligence and policing to break up the smuggling gangs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-looks-to-italy-for-help-amid-surge-in-channel-migrants-/7788738.html	2024-09-18T01:52:50-07:00	
Malaysia's king to visit China Thursday	BEIJING — Malaysia's king Sultan Ibrahim will visit China starting Thursday, the first by a Malaysian monarch in a decade, where he will meet President Xi Jinping and likely seek support for projects boosting connectivity to neighboring Singapore. The ceremonial ruler from the southern state of Johor, will be accompanied by Malaysia's transport and housing ministers, a statement from the country's foreign ministry said on Wednesday. 'His Majesty's visit provides an excellent opportunity for both sides to reaffirm a shared commitment in ensuring that Malaysia-China relations continue to remain forward-looking, dynamic and prosperous,' Malaysia's foreign ministry said. Sultan Ibrahim was installed as the country's 17th king in January, under a unique system of monarchy where the heads of Malaysia's nine royal families take turns to sit on the throne every five years and are supposed to stay above politics. But the 65-year-old has indicated he intends to weigh in on the country's political issues and proposed in a media interview before his ascension that Malaysia's state oil firm Petronas and the country's anti-corruption agency report directly to the king. The last time a Malaysian king visited China was in 2014. Ibrahim will also meet China's second-ranking official, Premier Li Qiang, Malaysia's foreign ministry said. Li visited Kuala Lumpur in June and backed Malaysian plans to develop its connectivity through a $10-billion rail link to other China-backed railway projects in Laos and Thailand. Li said that the initiative would realize plans for a proposed Pan-Asia railway running from Kunming in China to Singapore, presumably through Johor, which is where the outspoken Sultan wants to develop a rail link, too. Ibrahim has spoken of plans to revive a stalled high-speed rail project between Malaysia and Singapore, with a border crossing in Forest City, a $100-billion joint venture between China's Country Garden 2007. HK and a private Malaysian company backed by the Sultan. Data compiled by the American Enterprise Institute shows the embattled Chinese developer had invested just $110 million out of the total $26 billion Chinese firms have directed to Malaysia since 2010, the bulk of which was in its metals, energy and transport sectors. The two countries' commercial ties came under the spotlight earlier this month when Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said China had protest notes to stop Malaysia's oil exploration activities in the South China Sea, but stressed the two sides continued to communicate over the issue. China claims almost the entire South China Sea as its territory based on historic maps, including parts of the exclusive economic zones of Malaysia the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam. An international arbitration tribunal in 2016 said China's claim had no basis under international law, a ruling Beijing does not recognize.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-s-king-to-visit-china-thursday/7788736.html	2024-09-18T01:42:53-07:00	
Iconic US container firm Tupperware files for bankruptcy	WASHINGTON — Tupperware Brands and some of its subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Tuesday, the food container firm said in a statement. The company, known for its trademark food storage containers, has been hit by dwindling sales in recent years. Last year the New York Stock Exchange-listed firm warned of 'substantial doubt' about its ability to keep operating in light of its poor financial position. 'Over the last several years, the company's financial position has been severely impacted by the challenging macroeconomic environment,' president and CEO Laurie Ann Goldman said in a statement announcing the bankruptcy filing. 'As a result, we explored numerous strategic options and determined this is the best path forward,' added Goldman. The company said it would seek court approval for a sale process for the business to protect its brand and 'further advance Tupperware's transformation into a digital-first, technology-led company.' The Orlando, Florida-based firm said it would also seek approval to continue operating during bankruptcy proceedings and would continue to pay its employees and suppliers. 'We plan to continue serving our valued customers with the high-quality products they love and trust throughout this process,' Goldman said. The firm's shares were trading at $0.5099 Monday, well down from $2.55 in December last year. Tupperware said it had implemented a strategic plan to modernize its operations and drive efficiencies to ignite growth following the appointment of a new management team last year. 'The company has made significant progress and intends to continue this important transformation work.' In its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Tupperware listed assets of between $500 million and $1 billion and liabilities of between $1 billion and $10 billion. The filing also said it had between 50,000 and 100,000 creditors. Tupperware, whose name became synonymous with its airtight plastic containers, in recent years lost popularity with consumers and an initiative to gain distribution through big-box chain store Target failed to reverse its fortunes. The company's roots date to 1946, when chemist Earl Tupper 'had a spark of inspiration while creating molds at a plastics factory shortly after the Great Depression,' according to Tupperware's website. 'If he could design an airtight seal for plastic storage containers, like those on a paint can, he could help war-weary families save money on costly food waste.' Over time, Tupper's hermetically sealed plastic containers also became associated with 'Tupperware Parties,' where friends would gather with food and drink as a company representative demonstrated the items.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iconic-us-container-firm-tupperware-files-for-bankruptcy-/7788733.html	2024-09-18T01:36:11-07:00	
US decision on Nippon bid for US Steel pushed to after election, sources say	WASHINGTON/TOKYO — The U.S. national security panel reviewing Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel let the companies refile their application for approval of the deal, a person familiar with the matter said, delaying a decision on the politically sensitive merger until after the Nov. 5 presidential election. The move offers a ray of hope for the companies, whose proposed tie-up appeared set to be blocked when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) alleged on Aug. 31 the transaction posed a risk to national security by threatening the steel supply chain for critical U.S. industries. CFIUS needs more time to understand the deal's impact on national security and engage with the parties, the person said on Tuesday. Refiling sets a new 90-day clock to review the proposed tie-up and make a decision. The review was expected to take close to the full 90 days, another person familiar with the matter said. Nippon Steel declined to comment. CFIUS and U.S. Steel did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. 'Extending the timeline takes pressure off the parties and, importantly, pushes the decision past the election in November,' said Nick Klein, a CFIUS lawyer with DLA Piper. The deal has become a political hot potato. This month, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said at a rally in Pennsylvania, the swing state where U.S. Steel is headquartered, that she wants U.S. Steel to remain 'American owned and operated,' echoing a view held by President Joe Biden. The White House reiterated that position on Tuesday. Harris' Republican rival Donald Trump has pledged to block the deal if elected. Both candidates have sought to woo union votes. Postponing the decision to after the U.S. elections will 'dial down' the political temperature but does not guarantee approval, said David Boling, a former U.S. trade official who is now an analyst at Eurasia Group. 'Regardless of the CFIUS review, Nippon Steel still must reach an agreement with the United Steelworkers,' Boling said. 'Without that, it's very hard to see this deal happening.' The United Steelworkers Union, which vehemently opposes the deal, said on Tuesday 'nothing has changed regarding the risks that Nippon's acquisition would pose to national security or the critical supply chain concerns that have already been identified.' The deal is being closely watched in Japan, a close U.S. ally and its biggest foreign investor. 'Further strengthening economic relations, including expanding mutual investment between Japan and the U.S., are essential for both countries,' Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Moriya told reporters on Wednesday. Nippon Steel shares were up 1.1% in afternoon trading in Tokyo. U.S. Steel shares closed down 0.4% on Tuesday. CFIUS is concerned Nippon Steel's merger could hurt the supply of steel needed for critical transportation, construction and agriculture projects, it said in its August letter to the companies, exclusively obtained by Reuters. It also cited a global glut of cheap Chinese steel, and said that under Nippon, a Japanese company, U.S. Steel would be less likely to seek tariffs on foreign steel importers. It added that decisions by Nippon could 'lead to a reduction in domestic steel production capacity.' In a 100-page response letter to CFIUS, also exclusively obtained by Reuters, Nippon Steel said it will invest billions of dollars in U.S. Steel facilities that otherwise would have been idled, 'indisputably' allowing it to 'maintain and potentially increase domestic steelmaking capacity in the United States.' The company also reaffirmed a promise not to transfer any U.S. Steel production capacity or jobs outside the U.S. and would not interfere in any of U.S. Steel's decisions on trade matters, including decisions to pursue trade measures under U.S. law against unfair trade practices. The deal, Nippon added, would 'create a stronger global competitor to China grounded in the close relationship between the United States and Japan.' Robust CFIUS reviews take 90 days but it is common for companies to withdraw their filings and resubmit them to give them more time to address the panel's concerns. According to CFIUS's 2023 annual report, 18% of companies seeking deal approval refiled their applications last year. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel filed for the review in March, and CFIUS allowed them to refile in June, starting a second 90-day clock that runs out on Sept. 23, Reuters reported on Friday. In December, CFIUS could approve the deal, possibly with measures to address national security concerns, recommend that the president block it, or extend the timetable again.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-decision-on-nippon-bid-for-us-steel-pushed-to-after-election-sources-say/7788729.html	2024-09-18T01:24:45-07:00

China piles extra work on weary youth to ease pension crisis	BEIJING — China's decision to raise the retirement age will give a brief boost to its strained pension system but risks further discouraging weary young workers and cannot arrest long-term demographic decline, experts say. The ruling Communist Party last week announced a gradual increase in the statutory retirement age starting next year — rising from 60 to 63 for men, from 55 to 58 for white-collar women workers, and from 50 to 55 for blue-collar female employees. The government said the changes would bring a system that has changed little since the 1950s into line with decades of improvements in public health, life expectancy and education, and help society adapt to a shrinking population and workforce. Analysts told AFP that growing concerns over the sustainability of the nationwide pension system pushed Beijing to act. 'The pension system is under a lot of strain,' said Zhao Litao, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's East Asian Institute. 'It is... clear to the leadership that the stakes for postponing the reform (were) getting increasingly high,' he said. China's retirement age had been among the youngest in the world, and officials have discussed raising it for more than a decade. Opposition from lower-wage workers, a slowing economy and high youth unemployment had thwarted change, experts said. Officials could wait no longer, Zhao said, partly because 'the pace of population-aging and population-decline is faster than previously anticipated.' Pension tension China's sprawling pension system has three pillars: basic state pensions, mandatory plans for company employees, and voluntary plans for private personal schemes. But the state-led scheme lacks coordination at a national level, while the latter two pillars remain underdeveloped, critics say. A top government think tank said in a 2019 report that one main state pension fund may dry up by 2035 as the workforce shrinks. Around a third of Chinese provinces already run pension deficits, and local finances have come under more stress since the COVID-19 pandemic. Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at Australia's Victoria University, said the higher retirement age would ease pressure on the system 'in the short and medium term.' Under the new rules, the age will rise incrementally over 15 years from 2025, so younger people will end up working for longer than those currently close to retiring. Workers will eventually need to make a minimum of 20 years of contributions to draw their basic pension, up from the current 15 years. 'After the government increases the retirement age, this decline (in the number of workers) will become... slower,' Peng told AFP. But, she added, 'the labor force is still declining — this is a (longer-term) trend.' Working harder, longer But economic necessity has not necessarily bred widespread acceptance. Many posts on Chinese social media have pointed to a perceived lack of transparency over how workers born from the 1990s onwards would be impacted. Those generations already face widespread joblessness or an intense work culture that leaves many feeling overwhelmed or burnt out. 'For many Chinese individuals, these changes in retirement policies feel like a reneged commitment of social welfare provision — kicking the problem down an already murky road,' Yun Zhou, a sociologist at the University of Michigan, told AFP. 'As gender- and age-based discriminations remain deeply entrenched in the Chinese labor market, it remains to be seen to what extent workers... can enjoy effective labor rights protection,' she said. Dali Yang, professor of political science at the University of Chicago, said the government faced a 'loss of credibility' on pensions. Recent economic challenges have already prompted many Chinese to prioritize short-term cash over saving for retirement, Yang told AFP. Demography is destiny Chinese state media has said a rise in the retirement age was 'inevitable' given the country's development. The current age was set decades ago when scarcity and poverty were common, before market reforms brought rapid gains in living standards. Life expectancy rose from around 50 in the early 1960s to 79 by 2022, according to World Bank data. But development coincided with families having fewer children, hastened by decades of birth restrictions under the former one-child policy. Now, China is stuck with a growing senior population and fewer young people to fill the gap. Experts said only a suite of bold policies — from creating high-quality jobs to raising productivity, expanding public healthcare, fostering better work-life balance and raising the social position of women — could help Beijing adapt to its alarming demographic destiny. Several told AFP that last week's announcement was unlikely to be the last of its kind. 'There is still considerable room to further increase the retirement age,' Zhao, of NUS, said. But, he added, 'if (younger people) have to work longer and contribute more... they want to get answers for questions like job security and quality, and the level of future pension benefits.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-piles-extra-work-on-weary-youth-to-ease-pension-crisis/7788694.html	2024-09-17T23:36:06-07:00	
In Indonesia, Uganda and Ecuador, environmental activists risk lives for planet	PARIS — Almost 200 environmental activists were murdered last year, with the toll especially heavy in South America, according to rights group Global Witness. Here are the stories of three campaigners who have faced violence and repression trying to stop wildcat gold mining in Ecuador, illegal shrimp farming in Indonesia and a controversial oil project in Uganda. 'We have a responsibility' Daniel Frits Maurits Tangkilisan has been assaulted, arrested and prosecuted for his activism to protect a national park, but he is unbowed. 'Why be afraid? Why back down? Your home should be defended,' the 51-year-old told AFP in Jakarta, where he is awaiting a new ruling in legal proceedings against him. Born and raised in the Indonesian capital, he 'fell in love at first sight' with the remote Karimunjawa Islands National Park off Java, on his first visit in 2011. He later settled there. Daniel began to notice the growing impact of illegal shrimp farms, which began to proliferate around 2017. Run-off from the farms killed seaweed and forced marine life to move further from shore, impacting the livelihoods of fishing communities, he said. In 2022, Daniel helped start the #SaveKarimunjawa movement, which pushed for a local zoning law banning the shrimp farms. But his activism made him a target — he was threatened, assaulted and put in a chokehold, and fellow environmentalists received death threats. He was arrested in December 2023 over allegations of hate speech stemming from a Facebook post criticizing illegal shrimp farming. A local court sentenced him in April to seven months behind bars. The conviction was overturned on appeal but prosecutors took the case to the Supreme Court, insisting he should not be recognized as an environmental activist. 'This is a price that must be paid,' Daniel said of the threats and legal battles. And his activism has had some success, with recent government inspections forcing many illegal operations to shut. 'We have a responsibility to our children, grandchildren and future generations,' he said. 'If you give up... you say goodbye to your future.' 'Hell on Earth' Abdulaziz Bweete grew up in Kawempe, a shanty town in the Ugandan capital Kampala, and saw first-hand the devastating impact of environmental change in poorer communities. 'I have grown up seeing floods around but I had not interested myself in what is causing floods,' he told AFP. It took two things to galvanize the 26-year-old — going to university, and seeing the Uganda government's response to climate protests. Bweete was among a group of student organizers who marched on parliament in July with a petition opposing a multi-billion-dollar oil project that campaigners say will badly affect a delicate environment. He and several other young activists were arrested, charged with illegal assembly, and held in Kampala's maximum-security Luzira prison until August. He told AFP he and fellow protesters were beaten by police. The activist was previously imprisoned and arrested following rallies in the capital. 'All I can say is prison is a hell on Earth,' he said. 'We don't have freedom of protest in this country,' he said, glancing around nervously in Kyambogo University's lush campus setting. Demonstrations in Uganda, ruled with an iron fist by President Yoweri Museveni for four decades, are often met with a heavy-handed police response. Bweete said politics and climate change go hand in hand. 'If we have good leaders, we can have good climate policies. This is a long struggle, but we are determined to win,' he insisted. 'Defend life' Alex Lucitante, a leader of the Cofan Indigenous people on the border between Ecuador and Colombia, won a historic legal victory in 2018 over mining companies in the Amazon, striking out 52 gold mine concessions. It helped win him the Goldman Environmental Prize — the Nobel of environmental defenders — two years ago. But despite setting up a system of patrols and even drone surveillance, it has not stopped gold prospectors violating their territory. 'The destruction is still going on all around our land, and the threat is stronger,' he told AFP, telling of illegal mining, deforestation and threats from armed groups. 'Today, the situation is particularly critical in our territories,' said Lucitante. 'It all happens in plain sight and with the knowledge of the authorities,' which are 'sometimes linked to illegal actors operating in the area,' he added. The environmentalist has urged global leaders to listen to the 'voice of Indigenous communities' and hear their plea to 'defend life.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-indonesia-uganda-and-ecuador-environmental-activists-risk-lives-for-planet/7788689.html	2024-09-17T23:27:58-07:00

Gold Apollo says it did not make pagers used in Lebanon blasts	NEW TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan's Gold Apollo said on Wednesday the pagers that were used in the detonations in Lebanon on Tuesday were not made by it but by a company called BAC which has a license to use its brand. At least nine people were killed and nearly 3,000 wounded when pagers used by Hezbollah members detonated simultaneously across Lebanon on Tuesday. Images of destroyed pagers analyzed by Reuters showed a format and stickers on the back that were consistent with pagers made by Gold Apollo. A senior Lebanese security source told Reuters that Hezbollah had ordered 5,000 pagers from Taiwan-based Gold Apollo. 'The product was not ours. It was only that it had our brand on it,' Gold Apollo founder and president, Hsu Ching-Kuang, told reporters at the company's offices in the northern Taiwanese city of New Taipei on Wednesday. The company said in a statement that the AR-924 model was produced and sold by BAC. 'We only provide brand trademark authorization and have no involvement in the design or manufacturing of this product,' the statement said. Hsu earlier said that the firm with the license was based in Europe but later declined to comment on BAC's location. While Hsu was meeting with reporters, police officials arrived at the company. Hezbollah fighters began using pagers in the belief they would be able to evade Israeli tracking of their locations, two sources familiar with the group's operations told Reuters this year. Hsu said did not know how the pagers could have been rigged to explode. Iran-backed Hezbollah said it was carrying out a 'security and scientific investigation' into the causes of the blasts.

US Air Force general: Russia military larger, better than before Ukraine invasion	PENTAGON — Russia's military is bigger and stronger than it was prior to invading Ukraine in February 2022, the commander of United States Air Forces in Europe and Africa cautioned Tuesday. 'Russia is getting larger, and they're getting better than they were before. … They are actually larger than they were when [the invasion] kicked off,' Air Force General James Hecker told reporters at the Air & Space Forces Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber Conference. The improvements come despite heavy casualties inflicted by Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has estimated that since 2022, more than 350,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded. 'The rates of casualties that they're experiencing are staggering,' Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters Tuesday in response to a question from VOA. On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered that the Russian army grow by 180,000 active-duty troops for a total of 1.5 million soldiers, making Russia's military the second largest in the world, behind China's. 'Russia is going to be something that we're going to have to deal with for a long time, no matter how this thing ends,' Hecker said. However, William Pomeranz, a senior scholar at the Kennan Institute, told VOA that 'this move suggests that Vladimir Putin is losing the war.' 'This is an open signal from Vladimir Putin that his army and his military is in trouble and doesn't have the resources to maintain troops in the field,' Pomeranz said. Despite Russian improvements on the battlefield, Ukraine has continued to put chinks in Russia's armor, shooting down more than 100 Russian aircraft since Moscow began its full-scale invasion, which amounts to dozens more aircraft than Russia has been able to down on the Ukrainian side, according to General Hecker. 'So what we see is the aircraft are kind of staying on their own side of the line, if you will, and when that happens, you have a war like we're seeing today, with massive attrition, cities just being demolished, a lot of civilian casualties,' he said. To gain even the slightest advantages in a war where no clear side dominates the skies, Ukraine has turned to low-cost solutions that also appeal to the U.S. military. 'We have to get on the right side of the cost curve with this. Taking down $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 one-way UAVs [drones] with $1 million missiles, we just can't afford to do that in the long-term,' the general told reporters. General Chance Saltzman, the chief of the U.S. Space Force, announced Tuesday that a Space Force pilot program that uses commercial satellite imagery and related analytics to create more situational awareness for military leaders has proven very cost-effective when compared with traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance collection via U.S. MQ-9 drones, which are expensive and limited in number. AFRICOM was able to use the $40 million Tactical Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Tracking Program to maintain situational awareness during the full withdrawal of U.S. forces from two air bases in Niger in July and August. The drawback, however, was that instead of real-time situational awareness, the data took one to four hours to get to the security team. 'Not as good as real time, right? With MQ-9 that you would have, but it's better than nothing, right?' Hecker said. Hecker also said the U.S. was looking into more cost-effective ways to sense incoming threats around bases, including methods like Ukraine's Sky Fortress system that uses thousands of inexpensive sensors to identify aerial threats. He says the technology has been demonstrated in Romania and other countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-air-force-general-russia-military-larger-better-than-before-ukraine-invasion/7788601.html	2024-09-17T18:38:40-07:00	
North Korea fires short-range ballistic missiles for second time in a week	SEOUL/TOKYO — North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles Wednesday that landed in the sea off its east coast, South Korea and Japan said. The missiles lifted off from Kaechon, north of the capital, Pyongyang, around 6:50 a.m. local time and flew in a northeast direction, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, without specifying how many were fired. 'Our military is maintaining full readiness posture while strengthening surveillance and vigilance in preparation for additional launches and closely sharing information with the U.S. and Japan side,' it said in a statement. About 30 minutes after the first missile notice, Japan's coast guard said North Korea fired another ballistic missile, noting the projectiles appeared to have fallen. The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said on X that it was aware of the launches and consulting closely with Seoul and Tokyo. The North fired several short-range ballistic missiles last Thursday, the first such launch in more than two months, which it later described as a test of a new 600 mm multiple-launch rocket system. South Korea's JCS has said the launch might have been to test the weapons for export to Russia, amid intensifying military cooperation between the two countries. The United States, South Korea and Ukraine, among other countries, have accused Pyongyang of supplying rockets and missiles to Moscow for use in the war in Ukraine, in return for economic and other military assistance. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, who is visiting Russia this week to attend conferences, met her counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday and discussed ways to promote bilateral ties, the Russian foreign ministry said on its website. Wednesday's missile launches also came days after the isolated country for the first time showed images of centrifuges that produce fuel for its nuclear bombs, as leader Kim Jong Un visited a uranium enrichment facility and called for more weapons-grade material to boost the arsenal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-fires-short-range-ballistic-missiles-for-second-time-in-a-week/7788598.html	2024-09-17T18:29:10-07:00	
China’s influence campaign intensifies as US election nears	washington — At first glance, Noah R. Smith might seem like your typical social media user. His bio says he’s a father, a former 'Track and Field representative,' and a current member of the PanAm Sports organization. On July 14, a day after the first assassination attempt on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Smith shared three posts from an account named 'TRUMP WON.' One post declared, 'AMERICA was attacked today … we must get it together. It’s literally a matter of life and death,' accompanied by an image depicting a divine hand halting a bullet aimed at Trump. Another post urged 'all MAGA GOD Fearing Patriots' to connect, stating, 'Grow These Accounts, UNITED We Are Strong.' While it might seem that Smith is a devoted Trump supporter, closer inspection suggests otherwise. His cover photo features Chinese watermarks, his profile picture is sourced from a company that provides photos, videos and music, and his bio is lifted from an authentic account named Laurel R. Smith. In reality, Noah R. Smith is impersonating a U.S. voter who supports Trump. A joint investigation by VOA Mandarin and Doublethink Lab (DTL), a Taiwanese social media analytics firm, uncovered 10 such accounts on X. These accounts are linked to China’s Spamouflage network — a state-sponsored operation aimed at supporting the Chinese government and undermining its critics. This network was first identified by social media analytics company Graphika in 2019 and was used to target Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters at that time. Following the assassination attempt on July 14, the accounts began promoting pro-Trump content. Previously, they shared material consistent with Spamouflage’s broader interests: defending China, criticizing U.S. foreign policy, and exploiting divisive domestic issues such as gun violence and racial tensions. DTL labeled this network of accounts posing as Americans 'MAGAflage 1,' because they all seem to be promoting Trump’s slogan 'Make America Great Again [MAGA].' 'The MAGAflage accounts are different because they are not just criticizing stuff. They are amplifying positive content about Trump,' Jasper Hewitt, a digital intelligence analyst at Doublethink Lab, told VOA Mandarin. He added that it’s too early to draw conclusions about whom China is supporting, as researchers are still tracking accounts that criticize both Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. 'Engaging with the MAGA movement, or any part of the political spectrum, might merely be a new attempt to generate authentic traffic,' Hewitt told VOA. The first MAGAflage network was discovered by Elise Thomas, a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, in April 2024. This network focuses on promoting positive content of Trump. She told VOA earlier that by wrapping a topic in a U.S. partisan political frame, these accounts got 'a reasonable amount of engagement from real American users.' Limited influence The VOA Mandarin investigation revealed that the accounts operate in coordination. Six out of the 10 accounts were created in 2015 but had their first visible posts on May 18 or May 19, 2022. The batch accounts — the 10 new accounts — are not very active. Each account has roughly 100 posts or reposts over the last two years. The batch accounts were inactive for one year but were awoken after the first Trump assassination attempt. Additionally, these accounts occasionally post or repost Chinese content. For example, an account named Super-Rabbit shared praise for China's political and economic model from state-linked influencers like Shanghai Panda and Xinhua News Agency’s reporter Li Zexin. One post from September 3 contrasted U.S. President Joe Biden’s inactivity with China’s President Xi Jinping’s engagement in Africa. 'When Joe Biden is sitting on the beach wasted away, China’s President Xi is shaking hands with various African leaders and making a better impact in Africa,' the post said. VOA contacted the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment but did not receive a response as of publication time. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in a statement that 'China has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election, and we hope that the U.S. side will not make an issue of China in the election.' So far, the newly discovered MAGAflage 1 accounts have had limited influence, with only a handful of followers and minimal interactions. U.S. intelligence agencies issued their latest assessment earlier this month, warning that Russia, Iran, and China are intensifying efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election. While Russia remains the primary concern, officials noted that Chinese online influence actors have 'continued small scale efforts on social media to engage U.S. audiences on divisive political issues, including protests about the Israel-Gaza conflict and promote negative stories about both political parties.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-influence-campaign-intensifies-as-us-election-nears/7788292.html	2024-09-17T18:22:02-07:00	
Senate Republicans again block legislation to guarantee rights to IVF	WASHINGTON — Republicans have blocked for a second time this year legislation to establish a nationwide right to in vitro fertilization, arguing that the vote is an election-year stunt after Democrats forced a vote on the issue. The Senate vote was Democrats' latest attempt to force Republicans into a defensive stance on women's health issues and highlight policy differences between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in the presidential race, especially as Trump has called himself a 'leader on IVF.' The 51-44 vote was short of the 60 votes needed to move forward on the bill, with only two Republicans voting in favor. Democrats say Republicans who insist they support IVF are being hypocritical because they won't support legislation guaranteeing a right to it. 'They say they support IVF — here you go, vote on this,' said Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the bill's lead sponsor and a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children. The Democratic push started earlier this year after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the GOP-led legislature rushed to enact a law to provide legal protections for the clinics. Democrats quickly capitalized, holding a vote in June on Duckworth's bill and warning that the U.S. Supreme Court could go after the procedure after it overturned the right to an abortion in 2022. The bill would establish a nationwide right for patients to access IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies and a right for doctors and insurance companies to provide it, an effort to pre-empt state efforts to limit the services. It would also require more health insurers to cover it and expand coverage for military service members and veterans. In a statement after the vote, Harris said Republicans in Congress 'have once again made clear that they will not protect access to the fertility treatments many couples need to fulfill their dream of having a child.' Republican vice presidential candidate and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who missed the vote because he was campaigning, said during a stop in Wisconsin that the measure was not a serious IVF bill, but a measure designed to make Republicans look bad. 'The Senate blocked a ridiculous showboat bill that had no chance of passing,' Vance said. Republicans argued that the federal government shouldn't tell states what to do and that the bill was an unserious effort. Only Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted with Democrats to move forward on the bill both times. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said that Democrats are trying to create a political issue 'where there isn't one.' 'Let me remind everybody that Republicans support IVF, full stop,' Thune said just before the vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-republicans-again-block-legislation-to-guarantee-rights-to-ivf/7788589.html	2024-09-17T18:06:40-07:00	
Separatists in Indian Kashmir turn to mainstream politics	Beerwah, Kulgam and Srinagar, Indian administered Kashmir — Several Kashmiri political figures, including former members of banned separatist groups, have abandoned long-held separatist leanings and joined mainstream Indian politics. This shift in the disputed Himalayan region’s political landscape comes as three weeks of voting begin on Wednesday in the first legislative assembly election since 2019 when India stripped Jammu and Kashmir, or J&K, of its limited autonomy. One such Kashmiri figure is Sarjan Ahmad Wagay, a prominent cleric whose anti-India anthems became popular during a 2016 uprising. Wagay is running simultaneously from prison in two central Kashmir constituencies known as Ganderbal and Beerwah. His family says that Wagay’s decision to run was inspired by the success of Sheikh Abdul Rashid, who while imprisoned in New Delhi’s Tihar Jail won a J&K seat in the Indian parliament during national elections earlier this year. 'Rashid’s victory gave his family a hope that winning the election could help get him out of prison,' a family member, Rehbar Ahmad, told VOA. 'People from Beerwah and Ganderbal visited our home and assured us of their support,' Ahmad said. 'He was popular in these areas because he used to deliver religious sermons there. He is getting a lot of support from the like-minded people who want to see political prisoners out of jail.' In the heart of Kulgam district, Sayar Ahmad Reshi, a member of the banned Jamaat-e-Islami, is campaigning door-to-door. The socio-religious organization was banned by the Indian government in early 2019, accused of engaging in activities that 'threatened India’s security, integrity and sovereignty.' More than three decades ago, Jamaat-e-Islami participated in the Indian elections of 1987, but the group attributed its defeat to vote-rigging and has boycotted subsequent elections. This year, Jamaat-e-Islami decided to again participate in the elections but could not field candidates as a party because of the ban. Instead, they encouraged at least 10 members of their organization to run as independent candidates across the Kashmir Valley. 'Jamaat-e-Islami has never had issues with India, yet the organization is accused of promoting anti-India activities,' Reshi told VOA. 'If any individual was involved in such a movement, it was their own doing because there were no directives from our leadership,' he added. 'If Jamaat-e-Islami hadn’t been banned, I would have contested under its banner with a clear manifesto for social reform and justice,' Reshi said. 'I am hopeful that independent candidates of Jamaat-e-Islami will emerge victorious.' Political analyst Muzamil Maqbool told VOA that many people who long opposed the integration of Kashmir with central India have changed their minds since the region’s special autonomy was repealed in 2019. 'Kashmiri people are a leader-driven population, and all those leaders have deceived people through and through,' he said. 'Now the same people are exercising their power under democracy through voting and taking part in elections.' The candidacies of individuals previously associated with separatism have caused alarm among the region’s strongest traditional parties, the National Conference, or NC, and the Peoples Democratic Party, or PDP. Both parties suspect that the nationally ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has encouraged the trend in a bid to divide the vote and marginalize the regional parties. 'New Delhi always wanted to create an alternative here through the newly registered political parties which failed to score ... in the recently held parliamentary elections,' Maqbool said. 'However, there has been an entire paradigm shift where the focus has been shifted to many individuals, young faces and religious leaders to create an independent alternative force against regional mainstream parties.' Earlier, veteran separatist leader Salim Geelani, switched to mainstream politics after spending 35 years in Hurriyat Conference, an amalgam of separatist political parties in the Valley. He said that his decision to join PDP was driven by common goals including promoting infrastructure development and resolving Kashmir’s status within India. 'How can I deny the fact that I carry an Indian passport and use Indian currency? J&K remains a conflict zone and the people who lost their lives over the years, regardless of their identities, were our children,' he told VOA. 'Had there been no Kashmir issue the situation would be different today. I favored dialogue between all stakeholders of the region to resolve the Kashmir issue and I shall be in its favor forever,' he added. BJP national spokesperson Shazia Ilmi welcomed the decision of those who have chosen to show faith in Indian democracy rather than pursue separatist goals. 'Everyone has a right to contest elections in a democracy and our democracy allows that. Nobody has a right to make statements that are secessionist in nature that promote any kind of disintegration of the country,' Ilmi told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/separatists-in-indian-kashmir-turn-to-mainstream-politics/7788585.html	2024-09-17T17:59:26-07:00	
US lawmakers welcome Russian activist freed in August prisoner swap	WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers welcomed Vladimir Kara-Murza to Capitol Hill Tuesday, celebrating the release of the Russian activist from a Kremlin prison last month. Kara-Murza was part of the biggest prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Russia since the end of the Cold War. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin said Tuesday that Kara-Murza 'was at the forefront of the human rights struggle and an inspiration for so many people around the world.' In a letter written upon Kara-Murza's release, Cardin said, 'Your return home is both a personal victory and a testament to the unwavering strength of the human spirit.' Democratic Representative Bill Keating described Kara-Murza as one of the people Russian President Vladimir Putin most despises because of his ability to speak directly to the Russian people. Kara-Murza has twice survived suspected poisoning attempts. Kara-Murza, a deputy leader of the People's Freedom Party, was arrested in Russia in April 2022 and later faced charges of treason and spreading disinformation about the Russian military. Russian prosecutors suggested he face the maximum 25-year sentence in a prison colony. Kara-Murza was awarded the Václav Havel Human Rights Prize by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in October 2022 and the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 2024. 'Surreal doesn't come close to describing what I feel — just a few weeks ago sitting in a maximum-security prison in Siberia and now seeing so many friends in the halls of the U.S. Congress,' Kara-Murza told a gathering of lawmakers, journalists and activists on Capitol Hill. Kara-Murza thanked the public for keeping their attention focused on his situation. 'The only way we will be able to achieve long-term peace, stability, security and democracy on the European continent will be with a peaceful, free and democratic Russia,' he said. The Biden administration secured the release of 16 detainees in return for the release of eight detainees and two minors on Aug. 1. James O'Brien, assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, thanked Kara-Murza for his work on the Global Magnitsky Act, bipartisan legislation that authorizes the U.S. government to sanction government officials throughout the world who are human rights offenders. 'Vladimir, you gave us one of the main tools that we use to focus our advocacy for your freedom in the Global Magnitsky Act, and your work on that, I'm sure you didn't do it as a tool for yourself, but your work on that has helped us enormously as we work to free prisoners in the Western Hemisphere, in other countries across the world,' O'Brien said. Democratic Senator Chris Coons said Putin is still holding untold numbers of political prisoners in Russia. 'We must realize [Putin] does that, like all authoritarians, because he's afraid, afraid of his own people, afraid of accountability, afraid of the Ukrainians who just on the border of Russia are fighting with determination,' Coons said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-welcome-russian-activist-freed-in-august-prisoner-swap-/7788568.html	2024-09-17T17:25:01-07:00	
North Korea seen likely to escalate tensions ahead of US election	WASHINGTON — As the U.S. presidential election approaches, North Korea will likely escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula in an attempt to get attention and increase leverage for future negotiations with the United States, analysts said. On Friday, North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) and Rodong Sinmum newspaper released several photos showing leader Kim Jong Un visiting what the North’s media said is a uranium enrichment facility. It was the first time the North has disclosed a uranium enrichment facility publicly. In a recent speech marking the 76th anniversary of the founding of his government, Kim said North Korea will 'redouble its measures and efforts to make all the armed forces of the state, including the nuclear force, fully ready for combat.' Kim said he was acting because of the 'grave threat' posed by 'the reckless expansion' of a U.S.-led regional military bloc, according to KCNA. It remains unclear what the revelation means for the North’s nuclear capability, but it drew international attention. Nuclear escalation Despite the disclosure, the European Union said Monday that North Korea will never have the status of an acknowledged nuclear weapon state. 'The EU position is that the DPRK must immediately comply with UN Security Council resolutions by abandoning all its nuclear weapons, other weapons of mass destruction, ballistic missile programmes and existing nuclear programmes, in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner and cease all related activities,' said a spokesperson for the EU in an email to VOA Korean. Evans Revere, who served as acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said Kim probably believes that Trump, of the two presidential candidates, is more likely to help North Korea advance its agenda. 'Pyongyang wants to be accepted as a nuclear state and it is trying to undermine and eventually end the U.S.-ROK [South Korea] alliance and get rid of U.S. forces who are stationed on and around the Korean Peninsula,' Revere told VOA Korean Friday on the phone. 'Which of the two U.S. presidential candidates does North Korea see as more likely to help achieve its goals?' he asked. Revere, however, said he does not view North Korea’s recent actions as aimed at swaying the U.S. presidential election, stressing that what North Korea does and says is 'not always about us.' Sydney Seiler, who was the national intelligence officer for North Korea on the U.S. National Intelligence Council from 2020-2023, told VOA Korean in a Zoom interview Thursday it may be 'a step too far' to assume North Korea is trying to influence the upcoming election in the U.S. through its provocative behaviors. However, Seiler said, Pyongyang could be tweaking the timing of its actions 'to remain on everybody’s radar screen.' Seiler predicted that North Korea will hold off on its next major provocations, such as a seventh nuclear test, until after the next U.S. president is elected. North Korea’s intention Park Won-gon, a professor in the Department of North Korean Studies of Ewha Womans University in Seoul, told VOA Korean Friday that the North Korean regime may have considered testing its nuclear weapons for a seventh time to show that President Joe Biden’s North Korea policy has not worked and to 'turn it to Trump’s advantage.' 'The situation, however, has now changed,' Park said. 'Trump has been touting his close relationship with Kim Jong Un, so Pyongyang may have concluded that another nuclear test will not help Trump.' Hong Min, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, agreed that North Korea is not likely to conduct the seventh nuclear test before the November election. 'None of the countries that possess nuclear weapons have disclosed their nuclear facilities, especially enriched uranium facilities, but making such an unprecedented disclosure was to replace the nuclear test card,' Hong told VOA Korean Friday. Kim In-tae, senior research fellow at South Korea’s Institute for National Security Strategy, said a seventh nuclear test is still a possibility. 'North Korea’s foreign ministry declared it will prepare itself for a long-term nuclear confrontation with the United States,' Kim told VOA Korean Friday, referring to a Sept. 9 statement released by Pyongyang. 'They are now saying that they will strengthen their nuclear offensive from a longer-term perspective, regardless of the U.S. presidential election,' Kim said there is a possibility that North Korea will gradually ramp up its provocations, up to the test of a nuclear weapon. North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test in September 2017. VOA’s Kim Hyungjin contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-seen-likely-to-escalate-tensions-ahead-of-us-election/7788564.html	2024-09-17T17:12:38-07:00	
Experts say voters should feel confident in US elections this year	washington — American voters face a challenging duality as they count down the days until November's presidential election: a security landscape that officials say has become ever more dangerous even as the infrastructure to hold elections has become ever-more secure. The run-up to the 2024 election has seen the 'most complex threat landscape yet,' according to Cait Conley, a senior adviser at the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the government body responsible for overseeing election security. 'We do see a growing and diverse array of foreign adversaries, foreign actors, trying to disrupt our elections,' Conley said Tuesday, speaking at Politico's AI and Tech Summit in Washington. But U.S. voters should feel confident, she added. 'We have been surging resources,' Conley said. 'We have seen tremendous investment and progress in ensuring the full spectrum of security and resilience of our election infrastructure.' Nevertheless, Conley and other U.S. officials acknowledge the dangers are widespread, often extending beyond the voting booth. Physical threats The FBI and U.S. Postal Service said Tuesday they are investigating suspicious packages sent to election workers in at least 12 states. CISA officials have reported a growing number of swatting incidents — false reports to emergency services about violence or an emergency at a home or other location — targeting election workers. And the number of direct threats is rising rapidly. 'We are seeing an unprecedented and extremely disturbing level of threats of violence, and violence, against public officials,' said U.S. Deputy General Lisa Monaco, also speaking at the summit in Washington. 'For sure weekly and, sometimes, daily,' Monaco said of the frequency of the threats. Many of the threats target officials responsible for conducting elections. 'These are people who are simply volunteering their time to help all of us undertake the most fundamental right,' she said. 'These are people who are being threatened simply for doing their job.' Officials also warn that other public servants are getting a growing number of threats, including law enforcement officers, prosecutors and elected officials and candidates. 'It's serious,' said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, citing Sunday's apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump as he played golf at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida. He also pointed to the rash of threats in Springfield, Ohio, following the spread of unsubstantiated rumors about Haitian immigrants eating pets. 'We are in a heightened threat environment … a threat environment that is of deep concern,' Mayorkas said. 'It requires vigilance at every level of government and frankly on every block of each community across this country.' Concerns about the heightened threat environment are not new. Homeland Security officials have been warning of the dangers since at least January 2021, saying lone offenders or small groups could be motivated to carry out attacks motivated by a range of political and personal grievances. Only now, high emotions over the election combined with efforts by U.S. adversaries are fueling discontent and anger that could lead to more attacks. Cyber operations 'When it comes to malign influence campaigns, we are seeing a very aggressive set of actors,' Monaco said. Many of the efforts to sow discord have originated in Russia and Iran, and to a lesser extent China. But they are far from alone. 'We're seeing more actors in this space acting more aggressively in a more polarized environment and doing more with technologies, in particular AI,' Monaco said. Earlier this month, the U.S. Justice Department took action against what it said were two Russian plots to spread disinformation, taking down 32 fake news websites while bringing charges against two employees of Russia-backed media outlet RT, accusing them of funneling nearly $10 million to a U.S. company to promote material favorable to the Russian government. And last week, the U.S. State Department accused a number of Russian media companies, including RT, of working directly for Russia's intelligence agencies – charges Russia and RT denied. US preparations The best defense, Monaco said, is for U.S. voters to be careful about where they get their information. 'We have to be very vigilant on what we are consuming,' she said. Experts like Margaret Talev, who directs the Syracuse University Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship in Washington, agree. Voters should 'take a pause. Take a minute,' Talev told VOA. 'It involves all of us teaching ourselves, taking our time and trying to verify information from multiple sources rather than just believing the first thing that we see.' The National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), whose members play key roles in running elections, has also sought to make getting verified information easier, pushing a social media campaign it calls #TrustedInfo2024. NASS says its goal is 'to promote election officials as the trusted sources of election information during the 2024 election cycle and beyond.' And CISA, the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, has been working with election officials across the country to make sure they are ready for almost any contingency. CISA officials have also tried to rein in the hype about the dangers of AI, or artificial intelligence, blamed for helping U.S. adversaries to spread disinformation more effectively. 'Generative AI is not going to fundamentally introduce new threats to this election cycle,' the agency's Conley told VOA earlier this month. While AI is exacerbating existing threats, so far it has not produced anything elections officials have not already seen. 'This threat vector is not new to them,' Conley said. 'And they have taken the measures to ensure they're prepared to respond effectively.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-say-voters-should-feel-confident-in-us-elections-this-year/7788251.html	2024-09-17T17:11:53-07:00	
Partial lunar eclipse will be visible during September's supermoon	new york — Get ready for a partial lunar eclipse and supermoon, all rolled into one. The spectacle will be visible in clear skies across North America and South America Tuesday night and in Africa and Europe Wednesday morning. A partial lunar eclipse happens when the Earth passes between the sun and moon, casting a shadow that darkens a sliver of the moon and appears to take a bite out of it. Since the moon will inch closer to Earth than usual, it'll appear a bit larger in the sky. The supermoon is one of three remaining this year. 'A little bit of the sun's light is being blocked so the moon will be slightly dimmer,' said Valerie Rapson, an astronomer at the State University of New York at Oneonta. The Earth, moon and sun line up to produce a solar or lunar eclipse anywhere from four to seven times a year, according to NASA. This lunar eclipse is the second and final of the year after a slight darkening in March. In April, a total solar eclipse plunged select cities into darkness across North America. No special eye protection is needed to view a lunar eclipse. Viewers can stare at the moon with the naked eye or opt for binoculars and telescopes to get a closer look. To spot the moon's subtle shrinkage over time, hang outside for a few hours or take multiple peeks over the course of the evening, said KaChun Yu, curator at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. 'From one minute to the next, you might not see much happening,' said Yu. For a more striking lunar sight, skywatchers can set their calendars for March 13. The moon will be totally eclipsed by the Earth's shadow and will be painted red by stray bits of sunlight filtering through Earth's atmosphere.	https://www.voanews.com/a/partial-lunar-eclipse-will-be-visible-during-september-s-supermoon-/7788213.html	2024-09-17T15:13:35-07:00	
Tariffs in U.S.-China trade war may impact U.S. consumers, experts say	The Biden and Trump administrations have accused China of unfair trade practices and flooding international markets with artificially cheap goods. Analysts say both presidential candidates are using tariffs to counter China and encourage U.S. manufacturing jobs.

Iranian president pledges deeper ties with Moscow, state media says	Moscow — Iran's president committed his country to deeper ties with Russia to counter Western sanctions on Tuesday, state media reported, amid U.S. worries that Tehran is supplying Moscow missiles to hit Ukraine. Russia's top security official Sergei Shoigu arrived in the Iranian capital days after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang. More than two and a half years into its conflict with Ukraine, Moscow has been seeking to develop ties with the two nations, both hostile to the United States. 'My government will seriously follow ongoing cooperation and measures to upgrade the level of relations between the two countries,' the state IRNA news agency quoted Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian as telling Shoigu, Secretary of Russia's Security Council. 'Relations between Tehran and Moscow will develop in a permanent, continuous and lasting way. Deepening and strengthening relations and cooperation between Iran and Russia will reduce the impact of sanctions.' The United States views Moscow's growing relationships with Pyongyang and Tehran with concern and says both are supplying Russia with ballistic missiles for use in the conflict in Ukraine. Iran has denied sending ballistic missiles to Russia. Moscow has said only that Iran is Russia's partner in all possible areas. Shoigu's trips are taking place at a crucial moment in the war, as Kyiv presses the United States and its allies to let it use Western-supplied long-range weapons to strike targets such as airfields deep inside Russian territory. President Vladimir Putin said last week that Western countries would be fighting Russia directly if they gave the green light, and that Moscow would respond. The Nour news agency, affiliated to Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said Shoigu met his Iranian opposite number, Ali Akbar Ahmadian. There was no immediate information on the outcome of the meeting. Russia has repeatedly said it is close to signing a major agreement with Iran to seal a strategic partnership between the two countries. Shoigu was Russian defense minister until May, when he was appointed secretary of the Security Council that brings together President Vladimir Putin's military and intelligence chiefs and other senior officials. Apart from meeting North Korea's Kim last week, he also held talks in St. Petersburg with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iranian-president-pledges-deeper-ties-with-moscow-state-media-says/7788086.html	2024-09-17T12:51:14-07:00	
Myanmar diaspora protests at Chinese Embassy in Washington	Washington — More than 50 Burmese Americans gathered in front of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, protesting China's alleged interference in Myanmar's internal affairs. The protest on Saturday, part of a global campaign, called on China to withdraw its support for Myanmar's military junta and respect the will of the people, who have been fighting for democracy since the February 2021 coup. The protest — with demonstrators waving banners that read 'Reject Junta's Sham Elections' and 'Solidarity With the People of Myanmar' — was sparked by a statement released earlier Saturday by the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar, saying that China was not interfering in the country's affairs and would continue to promote peace and stability. 'We reject the Chinese Embassy's statement that they're not interfering in Myanmar's internal matters,' said Yin Aye, a protest leader who has been organizing demonstrations in the Washington area since the 2021 coup. 'If they would stop supporting sham elections and truly pressure the military to stop causing so much pain to our people, we might believe them.' Yin Aye referred to China's close ties with Myanmar's military junta and its alleged interference in the operations of ethnic resistance forces in northern Shan State, actions that have drawn widespread criticism from Burmese and pro-democracy groups. On August 29, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, or TNLA, an armed ethnic group fighting against the junta in northeastern Myanmar, said it had received a letter from Chinese authorities in the border town of Ruili warning the group to halt its offensive in northern Shan State, where key Belt and Road Initiative projects are located, or face consequences. Hla Kyaw Zaw, a veteran observer of China-Myanmar relations, said China's recent actions, particularly its warning to the TNLA, have sparked outrage among the Myanmar public, who view it as a direct threat to ethnic resistance forces fighting for democracy. 'The language used in the letter was undiplomatic and threatening,' Hla Kyaw Zaw told VOA’s Burmese Service. A spokesperson for the TNLA told VOA that Chinese authorities had warned the group in the letter to stop fighting, maintain stability along the China-Myanmar border and protect Chinese citizens. The letter warned that failure to comply would result in China 'teaching them a lesson' and holding the group responsible for any consequences. When asked about the letter at a regular press briefing in late August, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Liu Jian did not confirm or deny Beijing had sent the letter. 'China is closely following the situation in Myanmar and the developments of the conflict in northern Myanmar and has been working to promote peacetalks and ceasefire,' spokesperson Liu Jian said. 'As Myanmar’s biggest neighboring country, China has all along sincerely hoped that Myanmar will achieve stability and development and has worked actively to this end.' Since then, members of the Myanmar diaspora have intensified protests outside Chinese embassies worldwide, accusing China of supporting Myanmar's military coup. Protests worldwide Saturday's protest in Washington was part of a series of coordinated demonstrations by Burmese diaspora communities worldwide. In July, activists in Washington, New York, San Francisco, London and Tokyo protested outside Chinese embassies and consulates. In the July protest in Washington, protesters attempted to hand deliver an open letter to Chinese authorities, urging Beijing to halt its support for Myanmar's military junta. However, the letter went unanswered. 'When we handed the letter to the Chinese embassy here in D.C., they refused to accept it. They didn't even acknowledge our demands,' said Yin Aye. Activists were instructed to send the letter by post, but previous attempts to mail similar letters to the Chinese Embassy were returned undelivered. Despite the lack of formal response, Myanmar activists say the Chinese Embassy in Washington has been monitoring their protest activities in recent weeks. 'Now, we see them videotaping our protests,' Yin Aye said. Voice of America reached out to the Chinese embassies in Washington and Yangon for comment about the protests but did not receive a response by the time of publication. War crimes allegations The Myanmar diaspora argues that China's support for Myanmar's military is not only undermining the will of the people but also enabling war crimes, including aerial bombardments and the targeting of internally displaced persons. Minmin Berwald, an activist of Myanmar descent, was compelled to participate in the protest on Saturday. 'I want to ask China to immediately stop supporting this military regime and interfering in Burma's internal affairs,' Berwald said. 'It's not just homes being set on fire. Internally displaced people who have fled war are being bombarded.' China's contradictory stance China has maintained a complex position toward Myanmar since the February 2021 coup, balancing its own interests with regional stability, Hla Kyaw Zaw said. She noted that China has sent high officials to Myanmar, called for peace in the country and sponsored mediating talks between the junta and the armed ethnic groups. After the coup, however, China's official Xinhua news agency described the military's takeover and replacement of elected ministers as a 'major cabinet reshuffle,' avoiding the use of the term 'coup.' Beijing called for all parties in Myanmar to 'resolve their differences' and refrained from condemning the military. In 2022, China also abstained from voting on U.N. Security Council Resolution 2669, which called for an end to violence in Myanmar. However, critics argue that China's actions on the ground suggest deeper involvement. A veteran China-Myanmar affairs expert in Yangon, who requested anonymity for security reasons, said China's statements often appear contradictory. 'It's clear that China wants to control the situation to its advantage,' the expert said, referring to China's public calls for peace while its actions suggest otherwise. China, for its part, has denied interfering in Myanmar's internal affairs on multiple occasions. In its statement Saturday, the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar reiterated its position of noninterference and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The embassy also condemned what it called 'unjustified accusations' from individuals and media. The fight continues Protesters also called for China to take a more active role in cutting off support to Myanmar's junta, including halting the supply of jet fuel used in airstrikes against civilians. Amnesty International has documented multiple cases of the Myanmar military using airpower to target civilian areas, and activists argue that China's continued engagement with the junta implicates them in these atrocities. For now, the protesters have vowed to keep returning to the Chinese Embassy in Washington. 'We will continue to protest, continue to speak out,' said Yin Aye.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-diaspora-protests-at-chinese-embassy-in-washington/7788046.html	2024-09-17T12:33:41-07:00	
Zimbabwe starts providing free treatment for women with obstetric fistula	Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe — Zimbabwe's government has given in to pressure from rights groups and is now providing free treatment to women with obstetric fistula, a condition that makes it hard for mothers who went through difficult labor to control their bowels. For a closer look, VOA visited Chinhoyi, a farming and mining area about 150 kilometers west of Harare, where early marriages are common, and where the treatment is being offered. Among the first beneficiaries of the treatment were young women at Chinhoyi Provincial Hospital after government gynecologists had performed surgery to address their cases of obstetric fistula. Twenty-three-year old Chiedza, not her real name as she requested that VOA protect her identity, was visibly happy as she had not been able to control her bowels since giving birth to her son seven years ago. 'When I gave birth I tore my private parts, so I couldn’t hold my feces,' she said. 'It would just come out on its own. I would just feel something on my body flowing. I stayed like that because I did not have money to seek services of gynecologists to correct my condition. So, when I heard about this free service on a WhatsApp group for women, I called a toll-free number which was there and I came here. So I am now going to live a comfortable life. I can now perform even house chores comfortably.' Another woman who asked to be called Tendai ruptured her bladder after protracted labor at home while giving birth at the age of 16. 'I would share nappies with my baby so as to block my smell from others,' she said. 'At one time I almost committed suicide because people kept on laughing at my condition. I thought I had been bewitched till I came here and saw that there are some people in my condition. I am grateful for this procedure for it has given me hope.' The World Health Organization estimates that between 50,000 and 100,000 women experience obstetric fistula every year and that about 2 million women in sub-Saharan Africa are living with the condition. Dr. Stanley Ngwaru, a senior gynecologist in Zimbabwe’s ministry of health, says the condition is an abnormal communication between the woman's genital tract and the urinary tract or the rectum. 'They suffer shame and they suffer social segregation,' he said. 'It's very common in young women, because the genital tract is not well developed and when they go into labor, they are more likely to suffer from obstruction and this can lead to these communications are developing between the genital tract and the unit tract and the rectum.' Lucia Masuka, head of Amnesty International in Zimbabwe, says she commends the government for offering the free service. However, she believes authorities needs to develop a strategy to help prevent this condition from afflicting young women in the first place. 'If we therefore facilitate access to sexual reproductive health services for this group, it will reduce instances of early pregnancies, and in turn, reduce cases of obstetrics fistula,' she said. 'Whilst treatment is a positive development, it's akin to trying to mop water from an open tap; you will never really be able to mop that water as long as the tap is open.' Amnesty International in Zimbabwe last year pleaded with parliament to push the government to make obstetric fistula treatment a national issue after its research had revealed that the condition was rampant among young women in Zimbabwe and was not getting enough attention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-starts-providing-free-treatment-for-women-with-obstetric-fistula/7788024.html	2024-09-17T11:57:36-07:00	
Pentagon inspector general: Ukraine is 'job one' for defense oversight	Washington — Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. Congress has appropriated $174 billion, including U.S. weapons and materiel, to respond to the crisis and help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s aggression. U.S. Department of Defense Inspector General Robert Storch calls the oversight of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine his office’s 'job one,' with more than 200 people assigned to that task. In an interview with Voice of America’s Ukrainian Service, Storch discussed the challenges in obtaining the information necessary for such oversight in a country that is fighting a war, suffers from endemic corruption and has no large-scale U.S. military presence. According to the most recent quarterly Special Inspector General report to the U.S. Congress on Operation Atlantic Resolve (the name of the U.S. military response to Russian operations in Ukraine), issued in mid-August, there were 57 open investigations as of June 30, 2024. They involved 'grant and procurement fraud, corruption, theft, program irregularities, and diversion and counter-proliferation of technology of weapons systems components.' In January, Ukraine’s SBU security service reported that it had uncovered a $40 million corruption scheme, implicating defense ministry officials and arms supplier managers, that involved the embezzlement of funds for purchase of 100,000 mortar shells. That case did not involve U.S.-provided materiel. However, in September 2023, Oleksii Reznikov was removed as Ukraine’s defense minister 'over various corruption cases despite enjoying a solid reputation in representing Ukraine in its discussions with Western allies,' Reuters reported. Storch told VOA that the Pentagon is working with Ukraine’s military to ensure that it provides timely and accurate information, and with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government to fight corruption. He said that in the days immediately following Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s armed forces were delinquent in providing information, but that the situation has improved, in part thanks to oversight. While corruption remains endemic in Ukraine, Storch said that Ukraine’s anti-corruption institutions are maturing and that the oversight community is working to ensure that such progress continues. The following has been edited for length and clarity. VOA: You are overseeing numerous Pentagon programs. How robust is oversight of the delivery of weapons to Ukraine? Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Defense Robert Storch: We are leading a robust, comprehensive oversight effort that really covers all aspects of U.S. assistance to Ukraine. I have responsibility over the security assistance that's provided, and we partner very closely, hand-in-glove, with our great colleagues from the State Department Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Agency for International Development Office of Inspector General to make sure we're covering all aspects of humanitarian or other assistance that's being provided to Ukraine. VOA: How large is your team that is overseeing the Ukrainian program? Storch: We have a lot of things pulling at us and lots going on in the world with the Department of Defense. But Ukraine is very much job one. I always say it's really a matter of the highest priority for my office and for my colleagues’ offices as well. So, in the case of the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, we have over 200 people who are engaged in one aspect or another of oversight over U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. That includes about 30 people who were forward deployed in the region. We have several offices in Germany. We have folks in Poland. And we have both investigators and programmatic oversight personnel at the [U.S.] Embassy in Kyiv. If you take all of our partners from State and AID in oversight entities, it is between 300 and 400 people who are engaged in oversight in this whole-of-government effort. VOA: When you talk to Ukrainian officials, do they appreciate the importance of reporting? Storch: Without exception, they acknowledge the importance of making sure that we get the information we need to be able to do our oversight to make sure there's accountability, and frankly to be able to tell the decision-makers here in Washington that that's going on. … I go up to the Hill [Capitol Hill, location of the U.S. Congress] not infrequently. And you know, I'm not a policymaker. It's up to the administration and the Congress to set what the policies are. But one of the things I get asked all the time is, ‘Are we getting the information we need to carry out our work?’ and we have been getting that, and we're going to work to make sure we continue to. VOA: The Pentagon transfers materiel to the Ukrainian armed forces. Do they understand the importance of oversight, and do they provide timely self-reporting? Storch: We work really closely to make sure that's the case. That's one of the big lines of effort with regard to our oversight. We've done a number of reports looking at the monitoring and the reporting. There are obligations that the Ukrainian armed forces have for reporting on the status of the equipment, and U.S. personnel keep track and there's a database. When things are lost or destroyed, they have to be reported in a certain way. … [T]hat's one area where I like to think that our oversight has really made a difference. When we first started on that, the level of delinquency in that reporting was really pretty high, and some of that was because, when the war started, the U.S. personnel had to leave the country. There was equipment being provided and really no one doing that sort of accountability and inventory. So, a lot of it has been playing catch-up. And … there are challenges with a wartime setting and a lot of this equipment is being used on the front lines and [in] really difficult and sad situations. And so being able to maintain accountability is difficult, but we do a lot of work on that. VOA: In one of your reports, you mentioned endemic corruption in Ukraine. You worked in Ukraine in 2007 to 2009 to help the country overcome corruption. Can you compare the situation in Ukraine now to what you saw back then? Storch: I actually had the opportunity to work and live in Ukraine back in 2007 to 2009, when I was with the Department of Justice working with the Ukrainians to help them develop measures to address official corruption. And I had the opportunity to go back on a number of occasions and provide assistance in the drafting of the anti-corruption legislation, and that created the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Office of the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor, so I have had a lot of experience out there and have seen the way these institutions have matured. The Ukrainians made it happen ... But Ukraine has had long-standing issues with corruption, obviously, and people are working to address it. One of the things we talk about in our quarterly reporting … is that they're continuing to make efforts to address it, and we continue as the United States both to provide assistance in that, and then, in the oversight community, to do oversight over that to make sure that progress is being made. VOA: Your report mentions that there are 57 investigations ongoing into allegations ranging from irregularities in procurement to corruption, diversion and theft. Have any of those allegations been substantiated? Storch: At this point, based on our completed work, we haven't substantiated those allegations, but obviously the investigations continue, right? VOA: About half of the allegations involve the proliferation of weapons. How high is the risk of diversion? Storch: Sure, there's a significant risk there, but we always want to make sure we're doing everything we can to address it, and that's why I mention the programmatic oversight. We have a website [with] links to the hotlines that my office and our counterparts operate. I really encourage folks to take advantage of that to report that information. So, people can look into it. VOA: There is reporting that the Pentagon overestimated the value of some of the U.S. equipment destined for Ukraine. Do you think this accounting error will persist or is it being corrected? Storch: We're doing everything we can to help the [Defense] Department to address it. We became concerned about that pretty early on and consulted with the department about it and, without getting too complex, basically the department was using a methodology to value the materiel that was being provided that resulted in an overvaluation of it. If you were donating your car, you probably wouldn't be able to donate the cost of buying a new car like that, right? It's a little more complicated than that, but basically it resulted in an overvaluation. Initially the Department looking into it found about $6.2 billion that they thought was overstated. We came in and did additional oversight, which is reflected in our reporting, and found about $1.9 billion additionally. So, the answer to your question is we made recommendations to help the Department address the issues, and we're going to keep working to make sure those recommendations are carried out and the problems addressed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-inspector-general-ukraine-is-job-one-for-defense-oversight/7787995.html	2024-09-17T11:57:25-07:00

US court upholds British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking conviction	new york — A U.S. court on Tuesday upheld disgraced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction on sex trafficking charges for helping the late financier Jeffrey Epstein abuse underage girls. Maxwell's lawyers had argued that her convictions violated an agreement Epstein reached with federal prosecutors 15 years ago and violated the statute of limitations. They also cited judicial error and a miscalculation of the federal sentencing guidelines range as reason to reject her conviction and sentence. But the ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Epstein's non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors in Florida didn't bar federal prosecutors in New York from bringing a case. They also found that Maxwell's indictment was within the statute of limitations. Maxwell, 62, was found guilty in December 2021 of luring young girls to Epstein so he could molest them, between 1994 and 2004. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2022. Epstein sexually abused children hundreds of times over more than a decade, exploiting vulnerable girls as young as 14. Prosecutors said Maxwell, his longtime companion, helped him and made the abuse possible. He killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial. Epstein and Maxwell's associations with royals, presidents and billionaires were not a prominent part of her trial but mentions of friends such as Bill Clinton and Donald Trump showed how the pair exploited their connections to impress their prey. The trial revolved around allegations from only a handful of Epstein's accusers. Four testified that they were abused in the 1990s and early 2000s at Epstein's mansions in Florida, New York, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands. Maxwell is serving her sentence at a low-security federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-court-upholds-british-socialite-ghislaine-maxwell-s-sex-trafficking-conviction-/7787757.html	2024-09-17T09:39:55-07:00	
Dozens wounded after pagers detonate in Lebanon, media and security officials say	BEIRUT — Dozens of people were wounded in Beirut's suburbs and other parts of Lebanon after their handheld pagers exploded Tuesday, Lebanese state media and security officials said. A senior military intelligence official and an official with a Lebanese group with knowledge of the situation, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said that pagers carried by Hezbollah members were detonated. The second official said it was believed to be an Israeli attack. The state-run National News Agency reported that in Beirut's southern suburbs and other areas 'the handheld pagers system was detonated using advanced technology, and dozens of injuries were reported.' It wasn't immediately clear if people were killed. A Hezbollah official said that at least 150 people, including members of the group, were wounded in different parts of Lebanon when the pagers they were carrying exploded. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said the explosions were the result of 'a security operation that targeted the devices.' 'The enemy (Israel) stands behind this security incident,' the official said, without elaborating. He added that the new pagers that Hezbollah members were carrying had lithium batteries that apparently exploded. Lithium batteries, when overheated, can smoke, melt and even catch on fire. The Associated Press reached out to the Israeli military and they declined to comment. The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between Lebanon and Israel. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces have been clashing near-daily for more than 11 months against the backdrop of war between Israel and Hezbollah ally Hamas in Gaza. The clashes have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. Photos and videos from Beirut's southern suburbs circulating on social media and in local media showed people lying on the pavement with wounds on their hands or near their pants pockets. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah previously warned the group's members not to carry cellphones, saying that they could be used by Israel to track their movements and to carry out targeted strikes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-wounded-after-pagers-detonate-in-lebanon-media-and-security-officials-say-/7787548.html	2024-09-17T07:30:21-07:00	
Facebook owner Meta bans Russia state media outlets over 'foreign interference'	London — Meta said it's banning Russia state media organization from its social media platforms, alleging that the outlets used deceptive tactics to amplify Moscow's propaganda. The announcement drew a rebuke from the Kremlin on Tuesday. The company, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, said late Monday that it will roll out the ban over the next few days in an escalation of its efforts to counter Russia's covert influence operations. 'After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets: Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity,' Meta said in a prepared statement. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov lashed out, saying that 'such selective actions against Russian media are unacceptable,' and that 'Meta with these actions are discrediting themselves.' 'We have an extremely negative attitude towards this. And this, of course, complicates the prospects for normalizing our relations with Meta,' Peskov told reporters during his daily conference call. RT was formerly known as Russia Today. Rossiya Segodnya is the parent company behind state news agency RIA Novosti and news brands like Sputnik. 'It's cute how there's a competition in the West — who can try to spank RT the hardest, in order to make themselves look better,' RT said in a release. Rossiya Segodnya did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Meta's actions comes days after the United States announced new sanctions on RT, accusing the Kremlin news outlet of being a key part of Russia's war machine and its efforts to undermine its democratic adversaries. U.S. officials alleged last week that RT was working hand-in-hand with the Russian military and running fundraising campaigns to pay for sniper rifles, body armor and other equipment for soldiers fighting in Ukraine. They also said RT websites masqueraded as legitimate news sites but were used to spread disinformation and propaganda in Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere. Earlier this month, the Biden administration seized Kremlin-run websites and charged two RT employees of covertly providing millions of dollars in funding to a Tennessee-based content creation company to publish English-language social media videos pushing pro-Kremlin messages. Moscow has rejected the allegations. Meta had already taken steps to limit Moscow's online reach. Since 2020 it has been labeling posts and content from state media. Two years later, it blocked state media from running ads and putting their content lower in people's feeds, and the company, along with other other social media sites like YouTube and TikTok, blocked RT's channels for European users. Also in 2022 Meta also took down a sprawling Russia-based disinformation network spreading Kremlin talking points about the invasion of Ukraine. Meta and Facebook 'already blocked RT in Europe two years ago, now they're censoring information flow to the rest of the world,' RT said in its statement. Moscow has fought back, designating Meta as an extremist group in March 2022, shortly after sending troops into Ukraine, and blocking Facebook and Instagram. Both platforms — as well as Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter, which is also blocked — were popular with Russians before the invasion and the subsequent crackdown on independent media and other forms of critical speech. The social media platforms are now only accessible through virtual private networks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/facebook-owner-meta-bans-russia-state-media-outlets-over-foreign-interference-/7787477.html	2024-09-17T06:48:43-07:00	
French man admits to drugging wife so he and dozens of men could rape her	AVIGNON, France — A 71-year-old French man acknowledged in court on Tuesday that over nearly a decade, he was drugging his wife at the time and inviting dozens of men to rape her, as well as raping her himself. He pleaded with her and their three children for forgiveness. 'Today I maintain that, along with the other men here, I am a rapist,' Dominique Pelicot told the court. 'They knew everything. They can't say otherwise.' Pelicot's testimony is the most important moment so far in a trial that has shocked and gripped France and raised awareness about sexual violence. Many also hope his testimony will shed some light — to try to understand the unthinkable. While he previously confessed to investigators, the court testimony will be crucial for the panel of judges to decide on the fate of some 50 other men standing trial alongside him. Many deny having raped Gisele Pelicot, saying they were manipulated by her then-husband or claiming they believed she was consenting. Gisele Pelicot has become a symbol of the fight against sexual violence in France for agreeing to waive her anonymity in the case, letting the trial be public and appearing openly in front of the media. She is expected to speak in court after her ex-husband's testimony on Tuesday. Under French law, the proceedings inside the courtroom cannot be filmed or photographed. Dominique Pelicot is brought to the court through a special entrance inaccessible for the media, because he and some other defendants are being held in custody during the trial. Defendants who are not in custody come to the trial wearing surgical masks or hoods to avoid having their faces filmed or photographed. After days of uncertainty due to his medical state, Dominique Pelicot appeared in court Tuesday and told judges he acknowledged all the charges against him. His much-awaited testimony was delayed by days after he fell ill, suffering from a kidney stone and urinary infection, his lawyers said. Seated in a wheelchair, Pelicot spoke to the court for an hour, from his early life to years of abuse against his now ex-wife. Expressing remorse, his voice trembling and at times barely audible, he sought to explain events that he said scarred his childhood and planted the seed of vice in him. 'One is not born a pervert; one becomes a pervert,' Pelicot told judges, after recounting, sometimes in tears, being raped by a male nurse in a hospital when he was 9 years old and then being forced to take part in a gang rape at age 14. Pelicot also spoke of the trauma endured when his parents took a young girl in the family, and witnessing his father's inappropriate behavior toward her. 'My father used to do the same thing with the little girl,'' he said. 'After my father's death, my brother said that men used to come to our house.' At 14, he said, he asked his mother if he could leave the house, but 'she didn't let me.' 'I don't really want to talk about this, I am just ashamed of my father. In the end, I didn't do any better,' he said. Asked about his feelings toward his wife, Pelicot said she did not deserve what he did. 'From my youth, I remember only shocks and traumas, forgotten partly thanks to her. She did not deserve this, I acknowledge it,' he said in tears. At that moment, Gisele Pelicot, standing across the room, facing him across a group of dozens of defendants sitting in between them, put her sunglasses back on. Later, Dominique Pelicot said, 'I was crazy about her. She replaced everything. I ruined everything.' A security agent caught Pelicot in 2020 filming videos under women's skirts in a supermarket, according to court documents. Police searched Pelicot's house and electronic devices and found thousands of photos and videos of men engaging in sexual acts with Gisele Pelicot while she appears to lie unconscious on their bed. With the recordings, police were able to track down a majority of the 72 suspects they were seeking. Gisele Pelicot and her husband of 50 years had three children. When they retired, the couple left the Paris region to move into a house in Mazan, a small town in Provence. When police officers called her in for questioning in late 2020, she initially told them her husband was 'a great guy,' according to legal documents. They then showed her some photos. She left her husband, and they are now divorced. He faces 20 years in prison if convicted. Besides Pelicot, 50 other men, ages 26 to 74, are standing trial.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-man-admits-to-drugging-wife-so-he-and-dozens-of-men-could-rape-her/7787468.html	2024-09-17T06:47:31-07:00	
Sean 'Diddy' Combs arrested; indictment expected to be unsealed	NEW YORK — Sean 'Diddy' Combs was expected to appear before a federal judge in New York on Tuesday after his indictment on undisclosed criminal charges. The music mogul was arrested late Monday in Manhattan, roughly six months after federal authorities conducting a sex trafficking investigation raided his luxurious homes in Los Angeles and Miami. The indictment detailing the charges was expected to be unsealed Tuesday morning, according to U.S. Attorney Damian Williams. Over the past year, Combs has been sued by people who say he subjected them to physical or sexual abuse. He has denied many of those allegations and his lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, called the new indictment an 'unjust prosecution.' 'He is an imperfect person, but he is not a criminal,' Agnifilo said in a statement late Monday. Combs, 54, was recognized as one of the most influential figures in hip-hop before a flood of allegations that emerged over the past year turned him into an industry pariah. In November, his former girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, filed a lawsuit saying he had beaten and raped her for years. She accused Combs of coercing her and others into unwanted sex in drug-fueled settings. The suit was settled in one day, but months later CNN aired hotel security footage showing Combs punching and kicking Cassie and throwing her on the floor. After the video aired, Combs apologized, saying, 'I was disgusted when I did it.' Combs and his attorneys, however, denied similar allegations made by others in a string of lawsuits. Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for Cassie, said in a statement Tuesday that 'neither Ms. Ventura nor I have any comment. We appreciate your understanding and if that changes, we will certainly let you know.' A woman said Combs raped her two decades ago when she was 17. A music producer sued, saying Combs forced him to have sex with prostitutes. Another woman, April Lampros, said Combs subjected her to 'terrifying sexual encounters,' starting when she was a college student in 1994. The AP does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie and Lampros did. Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Records, has gotten out of legal trouble before. In 2001, he was acquitted of charges related to a Manhattan nightclub shooting two years earlier that injured three people. His then-protege, Shyne, was convicted of assault and other charges and served about eight years in prison.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sean-diddy-combs-arrested-indictment-expected-to-be-unsealed/7787440.html	2024-09-17T06:19:22-07:00

US boosts military ties with Southeast Asian countries	The United States has deepened its cooperation with allies in the Indo-Pacific region in recent years, including Japan and South Korea. But it has also reached out to non-allies, including non-aligned countries of Southeast Asia like Indonesia. VOA's Virginia Gunawan reports. Camera: Ahadian Utama, Hafizh Sahadeva.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-boosts-military-ties-with-southeast-asian-countries/7787394.html	2024-09-17T05:43:05-07:00	
Analysts say Vietnam official's US trip could set path to C-130 deal	HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam — Analysts say this week’s visit to Washington by Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang shows advances in cooperation between the two countries, despite rising Vietnamese nationalism that may indicate rising anti-American sentiment in Vietnam. A U.S.-based analyst told VOA on September 12 that Giang’s trip set the groundwork for Hanoi to potentially purchase military cargo planes from the United States this year. Giang met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon on Monday. [September 9] Both leaders 'reaffirmed the importance of the U.S.-Vietnam partnership,' the Defense Department said in a statement, and noted the one-year anniversary of the elevation of the countries’ ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest tier in Hanoi's diplomatic hierarchy. The leaders also underscored the importance of working together to address the lasting impacts of the U.S.-Vietnam War. Austin announced that the U.S. would budget $65 million over the next five years to complete the decontamination of Bien Hoa airbase of dioxin, bringing the total from department to $215 million. The airbase was the primary storage site for the toxic chemical Agent Orange during the U.S.-Vietnam War and remains an environmental and public health hazard for those nearby. Andrew Wells-Dang, who leads the Vietnam War Legacies and Reconciliation Initiative at the United States Institute of Peace, told VOA by phone on September 5 that diplomatic visits are key to advancing war-remediation efforts, including finding and identifying the remains of missing soldiers. He said that along with the U.S. visit of Deputy Defense Minister Vo Minh Luong in July, visits from authorities provide 'opportunity for them to have high level support.' Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington and an expert on Southeast Asia, said joint war-reconciliation efforts also set the groundwork for defense cooperation more broadly. 'The United States is very pleased with the growth in bilateral defense relations, and it started from very low levels and was built on humanitarian missions,' Abuza said during the August 29 call. 'We've just continued to build on that,' he added. Cargo planes Reuters reported in July that Hanoi was considering purchasing Lockheed Martin C-130 cargo planes from the U.S., according to unnamed sources. The U.S.-based analyst, who asked that his name to be withheld because he has not been cleared to discuss the topic, said the C-130 deal was discussed but not finalized during Giang's visit. The analyst said the deal was held back by the 'massive [U.S.] bureaucracy' and because solidifying the purchase during the Washington visit would be 'too inflammatory for the Chinese.' Ian Storey, senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, noted Vietnam's delicate diplomatic balancing act, illustrated by Giang's travel itinerary before the Washington trip. 'Vietnam aims to keep its relations with the major powers in balance,' he wrote in an email on August 30. 'As such, Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang visited Russia and China in August.' Storey added that the purchase of C-130 planes would not pose a threat to China in its maritime territorial disputes with Vietnam. 'C-130 aircraft would enable the Vietnamese to transport troops and supplies to its occupied atolls in the South China Sea, but these assets are non-strategic and won't shift the dynamics in the South China Sea,' he wrote. Nguyen The Phuong, a maritime security expert at the University of New South Wales Canberra, said the C-130 purchase would be a 'symbolic move.' 'Vietnam will try to explore more areas of security and defense cooperation between Vietnam and the United States to upgrade to a higher, more meaningful level,' he told VOA on August 30. 'The C-130 would be the symbol of that kind of evolving relationship,' he said. Phuong said a C-130 is a likely entry point as there is still mistrust between the former foes regarding lethal weapons, and the deal would not rankle China too much. 'It could be quite advantageous for Vietnam,' he said of a potential C-130 purchase. 'Vietnam can improve its relationship with the United States, and at the same time, we could not anger China because Vietnam would just buy non-lethal weapons.' Rising nationalism Although there are positive signs to improving Hanoi-Washington relations, there have also been recent instances of anti-Western sentiment that could be an impediment to the countries relations, Phuong said. Fulbright University Vietnam, which has significant backing from the United States, is facing accusations of fomenting a 'color revolution,' similar to the popular uprisings in former Soviet republics. On August 21, Vietnam National Defense TV aired a critique of Fulbright for allegedly not displaying the Vietnamese flag at a graduation ceremony and facilitating a color revolution. The report has since been taken down, but Phuong said the Fulbright issue and other recent incidents show tension between Vietnam's conservative and liberal factions. 'It's a presentation of a continuous struggle between different factions, one conservative and one liberal,' Phuong said. Abuza said that Vietnamese authorities may be attempting to tighten control ahead of the anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. 'Next April is the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon,' he said. 'The Vietnamese want to control that narrative 100%. There are a lot of sensitivities.' Along with the Fulbright incident, Phuong pointed to recent uproar around Vietnamese celebrities who were pictured with the South Vietnam flag while traveling to the United States. In addition, a Vietnamese high school student faced cyber bullying and was summoned by police after posting in September that he wanted to leave the country and would 'probably never see the [Communist] Party positively again.' 'There's extreme nationalism in Vietnam at the moment,' Phuong said. 'It's against Western values.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-say-vietnam-officials-us-trip-could-set-path-to-c-130-deal/7782903.html	2024-09-17T05:25:29-07:00	
China says it tailed a US spy plane through the sensitive Taiwan Strait	TAIPEI, Taiwan — Chinese warplanes tailed a U.S. military aircraft through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Tuesday, China's military said. The U.S. aircraft was a P-8A Poseidon patrol and reconnaissance plane, capable of conducting long-range anti-submarine warfare, according to a statement by the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command. Chinese military forces 'organized warplanes to tail and monitor the U.S. aircraft's flight and handled it in accordance with the law,' said Li Xi, a senior colonel and spokesperson for the command. 'Theater command troops will remain on constant high alert and resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and security as well as regional peace and stability,' he added. The U.S. Navy didn't immediately comment on the incident. China claims the self-ruled island of Taiwan as its own territory and bristles at other countries' patrolling the body of water separating it from the island. On Friday, Germany sailed two warships through the Taiwan Strait in its first transit of the disputed waters in more than two decades, drawing criticism from Beijing. In 2001, a U.S. surveillance plane and a Chinese navy fighter collided mid-air near the Chinese island province of Hainan, resulting in the Chinese pilot's death. The U.S. said its plane was in international airspace and the accident was the result of reckless flying by the Chinese side.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-tailed-a-us-spy-plane-through-the-sensitive-taiwan-strait-/7787330.html	2024-09-17T04:44:12-07:00	
Casualties in Myanmar push Southeast Asia's death toll from Typhoon Yagi past 500	BANGKOK — Floods and landslides in Myanmar triggered by last week’s Typhoon Yagi and seasonal monsoon rains have claimed at least 226 lives, with 77 people missing, state-run media reported Tuesday. The new figures push the total number of dead in Southeast Asia from the storm past 500. The accounting of casualties has been slow, in part due to communication difficulties with the affected areas. Myanmar is wracked by a civil war that began in 2021 after the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Independent analysts believe the ruling military controls much less than half of the country’s territory. Typhoon Yagi earlier hit Vietnam, northern Thailand and Laos, killing almost 300 people in Vietnam, 42 in Thailand and four in Laos, according to the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance. It said 21 people were killed in the Philippines, with another 26 missing. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said on Monday that an estimated 631,000 people may have been affected by flooding across Myanmar. There were already 3.4 million displaced people in Myanmar at the beginning of September, according to the U.N. refugee agency, mostly because of war and unrest in recent years. Heavy rains from the typhoon and the seasonal monsoon brought widespread flash floods to Myanmar, especially the central regions of Mandalay, Magway, Bago and the Ayeyarwaddy Delta; the eastern states Shan, Kayah, Kayin and Mon; and the country’s capital, Naypyitaw. Some flooded areas have started to see water levels recede but others in the Shan and Kayah states remain critical. More than 160,000 houses have been damaged and 438 temporary relief camps have been opened for more than 160,000 flood victims, Myanma Alinn reported. The military government announced that nearly 240,000 people have been displaced. Myanma Alinn said 117 government offices and buildings, 1,040 schools, 386 religious buildings, roads, bridges, power towers, and telecom towers were damaged by the floods in 56 townships. It also said nearly 130,000 animals were killed and more than 259,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged by the floods. The U.N.’s humanitarian affairs agency said food, drinking water, medicine, clothes, dignity kits, and shelters are urgent needs for the flood victims but alleviation efforts are hampered by blocked roads, damaged bridges and ongoing armed clashes. Vice Senior Gen. Soe Win, the second-ranking member of Myanmar’s ruling military council, said the country had received relief aid from other countries, and some humanitarian assistance from the Association of Southeast Asia, will arrive soon. Soe Win, speaking at a meeting of the National Disaster Management Committee on Monday, said that the extent of flooding in the capital was unprecedented, and cleaning and rehabilitation activities in the flooded areas began Thursday as the water level declined. Myanmar experiences extreme weather during the monsoon virtually every year. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis killed more than 138,000 people around the Irrawaddy River delta. The then-military government was harshly discredited when it delayed acceptance of outside aid. ​	https://www.voanews.com/a/casualties-in-myanmar-push-southeast-asia-s-death-toll-from-typhoon-yagi-past-500-/7787322.html	2024-09-17T04:32:32-07:00

Big Tech, calls for looser rules await new EU antitrust chief	Brussels — Teresa Ribera will have to square up to Big Tech, banks and airlines if confirmed as Europe's new antitrust chief, while juggling calls for looser rules to help create EU champions. Nominated Tuesday by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for the high-profile antitrust post, Ribera has been Spain's minister for ecological transition since 2018. The 55-year-old Spanish socialist, one of Europe's most ambitious policymakers on climate change, will have to secure European Parliament approval before taking up her post. As competition commissioner, she will be able to approve or veto multi-billion euro mergers or slap hefty fines on companies seeking to bolster their market power by throttling smaller rivals or illegally teaming up to fix prices. One of her biggest challenges will be to ensure that Amazon, Apple, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and Meta comply with landmark rules aimed at reining in their power and giving consumers more choice. Apple, Google and Meta are firmly in outgoing EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's crosshairs for falling short of complying with the Digital Markets Act. Another challenge will be how to deal with the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence amid concerns about Big Tech leveraging its existing dominance. Ribera may ramp up a crackdown on non-EU state subsidies begun by Vestager aimed at preventing foreign companies from acquiring EU businesses or taking part in EU public tenders with unfair state support. Recent rulings from Europe's highest court, which backed the Commission's $14.5 billion tax order to Apple, and its $2.7 billion antitrust fine against Google, could embolden Ribera to take a tough line against antitrust violations. That would mean she would be in no hurry to ease up on antitrust rules, despite Mario Draghi's call to boost EU industrial champions so that they are able to compete with U.S. and Chinese competitors. Ribera was also named on Tuesday as executive vice president of a clean, just and competitive energy transition, tasked with ensuring that Europe achieves its green goals. Her credentials include negotiating deals last year among EU countries on emissions limits for trucks and a contentious upgrade of EU power market rules.	https://www.voanews.com/a/big-tech-calls-for-looser-rules-await-new-eu-antitrust-chief-/7787303.html	2024-09-17T04:10:20-07:00

Jailed Iranian Nobel laureate urges action against oppression of women	PARIS — Jailed Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi on Monday urged the international community to act to end the oppression of women in Iran, two years after the start of a women-led protest movement. 'I call on international institutions and people around the world... to take active action,' she said in a letter written in Tehran's Evin prison on Saturday, and published by her foundation on Monday. 'I urge the United Nations to end its silence and inaction in the face of the devastating oppression and discrimination by theocratic and authoritarian governments against women by criminalizing gender apartheid,' she said. The 'Woman, Life, Freedom' protests were sparked by the death in custody of a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd called Mahsa Amini on September 16, 2022, after she was arrested for allegedly breaching the country's strict dress code for her gender. Mohammadi — who has campaigned against the compulsory wearing of the headscarf for women and the death penalty in Iran — has been in Tehran's Evin prison since November 2021. She has spent much of the past decade in and out of jail. On Sunday she was one of 34 women in the Evin prison to stage a 24-hour symbolic hunger strike on the second anniversary of the protest movement 'in solidarity with the protesting people of Iran, against the government's oppressive policies,' her foundation said. Mohammadi's children received the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf in 2023 while she was incarcerated. Since the Islamic revolution of 1979, women in Iran have to cover their hair and neck in public. The 'Woman, Life, Freedom' demonstrations were crushed by the authorities, with rights group Amnesty International saying security forces used assault rifles and shotguns in the crackdown. Human rights groups say at least 551 people were killed. Thousands more were arrested, according to the United Nations. But Mohammadi was defiant. 'Despite the challenging road ahead, we all know that nothing is as it was before,' she wrote. 'The people feel the greatest change in their beliefs, lives, and society. A change that, while it has not yet toppled the Islamic Republic regime, has shaken the foundations of religious tyranny.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jailed-iranian-nobel-laureate-urges-action-against-oppression-of-women/7787264.html	2024-09-17T03:01:57-07:00	
Venezuela ramped up repression after disputed vote, UN says	CARACAS/GENEVA — President Nicolas Maduro's government escalated repressive tactics to crush peaceful protests and keep power after Venezuela's disputed election in July, a U.N. report said on Tuesday. Electoral authorities awarded the vote to Maduro, without showing all tallies, but the opposition said its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez won by a landslide with counts proving that. More than two dozen people died in protests with 2,400 arrested. The U.N. fact-finding mission, which interviewed several hundred people remotely or in third countries as it is denied access to Venezuela, said authorities tried to dismantle the opposition, block independent information, and stop protests. 'We are facing a systematic, coordinated and deliberate repression by the Venezuelan government, which responds by a conscious plan to silence any form of dissent,' mission head Marta Valinas told journalists in Geneva. 'The government has instrumentalized the entire state apparatus, including especially the justice system, with a view to silencing any difference of opinion that opposes its scheme and to staying in power at any price.' According to the mission, 24 out of 25 deaths were caused by gunshot wounds, mostly to the neck. Arrests under the feared 'knock knock' operation - referring to the unexpected arrival at houses of government critics - often affected ordinary citizens in poor neighborhoods. The Maduro government has blamed right-wing, foreign-instigated 'extremists' and 'fascists' for the latest bout of violence in the South American oil producer that has seen waves of protests crushed during his more than decade-long rule. There was no immediate statement from Venezuelan authorities in response to the U.N. mission, which said it had tried to contact them for its investigation to no avail. The U.N. report said repression around the election was orchestrated from Maduro down and marked a new milestone in the deterioration of rule of law in Venezuela. 'The main public authorities abandoned all semblance of independence and openly deferred to the executive,' it said, noting that a climate of fear had been created. Allegations of disappearances, torture and other cruel treatment have increased since 2019, the report said. Opposition candidate Gonzalez has gone to Spain and requested asylum after a warrant was issued for his arrest in Venezuela. U.N.-mandated investigations do not have legally binding powers but the abuses they document are sometimes used in international courts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-ramped-up-repression-after-disputed-vote-un-says/7787258.html	2024-09-17T02:51:46-07:00	
COP29 leaders unveil climate funding and energy storage goals	LONDON — Less than two months ahead of the COP29 United Nations Climate Summit, the Azerbaijani leadership laid out its plans on Tuesday for what it hoped to achieve, as countries continue to wrestle with how to raise ambitions for a new financing target. The main task for the November summit is for countries to agree on a new annual target for funding that wealthy countries will pay to help poorer nations cope with climate change. Many developing countries say they cannot upgrade their targets to cut emissions faster without first receiving more financial support to invest in doing this. With countries remaining far from agreement on the financing goal, the COP29 presidency this week outlined more than a dozen side initiatives that could raise ambitions, but do not require party negotiation and building consensus which can hamper progress. These take the form of new funds, pledges, and declarations that national governments can adopt. Notably, this includes a fund with voluntary contributions from fossil fuel producing countries and companies for the public and private sectors working on climate issues, as well as grants that can be doled out to assist with climate-fueled natural disasters in developing countries. Such side agendas use 'the convening power of COP and the hosts’ respective national capabilities to form coalitions and drive progress,' said Mukhtar Babayev, who holds the rotating COP presidency, in a letter to all parties and stakeholders. Over 120 countries pledged at last year's COP28 summit in Dubai, for example, to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030. The COP29 presidency also hopes to build support around a pledge to increase global energy storage capacity six times above 2022 levels, reaching 1,500 gigawatts by 2030. This would include a commitment to scale up investments in energy grids, adding or refurbishing more than 80 million km by 2040. Babayev, who is Azerbaijan's minister of ecology and natural resources, said the agenda would 'help to enhance ambition by bringing stakeholders together around common principles and goals.' 'We hope to address some of the most pressing issues while also highlighting remaining priorities,' he said. Another declaration would see countries and companies create a global market for clean hydrogen, addressing regulatory, technological, financing and standardization barriers. COP29 leaders have also appealed for a 'COP Truce' that would highlight the importance of peace and climate action. Despite countries' existing climate commitments, carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels hit a record high last year, and the world just registered its hottest summer on record as temperatures climb.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cop29-leaders-unveil-climate-funding-and-energy-storage-goals/7787233.html	2024-09-17T01:31:36-07:00	
France uses tough, untested cybercrime law to target Telegram's Durov	PARIS — When French prosecutors took aim at Telegram boss Pavel Durov, they had a trump card to wield - a tough new law with no international equivalent that criminalizes tech titans whose platforms allow illegal products or activities. The so-called LOPMI law, enacted in January 2023, has placed France at the forefront of a group of nations taking a sterner stance on crime-ridden websites. But the law is so recent that prosecutors have yet to secure a conviction. With the law still untested in court, France's pioneering push to prosecute figures like Durov could backfire if its judges balk at penalizing tech bosses for alleged criminality on their platforms. A French judge placed Durov under formal investigation last month, charging him with various crimes, including the 2023 offence: 'Complicity in the administration of an online platform to allow an illicit transaction, in an organized gang,' which carries a maximum 10-year sentence and a $556,300 fine. Being under formal investigation does not imply guilt or necessarily lead to trial, but indicates judges think there's enough evidence to proceed with the probe. Investigations can last years before being sent to trial or dropped. Durov, out on bail, denies Telegram was an 'anarchic paradise.' Telegram has said it 'abides by EU laws,' and that it's 'absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform.' In a radio interview last week, Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau hailed the 2023 law as a powerful tool for battling organized crime groups who are increasingly operating online. The law appears to be unique. Eight lawyers and academics told Reuters they were unaware of any other country with a similar statute. 'There is no crime in U.S. law directly analogous to that and none that I'm aware of in the Western world,' said Adam Hickey, a former U.S. deputy assistant attorney general who established the Justice Department's (DOJ) national security cyber program. Hickey, now at U.S. law firm Mayer Brown, said U.S. prosecutors could charge a tech boss as a 'co-conspirator or an aider and abettor of the crimes committed by users' but only if there was evidence the 'operator intends that its users engage in, and himself facilitates, criminal activities.' He cited the 2015 conviction of Ross Ulbricht, whose Silk Road website hosted drug sales. U.S. prosecutors argued Ulbricht 'deliberately operated Silk Road as an online criminal marketplace ... outside the reach of law enforcement,' according to the DOJ. Ulbricht got a life sentence. Timothy Howard, a former U.S. federal prosecutor who put Ulbricht behind bars, was 'skeptical' Durov could be convicted in the United States without proof he knew about the crimes on Telegram, and actively facilitated them - especially given Telegram's vast, mainly law-abiding user base. 'Coming from my experience of the U.S. legal system,' he said, the French law appears 'an aggressive theory.' Michel Séjean, a French professor of cyber law, said the toughened legislation in France came after authorities grew exasperated with companies like Telegram. 'It's not a nuclear weapon,' he said. 'It's a weapon to prevent you from being impotent when faced with platforms that don't cooperate.' Tougher laws The 2023 law traces its origins to a 2020 French interior ministry white paper, which called for major investment in technology to tackle growing cyber threats. It was followed by a similar law in November 2023, which included a measure for the real-time geolocation of people suspected of serious crimes by remotely activating their devices. A proposal to turn on their devices' cameras and mouthpieces so that investigators could watch or listen in was shot down by France's Constitutional Council. These new laws have given France some of the world's toughest tools for tackling cybercrime, with the proof being the arrest of Durov on French soil, said Sadry Porlon, a French lawyer specialized in communication technology law. Tom Holt, a cybercrime professor at Michigan State University, said LOPMI 'is a potentially powerful and effective tool if used properly,' particularly in probes into child sexual abuse images, credit card trafficking and distributed denial of service attacks, which target businesses or governments. Armed with fresh legislative powers, the ambitious J3 cybercrime unit at the Paris prosecutor's office, which is overseeing the Durov probe, is now involved in some of France's most high-profile cases. In June, the J3 unit shut down Coco, an anonymized chat forum cited in over 23,000 legal proceedings since 2021 for crimes including prostitution, rape and homicide. Coco played a central role in a current trial that has shocked France. Dominique Pelicot, 71, is accused of recruiting dozens of men on Coco to rape his wife, whom he had knocked out with drugs. Pelicot, who is expected to testify this week, has admitted his guilt, while 50 other men are on trial for rape. Coco's owner, Isaac Steidel, is suspected of a similar crime as Durov: 'Provision of an online platform to allow an illicit transaction by an organized gang.' Steidel's lawyer, Julien Zanatta, declined to comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-uses-tough-untested-cybercrime-law-to-target-telegram-s-durov/7787218.html	2024-09-17T00:44:03-07:00	
Global index for free and fair elections suffers biggest decline on record in 2023, democracy watchdog says	STOCKHOLM — Lower voter turnout and increasingly contested results globally are threatening the credibility of elections, an intergovernmental watchdog warned on Tuesday, as its sub-index for free and fair elections suffered its biggest decline on record in 2023. In its report, the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) said 2023 was the eighth consecutive year with a net decline in overall democratic performance, the longest consecutive fall since records began in 1975. The watchdog bases its Global State of Democracy indexes on more than 100 variables and is using four main categories - representation, rights, rule of law and participation - to categorize performance. The category of democracy related to free and fair elections and parliamentary oversight, a sub-category of representation, suffered its worst year on record in 2023. 'This report is a call for action to protect democratic elections,' IDEA's Secretary-General Kevin Casas-Zamora said in the report. 'The success of democracy depends on many things, but it becomes utterly impossible if elections fail.' The think-tank said government intimidation and electoral process irregularities, such as fraudulent voter registration and vote-counting, were increasing. It also said that threats of foreign interference, disinformation and the use of artificial intelligence in campaigns added to challenges. It also said that global voter participation had fallen to 55.5% of eligible voters in 2023 from 65.2% in 2008. Globally, in almost 20% of elections between 2020 and 2024, one of the losing candidates or parties rejected the results. IDEA said that the democratic performance in the U.S., which holds a presidential election this year, had recovered somewhat in the past two years, but the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in July highlighted continued risks. 'Less than half (47%) of the Americans said the 2020 election was 'free and fair' and the country remains deeply polarized,' IDEA said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/global-index-for-free-and-fair-elections-suffers-biggest-decline-on-record-in-2023-democracy-watchdog-says/7787215.html	2024-09-17T00:34:05-07:00	
Turkey’s BRICS bid ahead of Russia summit plays both sides	TEL AVIV — Ahead of Russia hosting the 2024 BRICS Summit from Oct. 22-24, Turkey’s application to join the group of major emerging economies is coming under scrutiny. The BRIC, or Brazil, Russia, India and China, platform was initiated by Russia in 2009 as an informal club to provide members with a conduit for challenging the world order dominated by the U.S. and its Western allies. South Africa joined in 2010, making them BRICS. While analysts say Turkey’s membership bid is more about playing both sides than challenging its Western allies, some also voice concerns that Ankara is moving away from the West. 'Turkey’s BRICS bid is one more example of the country’s drift away from the Transatlantic community,' Asli Aydintasbas, visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center on the United States and Europe, told VOA Mandarin. Turkey’s formal application last week for membership in the BRICS bloc of emerging economies confirmed speculation of the plan after the Kremlin in June welcomed 'Turkey’s interest in the work of BRICS' and promised to support Ankara’s aspirations to join it. Ankara’s move marks the first time a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and a candidate to join the European Union has applied to join a group dominated by Russia and China. NATO is a political and military alliance of 32 countries created by the U.S. for collective security against the former Soviet Union. The body also serves as a medium for member-state consultation, cooperation, dispute resolution and crisis management. BRICS aims to challenge the political and economic dominance of mainly Western, developed nations. Critics say it struggles to accomplish much and is uniting authoritarian and corrupt governments that seek to silence opposition. In January 2024, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates were formally added to the group. 'There’s a process of enlarging BRICS that China and Russia are engaged in,' Gallia Lindenstrauss, a fellow at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies Turkey Policy Research, told VOA Mandarin. 'This bid announcement is directly tied to the S-400 sales to Turkey, and it comes as a prelude to the upcoming October BRICS meeting in Russia.' In 2020, the Trump administration slapped sanctions on Turkey for a $2.5 billion acquisition of the Russian S-400 missile system, which is said to pose a risk to the NATO alliance and to U.S. F-35 fighter jets. Despite the Russian missile deal, Turkey still has clear differences with the BRICS members and summit host concerning Moscow’s war on Ukraine, a key NATO concern. While most BRICS members have taken a neutral or Russia-leaning stance on Moscow’s invasion, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last week expressed 'unwavering' support for Ukraine's territorial integrity and said Russia must return annexed Crimea to Kyiv, prompting a mild rebuke from Moscow. 'Turkey is going through an anti-Western mood at the moment,' Aydintasbas says. 'This is made worse by events in Gaza.' Turkey, whose citizens are mostly Muslims, has been an outspoken critic of U.S. ally Israel’s fight against Hamas in Gaza. The conflict began after Hamas’ attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 and took as hostages 250 people. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Analysts say Turkey’s impatience over stalled negotiations to join the EU has also fueled its desire to form closer relations with BRICS. Ankara’s EU bid launched in 2005 has been delayed by concerns about its crackdown on Turkish opposition. Muhdan Saglam, Ankara-based Russian Energy and Russia-Turkey relations commentator, told VOA Mandarin that Turkey’s BRICS bid is a way to show it has different faces — one for the East and another facing West. 'Erdogan is using this to show the West Turkey has alternatives,' Saglam explains. 'But BRICS is not an alternative and Western authorities know that. It is important, though, because not one NATO member has applied for membership in a different organization. In this case, the political impact may be more important than economic or defense implications.' But Saglam says the BRICS bid is also a means for facilitating deals with business partners like China. BRICS member countries make up about 45% of the world’s population and 28% of the global economy. BRICS countries produce more than a third of the world’s crude oil. If Saudi Arabia joins the group, which it has indicated it may, BRICS nations would produce some 43% of global crude oil. But analysts note while Turkey’s trade with China has grown, to more than $48 billion in 2023, the vast majority were imports from China while Ankara has a more balanced trade with its top partner — the European Union. 'Turkey may ultimately be in BRICS,' Lindenstrauss said. 'But there’s no practical serious meaning here in terms of trade partners and it doesn’t change export/import trade factors.' In June, Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek, during a talk at London’s Chatham House think tank, referred to BRICS as 'a dialogue platform' versus a formal economic bloc like the EU. 'The EU remains our core partner in terms of trade investments, tourism flows ... so we remain focused (on the EU), but that doesn’t mean we do not look at alternatives if they present value,' he told the forum. Aydintasbas, of the Brookings Institution, said Turkey’s bid to join BRICS should not be dismissed. 'BRICS membership may not mean much in practical terms and Turkey is still keen to retain its NATO membership. But it is gradually, inch-by-inch, drifting from the West — and that requires greater strategic thinking on the part of U.S. and other NATO allies, given Turkey’s regional heft and geographic location. Is this an outcome we want?' The presidents of China and Iran have already confirmed they will attend the October summit in Russia. Although Russian and Chinse state media report the Turkish president has said he will attend the summit, Erdogan’s office has to make an official confirmation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-s-brics-bid-ahead-of-russia-summit-plays-both-sides/7787210.html	2024-09-17T00:05:20-07:00

Brazil confirms potential $18 bln deal with miners involved in deadly dam disaster	RIO DE JANEIRO — The Brazilian government confirmed on Monday it was in talks on a potential $18 billion payout from a trio of miners involved in a deadly 2015 dam collapse, saying the deal could also involve further repair work by the companies themselves. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Brazilian mining giant Vale and Australia's BHP, together with their joint venture Samarco, could soon reach a deal to pay around $18.2 billion in additional funds for repairs, with final terms of the agreement expected in October. Energy and Mining Minister Alexandre Silveira confirmed the story in a Monday interview with local radio broadcaster Itatiaia, based in Minas Gerais state where the toxic spill took place. Beyond the reparations under discussion, Silveira said the talks also cover some $7 billion in remediation the firms would implement themselves, such as removing toxic mining waste from a local river. The collapse of the dam at a Samarco iron ore mine near the city of Mariana nine years ago unleashed a wave of toxic tailings that killed 19 people, left hundreds homeless, flooded forests and polluted the length of the Doce River. The miners have already paid out some $8 billion on remediation and compensation for the collapse of the tailings dam, Silveira said. A previous proposal from the miners, which was not fully accepted by officials, had set a $15 billion payout to authorities in new resources plus another $3.7 billion in repairs the miners would implement. Vale did not mention the amount of a potential deal in a response to a request for comment on Monday but repeated that it expected to reach a deal in October. BHP and Samarco, meanwhile, confirmed the talks were ongoing in separate statements, adding they believe an agreement could be reached soon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-confirms-potential-18-bln-deal-with-miners-involved-in-deadly-dam-disaster/7787207.html	2024-09-16T23:20:24-07:00	
India condemns Iran supreme leader's comments on treatment of minorities	NEW DELHI — India has condemned comments made by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on the treatment of Muslims in the South Asian nation, calling his remarks 'misinformed and unacceptable.' 'We cannot consider ourselves to be Muslims if we are oblivious to the suffering that a Muslim is enduring in Myanmar, Gaza, India, or any other place,' Khamenei said in a social media post on Monday. In response, India's foreign ministry said it 'strongly deplored' the comments. 'Countries commenting on minorities are advised to look at their own record before making any observations about others,' the foreign ministry spokesperson said. The two countries have typically shared a strong relationship, and signed a 10-year contract in May to develop and operate the Iranian port of Chabahar. India has been developing the port in Chabahar on Iran's southeastern coast along the Gulf of Oman as a way to transport goods to Iran, Afghanistan and central Asian countries, bypassing the ports of Karachi and Gwadar in its rival Pakistan. Khamenei, however, has been critical of India in the past over issues involving Indian Muslims and the troubled Muslim-majority region of Kashmir.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-condemns-iran-supreme-leader-s-comments-on-treatment-of-minorities/7787183.html	2024-09-16T20:59:03-07:00	
Judge rejects former Trump aide's bid to move Arizona case to federal court	PHOENIX — A judge has rejected a bid by Mark Meadows, a former chief of staff to President Donald Trump, to move his charges in Arizona's fake elector case to federal court, marking the second time he has failed in trying to get his charges out of state court. In a decision Monday, U.S. District Judge John Tuchi said Meadows missed a deadline for asking for his charges to be moved to federal court, didn't offer a good reason for doing so and failed to show that the allegations against him related to his official duties as chief of staff to the president. Meadows faces charges in Arizona and Georgia in what authorities allege was an illegal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results in Trump's favor. He had unsuccessfully tried to move charges in the Georgia case last year. It's unknown whether Meadows will appeal the decision. The Associated Press left phone and email messages for two of Meadows' attorneys. While not a fake elector in Arizona, prosecutors said Meadows, while chief of staff, worked with other Trump campaign members to submit names of fake electors from Arizona and other states to Congress in a bid to keep Trump in office despite his November 2020 defeat. Meadows has pleaded not guilty to the charges in Arizona and Georgia. In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes. The decision sends Meadows' case back down to Maricopa County Superior Court. In both Arizona and Georgia, Meadows argued his charges should be moved to federal court because his actions were taken when he was a federal official working as Trump's chief of staff and that he has immunity under the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says federal law trumps state law. Arizona prosecutors said Meadows' electioneering efforts weren't part of his official duties at the White House. Meadows last year tried to get his Georgia charges moved but his request was rejected by a judge whose ruling was later affirmed by an appeals court. Meadows has since asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the ruling. The Arizona indictment says Meadows confided to a White House staff member in early November 2020 that Trump had lost the election. Prosecutors say Meadows also had arranged meetings and calls with state officials to discuss the fake elector conspiracy. Meadows and other defendants are seeking a dismissal of the Arizona case. Meadows' attorneys said nothing their client is alleged to have done in Arizona was criminal. They said the indictment consists of allegations that he received messages from people trying to get ideas in front of Trump — or 'seeking to inform Mr. Meadows about the strategy and status of various legal efforts by the president's campaign.' In all, 18 Republicans were charged in late April in Arizona's fake electors case. The defendants include 11 Republicans who had submitted a document falsely claiming Trump had won Arizona, another Trump aide and five lawyers connected to the former president. In August, Trump's campaign attorney Jenna Ellis, who worked closely with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, signed a cooperation agreement with prosecutors that led to the dismissal of her charges. Republican activist Loraine Pellegrino became the first person to be convicted in the Arizona case when she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was sentenced to probation. The remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty to the forgery, fraud and conspiracy charges in Arizona. Trump wasn't charged in Arizona, but the indictment refers to him as an unindicted coconspirator. The 11 people who were nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were 'duly elected and qualified' electors and claimed Trump had carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored. Prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin have also filed criminal charges related to the fake electors scheme.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-rejects-former-trump-aide-s-bid-to-move-arizona-case-to-federal-court/7787177.html	2024-09-16T20:34:24-07:00

AI videos of US leaders singing Chinese go viral in China	WASHINGTON — 'I love you, China. My dear mother,' former U.S. President Donald Trump, standing in front of a mic at a lectern, appears to sing in perfect Mandarin. 'I cry for you, and I also feel proud for you,' Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent in this year’s election, appears to respond, also in perfect Mandarin. Trump lets out a smile as he listens to the lyric. The video has received thousands of likes and tens of thousands of reposts on Douyin, China’s variation of TikTok. 'These two are almost as Chinese as it gets,' one comment says. Neither Trump nor Harris knows Mandarin. And the duet shown in the video has never happened. But recently, deepfake videos, frequently featuring top U.S. leaders, including President Joe Biden, singing Chinese pop songs, have gone viral on the Chinese internet. Some of the videos have found their way to social media platforms not available in China, such as Instagram, TikTok and X. U.S. intelligence officials and experts have long warned about how China and other foreign adversaries have been implementing generative AI in their disinformation effort to disrupt and influence the 2024 presidential election. 'There has been an increased use of Chinese AI-generated content in recent months, attempting to influence and sow division in the U.S. and elsewhere,' a Microsoft report on China’s disinformation threat said in April. Few of the people who saw the videos of the American leaders singing in Chinese, however, were convinced that they were real, based on what users wrote in the comments. The videos themselves do not contain misinformation, either. Instead, these videos and their popularity reflect, at least in part, a sense of cultural confidence in Chinese netizens in the age of perpetually intensifying U.S.-China competitions, observers told VOA Mandarin. By making the likes of Biden and Trump sing whatever Chinese songs the creators of the videos want them to sing, they can 'culturally domesticate powerful Americans,' said Alexa Pan, a researcher on China’s AI industry for ChinaTalk, an influential newsletter about China and technology. 'Making fun of U.S. leaders might be especially politically acceptable to and popular with Chinese viewers,' she said. Political opponents sing about friendship Videos of American leaders singing in Chinese started to spread on Chinese social media in May. In many of the videos featuring Biden and Trump, creators made the two politically opposed men sing songs about friendship. After Biden announced his withdrawal from the presidential race in July, one viral video had him sing to Trump, 'Actually I don’t want to leave. Actually, I want to stay. I want to stay with you through every spring, summer, autumn and winter,' to which Trump appeared to sing, 'You have to believe me. It won’t take long before we can spend our whole life together.' 'Crying eyes,' one Chinese netizen commented sarcastically. 'They must have gotten along really well.' Another such video posted on Instagram received mostly positive reactions. Some users said it was a stark contrast to the bitterness that has permeated U.S. politics. 'Made me laugh,' an Instagram user wrote. 'Wouldn't that be so refreshing to actually have them sing like that together?' Easy to make After reviewing some of the videos, Pan, of ChinaTalk, told VOA Mandarin that she believes they were quite easy to make. Obvious flaws in the videos, including body parts occasionally blending into the background, suggest they were created with simple AI technology, Pan said. 'One could generate these videos on the many AI text-to-video generation platforms available in China,' she wrote in an e-mail. On the Chinese internet, there are countless tutorials on how to make AI-generated videos using popular lip-syncing AI models, such as MuseTalk, released by Chinese tech giant Tencent, and SadTalker, developed by Xi'an Jiaotong University, a research-focused university in northwestern China. One Douyin account reviewed by VOA Mandarin has pumped out over 200 videos of American leaders singing in Chinese since May. One of the account’s videos was even reposted by the Iranian embassy. Chinese leaders off-limits The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in 2022 has triggered a global AI frenzy, with China being one of the leading countries developing the technology. The United Nations said in July that China had requested the most patents on generative AI, with the U.S. being a distant second. On the Chinese internet, the obsession has been particularly strong with deepfakes, which can be used to manipulate videos, images and audio of people to make them appear to say or sing things that they have not actually uttered. Some deepfake videos are made mostly for fun, such is the case with Biden and Trump singing Chinese songs. But there have also been abuses of the technology. Earlier this year, web users in China stole a Ukrainian girl’s image and turned her into a 'Russian beauty' to sell goods online. China has released strict regulations on deepfakes. A 2022 law states that the technology cannot be used to 'endanger the national security and interests, harm the image of the nation, harm the societal public interest, disturb economic or social order, or harm the lawful rights and interests of others.' Yang Han, an Australian commentator who used to work for China’s Foreign Ministry, told VOA Mandarin that the prominence of U.S leaders and the absence of Chinese leaders in these viral AI videos reflects a lack of political free speech in China. He said that it reminds him of a joke that former U.S. President Ronald Reagan used to tell during the Cold War. 'An American and a Russian compare with each other whose country has more freedom,' Yang said, relaying the joke. 'The American says he can stand in front of the White House and call Reagan stupid. The Russian dismisses it and says he can also stand in front of the Kremlin and call Reagan stupid.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-videos-of-us-leaders-singing-chinese-go-viral-in-china/7787160.html	2024-09-16T19:46:15-07:00	
Next generation of Buffetts is poised to become one of the biggest forces in philanthropy	OMAHA, Neb. — The next generation of Buffetts — Howard, Susie and Peter — is poised to become one of the most powerful forces in philanthropy when their 94-year-old father, the legendary businessman and leader of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, eventually passes away. But it wasn't always going to be that way. Buffett announced in June that he would donate his fortune, now valued at nearly $144 billion, to a charitable trust managed by his three children when he dies, instead of giving it to the Gates Foundation, as he indicated 18 years ago. The next generation of Buffetts will then have 10 years to give the money away, Warren Buffett said. In the meantime, the elder Buffett continues to make huge annual donations to the Gates Foundation and his four family foundations, which will continue throughout his lifetime. He first mentioned plans for a new charitable trust in November. Howard Buffett told The Associated Press he's learned what his father told him and his siblings about philanthropy was true: 'It's not so easy to give away money if you want to do it smart, if you want to be intelligent about it.' The middle Buffett child, Howard said his father is as sharp as ever and that he hopes he lives a long time, adding: 'It's pretty amazing that he's giving us this opportunity.' Buffett has entrusted Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates with significant annual gifts to their foundation since 2006 — a remarkable $43 billion to date. 'Wealthy people don't tend to give their money to other people to give away,' said James Ferris, founding director of The Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy at the University of Southern California. But many of the wealthiest people are also hesitant to hand over their fortunes to the next generation over concerns that it hampers their ingenuity, he said. Ferris thinks the story of Buffett's changing philanthropic intentions is a positive one. 'It shows how a donor is making choices and is adapting to circumstances,' he said. The Gates Foundation did not say when it learned of Buffett's decision or what the impact will be on its budget. It previously said in a statement that 'Warren Buffett has been exceedingly generous,' and that he has 'played an invaluable role in championing and shaping the foundation's work to create a world where every person can live a healthy, productive life.' Over the years, Buffett gave the Gates Foundation large annual donations, but also donated billions to foundations run by his three children and a fourth family foundation. Their work offers some insight into the priorities of the next generation of Buffetts. The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after Warren Buffett's first wife, is the largest in terms of donations. It supports organizations that provide reproductive health care and access to contraception and abortion around the world. Susie Buffett, 71, is its board chair and Peter Buffett, 66, is a board member. Susie Buffett also leads The Sherwood Foundation, a major supporter of early childhood development nationally that gives grants to organizations and projects within Omaha, Nebraska, the Buffetts' hometown. Peter Buffett's NoVo Foundation has been an important funder of organizations advocating for the autonomy of girls and women and against gender-based violence. In 2020, Peter and his wife, Jennifer, decided to reorient their focus, expanding their support for Native American communities and projects to build sustainable, local communities with a focus on agriculture and food access. The Howard G. Buffett Foundation has focused on conflict mitigation and agriculture around the world. Since 2022, it has donated some $800 million — more than most countries — to humanitarian initiatives in Ukraine during the country's war with Russia. These include supporting food distribution at schools, demining activities, and the rebuilding of a major publishing company and a key bridge transporting grain. In a relatively rare interview for a family that seldom makes time to speak with the media, Howard Buffett, 69, said he couldn't predict exactly how he and his siblings would give away their father's fortune. However, he said they would continue to take risks and find ways to make the biggest difference as their father recommended. 'I can tell you, we'll sit down in a room when the time comes, and we'll get it figured out pretty quickly,' he said, acknowledging that the directive to donate all the money within 10 years was a challenge. The siblings' different ways of thinking and approaches to giving are assets, he said. 'What this is going to do is we're going to bring all of our collective experience together,' he said. But don't expect to find the family name on a lot of buildings, which the siblings have largely avoid even as they've given away more than $15 billion of their father's money since 2006. Kathleen Enright, president and CEO of the Council on Foundations, said the Buffetts have effectively made philanthropy a family business, with the next generation now seasoned donors who have built enduring institutions in their foundations. 'It is a big deal,' she said, of the amount of money that the Buffetts are poised to give away, noting that because the fortune will likely continue to grow, they will have to give away highly visible sums to spend it down. The tight timeframe to give away his fortune after his death reflects one of Warren Buffett's longstanding conditions for receiving charitable funding. He has instructed the Gates Foundation and his family's foundations to grant out the full amount they received within a year. The next generation of Buffetts have run their foundations with tiny staffs — much like how Warren Buffett oversees his massive Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate with only about two dozen people at its headquarters in Omaha. Howard Buffett said his foundation employs just 22 staff members. It granted $458.1 million in 2023, according to tax documents. He acknowledged that his 'lean' staff puts some limits on their capacity, but said the way they've scaled their work is through creating strong and enduring relationships with other organizations to help implement their ideas. In contrast, the Gates Foundation has one of the largest endowments at $75.2 billion, funded by donations from Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. It employs more than 2,000 people, many of them technical experts all over the world, and is known for making highly directed grants with rigorous reporting requirements. The foundation has said it will wind down its operations within 25 years after its founders' deaths. Howard Buffett said he likes a challenge and thinks that in general, wealthy people should give their money away within their lifetimes, rather than holding it in perpetual foundations. 'Somebody is going to spend that money. Somebody is going to give that money away,' he said. 'So, I would rather do that with my brother and sister and do it together, as a partnership, than see it done any other way.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/next-generation-of-buffetts-is-poised-to-become-one-of-the-biggest-forces-in-philanthropy/7787147.html	2024-09-16T18:46:01-07:00	
US will ‘continue to push’ for release of detainees in China, State Department says	WASHINGTON — On Monday, after the U.S. State Department announced the release of David Lin, an American pastor, from nearly two decades of imprisonment in China, officials said more work remains to secure the freedom of other Americans held in China. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters that the U.S. government had been working to secure Lin's release for some time. 'When it comes to David Lin, we are glad to see he is released. We welcome it. We’ll continue to push the release of other Americans,' Miller said during a regular press briefing. Lin, 68, was detained in 2006 after entering China. He was later convicted of contract fraud and given a life sentence in 2009. After Chinese courts reduced his sentence, he was set to be released from Beijing in 2029. Bob Fu, a pastor and founder of ChinaAid, a nonprofit dedicated to religious freedom in China, called the original charges against Lin a 'scam' and said they were facilitated by the Chinese government as a gambit to unjustly take hostages. The imprisonment and now release of Lin, Fu told VOA, is especially significant as China is increasingly cracking down on religious practices within the country, with human rights violations in Xinjiang and Tibet and growing governmental restrictions on Christian traditions. Despite this, Fu said that the success of Lin’s release could be attributed to two factors: the souring of the global public opinion on China and the hard work of U.S. officials. 'This shows that if our top political leaders really take this seriously and persistently, it will bear fruits for our citizens' freedom,' he said. According to the Dui Hua Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to freeing detainees through dialogue with China, over 200 American nationals in China under coercive measures, including wrongful detentions and exit bans. The State Department has listed two other detained individuals as priority cases: Businessman Kai Li, accused of espionage in 2016, and Mark Swidan, convicted of drug trafficking in 2019. 'We’ll continue to push the release of other Americans,' Miller said. 'It’s something that we have been working on for some time.' Miller declined to say if Lin's release had been the result of a swap, according to a report by Reuters. China's embassy in Washington declined to comment when asked if Beijing had received anything from the U.S. in return for Lin's release, according to Reuters. The embassy also told Reuters that Chinese authorities handle criminal suspects in accordance with the law and 'treat them equally regardless of their nationality.' Later this week, a U.S. congressional hearing is set to be held on Americans who have been arbitrarily imprisoned in China. Some material for this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-will-continue-to-push-for-release-of-detainees-in-china-state-department-says/7787144.html	2024-09-16T18:32:50-07:00	
Turkish-backed group besieges Syrian-Kurdish village after protest	Northern Syria/Washington — A village in northwestern Syria has been under siege by a Turkish-backed group of armed militants following a women-led protest against ongoing abuses carried out by the Syrian faction. The Kurdish village of Kakhira in Syria’s Afrin district came under siege Sunday after fighters affiliated with the Suleiman Shah Brigade cut off internet access and set up additional checkpoints in and around the community, Kurdish news network Rudaw reported on Monday. The village and other parts of Afrin came under the control of Turkish military and Turkish-backed Syrian groups in March 2018 following a major military offensive against Kurdish forces. Many armed factions operating in the area, including the Suleiman Shah Brigade, are extremist groups that have imposed stringent restrictions on the local Kurdish population. International rights groups, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have accused these groups of carrying out violations against civilian residents of Afrin. The recent protest in Kakhira was sparked by the announcement of a new set of taxation against olive farmers and the subsequent arrests of several residents who had opposed the new levy, according to local sources. 'The demonstrators were met with harsh beatings and live bullets by the armed group, leaving at least six people wounded, including four women,' said Sozdar Rizgar, a former village resident who currently lives in a displacement camp elsewhere in northern Syria. She told VOA that the militiamen have restricted all access to and from the village. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, which has researchers throughout the war-torn country, put the number of those wounded at eight. Another source inside Afrin, who insisted on anonymity for fear of retribution, told VOA that fighters linked to the Suleiman Shah Brigade have in recent weeks seized several properties belonging to Kakhira villagers. 'The most recent example was last week, when the fighters confiscated a civilian house whose owner later died of a heart attack,' the source said. Last year, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on the Suleiman Shah Brigade and another armed group called the Hamza Division for 'serious human rights abuses against those residing in the Afrin region of northern Syria.' In a report released last week, the U.N. Syria Commission of Inquiry said armed groups in northwest Syria use brutal torture tactics in their detention centers that are like those of the Syrian government. Ahmed Qitme, a researcher at the Paris-based advocacy group Syrians for Truth and Justice, said such international designations and condemnations have not deterred armed groups in Afrin from carrying out these abuses. 'They act with impunity because they feel that nobody could stop them as long as they have the backing of Turkey,' he told VOA. The Kurdish National Council in Syria, an opposition group based in northern Syria, has called on Turkish authorities to exert pressure on armed factions and put an end to rights violations in Afrin. The Turkish government has not publicly commented on the ongoing events in northwest Syria. Officials at Turkey's Foreign Ministry did not respond to VOA's requests for comment in time for publication. The Syrian National Army — an umbrella group for all armed factions in northwest Syria, including Suleiman Shah Brigade — also did not respond to VOA's request for comment.

Boeing says it's weighing temporary layoffs to save cash during machinists strike	seattle — Boeing plans to freeze hiring and reduce travel and is considering temporary layoffs to save cash during a factory worker strike that began last week, the company told employees Monday. The company said the moves, which include reduced spending on suppliers, were necessary because 'our business is in a difficult period.' Chief financial officer Brian West detailed 10 immediate cutbacks in a memo to employees. They include a freeze on hiring across all levels, a pause in pay increases for managers and executives who get promoted, and a cancellation of all travel that isn't critical. 'We are also considering the difficult step of temporary furloughs for many employees, managers and executives in the coming weeks,' West said. Boeing's business is in a difficult spot, he said, adding: 'This strike jeopardizes our recovery in a significant way.' About 33,000 workers represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers began a strike early Friday. The walkout came after workers rejected an offer of a 25% increase in pay over four years. The union originally sought a pay hike of at least 40%. Representatives of the company and the union are scheduled to meet Tuesday with federal mediators. The union has started to survey its members to learn what they want most in a new contract. Striking workers are picketing at several locations around Washington state, Oregon and California. Outside Boeing's huge factory in Everett, Washington, Nancie Browning, a materials-management specialist at Boeing for more than 17 years, said last week's offer was worse than the one that prompted a two-month strike in 2008. She said that without annual bonuses that workers have come to depend on, the proposed pay increase was more like 9%, not 25%. 'We just want a piece of the pie like everybody else,' she said. 'Why should we work all this overtime and bust our backs while these guys [Boeing executives] are sitting up in their suites just raking in the cash?' The bonuses have emerged as a flash point for union members. Workers say they range from $3,000 to $5,000 a year. Boeing says it is hard to calculate bonuses in a way that is fair to 33,000 people who perform different jobs. So instead, the company proposes to ditch the payouts and replace them with automatic contributions of $4,160 per year to each employee's 401(k) retirement account. Workers are bitter that in contract extensions over the past 16 years, Boeing ended its traditional pension plan and lowered health care benefits. 'We want our pension back,' said Jacob Bustad, a machinist with Boeing for 14 years who was also on the picket line in Everett. 'We just keep losing and we never gain, while the people at the top just get more and more money. Boeing has done really good for me and my family, but these last years have been hard.' Boeing has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019 and burned through $4.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024 alone as it stood poised to post another money-losing year. The strike will delay deliveries of new planes, which are an important source of cash for the company. Stephanie Pope, the head of Boeing's commercial airplanes division, cited the company's $60 billion in total debt in urging blue-collar workers to accept the contract offer last week. She called it the best offer Boeing had ever made — and it was endorsed by the union's local president and negotiators. But workers rejected the recommendation of their own leaders, which had not happened since 1995. Additional cost-cutting moves spelled out in the chief financial officer's memo included eliminating first- and business-class service for anyone on travel that is deemed critical and stopping spending on outside consultants. West also said Boeing plans to make 'significant reductions in supplier expenditures' and will stop most supplier purchase orders related to the 737, 767 and 777 airplane models. After the strike started, Moody's put Boeing on review for a possible credit downgrade, and Fitch said a strike longer than two weeks would make a downgrade more likely. Both agencies rate Boeing debt one notch above noninvestment or junk status.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-says-it-s-weighing-temporary-layoffs-to-save-cash-during-machinists-strike-/7787107.html	2024-09-16T17:30:16-07:00	
As election for IOC president looms, what is the job and who are the 7 candidates?	geneva — Seven candidates are competing for one of the biggest and best jobs in world sports that traditionally becomes available only every 12 years. The International Olympic Committee announced on Monday which of its members in a most exclusive and discreet club have entered the race to be its next president. The election by secret ballot is in March. The winner will replace Thomas Bach, a German lawyer who steps down in June upon reaching the maximum 12 years in office. The 10th IOC president could be its first female leader, or its first from Africa or Asia. Or even its first from Britain. They will take over a financially stable organization that demands deft skills in the challenging arenas of sports and real-world politics. Who are the candidates? - Prince Feisal al Hussein, an IOC member since 2010, on its executive board since 2019. Founder of the Generations for Peace sports charity. His older brother is King Abdullah II of Jordan. - Sebastian Coe, IOC member since 2020. President of World Athletics since 2015. Olympic champion in men's 1,500 meters in 1980 and 1984. Elected lawmaker in British Parliament from 1992 to 1997. Led the 2012 London Olympics organizing committee. - Kirsty Coventry, IOC member since 2013, on executive board for a second time since 2023. Olympic champion in women's 200-meter backstroke in 2004 and 2008. Appointed sports minister in Zimbabwe government since 2018. Chairs IOC panel overseeing the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. - Johan Eliasch, IOC member since August. President of International Ski and Snowboard Federation since 2021. Owner of Head sports equipment brand, CEO until 2021. Swedish-British citizen. - David Lappartient, IOC member since 2022. President of International Cycling Union since 2017. President of France's Olympic committee and leader of French Alps bid that will host 2030 Winter Games. Chair of IOC esports panel that steered the Esports Olympic Games to Saudi Arabia. - Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr., IOC member since 2001, vice president since 2022, and member of the executive board from 2012 to 2020. Founder of a Spain-based investment bank. Created Samaranch Foundation to promote the Olympics in China in honor of his father, who was IOC president from 1980 to 2001. - Morinari Watanabe, IOC member since 2018. Japanese president of the International Gymnastics Federation since 2017. When is the election and who votes? The IOC election meeting is on March 18-21 at a resort hotel in Greece, near the site of Ancient Olympia. Candidates and their compatriots cannot vote, leaving about 95 eligible to take part in March. Among them, members of European and Asian royal families, including the Emir of Qatar; diplomats and lawmakers, including a former president of Croatia, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović; businesspeople, including Nita Ambani, whose husband is India's richest man; leaders of sports bodies; current and former Olympic athletes. What is the IOC president's job? It's an executive role running a not-for-profit organization that employs hundreds of staff at a modern lakeside headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. The IOC earns several billion dollars in revenue every four years from selling broadcasting and sponsor rights for the Summer Games and Winter Games. Most of the money is distributed to the Olympic family: organizers of upcoming Games, including youth editions, governing bodies of Olympic sports, more than 200 national Olympic bodies, scholarships for potential Olympic athletes and special projects. The job ideally calls for a deep knowledge of managing sports, understanding athletes' needs and political skills. How long can IOC presidents stay in the job? A maximum of 12 years, with a first term of eight years and the chance for one re-election for a further four. However, the IOC has an age limit of 70 and complex rules around membership status. It means some of the seven candidates could have to seek a special exemption while in office to complete a full eight-year mandate. What are the challenges and big decisions ahead? - Picking a host for the 2036 Summer Games, with India and Qatar as strong contenders. - Renewing the United States broadcast deal that has typically underwritten Olympic finances. Bach moved quickly in 2014 to renew NBC's deal through 2032. The next deal starts with the 2034 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. - Both decisions factor into wider questions in regard to drafting the global sports calendar. July-August has been the optimal Summer Games slot since 2004. But a 2036 Doha Olympics could not be held in those months, and where could Games be comfortably held after another decade of climate change? - When and how can Russia be reintegrated fully into international sports with no end to its invasion of Ukraine in sight? Coe's world track and field body currently excludes Russian athletes entirely.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-election-for-ioc-president-looms-what-is-the-job-and-who-are-the-7-candidates-/7786765.html	2024-09-16T16:47:57-07:00

Eswatini activists say park rangers shoot suspected poachers with impunity	Mbabane, Eswatini — Some Eswatini legislators, backed by human rights activists, are calling for an urgent review of the Game Act of 1991, a law they say allows wildlife park rangers to shoot and kill suspected poachers with little or no accountability. Game park owners have defended these shootings for years as necessary to protect animals. But critics contend that the Game Act instead jeopardizes human life. Human rights lawyer Thabiso Mavuso of the Law Society of Swaziland, who has represented the families of shooting victims, says the law not only allows game rangers to use lethal force with impunity but also shields them from legal accountability. 'We have seen here in Eswatini the killing, injury and torture of people, some as young as 13 years and some in their 60s, but nothing has been done against the perpetrators ... ,' Mavuso said. 'This law needs reform. It must be aligned with human rights and general principles of constitutionalism such as accountability and responsibility.' No one has exact numbers for how many suspected poachers have been killed in Eswatini’s game parks, but the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs estimates dozens are slain each year. Game ranger Mandla Motsa told VOA that it is rangers who need protection and that the Game Law should not be altered. 'We have lost a lot of rangers - some have been killed and others injured,' Motsa said. 'Almost all the time, the poachers shoot at rangers first. There has been a wrong narrative that we value the lives of animals more than that of humans. What people are forgetting is that there are two sides of lives involved in this issue and that is that of the ranger and the poacher. So, amending the Game Act would be to make it seem that our lives as rangers are also not important.' However, political analyst Mandla Hlatshwayo said the killings in the parks are a consequence of the government’s abuse of power under the guise of environmental protection. 'What's happening in the country in my view has nothing to do with environmental protection,' Hlatshwayo said. 'The killing of so-called poachers in the manner that it's actually taking place is wrong and must be condemned in the strongest of terms. We are witnessing the cold-blooded execution of suspects under circumstances that are very questionable. This is simple murder that is being condoned by the authorities, mainly because the victims are poor people with no power to fight back.' Former Senator Ngomayayona Gamedze, whose family has suffered losses at the hands of game rangers, says the act must be amended to prioritize the sanctity of human life. 'Wildlife in Eswatini is now accorded higher status and greater protection than human beings,' Gamedze said. 'This must be addressed by our legislators before human lives are further disregarded. Game rangers hold immense power over ordinary Swazis who love hunting, yet are penalized to the extent of death without trial. It is an injustice that the people of Eswatini are treated as less than animals, and a review of the Game Act is needed to prevent further loss of life.' Government spokesperson Alpheous Nxumalo said a motion from senators to amend the Gaming Act was being debated and that a vote was pending.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eswatini-activists-say-park-rangers-shoot-suspected-poachers-with-impunity-/7786760.html	2024-09-16T15:28:02-07:00	
Trial starts for Frenchman accused of unlawfully collecting military information in Russia	MOSCOW — The trial of a French citizen arrested in Russia on charges of unlawfully collecting information on military issues started Monday but was quickly adjourned for a month. Laurent Vinatier, arrested in Moscow in June, had earlier admitted guilt, setting the stage for a fast-track trial without a detailed examination of evidence. But quickly after the trial opened on Monday, the judge adjourned the hearing until October 14 when prosecutors will declare the sentence they will seek. Vinatier's lawyer, Aleksey Sinitsyn, said the trial was adjourned because the prosecution needed more time to prepare for final arguments. If convicted, Vinatier could face up to five years in prison. Detentions on charges of spying and collecting sensitive data have become increasingly frequent in Russia since it sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Vinatier's arrest came as tensions flared between Moscow and Paris following President Emmanuel Macron's comments about the possibility of deploying French troops in Ukraine. Russian authorities accused Vinatier of failing to register as a 'foreign agent' while collecting information about Russia's 'military and military-technical activities' that could be used to the detriment of the country's security. The prosecutors accused Vinatier of collecting military information during his meetings with three Russian citizens in Moscow in 2021-2022. The Russian citizens weren't named in the indictment. Vinatier is an adviser with the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, a Switzerland-based nongovernmental organization. The NGO in June said it was doing 'everything possible to assist' him. The charges against Vinatier relate to a law that requires anyone collecting information on military issues to register with authorities as a foreign agent. Human rights activists have criticized the law and other recent legislation as part of a Kremlin crackdown on independent media and political activists intended to stifle criticism of its actions in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trial-starts-for-frenchman-accused-of-unlawfully-collecting-military-information-in-russia-/7786766.html	2024-09-16T15:17:16-07:00	
US military completes withdrawal from junta-ruled Niger	DAKAR, Senegal — The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Niger is complete, an American official said Monday. A small number of military personnel assigned to guard the U.S. Embassy remain, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters. Earlier this year, Niger's ruling junta ended an agreement that allowed U.S. troops to operate in the West African country. A few months later, officials from both countries said in a joint statement that U.S. troops would complete their withdrawal by the middle of September. The U.S. handed over its last military bases in Niger to local authorities last month, but about two dozen American soldiers had remained in Niger, largely for administrative duties related to the withdrawal, Singh said. Niger's ouster of American troops following a coup last year has broad ramifications for Washington because it's forcing troops to abandon critical bases that were used for counterterrorism missions in the Sahel. groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group operate in the vast region south of the Sahara desert. One of those groups, Jama'a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin, known as JNIM, is active in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, and is looking to expand into Benin and Togo. Niger had been seen as one of the last nations in the restive region that Western nations could partner with to beat back growing jihadi insurgencies. The U.S. and France had more than 2,500 military personnel in the region until recently, and together with other European countries had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance and training. In recent months Niger has pulled away from its Western partners, turning instead to Russia for security. In April, Russian military trainers arrived in Niger to reinforce the country's air defenses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-military-completes-withdrawal-from-junta-ruled-niger-/7786759.html	2024-09-16T14:55:52-07:00

UN diverts $8 million in humanitarian funding to Nigeria flood response	Maiduguri, Nigeria — The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has approved the immediate release of $8 million dollars to support victims in flood ravaged Maiduguri, in Nigeria's Borno state. Severe flooding there last week killed dozens of people and displaced hundreds of thousands of others. Mohammed Malick Fall, the U.N. resident coordinator, announced the new funding to journalists in Maiduguri while visiting flood victims over the weekend. The visit was to assess the extent of damage caused by the flooding and to ramp up lifesaving assistance. Fall announced the allocation of $8 million from the humanitarian fund to support disaster response and management. 'We're all behind you not only in sympathy but in solidarity. We will not spare any of our resources in this response,' Fall said. 'Probably we might not be where we want it to be in terms of resources, but as we speak, we'll try to refocus resources that have been designed for some other intervention to see how we can bring them toward scaling up and speeding up this response. We'll prioritize our response around the immediate need.' The U.N. has provided hot meals and facilitated food air drops in hard-to-reach areas cut off by flood waters. Last Thursday, a dam burst caused millions of liters of water to pour into communities in Maiduguri. State authorities say the flood killed dozens of people and affected more than 1 million others. Many are taking shelter in camps. The disaster follows an alarming malnutrition crisis caused by conflict, climate change and inflation in the region. Local residents say food prices have skyrocketed as a result of flood waters washing out access roads and markets and farms. Borno state Governor Babagana Umara Zulum told journalists the full extent of damage remains unknown. 'The unfortunate flood incident is perhaps the most devastating acute disaster that our state has suffered as far as we can remember,' Zulum said. 'Many bridges are damaged and we're yet to assess the integrity of the bridges that form the main link between the two major parts of the city.' Zulum added that the flood hit the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, which has the most up-to-date medical diagnostic and therapeutic equipment in West Africa. The status and function of the equipment has yet to be ascertained. Borno state is the heartland region of the Boko Haram terror group. The group's 15-year insurgency has sparked one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. But the U.N. said Nigeria's Humanitarian Response Plan for Nigeria, seeking $927 million dollars, is only about 46% funded. In 2022, Nigeria's worst flooding in a decade killed more than 600 people and displaced 1.4 million. On Monday, the Nigerian Correctional Services announced a manhunt for more than 280 escapees from a prison destroyed by the flooding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-diverts-8-million-in-humanitarian-funding-to-nigeria-flood-response-/7786705.html	2024-09-16T14:06:35-07:00	
Ohio city cancels cultural festival after political furor over Haitians	Springfield, Ohio — An Ohio city at the center of a political furor over Haitian migrants canceled its annual celebration of cultural diversity on Monday in response to days of violent threats that have closed schools and government offices. The governor, meanwhile, said resources would be surged to Springfield to help city officials deal with the fallout. Springfield's two-day CultureFest, which highlights diversity, arts and culture, had been scheduled to begin Sept. 27 but was canceled 'in light of recent threats and safety concerns,' the city announced. 'We deeply regret having to cancel CultureFest, as we know it is a beloved event for our community,' City Manager Bryan Heck said in a statement. 'However, the safety of our residents and visitors must come first.' Springfield has been the focus of intense attention in recent days after former President Donald Trump, his running mate JD Vance, and the Republican presidential campaign have amplified debunked claims about Haitian immigrants eating domestic pets and waterfowl. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, has denounced the false rumors, saying there is no evidence of it. He said at a news conference in Springfield on Monday that dozens of members of the Ohio State Highway Patrol will be stationed in Springfield schools starting Tuesday, sweeping each building every morning before the arrival of faculty or students. Security cameras have also been stationed at various spots in the city. Springfield City Hall, several schools, and state motor vehicle offices in Springfield were forced to evacuate last week after receiving bomb threats. At least 33 separate bomb threats were made in recent days, all of them hoaxes, DeWine said. He said some of the threats came from overseas but declined to name the country. 'We cannot let the bad guys win. Our schools must remain open. They are going to remain open,' DeWine said. Two colleges in Springfield held classes virtually on Monday. Wittenberg University said it received two threats over the weekend, 'both of which were targeted toward members of the Haitian Community.' Clark State College said it would operate virtually through Friday 'due to recent events in Springfield.' Thousands of Haitian immigrants have settled in recent years in the predominantly white, blue-collar city of about 60,000, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) from the state capital of Columbus, where they have found work in factories and warehouses that had been struggling to fill job openings. The sudden influx has strained schools, health care facilities and city services and driven up the cost of housing. President Joe Biden, appearing in Philadelphia at the National HBCU Week Conference on Monday, addressed the situation in Springfield, condemning what he called the 'lies and hate.' 'It's wrong. It's simply wrong. And it must stop,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ohio-city-cancels-cultural-festival-after-political-furor-over-haitians/7786688.html	2024-09-16T13:52:58-07:00	
Electricity in short supply as Zambia deals with drought-driven energy crisis	Lusaka, Zambia — As Zambia deals with its worst drought in 20 years, businesses and households are going for days without electricity. Experts say the severe energy crisis could worsen Zambia ‘s already fragile economy and lead to massive job losses. On an average day, millions of people across the country are enduring up to 21 hours of power cuts, locally known as load shedding. Taonga Zulu, a Lusaka resident who runs a family farm business, told VOA that her livelihood has been hurt by the power cuts. 'It has been nearly impossible to manage the chicken run properly as we rely on electricity for various aspects of their care,' she said. 'The lack of power has also prevented us from pumping water, which means our farm is slowly turning into a desert.' The Zambia Association of Manufacturers is a business association representing the interests of the country’s factories. Association president Ashu Sagar said his members have not been spared by the energy crisis. He said big companies are struggling with the cost of running alternative diesel-powered generators, while smaller companies have no energy source at all. Sagar added that some of the association‘s members have failed to meet contractual obligations with buyers due to the drought-induced energy crisis. 'So, the impact on the manufacturing sector is quite big in that small companies that probably could have no capacity to invest in alternative energy solutions like diesel generators have had to curtail their manufacturing operations,' he said. Zambia‘s only public power utility company, the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation, or ZESCO, said Monday that it does not have enough power to supply all hospitals. Media reports say some hospitals are turning patients away due to lack of electricity and water. ZESCO spokesperson Matongo Maumbi said the country‘s heavy reliance on hydropower generation has led to a national shortfall of almost 1,300 megawatts as the various water sources are drying up. Economist Emmanuel Zulu says the energy crisis is dragging down the economy and pushing up unemployment. 'There is a slump in output and productivity in the economy and this is going to affect our GDP as well as employment because most people will be left with nothing to do,' he said. Worsened by climate change and the El Nino weather pattern, the energy crisis threatens national food security, water and energy supply, Zambia’s President Hakainde Hichilema said earlier this year. In his state of the nation address to parliament Friday, Hichilema said his government is working around the clock to address the energy crisis. 'Government is implementing a number of interventions in a bid to enhance resilience and reduce our dependence on hydroelectric power,' he said. 'We are promoting alternative sources of energy.' Energy expert Johnstone Chikwanda is optimistic that new measures, like the removal of bureaucratic hurdles that discouraged private companies from investing in energy production, will yield results in the near future. 'Looking at the extent of the measures which are currently being implemented and the strong praxis of leadership driving the energy sector reforms, I am convinced that this crisis is being invested better than how we previously handled the previous crisis,' he said. According to the United Nations, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi are among the countries in Southern Africa most affected by the regional drought that began early this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/electricity-in-short-supply-as-zambia-deals-with-drought-driven-energy-crisis/7786511.html	2024-09-16T12:06:58-07:00	
Pakistan defendants face 'grueling' legal battles over blasphemy allegations, says new report	ISLAMABAD — A new report finds Pakistan’s blasphemy laws are being significantly misused, with many defendants facing baseless accusations, protracted legal battles and lengthy pre-trial prison time as judges tread carefully to avoid offending religious groups. The U.S.-based Clooney Foundation for Justice (CFJ) on Monday released its findings after monitoring 24 blasphemy lawsuits for six months during 2022 in Lahore, the capital of Pakistan's most populous province, Punjab. The CJF said 15 of the accused are facing mandatory death sentences if convicted. However, the report said its monitors had noted little progress in most cases, with 217 out of 252 hearings adjourned, leaving many defendants stuck in pre-trial detention. 'This report shows a process fraught with significant delays and unfairness, exacerbating the widespread climate of misuse, discrimination, and intimidation that has developed around Pakistan’s blasphemy law,' said Zimran Samuel, a CFJ legal expert and visiting professor in practice at the London School of Economics. 'Pakistan’s blasphemy provisions in their current form and as they are being implemented are in urgent need of reform and reconsideration,' Samuel said. Making derogatory remarks against Islam or the Prophet Muhammad in Muslim-majority Pakistan is punishable by death under the country’s blasphemy laws, though no one has ever been executed under the laws. The CFJ’s report criticized the country’s blasphemy laws for being inconsistent with international standards, especially the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The study noted that many blasphemy accusations lack evidence, with complainants often not witnessing the alleged acts. In some cases, it added that the specific blasphemous words are not even identified. Despite safeguards in place, such as the requirement for government approval of charges, these are often disregarded, the report alleged. The CFJ stated that defendants are often arrested without warrants, denied bail, and subjected to repeated adjournments due to missing witnesses, prolonging their legal ordeals. It called for Pakistan to repeal its blasphemy laws, raise the standards for filing allegations, deter false accusations, and reform court procedures to prevent endless delays. 'The judicial system in Pakistan has completely failed in preventing the abuse and malafide (bad faith) use of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan,' the report quoted Hina Jilani, a leading human rights lawyer and activist in Pakistan. 'While there are concerns regarding the laws as they are currently framed, the way that courts disregard the few procedural safeguards that were added to the legal framework has rendered prosecution in such cases farcical and an epitome of injustice,' stated Jilani, a recipient of the American Society of International Law award. The report highlighted that some cases do not even go to trial, with mob violence against those accused of blasphemy on the rise. Pakistani officials did not immediately respond to the CFJ findings, which came ahead of the United Nations Human Rights Committee's review of the country, scheduled for October 17. Islamabad has consistently rejected foreign criticism of its blasphemy laws, calling it an internal matter for Pakistan to deal with. The report came just days after a police officer in the southwestern province of Balochistan shot and killed a man who was being held in custody on blasphemy allegations. The victim, a Muslim, was arrested a day earlier for allegedly making derogatory remarks about the Prophet Muhammad. In June, a 73-year-old Pakistani man from the minority Christian community died in a hospital a week after being violently attacked by a mob in his native Sargodha district in Punjab following accusations he insulted Islam. Days later, on June 20, a Muslim man from Punjab was visiting the scenic Swat Valley in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when a mob violently lynched him for allegedly desecrating Islam's holy book, the Quran. Hundreds of suspects, mostly Muslims, are languishing in jails in Pakistan because fear of retaliation from religious groups deters judges from moving their trials forward. The CFJ report backed long-running local and international rights groups’ concerns that the strict blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal vendettas or to persecute Pakistani minority communities. The organization says its CFJ legal experts are tasked to monitor criminal trials globally against those who are most vulnerable, particularly journalists, democracy defenders, women and girls, LGBTQ+ persons, and minorities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-defendants-face-grueling-legal-battles-over-blasphemy-allegations-says-new-report/7786497.html	2024-09-16T11:53:20-07:00

Pakistani man pleads not guilty to US assassination plot charges	NEW YORK — A Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges stemming from an alleged plot to assassinate an American politician in retaliation for the killing of Iran's Revolutionary Guards top commander Qassem Soleimani. Asif Merchant, 46, entered his plea to one count of attempting to commit terrorism across national boundaries and one count of murder for hire at a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Levy in Brooklyn. The judge ordered that Merchant be detained pending trial. Federal prosecutors say Merchant spent time in Iran before traveling to the United States to recruit people for the plot. Merchant told a confidential informant he also planned to steal documents from one target and organize protests in the United States, prosecutors said. The defendant named Donald Trump as a potential target but had not conceived the scheme as a plan to assassinate the former president, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. Court papers do not name the alleged targets, and no attacks were made. As president, Trump had in 2020 approved the drone strike on Soleimani. There are no suggestions that Merchant was tied to an apparent assassination attempt on Trump at his Florida golf course on Sunday, or a separate shooting of the Republican presidential candidate at a rally in Pennsylvania in July. Merchant was arrested in Texas on July 15. Iran's mission to the United Nations said in August that the 'modus operandi' described in Merchant's court papers ran contrary to Tehran's policy of 'legally prosecuting the murder of General Soleimani.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-man-pleads-not-guilty-to-us-assassination-plot-charges/7786386.html	2024-09-16T10:30:39-07:00

Thousands protest in France as high-profile rape cases rock country	Paris — Thousands of people protested sexual violence across France this past weekend, as two high-profile cases rock the country: one involving a woman who was allegedly drugged and raped by dozens of men for years; the other targeting a once-beloved French clergyman, who fought for the rights of the homeless. In French cities like Marseille and Nantes, both men and women took part in demonstrations calling for an end to sexual violence. They carried signs with messages like 'No, to the culture of rape,' and 'Gisele, we believe you' — in support of 72-year-old Gisele Pelicot. Pelicot’s former husband is on trial in the southern city of Avignon, accused of drugging her and recruiting dozens of men to rape her over nearly a decade. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Pelicot thanked the protesters and other supporters. They have given her force, she said, to fight for all those who are victims of sexual violence. The Avignon trial is only the latest of a raft of sexual violence accusations targeting famous French actors and other figures. Most recently, the spotlight has been on Abbe Pierre, once a crusader for the homeless. For years one of the most popular personalities in France, the priest died in 2007 at the age of 94. But in recent weeks, multiple allegations have surfaced that he sexually assaulted women in France and other countries over the decades. There are now efforts to strike his name from the charities he founded, as well as from parks and streets named after him. Speaking to reporters Friday, Pope Francis said Abbe Pierre did a lot of good, but was also a sinner — and such things must be spoken about, not hidden. The head of the French bishop’s association has since said that at least some French bishops had known about the cleric’s alleged abuses for decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-protest-in-france-as-high-profile-rape-cases-rock-country/7786330.html	2024-09-16T10:03:18-07:00

US imposes sanctions on 4 Georgians over protest crackdowns	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury Department imposed on Monday sanctions on two Georgian government officials and two members of the country’s pro-Russian far-right movement who it said were involved in violent crackdowns on protests. Large street protests erupted in Georgia over a 'foreign agent' law, which the South Caucasus country's parliament passed in May despite criticism, including from U.S. officials, that it was Kremlin-inspired and authoritarian. A Treasury statement said the financial sanctions on Monday targeted Georgia's Chief of the Special Task Department Zviad Kharazishvili and his deputy, Mileri Lagazauri, who oversaw security forces who violently suppressed the spring protests. 'The violence perpetuated by the Special Task Department included the brutal beatings of many attendees of the non-violent protests against the new foreign influence law, including Georgian citizens and opposition politicians,' the Treasury said. It added that Kharazishvili was personally involved in the physical and verbal abuse of protesters. Also targeted were Konstantine Morgoshia, founder of media company Alt-Info, and associated media personality Zurab Makharadze, Treasury said, accusing them of amplifying disinformation and spreading hate speech and threats. The dispute around the foreign agents law was seen as a test of whether Georgia, for three decades among the more pro-Western of the Soviet Union's successor states, would maintain its Western orientation or move closer to Russia. The Georgian Dream party that controls parliament said the legislation was needed to ensure transparency in foreign funding of NGOs and protect the country's sovereignty. Washington has long criticized the law and launched a review into bilateral cooperation with Georgia. The Biden administration has previously imposed visa bans on members of Georgian Dream, members of parliament, law enforcement and private citizens over the law and the protests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-sanctions-on-4-georgians-over-protest-crackdowns-/7786183.html	2024-09-16T08:47:39-07:00	
Postal Service chief 'fully committed' to timely US ballot deliveries	Washington — U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said on Monday he is 'personally fully committed' to ensuring all 2024 presidential election ballots are delivered in a timely fashion and vowed to respond to concerns raised by state and local officials. A group of about three dozen election officials from the National Association of State Election Directors and other groups on Wednesday raised serious concerns about USPS's ability to deliver millions of ballots for the 2024 presidential election, citing questions 'about processing facility operations, lost or delayed election mail, and front-line training deficiencies impacting USPS’s ability to deliver election mail in a timely and accurate manner.' DeJoy said in a letter released on Monday that he would hold a call with state officials to address specific concerns. The officials said that, despite repeated meetings with USPS election staff, 'we have not seen improvement or concerted efforts to remediate our concerns.' DeJoy said the USPS Office of Inspector General is auditing its plants and delivery units and will report any election mail issues they discover 'and we will address those issues expeditiously.' Starting Oct. 1, USPS will deploy ballot monitors and others in processing, retail and delivery units 'to reinforce and amplify our policies and procedures on the ground' USPS said on average it is currently delivering mail in 2.7 days but continues 'to recommend as a common-sense measure that voters should mail their completed ballot before Election Day, and at least one week prior to their state’s deadline.' The inspector general has said 46% of votes were cast by mail in the November 2020 presidential election, compared with 21% in the 2016 election. USPS said in the 2020 general election, it delivered 99.89% of ballots from voters to election officials within seven days. Voting by mail in some states is set to start in the coming weeks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/postal-service-chief-fully-committed-to-timely-us-ballot-deliveries/7786105.html	2024-09-16T08:02:25-07:00	
Nearly 300 inmates escape after floods bring down prison walls in northeast Nigeria	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigerian authorities said 281 inmates escaped after devastating floods brought down a prison’s walls in the country's northeast. A major dam collapsed on Sept. 10, unleashing severe flooding that left 30 people dead and over a million displaced, and prompted evacuations across the state of Borno. Officers attempted to evacuate the city of Maiduguri's main prison last week when they found out that the prisoners had escaped, Umar Abubakar, spokesperson for the Nigeria Correctional Services said in a statement Sunday night. 'The floods brought down the walls of the correctional facilities including the Medium Security Custodial Centre, as well as the staff quarters in the city,' Abubakar said. Security personnel were able to recapture seven of the inmates and an operation is still ongoing to locate the rest, he said. The collapse caused some of the state’s worst flooding since the same dam collapsed 30 years ago. The state government said the dam was at capacity due to unusually high rains. Two years ago, heavy flooding in Nigeria killed more than 600 people across the country. West Africa has experienced some of the heaviest flooding in decades this year, affecting over 2.3 million people, a threefold increase from 2023, according to the U.N.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nearly-300-inmates-escape-after-floods-bring-down-prison-walls-in-northeast-nigeria/7786033.html	2024-09-16T06:59:06-07:00	
Saudi Arabia plans to allow tougher nuclear oversight by IAEA this year	Vienna — Saudi Arabia plans to scrap light-touch oversight of its nuclear facilities by the U.N. atomic watchdog and switch to regular safeguards by the end of this year, the kingdom said on Monday, a step the watchdog has long been calling for. Saudi Arabia has a nascent nuclear program that it wants to expand to eventually include activities like proliferation-sensitive uranium enrichment. It is unclear where its ambitions end, since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said for years it will develop nuclear weapons if regional rival Iran does. Riyadh has yet to fire up its first nuclear reactor, which allows its program to still be monitored under the Small Quantities Protocol (SQP), an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency that exempts less advanced states from many reporting obligations and inspections. 'The kingdom ... has submitted a request to the agency in July 2024 to rescind the Small Quantities Protocol and implement to the full Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement,' Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told the IAEA's annual General Conference, speaking through an interpreter. 'We are currently working with the agency to finalize all necessary subsidiary agreements for the SQP to be effectively rescinded by the end of December of this year.' Prince Abdulaziz announced a year ago that his country had decided to scrap the SQP but he did not say when it would switch and there were no immediate signs that it was following through. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi has been calling on the dozens of states that still have SQPs to amend or rescind them, calling them a 'weakness' in the global non-proliferation regime. The IAEA has for years been in talks with Riyadh on making the switch to a Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement that covers issues like inspections in countries that have ratified the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 'Saudi Arabia's decision to rescind its Small Quantities Protocol increases [the IAEA]'s ability to verify the peaceful use of nuclear material in the country,' Grossi said on social media platform X, adding he commended Riyadh for the move. Neither Grossi nor Prince Abdulaziz mentioned the Additional Protocol, a supplementary agreement that allows more thorough oversight than the CSA, including snap inspections by the agency. While the IAEA would like Saudi Arabia to sign the Additional Protocol, it has been unclear whether it will.	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-arabia-plans-to-allow-tougher-nuclear-oversight-by-iaea-this-year-/7786015.html	2024-09-16T06:49:05-07:00	
Coe among 7 candidates to succeed Bach as IOC president	Lausanne, Switzerland — World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe is the highest profile of the seven candidates to have declared on Monday their bid to succeed International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach. Coe will face stiff opposition from, among others, Kirsty Coventry, bidding to become the first woman and African to head the IOC, and cycling boss David Lappartient. The election will be at the IOC Session in Athens, which runs from March 18-21 next year. Bach, 70, is standing down after serving 12 years. The German announced at the end of the Paris Games that he would not be seeking another term. The other four candidates include two from Asia another continent never to have had an IOC president — Jordan's Prince Faisal al-Hussein and gymnastics chief Morinari Watanabe. Juan Antonio Samaranch Junior, whose father of the same name was IOC president from 1980-2001 and transformed it into a commercial powerhouse, and a surprise entrant, ski federation president Johan Eliasch, round up the candidates. First up for the septet is presenting their respective programs to the IOC members at the turn of the year. 'The candidates will present their programs, in camera, to the full IOC membership on the occasion of a meeting to be held in Lausanne (Switzerland) in January 2025,' read a short IOC statement unveiling the candidates. There will be a transition period post-election — not something Bach enjoyed when he succeeded Jacques Rogge in 2013 with the new president and his team assuming control in June.	https://www.voanews.com/a/coe-among-7-candidates-to-succeed-bach-as-ioc-president/7785995.html	2024-09-16T06:40:19-07:00	
Germany expands border controls to curb migrant arrivals	Frankfurt-Oder, Germany — Germany on Monday expanded border controls to the frontiers with all its nine neighbors in hopes of curbing the flow of irregular migrants, a move that has sparked protests from other EU members. Federal police in high-visibility vests braved rains at road and highway crossings for spot checks of passenger cars, buses and other vehicles, asking to see people's identity papers and checking the trunks of some cars. Germany lies at the heart of Europe and of the visa-free Schengen zone, which is designed to allow the free movement of people and goods, long a core idea of the European project. Berlin announced the sweeping measure last week following a string of deadly extremist attacks that have stoked public fears and boosted support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Poland and Austria have been among countries to complain about the move, which is set to last an initial six months. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the step aimed to limit irregular migration and 'put a stop to criminals and identify and stop Islamists at an early stage.' The controls slowed traffic, but some people voiced support. Elle Rendigs, 70, who was headed from Germany to the French city of Strasbourg, said she hoped the stepped-up policing would bring 'a bit more security.' Border controls with Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria and Switzerland were already in place before the crackdown was announced. These have now been expanded to Germany's borders with France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. Faeser said the government hoped to minimize the impact on people living and working in border regions, promising 'coordination with our neighboring countries.' On the Polish border, a small group of protesters stood near the bridge at Frankfurt on the Oder, one waving a placard that called for 'Open worlds, open minds, open borders.' The controls on the way into Frankfurt, on the German side, were 'not good for the city,' local resident Waltraut, 77, told AFP. Germany expanded the border controls after a string of suspected Islamist attacks stirred concerns over immigration. Last month, a man on a knife rampage killed three people and wounded eight more at a festival in the western city of Solingen. The Syrian suspect, who has alleged links to the Islamic State group, had been due to be deported but managed to evade authorities. With national elections looming next year, the attacks put intense political pressure on Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government to toughen its stance on migrants and asylum seekers. As well as increasing the extent of controls at its borders, Germany has presented plans to speed up deportations to European partners. Under EU rules, asylum requests are meant to be handled by the country of arrival. The system has placed a huge strain on countries on the European periphery, where leaders have demanded more burden-sharing. Under the new crackdown, spot controls can be carried out within 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the border, said Daniel Rosin, a spokesman for police in Kehl, across the border from Strasbourg. Police will operate not only along the roads, but on 'trams and cross-border trains' connecting the two countries, Rosin said. Covering hundreds of extra kilometers of borderland will 'definitely not be possible to do without any gaps,' German police union leader Andreas Rosskopf told broadcaster RBB. He said it remained to be seen 'how successful it actually is in curbing migration and people smuggling.' Rene Hemmert, 69, traveling from France to Germany, said the controls remind him 'of when I was younger,' before the Schengen zone was established. 'I think it's a good thing because of all the problems we have, with immigration,' said Hemmert. 'It's the same as in France, they should do the same.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-expands-border-controls-to-curb-migrant-arrivals/7785920.html	2024-09-16T05:44:37-07:00

UK PM Starmer meets Italy's Meloni for illegal immigration talks	Rome — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Monday to discuss tackling illegal immigration, a day after another Channel migrant shipwreck claimed eight lives. Starmer, whose center-left Labour Party was elected with a crushing parliamentary majority in July, has vowed to fight illegal immigration, a hot-button topic in British politics for years. 'Here, there's been some quite dramatic reduction [in migrant arrival numbers] so I want to understand how that came about,' Starmer said in Rome ahead of his meeting with Meloni. He was speaking while touring a national immigration coordination centre with Italy's interior minister, Matteo Piantedosi. Starmer was received with a welcome ceremony at 12:00 local time (10:00 GMT) at Rome's Villa Doria Pamphili before his meeting with Meloni. Far-right riots shook cities and towns across England and Northern Ireland shortly after Starmer's election, the U.K.'s worst unrest since 2011, with mosques and migrant accommodation centers often targeted. The perilous cross-Channel journeys migrants attempt from northern France have posed a fiendishly difficult problem to solve for successive British prime ministers Eight migrants died on Sunday after their overcrowded boat capsized in the Channel between France and England, bringing to 46 the number of people who have lost their lives this year trying to reach British shores. Around 800 people crossed the Channel on Saturday, the second-highest figure since the start of the year, according to the U.K. interior ministry. Starmer has rejected the previous Conservative government's plan to expel all undocumented migrants to Rwanda while their asylum claims are examined. Instead, U.K. media say he is interested in the strategy of Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party, whose country is on the front line of illegal migration into the European Union. Italy signed an agreement with Albania in November to open two centers in the Balkan country where undocumented migrants would be housed while their asylum claims are processed. Italy is to fund and manage the centers, which will be capable of accommodating up to 3,000 migrants who have arrived on Italian shores by boat. Migrants with rejected asylum claims would be sent back to their country of origin, whereas those with accepted applications will be granted entry to Italy. That is a key difference from the former U.K. government's Rwanda scheme, whereby migrants sent to the East African nation could never have settled in Britain irrespective of the outcome of their claim. Fewer arriving migrants While touring the migrant coordination center, Starmer said it looked like the lower migrant arrivals to Italy were due to 'work that's been done in some of the countries where people are coming from.' 'I’ve long believed, by the way, that prevention and stopping people travelling in the first place is one of the best ways to deal with this particular issue,' he added. Starmer's trip to Italy has already spurred criticism, even within his own party. Labour MP Kim Johnson told The Guardian newspaper it was 'disturbing that Starmer is seeking to learn lessons from a neo-fascist government, particularly after the anti-refugee riots and far-right racist terrorism that swept Britain this summer.' The newly appointed chief of the U.K.'s new Border Security Command, Martin Hewitt, was accompanying Starmer during his trip, his office said. Besides Albania, Meloni's government has also inked a deal with Tunisia, granting aid in exchange for greater efforts to stop Italy-bound migrants who leave the North African country and cross the Mediterranean. Italy has also renewed a controversial deal with the UN-backed Libyan government in Tripoli, dating from 2017, in which Rome provides training and funding to the Libyan coastguard in order to stem departures of migrants or return to Libya those already at sea. Human rights groups say the policy pushes thousands of migrants back to Libya to face torture and abuse under arbitrary detention. Since the start of the year, migrant arrivals to Italy by sea have dropped markedly, according to the interior ministry. Between January 1 and September 13, 44,675 people arrived in Italy compared to a figure of 125,806 for the same period in 2023. Across all the EU borders, meanwhile, the number of migrants crossing has dropped by 39 percent, according to border agency Frontex. But multiple factors are behind these trends, experts say, with many migrants seeking entry into the EU having changed their route. While the Balkan and Central Mediterranean migration routes saw flows fall significantly this year, by 77 percent and 64 percent respectively, the West African and Eastern land border routes recorded sharp increases, of 123 percent and 193 percent respectively. Crossings are up 13 percent over the Channel this year, Frontex said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-pm-starmer-meets-italy-s-meloni-for-illegal-immigration-talks-/7785869.html	2024-09-16T04:43:44-07:00	
Death toll rises as torrential rain and flooding force evacuations in Central Europe	PRAGUE — The death toll was rising in Central European countries on Sunday after days of heavy rains caused widespread flooding and forced evacuations. Several Central European nations have already been hit by severe flooding, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania. Slovakia and Hungary might come next as a result of a low pressure system from northern Italy dumping record rainfall in the region since Thursday. The floods have claimed six lives in Romania and one each in Austria and Poland. In the Czech Republic, four people who were swept away by waters were missing, police said. It's not over yet Most parts of the Czech Republic have been affected as authorities declared the highest flood warnings at around 100 places across the country. But the situation was worst in two northeastern regions that recorded the biggest rainfall in recent days, including the Jeseniky mountains near the Polish border. In the city of Opava, up to 10,000 people out of a population of around 56,000 have been asked to move to higher ground. Rescuers used boats to transport people to safety in a neighborhood flooded by the raging Opava River. 'There’s no reason to wait,' Mayor Tomáš Navrátil told Czech public radio. He said that the situation was worse than during the last devastating floods in 1997, known as the 'flood of the century.' 'We have to focus on saving lives,' Prime Minister Petr Fiala told Czech public television on Sunday. His government was set to meet Monday to assess the damages. The worst 'is not behind us yet,' the prime minister warned. President Petr Pavel sounded more optimistic, saying 'it's obvious we've learned a lesson from the previous crisis.' At least 4 missing and villages cut off Thousands of others also were evacuated in the towns of Krnov, which was almost completely flooded, and Cesky Tesin. The Oder River that flows to Poland was reaching extreme levels in the city of Ostrava and in Bohumin, prompting evacuations. Ostrava, the regional capital, is the third-largest Czech city. Mayor Jan Dohnal said the city will face major traffic disruptions in the days to come. Almost no trains were operating in the region. Towns and villages in the Jeseniky mountains, including the local center of Jesenik, were inundated and isolated by raging waters that turned roads into rivers. The military sent a helicopter to help with evacuations. Jesenik Mayor Zdenka Blistanova told Czech public television that several houses in her and other nearby towns have been destroyed by the floods. A number of bridges and roads have been badly damaged. About 260,000 households were without power Sunday morning in the entire country, while traffic was halted on many roads, including the major D1 highway. A firefighter dies as Lower Austria declared a disaster zone A firefighter died after 'slipping on stairs' while pumping out a flooded basement in the town of Tulln, the head of the fire department of Lower Austria, Dietmar Fahrafellner, told reporters on Sunday. Authorities declared the entire state of Lower Austria in the northeastern part of the country a disaster zone, while 10,000 relief forces have so far evacuated 1,100 houses there. Emergency personnel have started setting up accommodation for residents who had to flee their homes due to the flooding. The municipality of Lilienfeld with about 25,000 residents is cut off from the outside world. Residents were told to boil tap water as a precaution. In Vienna, the Wien River overflowed its banks, flooding homes and forcing first evacuations of nearby houses. Romania reports 2 more flooding victims Romanian authorities said Sunday that another two people had died in the hard-hit eastern county of Galati after four were reported dead there a day earlier, following unprecedented rain. Dramatic flooding in Poland In Poland, one person was presumed dead in floods in the southwest, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Sunday. Tusk said the situation was 'dramatic' around the town of Klodzko, with about 25,000 residents, located in a valley in the Sudetes mountains near the border with the Czech Republic. Helicopters were used to pick up people from roofs in a few cases. In Glucholazy, rising waters overflowed a river embankment and flooded streets and houses. Mayor Paweł Szymkowicz said, 'we are drowning,' and appealed to residents to evacuate to high ground. The weather change arrived following a hot start to September in the region. Scientists have documented Earth’s hottest summer, breaking a record set just a year ago. A hotter atmosphere, driven by human-caused climate change, can lead to more intense rainfall.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-rises-as-torrential-rain-and-flooding-force-evacuations-in-central-europe-/7785841.html	2024-09-16T04:08:01-07:00	
Vietnam puts typhoon losses at $1.6 billion	Hanoi — Typhoon Yagi caused $1.6 billion in economic losses in Vietnam, state media said Monday, as the UN's World Food Program said the deadly floods it triggered in Myanmar were the worst in the country's recent history. Yagi battered Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand with powerful winds and a huge dump of rain more than a week ago, triggering floods and landslides that have killed more than 400 people, according to official figures. It tore across Vietnam's densely populated Red River delta — a vital agricultural region that is also home to major manufacturing hubs — damaging factories and infrastructure, and inundating farmland. The typhoon caused an estimated $1.6 billion in economic losses, state media reported, citing an initial government assessment. The death toll in Vietnam stands at 292, with 38 missing, more than 230,000 homes damaged and 280,000 hectares of crops destroyed, according to authorities. In Myanmar, the ruling junta has reported 113 fatalities and said that more than 320,000 people have been forced from their homes into temporary relief camps. 'Super Typhoon Yagi has affected most of the country and caused the worst floods we have seen in Myanmar's recent history,' Sheela Matthew, WFP's representative in Myanmar, said in a statement, without giving precise details. Exact details of the impact on agriculture were not yet clear, she said. 'But I can say for sure that the impact on food security will be nothing less than devastating,' Matthew said. Severe flooding hit Myanmar in 2011 and 2015, with more than 100 deaths reported on both occasions, while in 2008 Cyclone Nargis left more than 138,000 people dead or missing. The latest crisis has prompted the junta to issue a rare appeal for foreign aid, with neighbor India responding with 10 tons of materials, including dry rations, clothing and medicine. Myanmar's military has blocked or frustrated humanitarian assistance from abroad in the past, including after powerful Cyclone Mocha last year when it suspended travel authorizations for aid groups trying to reach around a million people. Even before the latest floods, people in Myanmar were already grappling with the effects of three years of war between the junta and armed groups opposed to its rule, with millions forced from their homes by the conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-puts-typhoon-losses-at-1-6-billion-/7785829.html	2024-09-16T03:50:46-07:00	
Japan celebrates historic Emmys triumph for 'Shogun'	Osaka, Japan — Japan celebrated on Monday the record-breaking Emmy Awards triumph of 'Shogun', although many confessed not having watched the series about the country's warring dynasties in the feudal era. 'Shogun' smashed all-time records at the television awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, taking home an astounding 18 statuettes and becoming the first non-English-language winner of the highly coveted award for best drama series. Lead Hiroyuki Sanada, who played Lord Toranaga, became the first Japanese actor to win an Emmy, while Anna Sawai achieved the same for her performance as Lady Mariko. 'As a Japanese, I'm happy Sanada won,' Kiyoko Kanda, a 70-year-old pensioner, told AFP in Tokyo. 'He worked so hard since he moved to Los Angeles,' she said. 'In 'Last Samurai', Tom Cruise was the lead, but it's exciting Sanada is the main character in 'Shogun',' Kanda added. But she admitted that she only watched the trailer. The series is available only on Disney's streaming platform, which is relatively new in Japan. 'I want to watch it. I'm curious to know how Japan is portrayed,' Kanda said. Otsuka, who declined to give her first name, said she, too, has not watched the show. 'But I saw the news and I'm happy he won.' Sanada, now 63, began his acting career at the age of five in Tokyo and moved to LA after appearing in 'Last Samurai' in 2003. The words 'historic achievements' and 'Hiroyuki Sanada' were trending on X in Japanese, while Sanada's speech at the awards racked up tens of thousands of views. Yusuke Takizawa, 41, also only watched a trailer but he said he was amazed by the quality of the show. 'I was impressed by the high-spirited acting, the attention to detail and the film technology,' Takizawa told AFP outside Osaka Castle, a major historical location for the series. 'I think many young people will want to try their hand in Hollywood after watching Sanada,' he said. Tourists at the castle also welcomed the record Emmy win. 'I think was the best TV show that I've seen this year,' said Zara Ferjani, a visitor from London. 'I thought it was amazing... The direction was beautiful, and I really enjoyed watching something that wasn't in English as well,' the 33-year-old said. She said she had planned to watch 'Shogun' after returning home from Japan. 'But one of my friends strongly advised me to watch it beforehand, just to appreciate the culture more and definitely Osaka Castle more,' she added. - Breaking from cliches - Many in the Japanese film industry were also jubilant. 'He won after many years of trying hard in Hollywood. It's too cool,' wrote Shinichiro Ueda, director of the hit low-budget film 'One Cut of the Dead', on X. Video game creator and movie fan Hideo Kojima, who has described the show as 'Game of Thrones in 17th-century Japan', reposted a news story on the win. The drama, adapted from a popular novel by James Clavell and filmed in Canada, tells the tale of Lord Toranaga, who fights for his life against his enemies alongside Mariko and British sailor John Blackthorne. A previous TV adaptation made in 1980 was centered on Blackthorne's perspective. But the new 'Shogun' breaks away from decades of cliched and often bungled depictions of Japan in Western cinema, with Japanese spoken throughout most of the show. Sanada, who also co-produced the drama, is credited with bringing a new level of cultural and historical authenticity to 'Shogun.' An army of experts, including several wig technicians from Japan, worked behind the scenes to make the series realistic, poring over sets, costumes and the actors' movements.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-celebrates-historic-emmys-triumph-for-shogun-/7785820.html	2024-09-16T03:35:51-07:00	
Over 100 striking Samsung workers detained by Indian police for planning march	CHENNAI, India — Police on Monday detained 104 striking workers protesting low wages at a Samsung Electronics plant in southern India as they were planning a protest march without permission, with the dispute disrupting output at the key factory for the past week. The detention marks an escalation of a strike by workers at a Samsung home appliance plant near Chennai in the state of Tamil Nadu. Workers want higher wages and have stopped work at the plant that contributes roughly a third of Samsung's annual India revenue of $12 billion. The Samsung protests have cast a shadow on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan of courting foreign investors to 'Make in India' and his goal of tripling electronics production to $500 billion within six years. Lured by cheap labor, foreign companies are increasingly using India for manufacturing to diversify their supply chain beyond China. On Monday, the workers planned to start a protest march, but were detained as no permission was given since there are schools, colleges and hospitals in that area, said senior police officer of the Kancheepuram district K. Shanmugam. 'It is the main area which would become totally paralyzed and [the protest would] disturb public peace,' he said. 'We have detained them in wedding halls as all of them can't be in stations,' he said. Samsung workers since last week have been protesting at a makeshift tent near the plant, demanding higher wages, recognition for a union backed by influential labor group the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), and better working hours. Samsung is not keen to recognize any union backed by a national labor group such as the CITU, and talks with workers, as well as state government officials, have not yielded resolution. The CITU Tamil Nadu Deputy General Secretary, S. Kannan, condemned the police action, saying 'This is an archaic move by the state government.' Despite Monday's police action, 12 union groups, including one affiliated with the ruling party of Tamil Nadu, said in a public notice dated Sept. 11 that they will stage a protest in support of the striking workers in Chennai on Wednesday, a move that could intensify the tensions between the company and the workers. 'We are going ahead with Wednesday's protest ... no changes to the plan,' said A. Jenitan, a deputy district secretary for the CITU. The protests add to Samsung's challenges in India, a key growth market. The South Korean company is planning job cuts of up to 30% of its overseas staff in some divisions, including in India. And India's antitrust body has found Samsung and other smartphone companies colluded with e-commerce giants to launch devices exclusively, violating competition laws, Reuters has reported. Samsung did not respond to a request for comment on Monday, but on Friday said it has initiated discussions with workers at the Chennai plant 'to resolve all issues at the earliest.' Video footage from Reuters partner ANI showed dozens of Samsung workers wearing the company uniform of blue shirts being transported in a bus to a hall. The Samsung plant employs roughly 1,800 workers and more than 1,000 of them have been on strike. The factory makes appliances such as refrigerators, TVs and washing machines. Another Samsung plant that makes smartphones in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh has had no unrest. The police also detained one of CITU's senior leaders, E. Muthukumar, who was leading the Samsung protests at the factory near Chennai, according to the CITU's Jenitan. Kancheepuram police official Shanmugam said there was no timeline as to how long the workers will be detained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-100-striking-samsung-workers-detained-by-indian-police-for-planning-march-/7785787.html	2024-09-16T03:07:16-07:00	
Australia imposes more sanctions on Iran over human rights concerns	SYDNEY — Australia is imposing more sanctions on Iranian officials on the second anniversary of the jailing and death of Mahsa Jina Amini. The 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman was arrested in September 2022 for 'improperly' wearing her hijab. Australia’s Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong said Monday that Australia stood in solidarity 'with Iranian women and girls in their struggle for equality and empowerment.' Wong announced financial sanctions and travel bans on senior security and law enforcement officials who have allegedly been involved in the 'violent repression' of protests in Iran. She said the human rights situation in Iran was 'dire' as female activists continued to be detained and handed death sentences. Wong told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. that abuses by Iranian authorities have continued since the death of Amini two years ago. 'We have sanctioned five Iranian security and law enforcement officials who have been involved in these law enforcement so-called activities, which are ultimately a repression - a violent repression - of the Iranian people,' Wong said. Nikita White a campaigner with Amnesty International Australia, a rights group, told local media Monday that human rights have rapidly deteriorated in Iran. 'The people who are being executed are being executed after facing horrifically unfair trials,' White said. She said torture and and ill-treatment have been reported. Australia has now imposed sanctions on almost 200 individuals and organizations with links to Iran, including those associated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It was listed by Canada as a terrorist group earlier this year following a similar move by the United States in 2019. In Canberra on Monday, opposition lawmaker and shadow foreign affairs spokesperson Simon Birmingham urged the Australian government to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization. Earlier this month, Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi described sanctions announced by Britain, France and Germany as 'economic terrorism.' Araghchi has rejected U.S. claims that Tehran has sent ballistic missiles to Russia to help in its war with Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-imposes-more-sanctions-on-iran-over-human-rights-concerns/7785771.html	2024-09-16T02:27:13-07:00

Child abuse case puts banned Malaysian sect back in spotlight	Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — On its website, Global Ikhwan Services and Business Holdings (GISB) describes itself as a Malaysian conglomerate with a vision to implement the Islamic way of life in line with the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. But the rescue this week of hundreds of children and youths from what Malaysian authorities said was suspected sexual abuse at charity homes allegedly run by GISB has put back in the spotlight the firm's roots in a religious sect outlawed by the government three decades ago. GISB acknowledges links to the religious sect Al-Arqam, which was banned in 1994, and names the sect's late preacher Ashaari Muhammad as its founder, but has largely sought to distance itself from the group's practices and beliefs, which the government views as heretical. GISB has said it did not run the homes and has denied all allegations of abuse. In a video posted on Facebook, however, its chief executive said the firm had broken unspecified laws and that there were 'one or two' cases of sodomy at the youth homes. In 2011, GISB made headlines for its controversial views on sex and marriage, which included encouraging polygamous families and setting up the Obedient Wives' Club, a group that called on wives to submit to their spouses 'like prostitutes.' The police raids on the charity homes in two Malaysian states this week came after several Islamic leaders called on the government to probe GISB's activities. Abu Hafiz Salleh Hudin, a lecturer on Islam at the International Islamic University of Malaysia, said he was aware of reports made to Malaysia's Islamic Development Department (Jakim) about worker exploitation and deviant teachings at GISB as far back as a decade ago. 'They would stress that they were exploited, and they were not being paid for work,' he told Reuters, citing reports made by former GISB members. The former members had also held on to Al-Arqam's teachings and beliefs, Abu Hafiz added. Police say they are investigating other allegations, including money laundering. Authorities say they also plan to scrutinize religious schools run by GISB while Jakim said it would present a report into deviant teachings involving the firm to the cabinet. Police say most of the youths rescued from the homes in two Malaysian states were children of GISB members. Many showed signs of abuse, neglect and emotional trauma, while 13 had been sodomized, officials said on Friday. Residents in Bukit Beruntung, a town in which a police source and locals said authorities had raided several youth homes, expressed shock at the abuse allegations. 'If it's true, then that is really worrying,' said Mohd Khair Syafie, the imam of a surau, or Muslim prayer hall, in the town, some 50 km outside the capital. Ashaari Muhammad founded the Al-Arqam movement in 1968, which was initially focused on discussing religious issues. In the 1980s, the group, which had tens of thousands of followers, was condemned by Malaysia's religious authorities over what they said were deviant teachings by Ashaari, whose followers claimed he had supernatural powers and could defer death. Ashaari, who had five wives and 37 children, spent two years in prison in the 1990s and died in 2010. In 2006, Malaysia's government outlawed Rufaqa Corp, another company founded by Ashaari, which it described as an attempt to revive Al-Arqam. A Rufaqa official at the time denied it had an other agenda than preaching Islam and building its business. In an August interview with business daily The Malaysian Reserve, GISB said the company was rebranded from Rufaqa Corp and reiterated it was a commercial entity compliant with Islam. Munira Mustaffa, executive director of security consultancy Chasseur Group, said GISB's businesses appeared to help it 'hide under the veil of legitimacy.' 'Living in a country where they know they are being watched, GISB have been careful to present themselves as entrepreneurial individuals and legitimate businesspeople,' said Munira. 'But at the same time, they follow the same template as other isolationist communities or cults.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/child-abuse-case-puts-banned-malaysian-sect-back-in-spotlight/7785739.html	2024-09-16T00:51:15-07:00	
First conviction under Hong Kong's security law for wearing 'seditious' T-shirt	HONG KONG — A Hong Kong man on Monday pleaded guilty to sedition for wearing a T-shirt with a protest slogan, becoming the first person convicted under the city's new national security law passed in March. Chu Kai-pong, 27, pleaded guilty to one count of 'doing with a seditious intention an act.' Under the new security law, the maximum sentence for the offense has been expanded from two years to seven years in prison and could even go up to 10 years if 'collusion with foreign forces' was found involved. Chu was arrested on June 12 at a MTR station wearing a T-shirt with the slogan 'Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times' and a yellow mask printed with 'FDNOL'- the shorthand of another slogan, 'five demands, not one less.' Both slogans were frequently chanted in the huge, sometimes violent, pro-democracy protests in 2019 and June 12 was a key kick-off day of the months-long unrests. Chu told police that he wore the T-shirt to remind people of the protests, the court heard. Chief Magistrate Victor So, handpicked by the city leader John Lee to hear national security cases, adjourned the case to Thursday for sentencing. Hong Kong was returned from Britain to China in 1997 under Beijing's promise of guaranteeing its freedoms, including freedom of speech, would be protected under a 'one country, two systems' formula. Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020 punishing secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, after the months-long protests in the financial hub. In March 2024, Hong Kong passed a second new security law, a home-grown ordinance also known as 'Article 23' according to its parent provision in the city's mini constitution, the Basic Law. Critics, including the U.S. government have expressed concerns over the new security law and said the vaguely defined provisions regarding 'sedition' could be used to curb dissent. Hong Kong and Chinese officials have said it was necessary to plug 'loopholes' in the national security regime.	https://www.voanews.com/a/first-conviction-under-hong-kong-s-security-law-for-wearing-seditious-t-shirt/7785735.html	2024-09-16T00:39:30-07:00

Shogun' and 'Hacks' win top series Emmy Awards	LOS ANGELES — 'Hacks' won the comedy series at Sunday's Emmy Awards, topping 'The Bear,' which took home several of the night's honors. 'Shogun' won the best drama series win, collecting a whopping 18 Emmys for its first season, just one of several historic wins. Hiroyuki Sanada won best actor in a drama for 'Shogun' on Sunday night at the Emmy Awards, and Anna Sawai won best actress as they became the first two Japanese actors to win Emmys. Their wins gave the FX series momentum going into one of the night's top awards, where 'Shogun' won best drama series. 'The Bear' came back for seconds in a big way at the ceremony four times including best actor, best supporting actor and best supporting actress in a comedy, while British upstart 'Baby Reindeer' won four of its own, including best limited series. The star of FX's 'The Bear' Jeremy Allen White won best actor in a comedy for the second straight year, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach repeated as best supporting actor. A surprise came when Liza Colón-Zayas won best supporting actor over major competition. 'How could I have thought it would be possible to be in the presence of Meryl Streep and Carol Burnett,' Colón-Zayas said as tears welled in her eyes as she accepted the award on the stage of the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. She is the first Latina to win in the category. 'To all the Latinas who are looking at me,' she said, 'keep believing and vote.' Netflix's darkly quirky 'Baby Reindeer' won best actor and best writing for the show's creator and star Richard Gadd and best supporting actress for Jessica Gunning, who plays his tormentor. Accepting the best limited series award, Gadd urged the makers of television to take chances. 'The only constant across any success in television is good storytelling,' he said. 'Good storytelling that speaks to our times. So take risks, push boundaries. Explore the uncomfortable. Dare to fail in order to achieve.' 'Baby Reindeer' is based on a one man-stage show in which Gadd describes being sexually abused along with other emotional struggles. Accepting that award, he said, 'no matter how bad it gets, it always gets better.' The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Gadd has. Jodie Foster won her first Emmy to go with her two Oscars when she took best actress in a limited series for 'True Detective: Night Country.' The creator of 'The Bear' was also a repeat winner. Christopher Storer took his second straight Emmy for directing, an award handed out by reunited 'Happy Days' co-stars Ron Howard and Henry Winkler. White said backstage that he was watching in the wings as Colón-Zayas won and 'that was just the greatest.' He also shouted out two acting wins the show had already scored at last weekend's Creative Arts Emmy Awards, when Jamie Lee Curtis won best guest actress in a comedy for playing his mother, and Jon Bernthal won best guest actor for playing his big brother. 'The Bear' won six times including most of the top comedy categories at the strike-delayed Emmys in January. While the third season of FX's 'The Bear' has already dropped, the trio won their second Emmys for its second, in which White's chef Carmen 'Carmy' Berzatto attempts to turn his family's grungy Chicago sandwich shop into an elite restaurant. It could still win more Sunday night including best comedy series. The father-son hosting duo of Eugene and Dan Levy in their monologue at the top of the show mocked the very dramatic 'The Bear' being in the comedy category. 'In honor of 'The Bear' we will be making no jokes,' Eugene Levy said, to laughs. Jean Smart won best actress in a comedy for 'Hacks.' She has won for all three seasons of 'Hacks,' and has six Emmys overall. She beat nominees including Ayo Edebiri, who as co-star of 'The Bear' moved from supporting actress, which she won in January, to lead actress. Coming into the show the big story was 'Shogun,' which had already taken the most Emmys for a show in a single season with 14 at the Creative Arts ceremony. The FX series about lordly politicking in feudal Japan can still win best drama series. If 'Shogun' faces competition for the best drama prize, it could come for the sixth and final season of 'The Crown,' the only show among the nominees that has won before in a category recently dominated by the retired 'Succession.' Elizabeth Debicki took best supporting actress in a drama for playing Princess Diana at the end of her life in the sixth and final season of the show. 'Playing this part, based on this unparalleled, incredible human being, has been my great privilege,' Debicki said. 'It's been a gift.' Billy Crudup won best actor in a drama for 'The Morning Show.' Streep wasn't the only Oscar winner trumped by a little-known name. Robert Downey Jr., the reigning best supporting actor winner for 'Oppenheimer,' was considered the favorite to win best supporting actor in a limited series for 'The Sympathizer,' but that award went to Lamorne Morris for 'Fargo.' 'Robert Downey Jr. I have a poster of you in my house!' Morris said from the stage as he accepted his first Emmy. Several awards were presented by themed teams from TV history, including sitcom dads George Lopez, Damon Wayans and Jesse Tyler Ferguson and TV moms Meredith Baxter, Connie Britton, and Susan Kelechi Watson.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shogun-and-hacks-win-top-series-emmy-awards/7785693.html	2024-09-15T20:31:58-07:00

Shy penguin wins New Zealand's bird election	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — It's noisy, smelly, shy – and New Zealand's bird of the year. The hoiho, or yellow-eyed penguin, won the country's fiercely fought avian election on Monday, offering hope to supporters of the endangered bird that recognition from its victory might prompt a revival of the species. It followed a campaign for the annual Bird of the Year vote that was absent the foreign interference scandals and cheating controversies of past polls. Instead, campaigners in the long-running contest sought votes in the usual ways — launching meme wars, seeking celebrity endorsements and even getting tattoos to prove their loyalty. More than 50,000 people voted in the poll, 300,000 fewer than last year, when British late night host John Oliver drove a humorous campaign for the pūteketeke — a 'deeply weird bird' which eats and vomits its own feathers – securing a landslide win. This year, the number of votes cast represented 10% of the population of New Zealand — a country where nature is never far away and where a love of native birds is instilled in citizens from childhood. 'Birds are our heart and soul,' said Emma Rawson, who campaigned for the fourth-placed ruru, a small brown owl with a melancholic call. New Zealand's only native mammals are bats and marine species, putting the spotlight on its birds, which are beloved — and often rare. This year's victor, the hoiho — its name means 'noise shouter' in the Māori language — is a shy bird thought to be the world's rarest penguin. Only found on New Zealand's South and Chatham islands — and on subantarctic islands south of the country — numbers have dropped perilously by 78% in the past 15 years. 'This spotlight couldn't have come at a better time. This iconic penguin is disappearing from mainland Aotearoa before our eyes,' Nicola Toki, chief executive of Forest & Bird — the organization that runs the poll — said in a press release, using the Māori name for New Zealand. Despite intensive conservation efforts on land, she said, the birds drown in nets and sea and can't find enough food. 'The campaign has raised awareness, but what we really hope is that it brings tangible support,' said Charlie Buchan, campaign manager for the hoiho. But while the bird is struggling, it attracted a star billing in the poll: celebrity endorsements flew in from English zoologist Jane Goodall, host of the Amazing Race Phil Keoghan, and two former New Zealand prime ministers. Aspiring bird campaign managers — this year ranging from power companies to high school students — submit applications to Forest & Bird for the posts. The hoiho bid was run by a collective of wildlife groups, a museum, a brewery and a rugby team in the city of Dunedin, where the bird is found on mainland New Zealand, making it the highest-powered campaign of the 2024 vote. 'I do feel like we were the scrappy underdog,' said Emily Bull, a spokesperson for the runner-up campaign, for the karure — a small, 'goth' black robin only found on New Zealand's Chatham Island. The karure's bid was directed by the students' association at Victoria University of Wellington, prompting fierce skirmish on the college campus when the student magazine staged an opposing campaign for the kororā, or little blue penguin. The rivalry provoked a meme war and students in bird costumes. Several people got tattoos. When the magazine's campaign secured endorsements of the city council and local zoo, Bull despaired for the black robin's bid. But the karure – which has performed a real-life comeback since the 1980s, with conservation efforts increasing the species from five birds to 250 – took second place overall. This weekend as Rawson wrapped up her campaign for the ruru, she too took her efforts directly to the people, courting votes at a local dog park. The veteran campaign manager who has directed the bids for other birds in past years was rewarded by the ruru placing fourth in the poll, her best ever result. 'I have not been in human political campaigning before,' said Rawson, who is drawn to the competition because of the funds and awareness it generates. The campaign struck a more sedate tone this year, she added. 'There's been no international interference, even though that was actually a lot of fun,' she said, referring to Oliver's high-profile campaign. It was not the only controversy the election has seen. While anyone in the world can vote, Forest & Bird now requires electors to verify their ballots after foreign interference plagued the contest before. In 2018, Australian pranksters cast hundreds of fraudulent votes in favor of the shag. The following year, Forest & Bird was forced to clarify that a flurry of votes from Russia appeared to be from legitimate bird-lovers. While campaigns are fiercely competitive, managers described tactics more akin to pro wrestling — in which fights are scripted — than divisive political contests. 'Sometimes people want to make posts that are kind of like beefy with you and they'll always message you and be like, hey, is it okay if I post this?' Bull said. 'There is a really sweet community. It's really wholesome.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/shy-penguin-wins-new-zealand-s-bird-election/7785679.html	2024-09-15T19:38:58-07:00	
Hundreds march in Brazil to support religious freedom	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil — Practitioners of different religious traditions marched down Rio de Janeiro's iconic Copacabana Beach on Sunday to support religious freedom in Brazil, where cases of intolerance have doubled over the past six years. Hundreds of men, women and children from more than a dozen faiths participated in the event, known as the March for the Defense of Religious Freedom. Many of the participants were practitioners of Afro-Brazilian religions that have recently faced attacks from members of Christian groups. Brazil's recently appointed Minister for Human Rights Macaé Evaristo also joined the march, which was held for the 17th consecutive year. 'The great challenge today in our country is to reduce inequality,' Evaristo told the state-run Agencia Brasil news agency. 'So for me it is very important to be present in this march, because the people here are also struggling for many things like decent work and a life free from hunger.' In Rio de Janeiro state, which is home to a quarter of the practitioners of Afro-Brazilian religions, there's been a proliferation of evangelical Christianity, particularly neo-Pentecostal churches founded since 1970 that focus on spreading their faith among non-believers. Experts say that while most neo-Pentecostal proselytizing is peaceful, the spread of the faith has been accompanied by a surge of intolerance for traditional African-influenced religions, ranging from verbal abuse and discrimination to destruction of temples and forced expulsion from neighborhoods. 'Everything that comes from Black people, everything that comes from people of African origin is devalued; if we are not firm in our faith, we will lose strength,' said Vania Vieira, a practitioner of the Afro-Brazilian religion Candomblé. 'This walk is to show that we are standing, that we will survive.' While the Brazilian constitution protects the free exercise of religion, cases of disrespect and attacks, especially against groups of African origin, have become increasingly frequent. Between 2018 and 2023, the Brazilian government's complaint service recorded an increase of 140% in the number of complaints of religious intolerance in the country. In Brazil, those who commit crimes of religious intolerance can face up to five years in prison, as well as a fine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-march-in-brazil-to-support-religious-freedom-/7785675.html	2024-09-15T19:29:39-07:00	
Small town in Kansas finds itself at the center of abortion debate	PITTSBURG, Kan. — The Rev. Anthony Navaratnam stood before his congregation and urged them to pray for the women from surrounding states who will flock to the new abortion clinic in town that opened in August. 'God is giving us an opportunity to be missionaries in Pittsburg, Kansas,' he told those at Flag Church, which hosted a training on how to protest outside of the clinic. The debate over reproductive rights has landed in this college town of 20,000 in the southeast corner of one of the few states left in the region still allowing abortions. It is near Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas and not terribly far from Texas. A place this size, especially one in a historically red state, was unlikely to have an abortion clinic before Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. Since then, Kansas has become one of five states that people are most likely to travel to in order to get an abortion when they're unable to at home, said Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College who researches abortion policies. Abortions spiked in Kansas by 152% after Roe, according to a recent analysis by the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. Using Myers' count, six of the clinics in Kansas, Illinois, New Mexico, North Carolina and Virginia that have opened or relocated post-Roe are in communities with fewer than 25,000 people. Two others are in communities of fewer than 50,000. 'Kansas is really the only one in this region that can provide care to many people in these surrounding states,' said Kensey Wright, a member of the board of directors for the Roe Fund in Oklahoma, which supports Kansas abortion clinics through grants. 'Without abortion clinics in that state, we would be without hope,' Wright said. Providing abortions for out-of-state people Housed in a former urology office, Pittsburg's Planned Parenthood clinic sits across the street from a medical clinic run by a Catholic health care system. Behind the clinic are houses. Clinic manager Logan Rink said her mother used to work in this building as a nurse — a connection that's 'small-town stuff.' She loves this town, and said her neighbors agree the clinic is needed. But she was guarded in her optimism, saying ' the reception that we are going to get from the community is going to be favorable in some ways and probably not always.' Experts said smaller-sized clinics can be less overwhelming for women who are coming from rural areas, like those surrounding Pittsburg. But there is no anonymity in these smaller communities, where religious and family ties often run deep. Pittsburg was established in 1876, and settled largely by immigrants from Catholic-leaning countries who came to work at surrounding coal mines. There's a typical main street and a state university with about 7,400 students. 'In a small town, it's not just that you'll know that person. Your family will know them. You will have known them for 40 years,' said Dr. Emily Walters, a supporter of the Pittsburg clinic who works as an anesthesiologist at a hospital in neighboring Missouri. 'Your stories will be intertwined.' She wondered aloud, 'How do I see you at a protest and then see you the next day at the grocery store and still be able to be polite and civil with each other?' Walters also chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party in an area that is increasingly Republican and has no Democratic state legislators — a change from 20 years ago when there were six. The county also has become increasingly religious in the same span; it now has twice as many white evangelical Protestants as the national average, and slightly more Catholics, according to the Public Religion Research Institute. Just five weeks after Roe was overturned in 2022, voters in Kansas had to decide whether to strip the right to an abortion from the state constitution, which could have led to an outright ban. Despite the Republican and religious leanings, 55% of Crawford County voters were part of the 59% of voters statewide who killed the proposal. It's in line with an Associated Press-NORC poll from 2024 that showed 6 in 10 Americans think their state should generally allow a person to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason. But the rural counties that surrounded Pittsburg chose otherwise at the ballot box. 'I remember people were stealing yard signs, putting up different ones in people's yards,' said Anastin Journot, an 18-year-old from Independence, Kansas, who is majoring in elementary education at Pittsburg State. She said she was alarmed by Roe getting overturned, remembering she thought: 'What if I'm in a situation where I'm needing to get an abortion and it's not an option?' Abortion in Kansas is generally legal up until the 22nd week of pregnancy. The clinic's southern location puts it closer to states that have banned abortions instead of sending people to Kansas' larger cities, where hours have been expanded and appointments are still in short supply. About 60% to 65% of people who call Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas for an abortion appointment are turned away because there isn't enough capacity, said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. Already, Wales said, the bulk of people seeking abortions in Kansas are from out of state — mostly Texas, which is about five hours south. After that, it's Missouri, a few minutes' drive east and Oklahoma, less than an hour away. She said some come from as far away as Louisiana and even Florida, which now prohibits the procedure after six weeks. Clinics 'strategically placed near (a state's) border can really help ease the congestion,' said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health scientist at the University of California San Francisco who studies abortion. Most of the area that's 100 miles from the new clinic has been designated as medically underserved for primary care by the federal government, and the number of obstetricians and gynecologists for every 100,000 female residents is less than half of the U.S. average. For now, though, the focus at the Pittsburg clinic will be on abortion. Wales said Planned Parenthood wants to slowly add more services over the next two to three months, and one future goal for the clinic is to provide gender-affirming care. Neighboring states have restricted that, too. 'Pittsburg is going to lift up a whole lot of states in the South and help people get care,' Wales said. But those additions, she added, will come after staff gets used to the patients and the presence of protesters and opposition. Protesters are at the ready Donations are up at Vie Medical Clinic, the town's crisis pregnancy center, executive director Megan Newman said. Such centers are typically religiously affiliated and encourage clients to continue their pregnancies. People opposed to the Planned Parenthood clinic also are picking up pamphlets about Vie so they can hand them out to those seeking abortions. 'When we got word that Planned Parenthood was coming, you could just kind of feel that in the town,' Newman said. Jeanne Napier, a 68-year-old who attends a local Baptist church, vowed as she shopped at the local mall that she'll 'be there every day with signs.' Her daughter, Terri Napier, said in a phone interview she believes part of her parents' opposition to the clinic is from watching her struggle about 20 years ago. She was in an abusive relationship with someone who has since died. She got pregnant. The family was fearful of bringing a child into the situation. She had an abortion and spiraled into drug use. 'I was at war with forgiving myself,' said the 43-year-old, who is now clean. Jeanne Napier said she felt like she encouraged the abortion. 'And I hate that,' she said, 'because I wish I could take that sin upon myself, so it's real personal. I had an active play in terminating a life, and we don't have that right.' Brianna Barnes, a 19-year-old journalism major at Pittsburg State who is from Wichita, has protested and prayed outside of a clinic in her hometown. 'If someone made eye contact with us, we just smiled at them, kind of showing that love and care because no one responds well to screaming, yelling, violence no matter what side it's on,' she said just after arriving on campus for the fall semester. Most of the students the AP talked to voiced support for the clinic. Her mother, Crystal Barnes, 42, turned to her daughter: 'You're going to be the odd man out being a Catholic, and conservative, especially with things like abortion. It is so heated.' The Friday before the clinic opened, crews installed a wooden facade outside, the air filled with the smell of fresh-cut lumber. Walters, the local anesthesiologist, had stopped by to check on the progress. Walters' support comes from a personal place. When she was 20 and the same number of weeks pregnant, she went to an emergency room, bleeding. She said she was sent home to miscarry instead of having her labor induced or having a procedure to remove the fetus. That experience — 'horrific, and wouldn't be considered standard of care, in modern practice,' she said — left her with a deep empathy for women in tough positions. Just before the 2022 vote, an ad backed by 400 Kansas doctors who support abortion rights ran in some of the state's largest papers, including The Kansas City Star. Walters' name was listed first. During that time, her home address appeared online, a frightening prospect in a state where abortion provider Dr. George Tiller was shot dead in 2009 at his Wichita church by an anti-abortion extremist. 'It is critical health care for women,' she said. 'It is going to be disruptive to Pittsburg. And that part hurts my heart.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/small-town-in-kansas-finds-itself-at-the-center-of-abortion-debate/7785670.html	2024-09-15T19:16:04-07:00	
Tropical Storm Ileana weakens to a depression	MEXICO CITY — Storm Ileana has weakened to a tropical depression, the National Hurricane Center said Sunday. The tropical storm formed Thursday off Mexico's Pacific coast as it moved ashore, making landfall on the coast of the Mexican state of Sinaloa on Saturday, a day after it pounded the resort-studded Los Cabos. On Sunday, wind speed dropped to 55 kph, NOAA said in an advisory, as Ileana was nearly 45 kilometers southwest of Los Mochis, Mexico, and moving west-northwest at 4 kph. It also forecasts the storm to become a remnant low — a post-tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds less than 34 knots. On Friday, a warning had been in effect for portions of the Baja California Peninsula, including Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo. Juan Manuel Arce Ortega, from Los Cabos Civil Protection, said the municipalities of La Paz and Los Cabos had suspended classes in schools because of the storm. Authorities prepared 20 temporary shelters in San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas, according to Los Cabos Civil Protection. At the Hacienda Beach Club and Residences in Cabo San Lucas, valet worker Alan Galvan said the rain arrived late Thursday night and has been constant. 'The rain isn't very strong right now, but the waves are choppy,' he said. 'The guests are very calm and already came down for coffee,' Galvan said. 'There's some flights canceled but everything is OK at the moment.' The rain remained consistent through Los Cabos Friday afternoon, with several roads flooded and some resorts stacking up sandbags on their perimeters. Some people were still walking around boat docks with their umbrellas. 'The priority has to be safety, starting with the workers. We always have to check on our colleagues who live in risk areas,' said Lyzzette Liceaga, a tour operator at Los Cabos. Ileana was the only active tropical storm in the National Weather Service's Eastern Pacific basin on Friday. In the Atlantic basin, post-tropical cyclone Francine was bringing heavy rain to parts of the southern United States, and Tropical Storm Gordon formed on Friday in the Atlantic Ocean, with forecasters saying it is expected to remain over open water for several days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-ileana-weakens-to-a-depression/7785661.html	2024-09-15T19:00:18-07:00	
Which candidate is better for tech innovation? Venture capitalists divided on Harris or Trump	LOS ANGELES — Being a venture capitalist carries a lot of prestige in Silicon Valley. Those who choose which startups to fund see themselves as fostering the next big waves of technology. So when some of the industry's biggest names endorsed former President Donald Trump and the onetime venture capitalist he picked for a running mate, JD Vance, people took notice. Then hundreds of other venture capitalists — some high profile, others lesser-known — threw their weight behind Vice President Kamala Harris, drawing battle lines over which presidential candidate will be better for tech innovation and the conditions startups need to thrive. Venture capitalist and Harris backer Stephen DeBerry says some of his best friends support Trump. Though centered in a part of Northern California known for liberal politics, the investors who help finance the tech industry have long been a more politically divided bunch. 'We ski together. Our families are together. We're super tight,' said DeBerry, who runs the Bronze Venture Fund. 'This is not about not being able to talk to each other. I love these guys — they're almost all guys. They're dear friends. We just have a difference of perspective on policy issues.' It remains to be seen if the more than 700 venture capitalists who've voiced support for a movement called 'VCs for Kamala' will match the pledges of Trump's well-heeled supporters such as Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. 'There are a lot of practical reasons for VCs to support Trump,' including policies that could drive corporate profits and stock market values and favor wealthy benefactors, said David Cowan, an investor at Bessemer Venture Partners. But Cowan said he is supporting Harris as a VC with a 'long-term investment horizon' because a 'Trump world reeling from rampant income inequality, raging wars and global warming is not an attractive environment' for funding healthy businesses. Several prominent VCs have voiced their support for Trump on Musk's social platform X. Public records show some of them have donated to a new, pro-Trump super PAC called America PAC, whose donors include powerful tech industry conservatives with ties to SpaceX and Paypal and who run in Musk's social circle. Also driving support is Trump's embrace of cryptocurrency and promise to end an enforcement crackdown on the industry. Although some Biden policies have alienated parts of the investment sector concerned about tax policy, antitrust scrutiny or overregulation, Harris' bid for the presidency has reenergized interest from VCs who until recently sat on the sidelines. 'We buy risk, right? And we're trying to buy the right type of risk,' Leslie Feinzaig, founder of 'VCs for Kamala' said in an interview. 'It's really hard for these companies that are trying to build products and scale to do so in an unpredictable institutional environment.' The schism in tech has left some firms split in their allegiances. Although venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, founders of the firm that is their namesake, endorsed Trump, one of their firm's general partners, John O'Farrell, pledged his support for Harris. O'Farrell declined further comment. Doug Leone, the former managing partner of Sequoia Capital, endorsed Trump in June, expressing concern on X 'about the general direction of our country, the state of our broken immigration system, the ballooning deficit, and the foreign policy missteps, among other issues.' But Leone's longtime business partner at Sequoia, Michael Moritz, wrote in the Financial Times that tech leaders supporting Trump 'are making a big mistake.' Much of the VC discourse about elections is in response to a July podcast and manifesto in which Andreessen and Horowitz backed Trump and outlined their vision of a 'Little Tech Agenda' that they said contrasted with the policies sought by Big Tech. They accused the U.S. government of increasing hostility toward startups and the VCs who fund them, citing Biden's proposed higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations and regulations they said could hobble emerging industries involving blockchain and artificial intelligence. Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio who spent time in San Francisco working at Thiel's investment firm, voiced a similar perspective about 'little tech' more than a month before he was chosen as Trump's running mate. 'The donors who were really involved in Silicon Valley in a pro-Trump way, they're not big tech, right? They're little tech. They're starting innovative companies. They don't want the government to destroy their ability to innovate,' Vance said in an interview on Fox News in June. Complicating the allegiances is that a tough approach to breaking up the monopoly power of big corporations no longer falls along partisan lines. Vance has spoken favorably of Lina Khan, who Biden picked to lead the Federal Trade Commission and has taken on several tech giants. Meanwhile, some of the most influential VCs backing Harris — such as LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman; and Sun Microsystems co-founder Vinod Khosla, an early investor in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI — have sharply criticized Khan's approach. U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat whose California district encompasses part of Silicon Valley, said Trump supporters are a vocal minority reflecting a 'third or less' of the region's tech community. But while the White House has appealed to tech entrepreneurs with its investments in clean energy, electric vehicles and semiconductors, Khanna said Democrats must do a better job of showing that they understand the appeal of digital assets. Naseem Sayani, a general partner at Emmeline Ventures, said Andreessen and Horowitz's support of Trump became a lightning rod for those in tech who do not back the Republican nominee. Sayani signed onto 'VCs for Kamala,' she said, because she wanted the types of businesses that she helps fund to know that the investor community is not monolithic. 'We're not single-profile founders anymore,' she said. 'There's women, there's people of color, there's all the intersections. How can they feel comfortable building businesses when the environment they're in doesn't actually support their existence in some ways?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/which-candidate-is-better-for-tech-innovation-venture-capitalists-divided-on-harris-or-trump/7785654.html	2024-09-15T18:39:00-07:00	
Trump safe after second assassination attempt, authorities say	washington — For the second time in nine weeks, former President Donald Trump walked away from an assassination attempt – the latest, on Sunday afternoon, at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, authorities said. Officials said Trump was not hurt, and that the shooter was spotted and fired on first by members of Trump’s security detail. Various national media sources, including The Associated Press, The New York Times and Fox News Channel, cited unnamed law enforcement officials who identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, of Hawaii. Those officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation. Unlike the previous attempt, this one did not happen on live television, like the dramatic shooting Trump survived on July 13. That attempt wounded Trump in the ear and killed a man attending the rally behind Trump. Days later, Trump accepted the Republican party’s presidential nomination. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is leading the case, has described it as 'what appears to be an attempted assassination.' That makes this the agency’s second ongoing investigation into an attempt on Trump’s life. The local sheriff said the suspect fled, leaving behind an 'AK-47-style rifle' with a scope, a GoPro camera and two backpacks. Police later caught him as he sped on the main highway into a neighboring county. 'The Secret Service agent that was on the course did a fantastic job,' said Sheriff Ric Bradshaw of the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, in a briefing held by law enforcement shortly after. 'What they do is they have an agent that jumps one hole ahead of time to where the president was at. And he was able to spot this rifle barrel sticking out of the fence and immediately engage that individual, at which time the individual took off.' In a joint statement sent out to journalists less than an hour after the Trump campaign announced this latest attempt on Trump’s life, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris said they were being regularly briefed and said they are 'relieved' that he is safe. 'The president and vice president have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing,' their statement read. 'They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team.' And in evening statement, Biden reiterated his message from the July shooting. 'As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country, and I have directed my team to continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former President’s continued safety,' he said. And Harris issued a shorter, solo statement on social media, in which she said, 'Violence has no place in America.' Trump has not reacted to this latest turn of events on the social media platform he owns. However, in an email to supporters, Trump said: 'There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!' And so, as dawn rises and questions swirl in America about how this will impact what has already been a tumultuous election season as America hurtles toward November. Trump has not announced any changes to his schedule and is set to speak live on X on Monday night from his Mar-a-Lago resort to launch his sons’ crypto platform. Meanwhile, the leaders of a congressional bipartisan task force investigating the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump said they have requested a briefing by the Secret Service. Some of the material for this story is from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-safe-after-second-assassination-attempt-authorities-say-/7785638.html	2024-09-15T18:02:48-07:00	
Mali, Burkina and Niger to launch new biometric passports	Bamako, Mali — Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger will soon launch new biometric passports, Mali's military leader Colonel Assimi Goita said Sunday, as the junta-led states look to solidify their alliance after splitting from regional bloc ECOWAS. The three Sahel nations, all under military rule following a string of coups since 2020, joined together last September under the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), after severing ties with former colonial ruler France and pivoting toward Russia. They then said in January that they were turning their backs on the Economic Community of West African States — an organization they accused of being manipulated by France. In July, the allies consolidated their ties with the creation of a Confederation of Sahel States which will be chaired by Mali in its first year and groups some 72 million people. 'In the coming days, a new biometric passport of the AES will be put into circulation with the aim of harmonizing travel documents in our common area,' Goita said during a televised address late Sunday. 'We will be working to put in place the infrastructure needed to strengthen the connectivity of our territories through transport, communications networks and information technology,' he said. The announcement came a day before the three states are due to mark the one-year anniversary of the alliance's creation. The neighbors are all battling jihadi violence that erupted in northern Mali in 2012 and spread to Niger and Burkina Faso in 2015. The unrest is estimated to have killed thousands and displaced millions across the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mali-burkina-and-niger-to-launch-new-biometric-passports/7785514.html	2024-09-15T17:00:09-07:00	
Environmental activist who feared for life killed in Honduras	Tegucigalpa, Honduras — An anti-mining activist was shot and killed in Honduras, President Xiomara Castro said, vowing justice for the latest such murder in one of the world's most dangerous countries for environmentalists. Juan Lopez, 46, was gunned down as he left church Saturday in the northeastern town of Tocoa, his widow Thelma Pena told AFP. Castro condemned the 'vile murder' in a post on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, late Saturday and said she had ordered an investigation. 'Justice for Juan Lopez,' Castro wrote. Lopez, who belonged to the ruling Libre party, campaigned against open-pit iron ore mining in a forest reserve in the vicinity of Tocoa, where he worked in the town hall. In an interview with AFP in 2021, Lopez discussed the risks that he said environmental activists face in this poor and violent Central American country. 'If you start defending common interests in this country,' he said, 'you clash with major interests.' 'If you leave home, you always have in mind that you do not know what might happen, if you are going to return,' said Lopez. At a recent news conference, the activist called for the resignation of Libre officials caught on video negotiating bribes with drug traffickers in 2013. That video recently ensnared Carlos Zelaya, a brother-in-law of the president. He resigned his seat in congress after admitting he took part in that meeting with drug gangsters. The U.N. country representative of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Isabel Albaladejo, urged investigators to consider 'possible reprisals' against Lopez for his demand for a local mayor to resign for alleged links to organized crime. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights had ordered protective measures for Lopez due to threats against him and other environmentalists from Tocoa. Fellow rights defender Joaquin Mejia paid tribute to the environmentalist, calling him 'a comrade committed to social change.' Mejia accused authorities of failing to 'fulfill their obligation' to protect Lopez. Honduran Attorney General Johel Zelaya said the 'reprehensible' murder would not go unpunished, and paid tribute to Lopez's activism. 'His life was an example of struggle. He never gave up in his incessant battle, hand-in-hand with the people to preserve natural resources,' Zelaya said on X. The NGO Global Witness says Honduras is one of the world's most dangerous countries for environmental activists. In 2023 it was ranked third in the world for the number of killings of such activists at 18, tied with Mexico. The top two were Colombia and Brazil. The organization said that from 2012 to 2023, 148 environmental campaigners were killed in Honduras. They include Berta Caceres, a high-profile opponent of a controversial hydroelectric dam who was murdered in 2016. A council of Indigenous organizations co-founded by Caceres said that the Honduran state and Castro's government were 'responsible for this new murder by not guaranteeing Juan's life.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/environmental-activist-who-feared-for-life-killed-in-honduras/7785300.html	2024-09-15T16:57:28-07:00

Trump shooting incident, reminder of past assassination attempts against US leaders	Washington — The FBI is investigating what it said was another assassination attempt on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The incident occurred Sunday at the Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach in Florida where Trump, the former president, was golfing. Law enforcement officials said Secret Service saw a man with a rifle in the bushes and shot at the suspected assassin. The suspect fled the bushes and was later apprehended on a highway, according to law enforcement. Previous attempt on Trump In July, Trump was shot by a gunman during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in what the FBI said was an attempted assassination. The former president was wounded in the ear. The Congressional Research Service says direct assaults against presidents, presidents-elect, and candidates have occurred on at least 15 separate occasions, with five resulting in death. Below is a list of other previous attempts on the lives of American leaders, successful or not. Assassinations Four U.S. presidents were assassinated while in office. Abraham Lincoln: Killed in 1865 by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theater in Washington. James Garfield: Shot in 1881 in Washington at a train station and died of his wounds two and a half months later. William McKinley: Assassinated in 1901 by an anarchist in Buffalo, New York. John F. Kennedy: Assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963 in Dallas, Texas, as the president rode in a motorcade. Leaders who survived assassination attempts Four presidents were wounded but survived assassination attempts, while in office or afterward. Donald Trump: Trump had just started a campaign speech in Pennsylvania on July 13 when shots rang out. Trump was shot in the ear. He was rushed by security officials to a black SUV. Ronald Reagan: He was shot in 1981 outside the Hilton Hotel in Washington. Reagan was wounded when one of the bullets ricocheted off a limousine and struck him under the left armpit. Gerald Ford: Survived two attempts on his life in less than three weeks in 1975 without being hurt. Theodore Roosevelt: He was shot in the chest in 1912 while campaigning for election in Milwaukee but insisted on delivering his speech to supporters before being taken to a hospital. Assassination attempts on other US leaders Robert F. Kennedy: A U.S. presidential candidate, and a U.S. senator, Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 by a gunman in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Alabama Governor George C. Wallace: A candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, he was shot in 1972 and became paralyzed from the waist down.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-shooting-incident-reminder-of-past-assassination-attempts-against-us-leaders/7785285.html	2024-09-15T16:22:09-07:00	
Emmys return with 'Shogun' and 'The Bear' leading the pack	Los Angeles — Hollywood will dole out the annual Emmy Awards, the highest honors in television, Sunday at a red-carpet ceremony where the historical drama 'Shogun' and restaurant tale 'The Bear' are poised to dominate the night. 'Shogun,' a lavish epic about a power struggle in 17th-century Japan, is the front-runner to take the night's top trophy for best drama series, according to awards pundits. Reigning best comedy champion 'The Bear' is expected to claim that prize again. Both shows debuted on the FX cable network and stream on Hulu, setting up a big night for owner Walt Disney and its TV chief Dana Walden. Sunday's ceremony will take place just eight months after the last Emmys, which aired in an unusual January slot because of disruptions caused by Hollywood labor strikes. Back on a September schedule, the show will air live from downtown Los Angeles on Disney's ABC starting at 5 p.m. Pacific time Sunday (12 a.m. GMT on Monday). 'Schitt's Creek' father-son duo Eugene and Dan Levy will host the festivities. Producers have promised cast reunions from shows past, such as 'Happy Days,' and other moments to celebrate the history of television. Olympic gold medalist swimmer Caeleb Dressel and bronze medalist rugby player Ilona Maher also are scheduled to appear. Ahead of the ceremony, 'Shogun' has already set records. It won 14 trophies — the most ever for one season of a drama series — at last weekend's Creative Arts Emmys, where awards were given for guest actors and crafts such as cinematography. The expensive series was no sure thing. It had been in development for years before it came together with elaborate sets, makeup and costumes and storytelling that impressed critics with its attention to detail. 'That's part of the Cinderella story of this series,' said Clayton Davis, awards editor at Hollywood publication Variety. Competitors for best drama include British royal family saga 'The Crown' and spy thriller 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' from Amazon's Prime Video. 'The Bear' also performed well at the Creative Arts Emmys, earning seven awards. The show is competing with its second season, which featured a widely praised episode about a disastrous family holiday gathering. HBO's 'Hacks,' about a 70-something comedienne and a millennial writer, could play the role of spoiler in the comedy category. Due to the timing of their seasons, the shows have never competed head-to-head at the Emmys. Limited series looks like a lock for 'Baby Reindeer,' awards watchers said. The Netflix series tells the tale of a bartender stalked and harassed by a customer. Scottish comedian and star Richard Gadd has said the Netflix show is based on his real-life story, although a defamation lawsuit argues the stalker's behavior is exaggerated. Rivals for limited series include Netflix's psychological thriller 'Ripley,' FX's 'Fargo' and HBO's 'True Detective: Night Country,' starring lead actress nominee Jodie Foster. Winners are chosen by the nearly 22,000 performers, directors, producers and other members of Hollywood's Television Academy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/emmys-return-with-shogun-and-the-bear-leading-the-pack/7785280.html	2024-09-15T15:53:55-07:00	
Trump Train' convoy surrounded Biden-Harris bus. Was it political violence?	Austin, Texas — A Texas jury will soon decide whether a convoy of supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently intimidated former Democratic lawmaker Wendy Davis and two others on a Biden-Harris campaign bus when a so-called 'Trump Train' boxed them in for more than an hour on a Texas highway days before the 2020 election. The trial, which began on Sept. 9, resumes Monday and is expected to last another week. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that six of the Trump Train drivers violated state and federal law. Lawyers for the defendants said they did not conspire against the Democrats on the bus and that their actions are protected speech. Here's what else to know: What happened on Oct. 30, 2020? Dozens of cars and trucks organized by a local Trump Train group swarmed the bus on its way from San Antonio to Austin. It was the last day of early voting in Texas for the 2020 general election, and the bus was scheduled to make a stop in San Marcos for an event at Texas State University. Video recorded by Davis shows pickup trucks with large Trump flags aggressively slowing down and boxing in the bus as it tried to move away from the Trump Train. One defendant hit a campaign volunteer's car while the trucks occupied all lanes of traffic, slowing the bus and everyone around it to a 15-mph crawl. Those on the bus — including Davis, a campaign staffer and the driver — repeatedly called 911 asking for help and a police escort through San Marcos, but when no law enforcement arrived, the campaign canceled the event and pushed forward to Austin. San Marcos settled a separate lawsuit filed by the same three Democrats against the police, agreeing to pay $175,000 and mandate political violence training for law enforcement. Davis testified that she felt she was being 'taken hostage' and has sought treatment for anxiety. In the days leading up to the event, Democrats were also intimidated, harassed and received death threats, the lawsuit said. 'I feel like they were enjoying making us afraid,' Davis testified. 'It's traumatic for all of us to revisit that day.' What's the plaintiffs' argument? In opening statements, an attorney for the plaintiffs said convoy organizers targeted the bus in a calculated attack to intimidate the Democrats in violation of the 'Ku Klux Klan Act,' an 1871 federal law that bans political violence and intimidation. 'We're here because of actions that put people's lives in danger,' said Samuel Hall, an attorney with the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. The plaintiffs, he said, were 'literally driven out of town by a swarm of trucks.' The six Trump Train drivers succeeded in making the campaign cancel its remaining events in Texas in a war they believed was 'between good and evil,' Hall said. Two nonprofit advocacy groups, Texas Civil Rights Project and Protect Democracy, also are representing the three plaintiffs. What's the defense's argument? Attorneys for the defendants, who are accused of driving and organizing the convoy, said they did not conspire to swarm the Democrats on the bus, which could have exited the highway at any point. 'This was a political rally. This was not some conspiracy to intimidate people,' said attorney Jason Greaves, who is representing two of the drivers. The defense also argued that their clients' actions were protected speech and that the trial is a concerted effort to 'drain conservatives of their money,' according to Francisco Canseco, a lawyer for three of the defendants. 'It was a rah-rah group that sought to support and advocate for a candidate of their choice in a very loud way,' Canseco said during opening statements. The defense lost a bid last month to have the case ruled in their favor without a trial. The judge wrote that 'assaulting, intimidating, or imminently threatening others with force is not protected expression.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-train-convoy-surrounded-biden-harris-bus-was-it-political-violence/7785268.html	2024-09-15T15:25:36-07:00	
Pakistan braces for deadliest year for journalists, setting grim record	Islamabad — Pakistan has documented the killings of 11 journalists in 2024, reaching a record-breaking annual tally with nearly four months left in the year. The South Asian nation continues to face persistent criticism for an alleged lack of justice or impunity for journalists' murders, making it one of the world’s most dangerous countries for media workers. The latest victim was Nisar Lehri, a 50-year-old Pakistani journalist and secretary of a local press club in violence-hit southwestern Balochistan province. Unknown assailants shot and killed him on September 4 near his home in the town of Mastung for his reporting about criminal elements, according to a complaint filed with the area police. Lehri’s murder followed the death of reporter Muhammad Bachal Ghunio on August 27. He was associated with the local Awaz TV channel and was targeted by gunmen in his native Ghotki district in southeastern Sindh province. Ghunio’s family and police investigators believe he was killed because of his reporting. Police subsequently announced the arrest of a suspect, and the recovery of a weapon allegedly used in the attack. Islamabad-based nonprofit Freedom Network, an advocate for press freedoms, reported that before the two fatalities, nine journalists were killed in Pakistan this year, including a YouTube show host. 'Safety is every journalist’s key concern while reporting, and given the fact that 11 journalists, including a YouTuber, were killed this year so far, it has a chilling effect on independent media,' Iqbal Khattak, the executive director of the nonprofit network, told VOA. Pakistani officials blame growing terrorist activities in the country for the uptick in attacks on journalists. However, critics dispute these claims, noting that many of the journalist fatalities this year occurred in Sindh and the country’s most populous Punjab province, which have been relatively peaceful compared to terrorism-hit Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. While Pakistan’s military and its intelligence agencies are routinely accused of orchestrating violence against journalists critical of their involvement in national politics, influential feudal lords and politicians in Sindh, as well as Punjab, are often blamed for ordering violence against media workers in their native constituencies and escaping accountability. 'The deep-rooted impunity and political instability are driving the current violence. However, the list of press freedom predators is not restricted to the two drivers,' Khattak stated. 'The list is long to name the predators. Terrorism is not excluded,' he added. Pakistani Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told reporters Saturday that the federal government is working closely with authorities in the four provinces to address the challenges facing journalists. 'There are incidents in Sindh, I totally agree. Some people often use political influence to get their way and get out of these cases,' Tarar stated when asked by VOA about his government’s role in addressing the cases of fatal attacks on journalists and providing justice to their families. The minister pledged to coordinate with provincial counterparts to investigate these cases and deter further violence against media workers. 'We need to set an example in one or two cases, so this does not happen again. I think this is a very important issue which needs to be handled,' Tarar said. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a U.S.-based global media rights group, mourned the deaths of Lehri and Ghunio in a Friday statement. 'Pakistani authorities must immediately bring the perpetrators of the killings … to justice and show urgent political will to end the horrifying cycle of violence against journalists that has continued this year across Pakistan,' said Beh Lih Yi, the CPJ Asia program coordinator. 'The press in Pakistan cannot carry out their journalism unless the government and security agencies put an end to the impunity against journalists in the country,' she stressed. The CPJ statement also noted that dozens of Pakistani journalists have been attacked or forced into hiding this year due to their reporting across the country. Another global media watchdog, Reporters Without Borders (RSF), urged Pakistan's federal and provincial authorities in a recent report to take urgent measures to address the alarming decline in press freedom in the country. 'The many press freedom violations reveal a climate of violence, and a determination to censor that has little in common with the undertakings by the political parties in their elections campaign manifestos and the message of support for journalists by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif,' stated Celia Mercier, the head of RSF’s South Asia desk. 'Pakistan remains one of the world’s most dangerous countries for media personnel, and the level of impunity for the murders of journalists is appalling,' Mercier said in June. Stifling free press Until this month, millions of Pakistanis experienced significant disruptions in accessing major social media platforms nationwide, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, drawing a public outcry. The military-backed Sharif government was blamed for imposing the shutdowns and internet slowdowns to deter dissent or political unrest. Pakistani authorities rejected the allegations and blamed internet disruptions on a faulty submarine internet cable. In an August 28 announcement, the state regulator, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, announced that repairs to the faulty cable would likely be completed by early October, but slow internet speeds might persist until then.

Zelenskyy again urges West to allow strikes deep inside Russia	Kyiv, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy once again Sunday urged Western allies to permit Kyiv to strike military targets deep inside Russia, especially air bases, after a deadly attack on Kharkiv. 'Only a systemic solution makes it possible to oppose this terror: the long-range solution to destroy Russian military aviation where it is based,' Zelenskyy said in his daily address. 'We are waiting for appropriate decisions coming primarily from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy.' Earlier, a guided Russian bomb struck a residential building in Kharkiv, the latest of a series of attacks on the northeastern city, starting a blaze which firefighters extinguished. Rescuers pulled out the dead body of an elderly woman from the rubble, Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said on Telegram, adding that 42 people were wounded. In his speech, Zelenskyy said Russia had also struck the Sumy and Donetsk regions Sunday with guided bombs. He said the Russian army carried out 'at least 100 such air attacks' daily. It is to prevent these sorts of attacks that Ukraine is asking for permission to strike military targets deep inside Russia from Western allies, who remain hesitant for fear of an escalation. Also Sunday, Russian shelling killed one person in the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, local authorities said, as Moscow's troops inched closer to the key logistics hub. More than 20,000 people — almost half of its population — have fled the city since August, while Russian strikes over the past two weeks have cut off water and electricity to many of its remaining residents. 'Around 11 a.m. (0800 GMT), the enemy shelled the western part of the city... Unfortunately, one person died,' Pokrovsk's military administration said on Telegram.

Iran's President to attend BRICS summit in Russia	DUBAI — Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian will attend the upcoming BRICS summit in Russia, state media cited Tehran's ambassador in Moscow as saying Sunday, amid tensions with the West over military cooperation between the two countries. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Russia had received ballistic missiles from Iran and was likely to use them in Ukraine within weeks. Cooperation between Moscow and Tehran threatened wider European security, he said. The United States, Germany, Britain and France on Tuesday imposed new sanctions on Iran, including measures against its national airline Iran Air. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Wednesday that Tehran did not deliver any ballistic missiles to Russia and that sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the three European countries against Iran were not a solution. Iran's ambassador in Russia Kazem Jalali confirmed Sunday that Pezeshkian will attend the summit of the BRICS group of major emerging economies, scheduled to be held in Kazan, Russia from Oct. 22 to 24, according to Iran's state media. Pezeshkian will meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin there, Jalali said. Iran and Russia are set to sign a bilateral comprehensive cooperation agreement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-president-to-attend-brics-summit-in-russia-/7785213.html	2024-09-15T12:51:48-07:00

Air Canada, pilots’ union reach tentative agreement to avoid shutdown	OTTAWA, Ontario — Air Canada and the union representing its pilots have come to terms on a labor agreement that is likely to prevent a shutdown of Canada’s largest airline. Talks between the company and the Air Line Pilots Association produced a tentative, four-year collective agreement, the airline announced in a statement early Sunday. The prospective deal recognizes the contributions of the pilots flying for Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge while setting a new framework for company growth. The terms will remain confidential until ratification by union members and approval by the airline’s board of directors over the next month, the airline said. The pilots’ association said its Air Canada Master Executive Council voted to approve the tentative agreement on behalf of more than 5,400 Air Canada pilots. After review and ratification by a majority of members, the deal is expected to generate an additional $1.9 billion for the pilots over the period of the agreement, the union said in a statement. 'While it has been an exceptionally long road to this agreement, the consistent engagement and unified determination of our pilots have been the catalyst for achieving this contract,' Charlene Hudy, the executive council's chair, said in the statement. 'After several consecutive weeks of intense round-the-clock negotiations, progress was made on several key issues including compensation, retirement, and work rules.' Federal Labor Minister Steven MacKinnon confirmed the agreement Sunday and lauded the company and the union. 'Thanks to the hard work of the parties and federal mediators, disruptions have been prevented for Canadians,' MacKinnon said in a statement. 'Negotiated agreements are always the best way forward and yield positive results for companies and workers.' The airline and its pilots have been in contract talks for more than a year. The pilots have sought wages competitive with their U.S. counterparts, but Air Canada continues to post record profits while expecting pilots to accept below-market compensation, the union said. The two sides could have issued a 72-hour notice of a strike or lockout beginning Sunday. The airline said the notice would have triggered its three-day wind down plan and started the clock on a full work stoppage as soon as Sept. 18. Air Canada spokesperson Christophe Hennebelle previously said the airline was committed to negotiations but faced union wage demands that the company could not meet. The airline was not seeking federal intervention, but cautioned the government should be prepared to help avoid major disruptions from the possible shutdown of an airline carrying more than 110,000 passengers daily, Hennebelle said. Business leaders had urged the federal government to intervene in the talks earlier in the week, but MacKinnon said there was no reason the sides should not have been able to reach a collective agreement. In August, the Canadian government asked the country’s industrial relations board to issue a back-to-work order to end a railway shutdown. Leaders of numerous business groups including the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Business Council of Canada convened in Ottawa on Thursday to call for action, including binding arbitration, to avoid the widespread economic disruptions of an airline shutdown. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Thursday his party would not support efforts to force pilots back to work. 'If there’s any bills being proposed on back to work legislation, we’re going to oppose that,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/air-canada-pilots-union-reach-tentative-agreement-to-avoid-shutdown-/7785180.html	2024-09-15T11:26:13-07:00

Italian army to guard hospital after attacks on medical staff	Rome — The Italian army will start guarding medical staff at a hospital in the southern Calabria region from Monday, after a string of violent attacks on doctors and nurses by enraged patients and relatives across Italy, according to local media reports. Prefect Paolo Giovanni Grieco has approved a plan to reinforce the surveillance services already operated by soldiers on sensitive targets in the Calabrian town of Vibo Valentia, including the hospital, the reports added. Recent attacks on health workers have been particularly frequent in southern Italy, prompting the doctors’ national guild to ask for the army to be deployed to ensure medical staff’s safety. The turning point was an assault at the Policlinico hospital in the southern city of Foggia in early September. A group of about 50 relatives and friends of a 23-year-old woman — who died during emergency surgery — turned their grief and rage into violence, attacking the hospital staff. Video footage, widely circulated on social media, showed doctors and nurses barricading in a room to escape the attack. Some of them were punched and injured. The director of the hospital threatened to close its emergency room after denouncing three similar attacks in less than a week. With over 16,000 reported cases of physical and verbal assaults in 2023 alone, Italian doctors and nurses have called for drastic measures. 'We have never seen such levels of aggression in the past decade,' said Antonio De Palma, president of the Nursing Up union, stressing the urgent need for action. 'We are now at a point where considering military protection in hospitals is no longer a far-fetched idea. We cannot wait any longer,' he added. The Italian Federation of Medical-Scientific Societies (FISM) has also proposed more severe measures for offenders, such as suspending access to free medical care for three years for anyone who assaults health care workers or damages hospital facilities. Understaffing and long waiting lists are the main reasons behind patients' frustration with health workers. According to Italy’s largest union for doctors (ANAAO), nearly half of emergency medicine positions remained unfilled as of 2022. Doctors lament that Italy’s legislation has kept wages low, leading to overworked and burnout staff at hospitals. These problems have been further aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has pushed many health workers to leave Italy in search of better opportunities abroad. In 2023, Italy was short of about 30,000 doctors, and between 2010 and 2020, the country saw the closure of 111 hospitals and 113 emergency rooms, data from a specialized forum showed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italian-army-to-guard-hospital-after-attacks-on-medical-staff-/7785175.html	2024-09-15T11:15:26-07:00

Hundreds rally in Paris for Iranian women's rights	Paris — Hundreds of people marched through Paris on Sunday in support of women's rights and the opposition in Iran, two years after the death of Mahsa Amini sparked protests against the country's religious authorities. A 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, Amini died in custody after being arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code for women. The march, organized by around 20 human rights associations, took place as 34 women began a hunger strike in a Tehran prison to mark the two-year anniversary of her death. Chirinne Ardakani, a Franco-Iranian lawyer and member of the 'Iran Justice' collective, said that the 'sacrifices' made by Iranians opposed to the regime were 'not in vain'. 'Everything has changed in Iran,' Ardakani told AFP. 'We've gone from an absolutely patriarchal culture, where there was no question of women being able to reveal themselves in the street, to massive support for these women,' the lawyer and activist added. The march in solidarity with the 'Women, Life, Freedom' movement was attended by Benjamin Briere and Louis Arnaud, two Frenchmen who were arrested and arbitrarily detained in Iran. Iran is accused of arresting Westerners without cause and using them as bargaining chips in state-to-state negotiations, with French diplomats describing these prisoners as 'state hostages'. Briere was eventually released in May 2023, while Arnaud was let go the month after. 'Yes, I was in prison, but it is an immense honor to have been able to live among you, freedom fighters, who shared my suffering,' Arnaud told the crowd, in his first public address since his release. Three other French nationals are still being held in Iran. After Amini died in custody on September 16, 2022, the women-led protests which erupted rattled Iran's leadership that autumn and winter. But the demonstrations were then crushed by the authorities, with rights group Amnesty International saying security forces used assault rifles and shotguns in the crackdown. Human rights groups say at least 551 people were killed. Thousands more were arrested, according to the United Nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-rally-in-paris-for-iranian-women-s-rights-/7785169.html	2024-09-15T10:53:51-07:00

US-China military leaders finish discussions on South China Sea, other issues	BANGKOK — Military leaders from the U.S. and China met in Beijing for routine talks that only resumed in January after being suspended for two years as ties between the two countries soured. The meetings ended Sunday and officials discussed ongoing issues such as Taiwan, the Russia-Ukraine war and clashes in the South China Sea. Michael Chase, deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, Taiwan and Mongolia led a delegation to engage in the bilateral Defense Policy Coordination Talks, which were last held in January. While the talks weren't expected to resolve long-standing differences in stances over issues ranging from South China Sea claims to Taiwan, the U.S. has continued to push for the discussions to avoid conflict. The meetings were held after Chase attended the Xiangshan forum in Beijing, a defense forum that is China's answer to the Shangri-La Dialogue. Communication between the two militaries broke off in 2021, as U.S.-China tensions ratcheted up over widening differences on issues such as Taiwan's sovereignty, the origin of COVID-19 and economic issues. Beijing has ignored U.S. requests to engage in the past, especially over intercepts between U.S. and Chinese aircraft and ships. While communications resumed after U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in San Francisco last November, it is unclear whether the talks could continue as the U.S. is poised for a presidential election. In the bilateral talks, the two sides discussed China's support for Russia during the ongoing Ukraine war, as well as China's actions in the South China Sea, said a U.S. senior defense official briefing reporters on the meetings. On Sunday, the Philippine ship at a disputed shoal, BRP Teresa Magbanua, had left to resupply and provide medical care to its crew members. The defense official said that they were 'watching further developments there very closely.' China's claims over the South China Sea have become increasingly assertive, with increasing clashes with the Philippine coast guard. In August, both sides accused each other over a collision between their ships which left gaping holes in the Philippine ships. The maritime claims have meant clashes at sea, such as at the Sabina Shoal, which both China and the Philippines claim. China had blocked attempts to resupply the BRP Teresa Magbanua, in August, with a force of 40 ships. The Philippines said it would replace the ship immediately, but the departure of the ship raises questions of whether China would seize the shoal. Filipino scientists had previously found submerged piles of crushed corals in its shallows, leading to concern that China may be preparing to build a structure to stake its claim. China confirmed the departure of the ship, which it said, 'infringed on China's territorial sovereignty.' 'During this period, China had taken control measures against the ship in accordance with the law and multiple attempts by the Philippine side to forcibly resupply the ship had failed,' China Coast Guard spokesperson Liu Dejun said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-china-military-leaders-finish-discussions-on-south-china-sea-other-issues-/7785095.html	2024-09-15T09:24:18-07:00	
EU's top diplomat calls Venezuelan government 'dictatorial'	Madrid — The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, called Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government 'dictatorial' during an interview broadcast Sunday in Spain, echoing comments made by a Spanish minister that angered Caracas. Venezuela on Thursday recalled its ambassador to Madrid for consultations and summoned Spain's envoy to Caracas for talks after Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles referred to Maduro's administration as a 'dictatorship' and saluted 'the Venezuelans who had to leave their country' because of his regime. Asked about the row during an interview with private Spanish television channel Telecinco, Borrell said over 2,000 people had been 'arbitrarily detained' since Venezuela's disputed July 28 presidential election, which the Latin American country's opposition accuses Maduro of stealing. Political parties in Venezuela are 'subjected to a thousand limitations on their activities' and the leader of the opposition, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, 'has had to flee' to Spain, he added. 'What do you call all this? Of course, this is a dictatorial, authoritarian, dictatorial regime. But just saying so doesn't solve anything. What we need to do is to try to solve it,' said Borrell, a former Spanish foreign minister. 'Sometimes resolving things requires a certain verbal restraint, but let us not fool ourselves about the nature of things. Venezuela has called elections, but it was not a democracy before and it is much less so after.' Maduro, who succeeded iconic left-wing leader Hugo Chavez on his death in 2013, insists he won a third term but failed to release detailed voting tallies to back his claim. The opposition published polling station-level results, which it said showed Gonzalez Urrutia winning by a landslide. Maduro's claim to have won a third term in office sparked mass opposition protests, which claimed at least 27 lives and left 192 people wounded. About 2,400 people, including numerous teens, were arrested in the unrest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-s-top-diplomat-calls-venezuelan-government-dictatorial-/7785071.html	2024-09-15T08:47:19-07:00	
More than 40 dead after river boat capsizes in Nigeria	Kano, Nigeria — More than 40 people are presumed to have died after a boat overloaded with passengers sank on a river in northwestern Nigeria, authorities said on Sunday. The vessel was ferrying 53 farmers to their farms across the Gummi River in Zamfara State on Saturday when it capsized, a local official said. 'Only 12 were rescued yesterday shortly after the accident,' said Na'Allah Musa, a political administrator of the flood-hit Gummi district where the accident happened, adding that authorities were searching for the bodies of the rest of the passengers, who are presumed to have died. Musa added that the vessel was 'crammed with passengers far beyond its capacity which caused it to overturn and sink.' In a statement on Sunday, Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu 'expressed the government and the people of Nigeria's commiseration' for the 'twin tragedies' of the farmers' deaths and the nearby floods. In recent days, rising waters in the Gummi area have forced more than 10,000 people to flee, with Tinubu promising support for the victims. Boat accidents are common on Nigeria's poorly regulated waterways, particularly during the rainy season when river and lakes swell. Last month, 30 farmers on their way to their rice fields drowned after their overloaded boat sank in the Dundaye River in neighboring Sokoto State, emergency officials said. Three days earlier, 15 farmers died when their canoe overturned on the Gamoda River in Jigawa State, according to the police.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-40-dead-after-river-boat-capsizes-in-nigeria-/7785053.html	2024-09-15T08:21:50-07:00	
Guinea gives land to victims of forced evictions	Conakry — Guinea has handed over a plot of land to thousands forcibly evicted by previous governments, with some of the victims having waited more than 25 years for compensation. More than 20,000 people were displaced when the government of former president Alpha Conde demolished the Kaporo-Rails, Kipe 2, Dimesse, and Dar Es Salam neighborhoods of the capital Conakry between February and May 2019, according to Human Rights Watch. The government said the land belonged to the state and would be used for official buildings. A previous round of demolitions took place in the same area of Conakry in 1998, under the rule of president Lansana Conte. At a jubilant ceremony on Saturday, the associations representing the victims received the land deeds for a 258-hectare (638-acre) plot in Wonkifong, some 60 kilometers (40 miles) from Conakry, an AFP journalist saw. The land will be managed by the state-owned company SONAPI, which will be responsible for developing the site and rehousing the victims. 'We are taking a concrete step towards healing the wounds of the past for 2,683 households, while laying the foundations for a shared future,' the managing director of SONAPI, Maimouna Laure Mah Barry, said in a statement. The spokesman for the victims, Samba Sow, said the event marked 'the reparation of a 26-year-old injustice for those who were evicted in 1998 and five years for those evicted in 2019.' 'Thousands of homes, schools, markets and places of worship were destroyed in flagrant violation of the laws of our country. The lives of several thousand families have been destroyed,' he added. Sow called on current head of state, junta leader General Mamady Doumbouya, to set up a compensation fund for the victims. The ceremony was attended by General Amara Camara, a junta spokesman, who said the president was 'resolutely committed to drying the tears of all the sons and daughters of this country.' The West African state has been ruled by a military junta led by Doumbouya since a coup in September 2021 toppled civilian president Conde.	https://www.voanews.com/a/guinea-gives-land-to-victims-of-forced-evictions-/7785026.html	2024-09-15T08:05:29-07:00	
US Fed expected to announce its first interest rate cut since 2020	Washington — The Federal Reserve is gearing up to announce its first interest rate cut for more than four years on Wednesday, with policymakers expected to debate how big a move to make less than two months before the U.S. presidential election. Senior officials at the U.S. central bank including Fed chair Jerome Powell have in recent weeks indicated that a rate cut is coming this month, as inflation eases toward the bank's long-term target of two percent, and the labor market continues to cool. The Fed, which has a dual mandate from Congress to act independently to ensure both stable prices and maximum sustainable employment, has repeatedly stressed it will make its decision on rate cuts based solely on the economic data. But a cut on Wednesday could still cause headaches for Powell, as it would land shortly before the election, in which former Republican president Donald Trump is running against the current Democratic vice president, Kamala Harris. 'As much as I think the Fed tries to say that they're not a political animal, we are in a really wild cycle right now,' Alicia Modestino, an associate professor of economics at Northeastern University, told AFP. How big a cut? The debate among policymakers on Tuesday and Wednesday this week will likely center on whether to move by 25 or 50 basis points. However, a rate cut of any size would be the Fed's first since March 2020, when it slashed rates to near-zero in order to support the US economy through the Covid-19 pandemic. The Fed started hiking rates in 2022 in response to a surge in inflation, fueled largely by a post-pandemic supply crunch and the war in Ukraine. It has held its key lending rate at a two-decade high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent for the past 14 months, waiting for economic conditions to improve. Now, with inflation falling, the labor market cooling, and the US economy still growing, policymakers have decided that conditions are ripe for a cut. Policymakers are left with a choice: making a small 25 basis point cut to ease into things, or a more aggressive cut of 50 basis points, which would be helpful for the labor market but could also risk reigniting inflation. 'I think that in advance of the November meeting, there's not quite enough data to say we're in jeopardy on the employment side,' said Modestino, who was previously a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Analysts see the smaller cut as a safe bet. 'We expect the Fed to cut by 25bp [basis points],' economists at Bank of America wrote in a recent note to clients. 'The Fed likes predictability,' Modestino from Northeastern said. 'It's good for markets, good for consumers, good for workers.' 'So a 25 basis point cut now, followed up by another 25 basis point cut in November after the next round of economic data, offers a somewhat smoother glide path for the economy,' she added. How many cuts? While analysts overwhelmingly expect the Fed to start cutting in September, there is less clarity about what comes next. Economists at some banks, including Goldman Sachs, expect cuts totaling 75 basis points over the last three meetings of the year, while others see more aggressive cuts, like economists at Citi, who have 125 basis points of easing as their base case. 'The continued softening of the labor market is likely to provoke larger-sized cuts if not at this FOMC meeting then in November and December,' the Citi economists wrote in a recent note to clients, referring to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The Fed will shed some light on the issue on Wednesday, when it publishes the updated economic forecasts of its 19-member FOMC — including their rate cut expectations. In June, FOMC members sharply reduced the number of cuts they had penciled in for this year from a median of three down to just one amid a small uptick in inflation. But as inflation has fallen and the labor market has weakened, expectations of more cuts have grown. Traders also see a greater-than 99 percent chance of at least four more cuts in 2025, which would bring the Fed's key lending rate down to between 3.5 and 3.75 percent — 175 basis points below current levels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-fed-expected-to-announce-its-first-interest-rate-cut-since-2020/7785008.html	2024-09-15T07:31:46-07:00	
Jordan's King Abdullah appoints US-educated technocrat as PM, royal court says	AMMAN — Jordan's King Abdullah has designated key palace aide Jafar Hassan as prime minister after the government resigned on Sunday, the royal court said, days after a parliamentary election in which the Islamist opposition made some gains in the U.S.-allied kingdom. Hassan, now head of King Abdullah's office and a former planning minister, replaces Bisher Khasawneh, a veteran diplomat and former palace adviser who was appointed nearly four years ago, a royal court statement said. Khasawneh will stay on in a caretaker capacity until the formation of a new cabinet, the statement said. Harvard-educated Hassan, a widely respected technocrat, will face the challenges of mitigating the impact of the Gaza war on the kingdom's economy, hard-hit by curbs to investment and a sharp drop in tourism. The outgoing prime minister had sought to drive reforms pushed by King Abdullah to help reverse a decade of sluggish growth, hovering at around 2%, that was worsened by the pandemic and conflict in neighboring Iraq and Syria. The traditional conservative establishment had long been blamed for obstructing a modernization drive advocated by the Western-leaning monarch, fearing liberal reforms would erode their grip on power. Politicians say a key task ahead is accelerating IMF-guided reforms and reining in more than $50 billion in public debt in a country with high unemployment and whose stability is supported by billions of dollars of foreign aid from Western donors. The Muslim Brotherhood opposition and ideological allies of Palestinian militant group Hamas made significant gains in Tuesday's election, boosted by anger over Israel's war in Gaza. The Islamists won 31 seats, the most since parliamentary life was revived in 1989 after decades of martial law, leaving them the largest political grouping in parliament. In a country where anti-Israel sentiment runs high, they have led some of the largest protests in the region in support of Hamas, which their opponents say allowed them to increase their popularity. Although the new composition of the 138-member parliament retains a pro-government majority, the more vocal Islamist-led opposition could challenge IMF-backed free-market reforms and foreign policy, diplomats and officials say. Under Jordan's constitution, most powers still rest with the king, who appoints governments and can dissolve parliament. The assembly can force a cabinet to resign by a vote of no confidence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jordan-s-king-abdullah-appoints-us-educated-technocrat-as-pm-royal-court-says/7784994.html	2024-09-15T07:04:37-07:00	
A high-level US delegation in Dhaka to foster economic growth with interim government	DHAKA, Bangladesh — A high-level U.S. delegation met Sunday with the head of Bangladesh's interim government, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, to affirm 'dedication to fostering inclusive economic growth,' according to the American embassy in Dhaka. Yunus took over after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country last month amid a mass uprising. She was accused of corruption, violation of human rights and excessive use of force against the protesters. During her 15-year rule, Hasina enjoyed close relations with India, China and Russia who have heavily invested in the country's infrastructure development, trade and investment. The U.S. has also become the single largest foreign investor in Bangladesh under Hasina. Yunus on Sunday said he sought U.S. support 'to rebuild the country, carry out vital reforms, and bring back stolen assets,' his press office said in a statement after he met the delegation at the State Guest House Jamuna in Dhaka. He told the U.S. representatives his interim administration has moved fast to 'reset, reform, and restart' the economy, initiate reforms in financial sectors, and fix institutions such as the judiciary and police, the statement said. The U.S. delegation, led by Brent Neiman, assistant secretary for International Finance at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, had representatives from the U.S. Agency for International Development, and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Donald Lu, assistant secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, joined the delegation after visiting India. They met with several officials in Dhaka, including Touhid Hossain, the country's adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The USAID also signed an agreement to provide $202.25 million in aid to Bangladesh. The U.S. embassy on X underscored how American companies are entrenched in the South Asian country. 'With the right economic reforms in place, the American private sector can help unlock Bangladesh's growth potential through trade and investment,' the embassy wrote on its official account. The delegation also met representatives of the American companies under the American Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh (AmCham) operating in Bangladesh upon arriving Saturday. Concerns over safety and lack of order in Bangladesh were relayed by the companies' agents. AmCham President Syed Ershad Ahmed said at the meeting that while there were improvements after the interim government was installed, 'there are some bottlenecks too.' Profit repatriation amid the ongoing crisis of U.S. dollars and challenges in the supply chain resulting from congestion at ports were among the issues he raised. The meeting came as unrest took hold of the country's major garment industry with workers walking out, leaving factories shuttered, as they demanded better benefits including higher wages. The factory owners, the government and workers' leaders are holding meetings to ease the tension. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate-induced disasters. The U.S. embassy on its official Facebook page said the United States wanted to help it 'mitigate climate risks.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-high-level-us-delegation-in-dhaka-to-foster-economic-growth-with-interim-government-/7784966.html	2024-09-15T06:23:47-07:00	
87 and hobbled, Pope Francis goes off-script in Asia and reminds world he can still draw a crowd	DILI, East Timor — It was the farthest trip of his pontificate and one of the longest papal trips ever in terms of days on the road and distance traveled. But Pope Francis, age 87, hobbled by bad knees and bent over with sciatica, appeared to be having the time of his life. With half of East Timor's population gathered at a seaside park, Francis couldn't help but oblige them with a final good night and languid loops in his popemobile, long after the sun had set and the field was lit by cellphone screens. It was late, the heat and humidity had turned Tasitolu park into something of a sauna, and most of the journalists had already gone back to their air-conditioned hotel to watch the Mass on TV. But there was Francis, defying the doubters who had questioned if he could, would or should make such an arduous trip to Asia given everything that could go wrong. 'How many children you have!' Francis marveled to the crowd of 600,000, which amounted to the biggest-ever turnout for a papal event as a proportion of the population. 'A people that teaches its children to smile is a people that has a future.' The moment seemed to serve as proof that, despite his age, ailments and seven hours of jet lag, Pope Francis still could pope, still likes to pope and has it in him to pope like he used to at the start of his pontificate. That's never truer than when he's in his element: in the peripheries of the world, among people forgotten by the big powers, where he can go off-script to respond to the spirit of the moment. And it was certainly the case on his 11-day trip through Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore, during which he clocked nearly 33,000 kilometers (20,505 miles) in air travel alone. It was a trip that he had originally planned to make in 2020 but COVID-19 intervened. Four years and a handful of hospitalizations later (for intestinal and pulmonary problems), Francis finally pulled it off. He seemed to relish getting out of the Vatican and away from the weighty grind of the Holy See after being cooped up all year, much of it battling a long bout of bronchitis. Francis does tend to rally during foreign trips, though he usually sticks to a script when he's in the protocol meetings with heads of state, dutifully delivering speeches that were written in advance by Vatican diplomats. But when he's meeting with young people or local priests and nuns, he tends to show his true colors. He'll ditch his prepared remarks and speak off-the-cuff, often engaging in back-and-forth banter with the faithful to make sure his message has stuck. Doing so thrills the crowd, terrorizes his translators and complicates the work of journalists, but you always know Francis is enjoying himself and feels energized when he goes rogue. And he went rogue plenty of times in Asia — and on the in-flight press conference coming back to Rome, during which he urged American Catholics to vote for who they think is the 'lesser evil' for president. Francis started in Indonesia, arguably the most delicate destination on his itinerary given the country is home to the world's largest Muslim population. The Vatican would be loathe to say or do anything that might cause offense. And yet from his very first encounter with President Joko Widodo, Francis appeared in a feisty mood, praising Indonesia's relatively high birthrate while lamenting that in the West, 'some prefer a cat or a little dog.' Francis has frequently made the same demographic quip at home in Italy, which has one of the world's lowest birthrates. But the high-profile trip meant that his trademark sarcasm got amplified. American commentators immediately assumed Francis had entered the 'childless cat ladies' debate roiling U.S. politics, but there was no indication he had JD Vance in mind. Even in the most delicate moment in Jakarta, at Southeast Asia's biggest mosque, Francis threw protocol aside and kissed the hand of the grand imam and brought it to his cheek in gratitude. In Papua New Guinea, Francis was similarly jazzed after pulling off a visit to a remote jungle outpost that had seemed impossible for him to reach: The airport in Vanimo, population 11,000, doesn't have an ambulift wheelchair elevator that Francis now needs to get on and off planes, and bringing one in just for him was out of the question. The stubborn pope, who really, really wanted to go to Vanimo, ended up rolling on and off the back ramp of a C-130 cargo plane that Australia had offered to get him, and the metric ton of medicine and other supplies he brought with him, to the town. Despite the considerable security concerns of entering a region torn by tribal rivalries, Francis seemed to relish the jungle visit, perhaps because he felt so much at home. A dozen Argentine missionary priests and nuns have lived in Vanimo with the local community for years and had invited him to come. They decorated the simple stage in front of the church with a statue of Argentina's beloved Virgin of Lujan, to whom Francis is particularly devoted, and had a gourd of mate, the Argentine tea, waiting for him. In East Timor Francis had to negotiate perhaps the most sensitive issue clouding the visit: the case of Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, the revered national hero who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent independence campaign. The Vatican revealed in 2022 that it had sanctioned Belo, who now lives in Portugal, for having sexually abused young boys and ordered him to cease contact with East Timor. Francis didn't mention Belo by name and didn't meet with his victims, but he did reaffirm the need to protect children from 'abuse.' There was nary a mention of Belo's name in any official speech during a visit in which East Timor's traumatic history and independence fight were repeatedly evoked. In Singapore, his final stop, Francis once again ditched his remarks when he arrived at the last event, a meeting of Singaporean youth on Friday morning. 'That's the talk I prepared,' he said, pointing to his speech and then proceeding to launch into a spontaneous back-and-forth with the young people about the need to have courage and take risks. 'What's worse: Make a mistake because I take a certain path, or not make a mistake and stay home?' he asked them. He answered his own question, with a response that could explain his own risky decision to embark on the Asia trip in the first place. 'A young person who doesn't take a risk, who is afraid of making a mistake, is an old person,' the 87-year-old pope said. 'I hope all of you go forward,' he said. 'Don't go back. Don't go back. Take risks.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/and-hobbled-pope-francis-goes-off-script-in-asia-and-reminds-world-he-can-still-draw-a-crowd/7784945.html	2024-09-15T05:43:08-07:00

UK foreign minister Lammy plays down Putin threats	London — U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of 'bluster' Sunday over his warning that letting Ukraine use long-range weapons to strike inside Russia would put NATO 'at war' with Moscow. Tensions between Russia and the West over the conflict reached dire levels this week as U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met at the White House to discuss whether to ease rules on Kyiv's use of western-supplied weaponry. 'I think that what Putin's doing is throwing dust up into the air,' Lammy told the BBC. 'There's a lot of bluster. That's his modus operandi. He threatens about tanks, he threatens about missiles, he threatens about nuclear weapons.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been asking for permission to use British Storm Shadow missiles and U.S.-made ATACMS missiles to hit targets deeper inside Russia for months. Biden and Starmer delayed a decision on the move during their meeting on Friday. It came after Putin warned that green-lighting use of the weapons 'would mean that NATO countries, the U.S., European countries, are at war with Russia.' 'If that's the case, then taking into account the change of nature of the conflict, we will take the appropriate decisions based on the threats that we will face,' he added. The Russian leader has long warned Western countries that they risk provoking a nuclear war over their support for Ukraine. 'We cannot be blown off course by an imperialist fascist, effectively, that wants to move into countries willy nilly,' said Lammy. 'If we let him with Ukraine, believe me, he will not stop there.' Lammy said that talks between Starmer, Biden and Zelensky over the use of the missiles would continue at the United Nations General Assembly gathering in New York later this month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-foreign-minister-lammy-plays-down-putin-threats/7784905.html	2024-09-15T03:30:34-07:00	
Floods kill 1 in Poland and rescue worker in Austria as rains batter central Europe	LIPOVA LAZNE, Czech Republic — One person drowned in southwest Poland and thousands were evacuated across the border in the Czech Republic as heavy rains continued to batter central Europe on Sunday, causing flooding in several areas. A firefighter tackling flooding in lower Austria was also killed, Austrian Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler said on Sunday on social platform X as authorities declared the province, which surrounds Vienna, bordering the Czech Republic and Slovakia, a disaster area. Rivers overflowed from Poland to Romania, where four people were found dead on Saturday, after days of torrential rain in a low-pressure system named Boris. Some parts of the Czech Republic and Poland faced the worst flooding in almost three decades. In the Czech Republic, a quarter of a million homes were without power due to high winds and rain. Czech police said they were looking for three people who were in a car that fell into the river Staric near Lipova Lazne, 235 kilometers east of Prague on Saturday. In Poland, one person died in Klodzko county, which Prime Minister Donald Tusk said was the worst-hit area of the country and where 1,600 had been evacuated. 'The situation is very dramatic,' Tusk told reporters on Sunday after a meeting in Klodzko town, which was partly under water as the local river rose to 6.65 meters Sunday morning before receding slightly. That surpassed a record seen in heavy flooding in 1997, which partly damaged the town and claimed 56 lives in Poland. The nearby historic town of Glucholazy ordered evacuations Sunday morning as the local river started to break its banks, while firefighters and soldiers had been fighting since Saturday to protect a bridge in the town. Residents across the Czech border also said the situation was worse than flooding seen before. 'What you see here is worse than in 1997, and I don't know what will happen because my house is under water, and I don't know if I will even return to it,' said Pavel Bily, a resident of Lipova Lazne. The fire service in the region said it had evacuated 1,900 people as of Sunday morning, while many roads were impassable. In the worst-hit areas, more than 10 centimeters of rain fell overnight and around 45 centimeters since Wednesday evening, the Czech weather institute said. More rain is expected Sunday and Monday. In Budapest, officials raised forecasts for the Danube to rise in the second half of this week, to above 8.5 meters, nearing a record 8.91 meters seen in 2013, as rain continued in Hungary, Slovakia and Austria. 'According to forecasts, one of the biggest floods of the past years is approaching Budapest but we are prepared to tackle it,' Budapest's mayor Gergely Karacsony said. In Romania, authorities said the rain was less intense than on Saturday, when flooding killed four and damaged 5,000 homes. Towns and villages in seven counties across eastern Romania were affected, and the country's emergency response unit said it was still searching for two people missing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/floods-kill-1-in-poland-and-rescue-worker-in-austria-as-rains-batter-central-europe/7784895.html	2024-09-15T02:59:17-07:00	
8 migrants die in Channel crossing attempt, French authorities say	Lille, France — Eight migrants died early Sunday when their overcrowded vessel capsized while trying to cross the Channel from France to England, French authorities said, less than two weeks after the deadliest such disaster this year. The French and British governments have sought for years to stop the flow of migrants, who pay smugglers thousands of euros per head for the passage to England from France aboard small boats. A police source told AFP the accident occurred shortly after the boat embarked. Regional prefect Jacques Billant is set to hold a news conference at 10 a.m., his office said. Maritime authorities said Saturday that numerous attempts by migrants to make the perilous crossing in small boats have been attempted in recent days, with 200 people rescued in 24 hours over Friday and Saturday alone. At least 12 migrants, mostly from Eritrea, died off the northern French coast when their boat carrying dozens of people capsized this month. It was the deadliest such disaster this year and brought to 37 the number of migrant deaths in the Channel, up from 12 in 2023. More than 22,000 migrants have arrived in England by crossing the Channel since the beginning of this year, according to British officials. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron pledged this summer to strengthen 'cooperation' in handling the surge in undocumented migrant numbers. The Channel crossings often prove perilous, and in November 2021, 27 migrants died when their boat capsized in the deadliest single such disaster to date. French authorities seek to stop migrants taking to the water but do not intervene once they are afloat except for rescue purposes, citing safety concerns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrants-die-in-channel-crossing-attempt-french-authorities-say/7784893.html	2024-09-15T02:49:56-07:00	
Shanghai braces for direct hit from Typhoon Bebinca	SHANGHAI/BEIJING — Shanghai halted transportation links, recalled ships and shut tourism spots including Shanghai Disney Resort on Sunday as it braced for Typhoon Bebinca, in what could be the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the Chinese financial hub since 1949. The Category 1 typhoon, packing maximum sustained wind speeds near its center of around 144 kph, was about 500 kilometers southeast of Shanghai as of 1 p.m. It is expected to make landfall along China's eastern coast after midnight on Monday. The strongest storm to make landfall in Shanghai in recent decades was Typhoon Gloria in 1949, which tore through the city with gusts of 144 kph. Shanghai was last threatened by a direct hit in 2022 by the powerful Typhoon Muifa, which instead landed 300 kilometers away in the city of Zhoushan, in Zhejiang province. Shanghai is typically spared the strong typhoons that hit farther south in China, including Yagi, a destructive Category 4 storm that roared past southern Hainan province last week. But Shanghai and neighboring provinces are taking no chances with Category 1 Bebinca. Resorts in Shanghai, including Shanghai Disney Resort, Jinjiang Amusement Park and Shanghai Wild Animal Park, have been temporarily closed while most ferries have been halted to and from Chongming Island - China's third-biggest island known as 'the gateway to the Yangtze River.' More than 600 flights to and from Shanghai were also canceled, according to local media. In Zhejiang, ships have been recalled while several parks in the provincial capital Hangzhou announced closures. Bebinca's arrival will coincide with the Mid-Autumn festival, a nationwide three-day holiday when many Chinese travel or engage in outdoor activities. China's Ministry of Water Resources on Saturday issued a Level-IV emergency response -- the lowest level in China's four-tier emergency response system -- for potential flooding in Shanghai and the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shanghai-braces-for-direct-hit-from-typhoon-bebinca/7784890.html	2024-09-15T02:42:18-07:00	
Tech billionaire returns to Earth after first private spacewalk	CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — A billionaire spacewalker returned to Earth with his crew on Sunday, ending a five-day trip that lifted them higher than anyone has traveled since NASA's moonwalkers. SpaceX's capsule splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico near Florida's Dry Tortugas in the predawn darkness, carrying tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, two SpaceX engineers and a former Air Force Thunderbird pilot. They pulled off the first private spacewalk while orbiting nearly 740 kilometers above Earth, higher than the International Space Station and Hubble Space Telescope. Their spacecraft hit a peak altitude of 1,408 kilometers following Tuesday's liftoff. Isaacman became only the 264th person to perform a spacewalk since the former Soviet Union scored the first in 1965, and SpaceX's Sarah Gillis the 265th. Until now, all spacewalks were done by professional astronauts. 'We are mission complete,' Isaacman radioed as the capsule bobbed in the water, awaiting the recovery team. Within an hour, all four were out of their spacecraft, pumping their fists with joy as they emerged onto the ship's deck. It was the first time SpaceX aimed for a splashdown near the Dry Tortugas, a cluster of islands 113 kilometers west of Key West. To celebrate the new location, SpaceX employees brought a big, green turtle balloon to Mission Control at company headquarters in Hawthorne, California. The company usually targets closer to the Florida coast, but two weeks of poor weather forecasts prompted SpaceX to look elsewhere. During Thursday's commercial spacewalk, the Dragon capsule's hatch was open barely a half-hour. Isaacman emerged only up to his waist to briefly test SpaceX's brand-new spacesuit followed by Gillis, who was knee-high as she flexed her arms and legs for several minutes. Gillis, a classically trained violinist, also held a performance in orbit earlier in the week. The spacewalk lasted less than two hours, considerably shorter than those at the International Space Station. Most of that time was needed to depressurize the entire capsule and then restore the cabin air. Even SpaceX's Anna Menon and Scott 'Kidd' Poteet, who remained strapped in, wore spacesuits. SpaceX considers the brief exercise a starting point to test spacesuit technology for future, longer missions to Mars. This was Isaacman's second chartered flight with SpaceX, with two more still ahead under his personally financed space exploration program named Polaris after the North Star. He paid an undisclosed sum for his first spaceflight in 2021, taking along contest winners and a pediatric cancer survivor while raising more than $250 million for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. For the just completed so-called Polaris Dawn mission, the founder and CEO of the Shift4 credit card-processing company shared the cost with SpaceX. Isaacman won't divulge how much he spent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tech-billionaire-returns-to-earth-after-first-private-spacewalk-/7784887.html	2024-09-15T02:06:27-07:00	
Missile fired from Yemen lands in open area in Israel, sets off air raid sirens	JERUSALEM — A long-range missile fired from Yemen landed in an open area in central Israel early Sunday, the Israeli military said, in the latest reverberation from the nearly yearlong war in Gaza. The early morning attack triggered air raid sirens, including at Israel's international airport, where Israeli media aired footage of people racing to shelters. There were no reports of casualties or damage, and the airport authority said operations resumed as normal shortly thereafter. A fire could be seen in a rural area of central Israel, and local media showed images of what appeared to be a fragment from a missile or interceptor that landed on an escalator in a train station in the central town of Modiin. The military said the sound of explosions in the area came from interceptors. Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have repeatedly fired drones and missiles toward Israel since the start of the nearly yearlong war between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, but nearly all of them have been intercepted over the Red Sea. There was no immediate claim for Sunday's attack. In July, an Iranian-made drone launched by the Houthis struck Tel Aviv, killing one person and wounding 10 others. Israel responded with a wave of airstrikes on Houthi-held areas of Yemen. The Houthis have also repeatedly attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea, in what the rebels portray as a blockade on Israel in support of the Palestinians. Most of the targeted ships have no connection to Israel. The war in Gaza, which began with Hamas' October 7 attack into southern Israel, has rippled across the region, with Iran and allied militant groups attacking Israeli and U.S. targets and drawing retaliatory strikes from Israel and its Western allies. On several occasions, the strikes and counterstrikes have threatened to trigger a wider conflict. Iran supports militant groups across the region, including Hamas, the Houthis and Lebanon's Hezbollah, its most powerful ally, which has traded fired with Israel on a near-daily basis since the war in Gaza began. Iran and its allies say they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians. The military said around 40 projectiles were fired from Lebanon early Sunday, with most intercepted or falling in open areas. The strikes along the Israel-Lebanon border have displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides. Israel has repeatedly threatened to launch a wider military operation against Hezbollah to ensure its citizens can return to their homes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/missile-fired-from-yemen-lands-in-open-area-in-israel-sets-off-air-raid-sirens/7784874.html	2024-09-15T00:26:07-07:00	
Meet straight man protesting Ghana's anti-LGBTQ bill	ACCRA, Ghana — Texas Kadiri Moro stood in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Accra on Thursday, dressed in short pink Speedos and a pink polo shirt. Accompanied by trumpet players, carrying a banner with slogans including 'Why should a society of evildoers judge others?' and 'Justice begins where inequality ends!' he marched across the Ghanaian capital in a one-man protest against a highly controversial bill that targets members of the LGBTQ+ community and their supporters. Moro is an unusual figure amid the LGBTQ+ rights activists in the coastal West African nation. He is heterosexual, married to a woman, and a father of six. He is a teacher. And he is a practicing Muslim. Yet for months he has been conducting solo demonstrations against the bill, which criminalizes members of the LGBTQ+ community, as well as its supporters, including promotion and funding of related activities and public displays of affection. It could send some people to prison for more than a decade. The bill was passed by Ghana's parliament earlier this year but has been challenged in the Supreme Court. It has not yet been signed into law by President Nana Akufo-Addo, who cited ongoing proceedings. But he refused to reject it either. 'There are so many issues about rights' when it comes to the bill, Moro told The Associated Press. 'Homosexuality does not affect anyone,' Moro said. 'We have activities that people are doing in the country that are worse than homosexual activities,' he said, citing adultery as an example. Parliament, he said, should be more concerned with 'other crimes and pollution.' The bill has sparked condemnation from rights groups and some in the international community who have been concerned about similar efforts by other African governments. Sponsors of the bill have said it seeks to protect children and people who are victims of abuse. Man becomes target Gay sex is already illegal in Ghana, carrying a three-year prison sentence, but the new bill could imprison people for more than a decade for activities including public displays of affection and promotion and funding of LGBTQ+ activities. Since he began his protests, Moro has lost his job, not received any assistance from the LGBTQ+ community, and become a target of 'very hostile attacks from the Muslim community,' he said. But he is determined to continue. For him, it is about battling injustice. 'I know I'm doing something that God is asking me to do,' he said. To point out the hypocrisy of the bill, Moro carried a petition to the Parliament asking the government to withdraw foreign missions from countries where homosexuality is legal, if they find it 'filthy,' he said. Bill 'is a wrongdoing' At the entrance to Parliament House, Kate Addo, Parliament's director of communications, received Moro's petition on behalf of the speaker. She said she was pleased with his initiative. 'We live in a democratic country where what people do in their bedrooms is not to be anyone's concern,' Addo said. 'However, we are also regulated by law.' Even though Ghana's president delayed signing the bill into law, activists said that the debate by itself triggered an increase in physical and psychological violence against LGBTQ+ people. Joseph Kobla Wemakor, the executive director of Human Rights Reporters Ghana, said that 'abuse, both psychologically and physically against members of the community has skyrocketed' since the bill was introduced. 'The moment people hear that you are part of this, the LGBTQ+, you are an enemy,' Wekamor said. 'They are looking forward to hurting you, even lynching you, killing you.' They are 'forgetting that we are all humans,' he said. 'It takes one man to change the world,' he said. 'And if he has started something like that, other people will follow, because it (the bill) is a wrongdoing.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd---meet-straight-man-protesting-ghana-s-anti-lgbtq-bill-/7784092.html	2024-09-14T23:54:20-07:00	
Bag of Cheetos has huge impact on national park ecosystem	ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico — A bag of Cheetos gets dropped and left on the floor. Seems inconsequential, right? Hardly. Rangers at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in southern New Mexico describe it as a 'world-changing' event for the tiny microbes and insects that call this specialized subterranean environment home. The bag could have been there a day or two or maybe just hours, but those salty morsels of processed corn made soft by thick humidity triggered the growth of mold on the cavern floor and on nearby cave formations. 'To the ecosystem of the cave it had a huge impact,' the park noted in a social media post, explaining that cave crickets, mites, spiders and flies soon organized to eat and disperse the foreign mess, essentially spreading the contamination. The bright orange bag was spotted off trail by a ranger during one of the regular sweeps that park staff make through the Big Room, the largest single cave chamber by volume in North America, at the end of each day. They are looking for straggling visitors and any litter or other waste that might have been left behind on the paved trail. The Big Room is a popular spot at Carlsbad Caverns. It is a magical expanse filled with towering stalagmites, dainty stalactites and clusters of cave popcorn. Tons of trash From this underground wonderland in New Mexico to lake shores in Nevada, tributaries along the Grand Canyon and lagoons in Florida, park rangers and volunteers collect tons of trash left behind by visitors each year as part of an ongoing battle to keep unique ecosystems from being compromised while still allowing visitors access. According to the National Park Service, more than 300 million people visit the national parks each year, bringing in and generating nearly 70 million tons of trash, most of which ends up where it belongs - in garbage bins and recycling containers. But for the rest of the discarded snack bags and other debris, it often takes work to round up the waste, and organizations like Leave No Trace have been pushing their message at trailheads and online. At Carlsbad Caverns, volunteers comb the caverns collecting lint. One five-day effort netted as much as 50 pounds (22.68 kilograms). Rangers also have sweep packs and spill kits for the more delicate and sometimes nasty work that can include cleaning up human waste along the trail. 'It's such a dark area, sometimes people don't notice that it's there. So they walk through it and it tracks it throughout the entire cave,' said Joseph Ward, a park guide who is working specifically on getting the 'leave no trace' message out to park visitors and classrooms. The rangers' kits can include gloves, trash bags, water, bleach mixtures for decontamination, vacuums and even bamboo toothbrushes and tweezers for those hard-to-reach spots. As for the spilled Cheetos, Ward told The Associated Press that could have been avoided because the park doesn't allow food beyond the confines of the historic underground lunchroom. Cheetos response After the bag was discovered in July, cave specialists at the park settled on the best way to clean it up. Most of the mess was scooped up, and a toothbrush was used to remove rings of mold and fungi that had spread to nearby cave formations. It was a 20-minute job. Some jobs can take hours and involve several park employees, Ward said. Robert Melnick, professor emeritus at the University of Oregon, has been studying the cultural landscape of Carlsbad Caverns, including features like a historic wooden staircase that has become another breeding ground for exotic mold and fungi. He and his team submitted a report to the park in recent days that details those resources and makes recommendations for how the park can manage them in the future. The balancing act for park managers at Carlsbad and elsewhere, Melnick said, is meeting the dual mandate of preserving and protecting landscapes while also making them accessible. 'I don't quite know how you would monitor it except to constantly remind people that the underground, the caves, are a very, very sensitive natural environment,' he said. Pleas to treat the caverns with respect are plastered on signs throughout the park, rangers give orientations to visitors before they go underground, and reminders of the dos and don'ts are printed on the back of each ticket stub. But sometimes there is a disconnect between awareness and personal responsibility, said JD Tanner, director of education and training at Leave No Trace. Personal stake is vital Many people may be aware of the need to 'keep it pristine,' but Tanner said the message doesn't always translate into action or there is a lack of understanding that small actions — even leaving a piece of trash — can have irreversible damage in a fragile ecosystem. 'If someone doesn't feel a personal stake in the preservation of these environments, they may not take the rules seriously,' Tanner said. Diana Northup, a microbiologist who has spent years studying cave environments around the world, once crawled up the main corridor at Carlsbad Caverns to log everything that humans left behind. 'So this is just one thing of very many,' she said of the Cheetos. As many as 2,000 people go through the caverns on any given day during the busy season. With them come hair and skin fragments, and those fragments can have their own microbes on board. 'So it can be really, really bad or it can just be us and all the stuff we're shedding,' Northup said of human contamination within cave environments. 'But here's the other side of the coin: The only way you can protect caves is for people to be able to see them and experience them.' 'The biggest thing,' she said, 'is you have to get people to value and want to preserve the caves and let them know what they can do to have that happen.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/bag-of-cheetos-created-huge-impact-on-national-park-ecosystem-/7784063.html	2024-09-14T23:53:46-07:00

Muralists paint over traces of violence in Salvadoran neighborhood	MEJICANOS, El Salvador — From the window of her tin-sided shop outside El Salvador's capital, San Salvador, Esmeralda Quintanilla watches artists get to work in her neighborhood on walls still pockmarked by bullet holes from the country's civil war and gang conflict. Armed with brushes, paint and spray cans, muralists and graffiti artists have already covered the walls of several of the 40 five-story units in a housing complex in the Zacamil neighborhood of the Mejicanos district. 'With the murals, everything looks really nice,' said Quintanilla, a 55-year-old seamstress who has lived in the neighborhood nearly half her life. 'You start to see all this, and it gives the place a different image. I feel really happy, proud.' The dozen murals already completed include a Mesoamerican pyramid, pixelated depictions of the Virgin Mary and works straight out of the artists' imaginations. The initiative in the once-violent neighborhood is led by a Salvadoran foundation that seeks to fill communities with art. Its aim in Zacamil is to create stories-high murals over the next two years on nearly every wall of the complex, which houses around 4,000 residents. Zacamil got a break from decades of violence two years ago when President Nayib Bukele launched a nationwide crackdown on gangs. The state of emergency — which human rights groups have said Bukele must end amid reports of abuses — has put almost 82,000 alleged gang members in prison. Even with the murals improving the neighborhood's appearance, chronic infrastructure issues remain, with garbage piled up in the streets and storm drains clogged. TV antennas, power cables and clothes strewn out windows across clotheslines also dot the neighborhood. Many Zacamil residents fled in 1989 when fighting between the Salvadoran army and the former leftist guerrilla group, Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, nearly destroyed the Mejicanos district. When they returned, many found homes damaged by two earthquakes in 2001 or invaded by gang members. 'There are always problems, but this is a facelift,' said a 70-year-old resident who declined to give his name. El Salvador's 12-year civil war from late 1979 to January 1992 killed more than 75,000 people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/muralists-paint-over-traces-of-violence-in-salvadoran-neighborhood/7783263.html	2024-09-14T23:52:27-07:00	
Traveling 'health train' has become essential source of free care in South Africa	JOHANNESBURG — Thethiwe Mahlangu woke early on a chilly morning and walked through her busy South African township, where minibuses hooted to pick up commuters and smoke from sidewalk breakfast stalls hung in the air. Her eyes had been troubling her. But instead of going to her nearby health clinic, Mahlangu was headed to the train station for an unusual form of care. A passenger train known as Phelophepa — or 'good, clean, health' in the Sesotho language — had been transformed into a mobile health facility. It circulates throughout South Africa for much of the year, providing medical attention to the sick, young and old who often struggle to receive the care they need at crowded local clinics. For the past 30 years — ever since South Africa's break with the former racist system of apartheid — the train has carried doctors, nurses and optometrists on an annual journey that touches even the most rural villages, delivering primary health care to about 375,000 people a year. The free care it delivers is in contrast to South Africa's overstretched public health care system on which about 84% of people rely. Health care reflects the deep inequality of the country at large. Just 16% of South Africans are covered by health insurance plans that are beyond the financial reach of many in a nation with unemployment of over 32%. Earlier this year, the government began to address that gap. President Cyril Ramaphosa in May signed into law the National Health Insurance Act, which aims to provide funding so that millions of South Africans without health insurance can receive care from the better-provisioned private sector. But the law has been divisive. The government has not said how much it will cost and where the money will come from. Economists say the government will have to raise taxes. Critics say the country can't afford it and warn that the system — yet to be implemented — will be open to abuse by corrupt officials and businessmen. They say the government should fix the public health care system instead. For Mahlangu and others who look to the train for a rare source of free treatment, the situation at local health clinics is one of despair. Long lines, shortages of medicines and rude nurses are some of the challenges at the clinics that cater for thousands of patients a day in Tembisa, east of Johannesburg. 'There we are not treated well,' Mahlangu said. 'We are made to sit in the sun for long periods. You can sit there from 7 a.m. until around 4 p.m. when the clinic closes. When you ask, they say we must go ask the president to build us a bigger hospital.' The health train has grown from a single three-carriage operation over the years to two 16-carriage trains. They are run by the Transnet Foundation, a social responsibility arm of Transnet, the state-owned railway company. When the train began in 1994, many Black people in South Africa still lived in rural villages with little access to health facilities. It was a period of change in the country. The train began as an eye clinic, but it soon became clear that needs were greater than that. Now both trains address the booming population of South Africa's capital of Pretoria and nearby Johannesburg, the country's economic hub. One would spend two weeks in Tembisa alone. 'The major metros are really struggling,' said Shemona Kendiah, the train's manager. But the traveling clinic is far from the solution to South Africa's health care problems. Public health expert Alex van den Heever said there have been substantial increases in the health care budget and the public sector employment of nurses and doctors since the country's first democratic government in 1994. The health department's budget in Gauteng province, which includes Pretoria and Johannesburg, has grown from 6 billion rand ($336 million) in 2000 to 65 billion ($3.6 billion) rand now. But van den Heever accused the African National Congress, the ruling party since the end of apartheid, of allowing widespread corruption to undermine the public sector, including the health care system. 'This has led to a rapid deterioration of performance,' he said. For South Africans who have witnessed the decline firsthand, it can be a relief when the health train pulls into town. Mahlangu — with her new pair of glasses — was among hundreds who walked away satisfied with its services and already longing for the train's return next year. Another patient, Jane Mabuza, got a full health checkup along with dental services. She said she hoped the train would reach many other people. 'Here on the train, you never hear that anything has been finished,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/traveling-health-train-has-become-essential-source-of-free-care-in-south-africa/7782629.html	2024-09-14T23:51:51-07:00	
From Chinese to Italians and beyond, maligning a culture via its food is longtime American habit	new york — It's a practice that's about as American as apple pie — accusing immigrant and minority communities of engaging in bizarre or disgusting behaviors when it comes to what and how they eat and drink, a kind of shorthand for saying they don't belong. The latest iteration came at Tuesday's presidential debate, when former President Donald Trump spotlighted a false online tempest around the Haitian immigrant community of Springfield, Ohio. He repeated the groundless claim previously spread by his running mate, JD Vance, that the immigrants were stealing dogs and cats, the precious pets belonging to their American neighbors, and eating them. The furor got enough attention that officials had to step in to refute it, saying there was no credible evidence of any such thing. But while it might be enough to turn your stomach, such food-based accusations are not new. Far from it. Food-related scorn and insults were hurled at immigrant Chinese communities on the West Coast in the late 1800s as they started coming to the United States in larger numbers, and in later decades spread to other Asian and Pacific Islander communities like Thai or Vietnamese. As recently as last year, a Thai restaurant in California was hit with the stereotype, which caused such an outpouring of undeserved vitriol that the owner had to close and move to another location. Behind it is the idea that 'you're engaging in something that is not just a matter of taste, but a violation of what it is to be human,' said Paul Freedman, a professor of history at Yale University. By tarring Chinese immigrants as those who would eat things Americans would refuse to, it made them the 'other.' Food as flashpoint Other communities, while not being accused of eating pets, have been criticized for the perceived strangeness of what they were cooking when they were new arrivals, such as Italians using too much garlic or Indians too much curry powder. Minority groups with a longer presence in the country were and are still not exempt from racist stereotypes — think derogatory references to Mexicans and beans or insulting African Americans with remarks about fried chicken and watermelon. 'There's a slur for almost every ethnicity based on some kind of food that they eat,' said Amy Bentley, professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University. 'And so that's a very good way of disparaging people.' That's because food isn't just sustenance. Embedded in human eating habits are some of the very building blocks of culture — things that make different peoples distinct and can be commandeered as fodder for ethnic hatred or political polemics. 'We need it to survive, but it's also highly ritualized and highly symbolic. So the birthday cake, the anniversary, the things are commemorated and celebrated with food and drink,' Bentley said. 'It's just so highly integrated in all parts of our lives.' And because 'there's specific variations of how humans do those rituals, how they eat, how they have shaped their cuisines, how they eat their food,' she added, 'It can be as a theme of commonality ... or it can be a form of distinct division.' It's not just the what. Insults can come from the how as well — eating with hands or chopsticks instead of forks and knives, for example. It can be seen in class-based bias against poorer people who didn't have the same access to elaborate table settings or couldn't afford to eat the same way the rich did — and used different, perhaps unfamiliar ingredients out of necessity. Such disparagement can extend directly into current events. During the Second Gulf War, for example, Americans angry at France's opposition to the U.S. invasion of Iraq started calling french fries 'freedom fries.' And a much-used insulting term in the United States for Germans during the first two world wars was 'krauts' — a slam on a culture where sauerkraut was a traditional food. 'Just what was wrong with the way urban immigrants ate?' Donna R. Gabaccia wrote in her 1998 book, 'We Are What We Eat: Ethnic Food and the Making of Americans.' In reviewing attitudes of the early 20th century and its demands for '100% Americanism,' she noted that 'sauerkraut became 'victory cabbage'' and one account complained of an Italian family 'still eating spaghetti, not yet assimilated.' More food culture, more fodder Such stereotypes have persisted despite the fact that the American palate has significantly expanded in recent decades, thanks in part to the influx of those immigrant communities, with grocery stores carrying a wealth of ingredients that would baffle previous generations. The rise of restaurant culture has introduced many diners to authentic examples of cuisines they might have needed a passport to access in other eras. After all, Bentley said, 'when immigrants migrate to a different country, they bring their foodways with them and maintain them as they can. ... It's so reminiscent of family, community, home. They're just really material, multisensory manifestations of who we are.' Haitian food is just one example of that. Communities like those found in New York City and south Florida have added to the culinary landscape, using ingredients like goat, plantains and cassava. So when Trump said that immigrants in Springfield — whom he called 'the people that came in' — were eating dogs and cats and 'the pets of the people that live there,' the echoes of his remarks played into not just food but culture itself. And even though the American palate has broadened in recent decades, the persistence of food stereotypes — and outright insults, whether based in fact or completely made up — shows that just because Americans eat more broadly, it doesn't mean that carries over into tolerance or nuance about other groups. 'It's a fallacy to think that,' said Freedman. 'It's like the tourism fallacy that travel makes us more understanding of diversity. The best example right now is Mexican food. Lots and lots of people like Mexican food AND think that immigration needs to be stopped. There's no link between enjoyment of a foreigner's cuisine and that openness.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/from-chinese-to-italians-and-beyond-maligning-a-culture-via-its-foods-is-a-longtime-american-habit-/7782604.html	2024-09-14T23:51:19-07:00	
Historians say increased censorship in China makes research hard	BEIJING — At Beijing's largest antiques market, Panjiayuan, among the Mao statues, posters and second-hand books are prominent signs warning against the sale of publications that might have state secrets or 'reactionary propaganda.' Some of the signs display a hotline number so that citizens can tip off authorities if they witness an illegal sale. China's antique and flea markets were once a gold mine of documents for historians, but now the signs are emblematic of the chill that has descended on their ability to do research in the country. On one hand, Beijing wants to increase academic exchange and President Xi Jinping last November invited 50,000 American students to China over the next five years -- a massive jump from about 800 currently. How much steam that will gather is very much an open question. But scholars of modern Chinese history in particular -- arguably among the people most interested in China - fear that tightened censorship is extinguishing avenues for independent research into the country's past. This is especially so for documents relating to the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution -- the most historically sensitive period for the Chinese Communist Party -- when Mao Zedong declared class war and plunged China into chaos and violence. 'I would say the period of going to flea markets and simply finding treasure troves is pretty much over,' said Daniel Leese, a modern China historian at the University of Freiburg. Trawling for documents 'has basically gone out of favor because it has simply become too complex, difficult and dangerous,' he said, adding that younger foreign scholars are increasingly relying on overseas collections. The Chinese Communist Party has exerted control over all publications including books, the media and the internet since establishing the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, with the degree of censorship fluctuating over time. But censorship has only intensified under President Xi Jinping, who came to power in 2012 and has blamed 'historic nihilism' or versions of history that differ from the official accounts for causing the collapse of the Soviet Union. In recent years, a raft of new national security and anti-espionage legislation has made scholars even more wary of citing unofficial Chinese materials. Some scholars of modern Chinese history who have published studies that either challenged Chinese state narratives or are on sensitive topics say they have been denied visas to China. James Millward, a historian at Georgetown University, said he had been visa-blocked on several occasions after contributing to the 2004 book Xinjiang: China's Muslim Borderland but has since received short-term visas a few times albeit after a lengthy process. The political climate is also shaping how historians choose their research subjects. One historian based in the U.S. said he has chosen to work on non-controversial topics to maintain travel access to China. He declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. China's education ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The foreign ministry said it was unaware of relevant circumstances. Documentary discoveries Leese and other foreign historians say they previously found case files of persecuted intellectuals as well as secret Communist Party documents at Chinese flea and antique markets. These were often donated by relatives of deceased officials or painstakingly rescued by booksellers from recycling centers near government offices disbanded during the mass state sector layoffs of the 1990s. But the government has, since 2008, cracked down on flea markets and other sources of used books and documents. Buyers have been arrested, sellers have been fined and used book websites have been cleared of politically sensitive items, according to domestic media reports, collectors and four overseas researchers who spoke with Reuters. In 2019, for example, a Japanese historian was detained for two months on spying charges after buying 1930s books on the Sino-Japanese War from a second-hand bookshop. Two years later, a hobbyist accused of selling illegal publications from Hong Kong and Taiwan publishers on Kongfuzi, China's biggest website for used books, was fined 280,000 yuan ($39,000) for not having a business license, Chinese media reported. And this year, two workers at a recycling center were punished for selling confidential military documents, state media said. Buyers now cultivate personal relationships with merchants who sell through WeChat, said a Beijing-based collector interested in documents from the Cultural Revolution, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Historians also note that access to the vast majority of local government archives has been restricted since 2010 and their digitization has enabled censors to heavily redact them. Foreign-based historians add that their counterparts in mainland China can only preserve materials for posterity in the current political climate. But not all are downbeat. 'Even under Xi, Chinese scholars continue to seek openings and enlarge the understanding and interpretation of PRC history,' said Yi Lu, assistant history professor at Dartmouth College, who has worked extensively with Chinese university collections of 20th-century materials. 'All is not lost.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-wants-academic-exchange-but-historians-say-increased-censorship-makes-research-hard-/7782594.html	2024-09-14T23:50:45-07:00	
US consumer watchdog finds school lunch fees taking toll on parents	new york — Single mother Rebecca Wood, 45, was already dealing with high medical bills in 2020 when she noticed she was being charged a $2.49 'program fee' each time she loaded money onto her daughter's school lunch account. As more schools turn to cashless payment systems, more districts have contracted with processing companies that charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The report found that though legally schools must offer a fee-free option to pay by cash or check, there's rarely transparency around it. 'It wouldn't have been a big deal if I had hundreds of dollars to dump into her account at the beginning of the year,' Wood said. 'I didn't. I was paying as I went, which meant I was paying a fee every time. The $2.50 transaction fee was the price of a lunch. So I'd pay for six lunches, but only get five.' The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal policy on fee-free school lunch, has mandated that districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome. 'It's just massively inconvenient,' said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children. Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead. 'A dollar here and there, I expected,' she said. 'But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower — as are the salaries — is a lot.' Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day, for two working parents, was an increased burden of time and effort. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free lunches in school, which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point. In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account. For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, those fees can hit weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report. In Wood's case, she researched the fees and learned about the USDA requirement to offer fee-free payment by cash or by check. When she pointed this out to the superintendent of her daughter's Massachusetts school district, the administrator said the lack of transparency was an oversight. To protest, Wood had planned to pay for her daughter's lunches in coins at the school office, together with other parents. But then the pandemic hit, changing, among other things, school lunch policy. In subsequent years, Wood became part of a campaign that successfully pushed for universal free school lunches in the state, but she continues to protest school processing fees for families. 'Even if lunch itself is free, if you want to buy something a la carte, or an extra lunch, or some other transaction, you still have to pay that fee,' Wood said. 'They take money from people who need it the most.' While payment companies maintain that school districts have the chance to negotiate fees and rates when they form their contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures 'may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.' Just three companies — MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect — dominate the market, according to the report. Without the ability to choose which company to work with, 'families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,' the agency said, 'including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.' The companies named in the report did not respond to requests for comment. I'm a parent facing these fees. What can I do? Know that you always have a right to pay by cash or check, under federal policy. You can also request that your school district negotiate down the fees with their payment processing company, or request that the district cover the fees directly, which can give them leverage in negotiating a contract. If your school is located in a low-income area, you may also check whether your district qualifies for the Community Eligibility Provision, which would allow the school to provide free breakfast and lunch to all enrolled students. More information on the CEP is available at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's website.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-consumer-watchdog-finds-school-lunch-fees-taking-a-toll-on-parents-/7781142.html	2024-09-14T23:49:59-07:00	
Robot begins removing Fukushima nuclear plant’s melted fuel	tokyo — A long robot entered a damaged reactor at Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant on Tuesday, beginning a two-week, high-stakes mission to retrieve for the first time a tiny amount of melted fuel debris from the bottom. The robot's trip into the Unit 2 reactor is a crucial initial step for what comes next — a daunting, decades-long process to decommission the plant and deal with large amounts of highly radioactive melted fuel inside three reactors that were damaged by a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Specialists hope the robot will help them learn more about the status of the cores and the fuel debris. Here is an explanation of how the robot works, its mission, significance and what lies ahead as the most challenging phase of the reactor cleanup begins. What is the fuel debris? Nuclear fuel in the reactor cores melted after the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant's cooling systems to fail. The melted fuel dripped down from the cores and mixed with internal reactor materials such as zirconium, stainless steel, electrical cables, broken grates and concrete around the supporting structure and at the bottom of the primary containment vessels. The reactor meltdowns caused the highly radioactive, lava-like material to spatter in all directions, greatly complicating the cleanup. The condition of the debris also differs in each reactor. Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, or TEPCO, which manages the plant, says an estimated 880 tons of molten fuel debris remains in the three reactors, but some experts say the amount could be larger. What is the robot's mission? Workers will use five 1.5-meter-long pipes connected in sequence to maneuver the robot through an entry point in the Unit 2 reactor's primary containment vessel. The robot itself can extend about 6 meters inside the vessel. Once inside, it will be maneuvered remotely by operators at another building at the plant because of the fatally high radiation emitted by the melted debris. The front of the robot, equipped with tongs, a light and a camera, will be lowered by a cable to a mound of melted fuel debris. It will then snip off and collect a bit of the debris — less than 3 grams). The small amount is meant to minimize radiation dangers. The robot will then back out to the place it entered the reactor, a roundtrip journey that will take about two weeks. The mission takes that long because the robot must make extremely precise maneuvers to avoid hitting obstacles or getting stuck in passageways. That has happened to earlier robots. TEPCO is also limiting daily operations to two hours to minimize the radiation risk for workers in the reactor building. Eight six-member teams will take turns, with each group allowed to stay maximum of about 15 minutes. What do officials hope to learn? Sampling the melted fuel debris is 'an important first step,' said Lake Barrett, who led the cleanup after the 1979 disaster at the U.S. Three Mile Island nuclear plant for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and is now a paid adviser for TEPCO's Fukushima decommissioning. While the melted fuel debris has been kept cool and has stabilized, the aging of the reactors poses potential safety risks, and the melted fuel needs to be removed and relocated to a safer place for long-term storage as soon as possible, experts say. An understanding of the melted fuel debris is essential to determine how best to remove it, store it and dispose of it, according to the Japan Atomic Energy Agency. Experts expect the sample will also provide more clues about how exactly the meltdown 13 years ago played out, some of which is still a mystery. The melted fuel sample will be kept in secure canisters and sent to multiple laboratories for more detailed analysis. If the radiation level exceeds a set limit, the robot will take the sample back into the reactor. 'It's the start of a process. It's a long, long road ahead,' Barrett said in an online interview. 'The goal is to remove the highly radioactive material, put it into engineered canisters ... and put those in storage.' For this mission, the robot's small tong can only reach the upper surface of the debris. The pace of the work is expected to pick up in the future as more experience is gained and robots with additional capabilities are developed. What's next? TEPCO will have to 'probe down into the debris pile, which is over a meter thick, so you have to go down and see what's inside,' Barrett said, noting that at Three Mile Island, the debris on the surface was very different from the material deeper inside. He said multiple samples from different locations must be collected and analyzed to better understand the melted debris and develop necessary equipment, such as stronger robots for future larger-scale removal. Compared to collecting a tiny sample for analysis, it will be a more difficult challenge to develop and operate robots that can cut larger chunks of melted debris into pieces and put that material into canisters for safe storage. There are also two other damaged reactors, Unit 1 and Unit 3, which are in worse condition and will take even longer to deal with. TEPCO plans to deploy a set of small drones in Unit 1 for a probe later this year and is developing even smaller 'micro' drones for Unit 3, which is filled with a larger amount of water. Separately, hundreds of spent fuel rods remain in unenclosed cooling pools on the top floor of both Unit 1 and 2. This is a potential safety risk if there's another major quake. Removal of spent fuel rods has been completed at Unit 3. When will the decommissioning be finished? Removal of the melted fuel was initially planned to start in late 2021 but has been delayed by technical issues, underscoring the difficulty of the process. The government says decommissioning is expected to take 30-40 years, while some experts say it could take as long as 100 years. Others are pushing for an entombment of the plant, as at Chernobyl after its 1986 explosion, to reduce radiation levels and risks for plant workers. That won't work at the seaside Fukushima plant, Barrett says. 'You're in a high seismic area, you're in a high-water area, and there are a lot of unknowns in those (reactor) buildings,' he said. 'I don't think you can just entomb it and wait.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/robot-begins-removing-fukushima-nuclear-plant-s-melted-fuel/7781166.html	2024-09-14T23:49:27-07:00	
Brazilian dog plays footvolley by passing, driving ball with his snout	rio de janeiro — Rio de Janeiro's main beaches bustle with commotion on sunny weekends. But activity ground to a near standstill on one stretch of sand. People held up their phones to record athletic feats they'd never before witnessed, or even imagined. The game? Footvolley, a combination of soccer and beach volleyball. The athlete? A 3-year-old border collie named Floki. Floki sparks wonder among bystanders because he hangs tough in a game that even humans struggle to get a handle on. Footvolley rules are essentially the same as beach volleyball, but with a slightly lower net and, like soccer, players are forbidden from using hands and arms. Floki springs up from the sand to drive the ball with his snout. He has become something of an internet sensation in Brazil, with hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram and TikTok. Floki's owner, Gustavo Rodrigues, is a footvolley coach, but swears he didn't plan this. He had wanted an American Bully, a decidedly less sprightly breed. Floki came into Rodrigues' life instead and quickly revealed his potential when, at just 2 months old, he started jumping after birthday balloons. Rodrigues started Floki out on what's called 'altinha,' where a group standing in a circle juggles a soccer ball for as long as possible. In 2023, Floki made his debut in the much more complex, competitive game of footvolley — a hobby enjoyed by some Brazilian soccer stars after they retire, including World Cup winners Ronaldinho and Romario. Footvolley players need poise, agility, coordination, timing, finesse. Covering one side of the court between just two people means quick sprints back and forth on soft sand under the baking sun. It's no mean feat, but Floki was a natural. A star was born. 'He does things that even some professionals don't — like positioning on the court,' said Rodrigues, 26. 'Sometimes the ball goes from one side (of the court) to the other, and he doesn't keep his back turned to it. He turns toward the ball to always hit it straight on.' It's clear this high-energy pup lives for this game. Even resting under the shade of the beach's caipirinha bar, he was laser-focused on the action of the adjacent court's match. When playing, he barks at Rodrigues to pass him the ball and seems to at least understand the basic rules. At times, rather than passing back to Rodrigues for the third and final touch their opponents expect, he sneaks the ball over the net himself to score a point. Then he jumps into Rodrigues' arms to celebrate. One of the awestruck onlookers Sunday was Luiza Chioli, who had traveled to Rio from Sao Paulo. She already knew the famous Floki from TikTok, but hadn't expected front-row seats to watch him while sipping her gin and tonic. 'Seeing social media, we had thought it was just cuts, that they used the best takes,' said Chioli, 21. 'But we saw he played, performed the whole time, did really well. It's really cool.' As Floki's follower count has grown, partnerships and endorsement deals have come rolling in. Rodrigues and Floki live in the inland capital Brasilia, but often travel to Rio — footvolley's mecca — and other Brazilian states to show off his skills, do marketing appearances and create monetized social media content. Floki's Sunday began with almost an hour playing beside former footvolley champion Natalia Guitler, who's been called Queen of the Beach. Between attempts to film her doing a trick pass to him, he scampered for drinks of water or to dip in the ocean. By the end, both she and Floki were scrambling for shade. 'We're dead,' she said as she collapsed onto the sand next to a panting Floki. Someone passed her a phone to check out the best clips for her Instagram, where she has almost 3 million followers. 'Me and my bestie @dog_altinha playing footvolley,' she wrote in a later post showing their long rally, and which included her bicycle kicking the ball over the net. After a rest and another footvolley session, Floki headed to a more remote beach to do a marketing shoot for Farm, a fashion designer that's become the paragon of Rio's breezy tropical style, both in Brazil and abroad. Then Floki was on Instagram hyping a brand of dog popsicles, gnawing a banana-flavored one himself, and giving an altinha demonstration to mall shoppers. His evening stroll along Copacabana's beachside promenade showed him straining against his leash, still evidently bursting with his boundless energy. With their weekend marketing blitz in Rio over, Rodrigues and Floki would head back to Brasilia, where their influencer hustle takes a back seat to the hustle of playing competitive matches. They win about one in every three, Rodrigues said, and their opponents are always desperate to avoid being beaten by a dog. 'It generates talk, and people make fun,' said Rodrigues. 'No one likes to lose a point to him, so people play their hearts out against us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazilian-dog-plays-footvolley-by-passing-driving-ball-with-his-mouth/7781119.html	2024-09-14T23:48:51-07:00	
Nightlife now rules in Iraq's former IS bastion	Mosul, Iraq — If they had tried to do this a few years ago, the group of Iraqi women enjoying a night out in Mosul would probably have risked severe punishment. The northern city was under the harsh rule of the Islamic State group until the jihadists were ousted from their last major Iraqi bastion in 2017. Seven years later, Mosul's streets truly come alive at nightfall, and residents are rediscovering the art of having a good time. Amira Taha and her friends have come to a restaurant with their children, to enjoy food and live music -- complete with crooners -- on a night out that would have been unthinkable under IS rule. 'There has been enormous change in Mosul,' Taha tells AFP. 'We now have freedom and nights out like this have become common' because of 'the very stable security situation.' The city has new restaurants to go to, pleasure cruises on the river Tigris, and amusement parks that draw families keen to take advantage of the newfound stability. Dressed in an electric blue suit, the 35-year-old mother says 'people wanted to open up [to the world] and enjoy themselves.' Reign of terror On the stage, three Iraqi singers in suits and slicked-back hair take it in turns to entertain the diners with Iraqi and Arab pop songs. The orchestra includes an electric organist, a violinist, and a musician playing the darbouka, a goblet-shaped drum. When the jihadists took Mosul in 2014 they imposed a reign of sheer terror. Music was banned, as were cigarettes. Churches and museums were ransacked and IS staged public stonings and beheaded perceived wrongdoers. Even after Mosul was retaken in 2017 in a destructive and lengthy fight by Iraqi and international coalition forces, it took several years for its citizens to emerge from years of trauma. Entire neighborhoods were devastated, and reconstruction became a lengthy process. Mines had to be cleared before homes, infrastructure and roads could be rebuilt to allow hundreds of thousands of people to return to what is now a metropolis of 1.5 million people. In the past, Taha says, 'people would go home, shut their doors and then go to bed' because of fears over security. But now, all around her on the restaurant's lawns, families are seated at most of the tables. Sometimes the men and women puff on water pipes as their children clap and dance. Overlooking the restaurant is a brand-new bridge spanning the Tigris, a proud symbol of a Mosul being reborn. Taking a gamble Other cities in Iraq are in a similar situation, enjoying a return to normality after decades marked by war, sectarian violence, kidnappings, political conflict and jihadist extremism. Ahmed -- who goes by only his first name -- opened a restaurant called 'Chef Ahmed the Swede' in June, after spending 'half of my life' in Sweden and taking a gamble. Now he serves between 300 and 400 diners every day, Ahmed tells AFP. 'I'd always dreamt of coming back and starting my own business,' says the proprietor, who is in his 40s. 'People want to go out, they want to see something different,' he says. At Ahmed's, diners can choose from dishes inspired by Scandinavian and European cuisines, alongside old favorites such as pastas, pizzas and grilled meats. Khalil Ibrahim runs an amusement park on the banks of the river. 'The city has seen radical changes over the past few years,' he says. 'We've gone from destruction to reconstruction.' Friday is the first day of the weekend, and the evening is pierced by the happy shrieks and laughter of children in dodgem cars, the Ferris wheel and other attractions. 'People used to go home early,' Ibrahim tells AFP. 'But now they're still arriving even at midnight.' 'We can breathe' His park opened in 2011, but it was 'completely destroyed' in the war. 'We started again from scratch' with the help of private funding, he says. As Mosul was still emerging from its jihadist nightmare, another tragedy befell the city. In 2019 around 100 people, mostly women and children, died when a ferry taking families across the river to a leisure park capsized. But today, pleasure boats ply the Tigris by night, their passengers admiring the riverbank lights of the restaurants and their reflection in the dark waters. In small cafes, clients play dominoes or cards as they have a smoke. 'We're comfortable here. We can breathe. We have the river, and that's enough for us,' says day laborer Jamal Abdel Sattar. 'Some shops stay open until 3 in the morning, and some never close,' he adds. 'When people got their first taste of security, they began to go out again.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nightlife-now-rules-in-iraq-s-former-is-bastion/7784854.html	2024-09-14T22:33:35-07:00	
Storm, flooding death toll in Myanmar jumps to 74	Yangon, Myanmar — The death toll in Myanmar in the wake of Typhoon Yagi has jumped to 74, state media reported on Sunday, a day after its junta made a rare request for foreign aid. Floods and landslides have killed almost 350 people in Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand in the wake of Typhoon Yagi, which hit the region last weekend, according to official figures. In Myanmar, the floods 'resulted in 74 deaths and 89 people missing' as of Friday evening, the Global New Light of Myanmar said. Search and rescue operations were ongoing, it said, adding that the floods had destroyed more than 65,000 houses and five dams, heaping further misery on the country where war has raged since the military's 2021 coup. The junta's previous death toll was 33, with more than 235,000 people displaced, according to figures released Friday. Swathes of farmland have been inundated in central regions, including around the sprawling, low-lying capital Naypyidaw. There have been reports of landslides in hilly areas but with roads and bridges damaged and phone and internet lines down, compiling information has been difficult. The Sittaung and Bago rivers, which flow through central and southern Myanmar, were both still above dangerous levels Sunday, state media said, although water levels were expected to fall in the coming days. Authorities in Myanmar had opened 82 'relief camps' to house displaced people, according to state media. Thailand's weather office warned Sunday of further heavy rain in provinces along the Mekong river. Request for aid The floods have heaped more misery on Myanmar, where more than 2.7 million people have already displaced by conflict. Myanmar's junta chief made a rare request for foreign aid to deal with the floods, state media reported Saturday. The military has previously blocked or frustrated humanitarian assistance from abroad. Last year it suspended travel authorizations for aid groups trying to reach around a million victims of powerful Cyclone Mocha that hit the west of the country. On Saturday the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) in Myanmar and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told AFP they could not currently comment on the junta's request. Heavy monsoon rains lash Southeast Asia every year, but human-made climate change is causing more intense weather patterns that can make destructive floods more likely. Climate change is causing typhoons to form closer to the coast, intensify faster and stay longer over land, according to a study published in July.	https://www.voanews.com/a/storm-flooding-death-toll-in-myanmar-jumps-to-74/7784852.html	2024-09-14T22:02:56-07:00	
Italian prosecutors seek 6-year sentence for Salvini in migration case	rome — Italian prosecutors requested on Saturday a six-year prison sentence for Matteo Salvini, Italy's far-right deputy prime minister, for allegedly blocking migrants from disembarking at one of the country's ports in 2019. Salvini, a partner in Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's coalition, is on trial for alleged deprivation of liberty and abuse of office for keeping 147 migrants at sea for weeks on a ship run by the Open Arms charity. 'The prosecution has asked for former interior minister Salvini to be sentenced to six years,' Open Arms' lawyer Arturo Salerni told AFP, as the 'long and difficult trial' nears an end. A verdict in the trial, which began in October 2021, could come next month, he said. Salvini would be free to appeal any decision. Salvini was not present, but wrote on Facebook: 'Six years in prison for having blocked arrivals and defended Italy and Italians? Madness. Defending Italy is not a crime.' Meloni also criticized the prosecutors. 'It is incredible that a minister of the Italian Republic risks 6 years in prison for doing his job defending the nation's borders, as required by the mandate received from its citizens,' the prime minister wrote on X. In summing up, prosecutor Geri Ferrara told the Palermo court in Sicily that there was 'one key principle that is not debatable.' 'Between human rights and the protection of state sovereignty, it is human rights that must prevail in our fortunately democratic system,' he said. The ship was stuck at sea for nearly three weeks before the migrants were allowed to disembark on the island of Lampedusa following a court order. Members of Open Arms have testified that the migrants' physical and mental well-being reached a crisis point as sanitary conditions onboard became dire, including a scabies outbreak. Salvini, head of the anti-immigration League party and interior minister at the time, testified in January that he had understood that 'the situation was not at risk' onboard the ship. 'The POS (safe port) should have been provided immediately and without delay,' prosecutor Marzia Sabella said Saturday, according to Italian media reports. 'Refusing to do so was breaking the rules, not being in line with a government plan,' and Salvini's 'choices' had given rise to 'chaos,' she said. A populist known for an 'Italians first' policy, Salvini has repeatedly used attacks against illegal immigration to boost his political capital. In 2019, serving under prime minister Giuseppe Conte, he implemented a 'closed ports' policy under which Italy refused entry to charity ships that rescue migrants stranded while crossing the Mediterranean. He cast it as a tough measure against traffickers who operate boats between North Africa and Italy and Malta, the deadliest migrant crossing in the world. French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, also known for her anti-immigrant politics, offered Salvini a message of support on Saturday night, alleging he was the target of 'judicial harassment aimed at silencing him.' Salvini thanked her and promised not to 'give in.' Much of the trial has been focused on determining whether the decision-making and responsibility in the case lay with the Conte government or Salvini alone. Salvini has previously faced a similar trial, accused of refusing to allow 116 migrants to disembark from an Italian coast guard boat in July 2019. But it was thrown out by a court in Catania in 2021.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italian-prosecutors-seek-6-year-sentence-for-salvini-in-migration-case/7784843.html	2024-09-14T20:19:51-07:00	
WHO flags limited mpox testing in epicenter DRC	Geneva, Switzerland — Limited capacity is keeping mpox testing coverage low in the DR Congo — the epicenter of the international emergency — the World Health Organization said Saturday in its latest situation report. 'Testing coverage in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains low, due to limited testing capacity,' the United Nations health agency said in its update. It said the mpox case fatality ratio in the DRC in 2024 was 0.5% among confirmed cases — or 25 deaths from 5,160 cases — and 3.3% among suspected cases, both tested and untested — or 717 deaths among 21,835 cases. 'Due to limited access to laboratory testing in remote areas, only about 40% of all suspected cases have been tested in 2024 (up from 9% in 2023), and among these, around 55% tested positive,' the WHO said. It said the three countries reporting the most suspected cases in the year up to September 8 were the DRC, followed by Burundi (1,489 suspected cases, no deaths), and Nigeria (935 suspected cases, no deaths). There are two clades of mpox, each with a and b subclades. The WHO said the clades and their subclades were circulating in different geographic areas and were affecting different populations — and therefore needed 'tailored and locally adapted outbreak responses.' The WHO declared an international emergency over mpox on August 14, concerned by the surge in cases of the new Clade 1b strain in the DRC that spread to nearby countries. In the DRC, Clade 1b has been detected chiefly in the eastern South Kivu and North Kivu provinces, with additional cases in the Kinshasa capital province. Current sequencing capacity in the DRC 'is limited, and clade distribution might be broader than what is currently known' the WHO said. Clade 1b has also been detected in the DRC's eastern neighbors Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda, plus Kenya. Additionally, a single case has been detected in Sweden and another in Thailand. Looking at global vaccine availability, the WHO said more than 3.6 million doses had been pledged for the global response, including more than 620,000 doses of the MVA-BN vaccine by European countries, the United States and manufacturer Bavarian Nordic. Meanwhile Japan has pledged 3 million doses of the LC16 vaccine. To date, 265,000 MVA-BN doses have been delivered to Kinshasa, while 10,000 have gone to Nigeria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-flags-limited-mpox-testing-in-epicenter-drc-/7784829.html	2024-09-14T18:39:24-07:00	
Tunisia’s presidential campaign season begins a day after protests	TUNIS, Tunisia — The official start of the presidential campaign season in Tunisia began on Saturday, a day after Tunisians took their anger to the streets of the capital to decry what protesters say is the deteriorating state of the country. In what appeared to be the largest protest since authorities began a monthslong wave of arrests earlier this year, hundreds of Tunisians marched peacefully on Friday and called for an end to what they called a police state. 'We're here to say no and show that we don't all agree with what's really happening in the country,' Khaled Ben Abdeslam, a father and urban development consultant, told The Associated Press. In 2011, longtime Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was toppled by nationwide protests that unleashed revolt across the Arab world. More than a decade later, Ben Abdelslam said he was worried about the growing number of political figures who've been thrown in jail under President Kais Saied and said he wants to ensure Tunisia 'turns the page' for the good of his kids. 'Nobody dares to say or do anything anymore today,' he said as protesters neared Tunisia's powerful Interior Ministry. He and other demonstrators slammed both Tunisia's economic and political woes, carrying signs that grouped together the growing costs of staple items and growing concerns about civil liberties. 'Where is sugar? Where is oil? Where is freedom? Where is democracy?' signs read. Some carried posters telling the government that 'human rights are not optional' while others revived the popular slogans that mobilized Tunisia's masses against Ben Ali. This time though, they directed scorn toward Saied. The protests capped off a week in which the North African country's largest opposition party, Ennahda, said its senior members had been arrested en masse, at a scale not previously seen. The arrests come as Saied prepares to campaign for reelection on October 6, when he will ask voters to grant him a second term. When first elected in 2019, Saied used anti-corruption promises to win over people disillusioned with the political controversies that plagued Tunisia's young democracy in the years that followed the Arab Spring. Since taking office, the 66-year-old former law professor has gone to lengths to consolidate his own power, freezing the country's parliament and rewriting the constitution. Throughout his tenure, authorities have arrested journalists, activists, civil society figures and political opponents across the ideological spectrum. And though he promised to chart a new course for the country, its unemployment rate has steadily increased to one of the region's highest at 16%, with young Tunisians hit particularly hard. The economy continues to face significant challenges, yet Saied has managed to energize supporters with populist rhetoric, often accusing migrants from sub-Saharan Africa of violence and crime and aiming at changing the country's demography. In the months leading up to his reelection bid, the political crackdown has expanded. His opponents have been arrested, placed under gag order or faced criminal investigations that observers have called politically motivated. Figures who said they planned to challenge him have been sentenced for breaking campaign finance laws. Others have been ruled ineligible to challenge him by Tunisia's election authority. Even those whom the authority approved have later faced arrest. Ayachi Zammel, a businessman planning to challenge Saied, was promptly arrested after being announced as one of the two candidates approved to appear on the ballot alongside Saied. His attorney, Abdessattar Messaoudi, told The Associated Press that she feared a court may bar him from politics for life as it had done to other Saied challengers. The Tunisian Network for the Defense of Rights and Freedoms — a newly formed coalition of civil society groups and political parties — organized Friday's protest to draw attention to what it called a surge of authoritarianism. Outrage swelled among many members of the network after the country's election authority — made up of Saied appointees — dismissed a court ruling ordering it to reinstate three challengers to Saied. The authority has defied judges who have ruled in favor of candidates who have appealed its decisions and pledged not to allow Mondher Zenaidi, Abdellatif El Mekki and Imed Daimi to appear on the ballot alongside Saied next month. Hajer Mohamed, a 33-year-old law firm assistant said that she and her friends are terrified about the direction Tunisia is heading in ways they couldn't have imagined when people rejoiced the freedoms won 13 years ago. 'We never thought that after the 2011 revolution we'd live to see the country's suffocating situation,' she said. 'Even under former dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the situation wasn't as scandalous as it is today.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tunisia-s-presidential-campaign-season-begins-a-day-after-protests/7784831.html	2024-09-14T18:35:28-07:00	
Shame must change sides' — France's rape plaintiff becomes feminist icon	Marseille, France — Walking into court each day with her head held high, the ex-wife of a Frenchman on trial for orchestrating multiple rapes of her in her own bed for almost a decade has become a feminist icon. With her now trademark auburn bob and dark glasses, 71-year-old Gisele Pelicot has become a figurehead in the battle against the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse. Her life was shattered in 2020 when she discovered that her partner of five decades had for years been secretly administering her large doses of tranquilizers to rape her and invite dozens of strangers to join him. But she has decided not to hide and demanded the trial of Dominique Pelicot, 71, and 50 co-defendants since September 2 be open to the public because, as she has said through one of her lawyers, it should be up to her alleged abusers — not her — to be ashamed. 'It's a way of saying ... shame must change sides,' her attorney Stephane Babonneau said as the trial opened. Since then, feminist activists have held up her stylized portrait by Belgian artist Aline Dessine, with the words 'Shame is changing sides,' to show support at protests. The artist with 2.5 million followers on TikTok has given up all rights to the image. Thousands protest Thousands protested in cities across France on Saturday in support of Gisele Pelicot and demanding an end to rape. 'Gisele for all, all for Gisele,' read one hand-drawn poster at a gathering in the southern city of Marseille. A day earlier, outside the courthouse in the southern town of Avignon, protester Nadege Peneau said she was full of admiration for the trial's main plaintiff. 'What she's doing is very brave,' she said. 'She's speaking up for so many children and women, and even men' who have been abused. Gisele Pelicot in August obtained a divorce from her husband, who has confessed to the abuse after meticulously documenting it with photos and videos. She has moved away from the southern town of Mazan where, in her own words, for years he treated her like 'a piece of meat' or a 'rag doll.' She now uses her maiden name, but during the trial has asked the media to use her former name as a married woman. Her lawyer Antoine Camus said she had transformed from a devoted wife and retiree, who loved walks and choir singing, into a woman ready for a battle. 'I will have to fight till the end,' she told the press on September 5, in her only public statement outside court in the first days of the four-month trial. 'Obviously it's not an easy exercise and I can feel attempts to trap me with certain questions,' she added calmly. Learning truth behind memory lapses She met Dominique Pelicot, her future husband and rapist, in 1971. She had dreamed of becoming a hairdresser but instead studied to be a typist. After a few years temping, she joined France's national electricity company EDF, ending her career in a logistics service for its nuclear power plants. At home, she looked after her three children and later seven grandchildren. Only when the police caught her husband filming up women's skirts in a supermarket in 2020 did she find out the true reason behind her troubling memory lapses. Camus, her lawyer, said his client 'never wanted to be a role model.' 'She just wants all this not to be in vain,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shame-must-change-sides-france-s-rape-plaintiff-becomes-feminist-icon-/7784817.html	2024-09-14T17:54:22-07:00	
Boeing strike could last ‘a while’; workers confident of higher wages, union says	SEATTLE — A strike at Boeing 'could go on for a while' as workers are confident they can get bigger wage increases and an improved pension, union leader Jon Holden said in an interview with National Public Radio on Saturday. More than 30,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), who produce Boeing's top-selling 737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland, began a strike Friday after overwhelmingly voting down a new contract. Boeing and union negotiators are to return to the bargaining table next week, in talks overseen by U.S. federal mediators, after more than 94% of workers voted to reject an initial contract offer that Holden had endorsed. Holden said the priorities for his members were a bigger wage increase and the restoration of a defined-benefit pension scheme that the union lost during a previous round of negotiations with Boeing a decade ago. 'We have the most leverage and the most power at the most opportune time that we've ever had in our history, and our members are expecting us to use it,' Holden told NPR. 'I know that our members are confident. They're standing shoulder to shoulder and they're ready. So it (the strike) could go on for a while,' he said. The initial deal included a 25% pay raise spread over four years and a commitment by Boeing to build its next commercial jet in the Seattle region, if the plane program is launched within the four-year period of the contract. Union members, venting frustration at years of stagnant wages and rising living costs, said removal of a performance bonus in the Boeing offer would erode half of the headline salary increase. Boeing's stock fell 3.7% on Friday. It has tumbled almost 40% so far this year, slashing the company's market value by roughly $58 billion. A long strike could further damage Boeing's finances, already groaning because of $60 billion in debt. A lengthy pause on plane production would also weigh on airlines that fly Boeing jets and suppliers that manufacture parts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-strike-could-last-a-while-workers-confident-of-higher-wages-union-says/7784821.html	2024-09-14T17:54:17-07:00	
NATO’s Bauer, others support Ukraine using long-range weapons against Russia	PRAGUE — The head of NATO's military committee said Saturday that Ukraine has the solid legal and military right to strike deep inside Russia to gain combat advantage — reflecting the beliefs of several U.S. allies — even as the Biden administration balks at allowing Kyiv to do so using American-made weapons. 'Every nation that is attacked has the right to defend itself. And that right doesn't stop at the border of your own nation,' said Admiral Rob Bauer, speaking at the close of the committee's annual meeting, also attended by U.S. Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Bauer, of Netherlands, also added that nations have the sovereign right to put limits on the weapons they send to Ukraine. But, standing next to him at a news briefing, Lt. General Karel Řehka, chief of the General Staff of the Czech Armed Forces, made it clear his nation places no such weapons restrictions on Kyiv. 'We believe that the Ukrainians should decide themselves how to use it,' Řehka said. Their comments came as U.S. President Joe Biden is weighing whether to allow Ukraine to use American-provided long-range weapons to hit deep into Russia. And they hint at the divisions over the issue. Biden met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday, after this week's visit to Kyiv by their top diplomats, who came under fresh pressure to loosen weapons restrictions. U.S. officials familiar with discussions said they believed Starmer was seeking Biden's approval to allow Ukraine to use British Storm Shadow missiles for expanded strikes in Russia. Biden's approval may be needed because Storm Shadow components are made in the U.S. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share the status of private conversations, said they believed Biden would be amenable, but there has been no decision announced yet. On Thursday Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that allowing long-range strikes 'would mean that NATO countries, the United States and European countries, are at war with Russia.' His remarks were in line with the narrative the Kremlin has promoted since early in the war, accusing NATO countries of de-facto participation in the conflict and threatening a response. Providing additional support and training for Ukraine was a key topic at the NATO chiefs' meeting, but it wasn't clear Saturday if the debate over the U.S. restrictions was discussed. Many of the European nations have been vigorously supportive of Ukraine in part because they worry about being the next victim of an empowered Russia. At the opening of the meeting, Czech Republic President Petr Pavel broadly urged the military chiefs gathered in the room to be 'bold and open in articulating your assessments and recommendations. The rounder and the softer they are, the less they will be understood by the political level.' The allies, he said, must 'take the right steps and the right decisions to protect our countries and our way of life.' The military leaders routinely develop plans and recommendations that are then sent to the civilian NATO defense secretaries for discussion and then on to the nations' leaders in the alliance. The U.S. allows Ukraine to use American-provided weapons in cross-border strikes to counter attacks by Russian forces. But it doesn't allow Kyiv to fire long-range missiles, such as the ATACMS, deep into Russia. The U.S. has argued that Ukraine has drones that can strike far and should use ATACMS judiciously because they only have a limited number. Ukraine has increased its pleas with Washington to lift the restrictions, particularly as winter looms and Kyiv worries about Russian gains during the colder months. 'You want to weaken the enemy that attacks you in order to not only fight the arrows that come your way, but also attack the archer that is, as we see, very often operating from Russia proper into Ukraine,' said Bauer. 'So militarily, there's a good reason to do that, to weaken the enemy, to weaken its logistic lines, fuel, ammunition that comes to the front. That is what you want to stop, if at all possible.' Brown, for his part, told reporters traveling with him to the meeting that the U.S. policy on long-range weapons remains in place. But, he added, 'by the same token, what we want to do is — regardless of that policy — we want to continue to make Ukraine successful with the capabilities that have been provided' by the U.S. and other nations in the coalition, as well as the weapons Kyiv has been able to build itself. 'They've proven themselves fairly effective in building out uncrewed aerial vehicles, in building out drones,' Brown told reporters traveling with him to meetings in Europe. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has made similar points, arguing that one weapons system won't determine success in the war. 'There are a number of things that go into the overall equation as to whether or not you know you want to provide one capability or another,' Austin said Friday. 'There is no silver bullet when it comes to things like this.' He also noted that Ukraine has already been able to strike inside Russia with its own internally produced systems, including drones.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-s-bauer-others-support-ukraine-using-long-range-weapons-against-russia/7784820.html	2024-09-14T17:42:06-07:00	
China's economy softens in August as Beijing grapples with lagging demand	BEIJING — China's economy softened in August, extending a slowdown in industrial activity and real estate prices as Beijing faces pressure to ramp up spending to stimulate demand. Data published by the National Bureau of Statistics Saturday showed weakening activity across industrial production, retail sales and real estate this month compared to July. 'We should be aware that the adverse impacts arising from the changes in the external environment are increasing,' said Liu Aihua, the bureau's chief economist in a news conference. Liu said that demand remained insufficient at home, and the sustained economic recovery still confronts multiple difficulties and challenges. China has been grappling with a lagging economy post-COVID, with weak consumer demand, persistent deflationary pressures and a contraction in factory activity. Chinese leaders have ramped up investment in manufacturing to rev up an economy that stalled during the pandemic and is still growing slower than hoped. Beijing also has to deal with increasing pressure to implement large-scale stimulus measures to boost economic growth. While industrial production rose by 4.5% in August compared to a year ago, it declined from July's 5.1% growth, according to the bureau's data released. Retail sales grew 2.1% from the same time last year, slower than the 2.7% increase last month. Fixed asset investment rose by 3.4% from January to August, down from 3.6% in the first seven months. Meanwhile, investment in real estate declined by 10.2% from January to August, compared to last year. The figures released Saturday come after trade data for August saw imports grow just 0.5% compared to a year ago. The consumer price index rose 0.6% in August, missing forecasts according to data released Monday. Officials attributed the higher CPI to an increase in food prices due to bad weather. But the core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose by just 0.3% in August, the slowest in over three years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-economy-softens-in-august-as-beijing-grapples-with-lagging-demand/7784816.html	2024-09-14T17:12:33-07:00

Nigerian army rescues 13 hostages from extremist group	ABUJA, Nigeria — Nigerian troops have rescued 13 hostages who were kidnapped by an extremist group in the northwestern state of Kaduna, the country's army said on Saturday. The army said in a statement that 'the troops successfully overwhelmed the terrorists, forcing them to abandon their captives.' Several kidnappers were killed, and others were captured, the military added. It didn't specify which armed group the kidnappers belonged to. The rescued hostages were taken to a military facility for a medical assessment before being reunited with their families. Weapons, ammunition, solar panels and cash were also discovered during the rescue operation. Kidnappings have become common in parts of northern Nigeria, where dozens of armed groups take advantage of a limited security presence to carry out attacks in villages and along major roads. Most victims are released only after the payment of ransoms that sometimes run into the thousands of dollars. At least 1,400 students have been taken from Nigerian schools since the 2014 kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram militants in the village of Chibok in Borno state shocked the world. Boko Haram, Nigeria's homegrown jihadi rebels, launched its insurgency in 2009 to establish Islamic Shariah law in the country. At least 35,000 people have been killed and 2.1 million people displaced due to the extremist violence, according to United Nations agencies in Nigeria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerian-army-rescues-13-hostages-from-extremist-group-/7784577.html	2024-09-14T16:41:52-07:00

Ukraine: N. Korea's military aid to Russia presents battlefield problem	kyiv, ukraine — Ukraine's spy chief said Saturday that Russia's increased production of guided bombs as well as artillery ammunition deliveries from North Korea present major problems for Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. The head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency GUR, Kyrylo Budanov, said North Korean military aid to Russia presented the biggest concern compared to support provided by Moscow's other allies. 'They supply huge amounts of artillery ammunition, which is critical for Russia,' he said, pointing to the ramp up in the battlefield hostilities following such deliveries. Ukraine and the United States, among other countries and independent analysts, say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is helping Russia in the war against Ukraine by supplying missiles and ammunition in return for economic and other military assistance from Moscow. Russia's boost in the production of guided bombs also presented a 'huge problem for the front line,' Budanov said at the Yalta European Strategy conference organized by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation in Kyiv. Ukraine's forces are stretched thin more than 30 months into the full-scale invasion, working to stave off Russian advance toward key towns in the country's east. Ukrainian forces have also made an incursion into the western Russian region of Kursk. A ramp up in the production of the Iskander-type missiles has resulted in Russia's 'massive use' of weapons to attack Ukraine, Budanov said. This year's strikes on Ukraine's critical infrastructure have caused significant damage to the country's power grid, leading to power cuts. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has renewed pleas for air defense support from Ukraine's allies. Budanov said Russian internal planning showed that Moscow will face a recruitment crunch in the middle of next year. 'During this period (summer 2025) they will face a dilemma: either to declare mobilization or to somehow reduce the intensity of hostilities, which may ultimately be critical for them,' Budanov said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-n-korean-military-aid-to-russia-present-major-battlefield-problem-/7784566.html	2024-09-14T16:10:17-07:00	
Biden to use rest of term putting Ukraine in 'best position,' says adviser	Kyiv, Ukraine — U.S. President Joe Biden will use the remaining four months of his term 'to put Ukraine in the best possible position to prevail,' a senior adviser said Saturday. Speaking remotely to a forum in Kyiv, Ukraine, Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, also said Biden will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in late September at the U.N. General Assembly in New York to discuss aid to Ukraine. 'President Zelenskyy has said that ultimately this war has to end through negotiations, and we need them to be strong in those negotiations,' Sullivan said, adding Ukraine would decide when to enter talks with Russia. Biden will be replaced next January either by Vice President Kamala Harris, who has indicated she will continue his policies of backing Ukraine, or by former President Donald Trump, who would not say at a debate earlier this week whether he wanted Kyiv to win the war. The announcement of the upcoming Biden-Zelenskyy meeting came after Moscow and Kyiv earlier Saturday swapped 103 prisoners of war each in a UAE-brokered deal, and as Russian forces continue to gain ground in their grinding offensive in east Ukraine. Sullivan, in his comments by video link to the forum in Kyiv, said 'difficult and complicated' logistics — rather than unwillingness — was delaying aid to Ukraine. 'It's not a matter of political will,' Sullivan said. 'But given what Ukraine is up against, we've got to do more, and we've got to do better.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-use-rest-of-term-putting-ukraine-in-best-position-says-adviser-/7784556.html	2024-09-14T15:16:35-07:00	
American, 2 Spaniards suspected of link to plan to destabilize Venezuela	Caracas, Venezuela — An American citizen and two Spaniards have been detained in Venezuela on suspicion of links to an alleged plan to destabilize the country, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said Saturday, adding that hundreds of weapons were seized. The two Spanish nationals were recently detained in Puerto Ayacucho, Cabello told a press conference, adding that an American was also in custody on suspicion of planning to 'generate violence' and 'destabilize' Venezuela. He added that around 400 rifles originating in the United States had also been seized. The arrests come amid heightened tensions between Venezuela and both the U.S. and Spain over the disputed Venezuelan presidential election, which the country's opposition accuses incumbent strongman Nicolas Maduro of stealing. Earlier this week Caracas recalled its ambassador to Madrid for consultations and summoned Spain's envoy to Venezuela for talks after a Spanish minister accused Maduro of running a 'dictatorship.' Venezuela was also angered by the decision of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to meet with Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, who went into exile in Spain after being threatened with arrest by Maduro's regime. Caracas also has been engaged in a war of words with the United States, which recognized Gonzalez Urrutia as the winner of the July 28 poll. Maduro insists he won a third term but has failed to release detailed voting tallies to back his claim. Washington on Thursday announced new sanctions against 16 Venezuelan officials, including some from the electoral authority, for impeding 'a transparent electoral process' and not publishing accurate results. Venezuela denounced the measures as a 'crime of aggression' and Maduro decorated four military officers among those targeted by the sanctions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7784547.html	2024-09-14T14:40:16-07:00	
Fuel truck explodes in Haiti, killing at least 16, seriously wounding 40	PORT-AU-PRINCE, haiti — A fuel truck exploded on a road in Haiti's southern peninsula Saturday, killing at least 16 people and leaving 40 survivors with serious burns, officials said. Haiti Prime Minister Garry Conille said emergency teams were working to 'save the lives of the seriously injured' after the incident, which occurred in the morning near the coastal city of Miragoane in the department of Nippes. 'The government stands in solidarity with all the victims and their families,' Conille said in a social media post. Authorities in Nippes said 16 bodies were completely charred and unrecognizable. A witness to the incident said the truck's gas tank had been punctured by another vehicle, and people rushed to the site to collect fuel. 'There were a lot of people. Those who were close to the truck got pulverized,' said the man, who did not give his name, in a video interview with local outlet Echo Haiti Media. When asked how many people might have been killed in the blast, he said it was difficult to say. 'You can't know, because there were a lot of people, bystanders and those collecting oil. There were a lot of people,' he said. Fuel deliveries to the Miragoane area have slowed in recent weeks as trucks were transported via ferry to avoid gang-controlled highways surrounding the capital of Port-au-Prince. The spread of gangs in the capital and surrounding areas has fueled a humanitarian crisis with mass displacements, sexual violence, child recruitment and widespread hunger. A state of emergency is now in place nationwide. Haiti's civil protection agency reported the identities of a 31-year-old man and two 23-year-old men who suffered burns over 89% of their bodies, and were being treated in a hospital in Les Cayes, in southern Haiti. Two of them sustained second-degree burns, the agency said. A similar incident in 2021 in the city of Cap-Haitien killed at least 60 people, after people were also thought to have been attempting to take fuel from a tanker truck.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fuel-truck-explodes-in-haiti-killing-at-least-16-seriously-wounding-40-/7784544.html	2024-09-14T13:59:34-07:00

Japan, US face ‘shared challenge’ from China steel, PM hopeful says	TOKYO — Japan and the United States should avoid confrontation about the steel industry and work together amid competition from China, the world's top steelmaker, leading prime ministerial candidate Shinjiro Koizumi said Saturday. Sources told Reuters Friday that a powerful U.S. national security panel reviewing Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel faces a September 23 deadline to recommend whether the White House should block the deal. Koizumi, Japan's former environment minister, said at a debate Saturday that Japan and the U.S. should not confront each other when it comes to the steel industry but to face together the 'shared challenge' coming from China's steel industry. 'If China, producing cheap steel without renewable or clean energy, floods the global market, it will most adversely affect us, the democratic countries playing by fair market rules,' Koizumi said. Nippon Steel's key negotiator on the deal, Vice Chairman Takahiro Mori, said last month that his company and other Japanese steelmakers were urging Tokyo to consider curbing cheap steel imports coming from China to protect the local market. On Sunday, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel sent a letter to U.S. President Joe Biden about their deal, as Biden, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have all opposed the merger. 'We are also in the midst of elections, just like the U.S., and during elections, various ideas may arise. Overreacting to each of these would, in my view, call into question diplomatic judgment,' Koizumi said when asked about the deal. Sanae Takaichi, Japan's minister in charge of economic security and another prime ministerial candidate, also defended the deal during the same debate attended by eight other Liberal Democratic Party's, or LDP, leadership contenders Saturday. 'It appears they are using CFIUS to frame this as an economic security issue,' she said, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. 'However, Japan and the U.S. are allies, and the steel industry is about strengthening our combined resilience.' The 43-year-old son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, the junior Koizumi, is seen as a leading contender in the September 27 race to pick the LDP's new leader, who will become the next prime minister due to the party's control of parliament. Koizumi said Saturday that he would seek a dialog with the North Korean leadership to resolve the issue over the abduction of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s. The purported primary goal was to train North Korean agents to impersonate Japanese people. 'We want to explore new opportunities for dialog between people of the same generation, without being bound by conventional approaches, and without preconditions,' Koizumi said. After admitting in 2002 that it had abducted 13 Japanese, North Korea apologized and allowed five to return home. It said eight others had died and denied that an additional four entered its territory. It promised to reinvestigate but has never announced the results. Japan says North Korea has refused to send the others home because of concern that they might reveal inconvenient information about the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-us-face-shared-challenge-from-china-steel-pm-hopeful-says/7784444.html	2024-09-14T10:53:01-07:00	
Thousands attend rally organized by Poland's nationalist opposition party	WARSAW, Poland — Thousands of people attended an antigovernment rally organized by Poland's nationalist conservative opposition party to boost support before next year's presidential election. Law and Justice leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski called on supporters to be active at social and political levels and to back the party’s candidate in next year’s presidential election. He hasn't yet named the candidate. Kaczynski also accused the pro-European Union government of acting against the nation’s interests and violating its laws and cited recently opened investigations into allegations of mismanagement and corruption of the Law and Justice government. Up to 4,000 people with national white-and-red flags gathered for the rally held in windy weather outside the Justice Ministry in Warsaw, which has become a symbol of years of deep rifts between the backers of Kaczynski and Donald Tusk, now the prime minister and leader of the center-right Civic Platform party. Law and Justice, which governed Poland for from 2015 until 2023, drew criticism from Brussels and Tusk alike for making changes to Poland’s judicial system that were deemed undemocratic. Many in the nation of 38 million people were also tired of the aggressive and divisive language that Kaczynski, who dictated the government's policies from the sidelines, used to energize support. The party lost power in the 2023 election, but is still exerting control through President Andrzej Duda, who is allied with Law and Justice. Duda, whose second and last term runs out in August, has been blocking many of the government's draft laws.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-attend-rally-organized-by-poland-s-nationalist-opposition-party/7784439.html	2024-09-14T10:38:42-07:00	
Sudanese city pounded as analysts report 'unprecedented' combat	Port Sudan, Sudan — Heavy fighting on Saturday shook a Sudanese city besieged by paramilitaries, witnesses told AFP, as U.S. researchers reported unprecedented and escalating combat in the North Darfur state capital. El-Fasher is one of five state capitals in Sudan's western Darfur region and the only one not in the hands of the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, who have been battling the regular army since April 2023. The United Nations says the war across much of Sudan has created the world's largest displacement crisis, with millions uprooted, and has led to famine at a displacement camp near El-Fasher. Darfur has seen some of the war's worst atrocities, and the RSF has besieged El-Fasher since May. 'Neighborhoods are completely deserted and all you can hear are explosions and missiles,' Ibrahim Ishaq, 52, told AFP. 'The central market area has become unlivable because of the intensity of the explosions,' said Ishaq, who fled westward from the city on Friday. Witnesses reported army bombardment south and east of the city on Saturday and said they heard air-defense batteries firing. The Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab said in a report Friday that its analysis confirmed 'unprecedented large-scale combat operations' in El-Fasher within the previous 10 days, 'with significant escalation in the past 36 hours' involving the army and the paramilitaries. It cited reports that describe 'a major multidirectional RSF attack from the northern, eastern, and southern directions' on Thursday. Reduced to rubble Darfur Governor Mini Minawi had on Thursday said on social media platform X that the army had repelled 'a large attack' by the RSF. The paramilitaries, however, said they seized military sites in El-Fasher. Using satellite imagery and other data, the Yale researchers said they found munition impacts 'likely related to high-tempo aerial bombardment' from the regular army, but they said other structural damage resulted from 'RSF bombardment' and combat activity by both sides. Whatever the battle's ultimate outcome, current levels of fighting 'are likely to effectively reduce what is left of El-Fasher to rubble,' the Yale study said. The United States special envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, on Saturday said on social media platform X: 'We are extremely concerned about the RSF's renewed attacks.' He urged the RSF 'to stop its assault.' It was not immediately possible to determine the number of victims. Sudan's war has already killed tens of thousands of people, with some estimates as high as 150,000, according to Perriello. Strikes near Khartoum In the capital, Khartoum, on Saturday, about 800 kilometers from El-Fasher, witnesses reported heavy explosions and strikes to the city's south. Independent United Nations experts earlier this month appealed for deployment of an 'impartial force' to be urgently deployed in Sudan for civilian protection. Sudan's foreign ministry, loyal to the army, rejected the idea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudanese-city-pounded-as-analysts-report-unprecedented-combat/7784432.html	2024-09-14T10:27:31-07:00	
Ballerina DePrince, whose career inspired many after she was born into war, dies at 29	FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida — Ballet dancer Michaela Mabinty DePrince, who came to the United States from an orphanage in war-ravaged Sierra Leone and performed on some of the world's biggest stages, has died, her family said in a statement. She was 29. 'Michaela touched so many lives across the world, including ours. She was an unforgettable inspiration to everyone who knew her or heard her story,' her family said in a statement posted Friday on DePrince's social media accounts. 'From her early life in war-torn Africa, to stages and screens across the world, she achieved her dreams and so much more.' A cause of death was not provided. DePrince was adopted by an American couple and by age 17 she had been featured in a documentary film and had performed on the TV show 'Dancing with the Stars.' After graduating from high school and the American Ballet Theatre’s Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School, she became a principal dancer with the Dance Theatre of Harlem. She then went to the Netherlands, where she danced with the Dutch National Ballet. She later returned to the U.S. and joined the Boston Ballet in 2021. 'We’re sending our love and support to the family of Michaela Mabinty DePrince at this time of loss,' the Boston Ballet said in a statement to The Associated Press on Saturday. 'We were so fortunate to know her; she was a beautiful person, a wonderful dancer, and she will be greatly missed by us all.' In her memoir, Taking Flight: From War Orphan to Star Ballerina, she shared her journey from the orphanage to the stage. She also wrote a children's book, Ballerina Dreams. DePrince suffered from a skin pigmentation disorder that had her labeled 'the devil’s child' at the orphanage. 'I lost both my parents, so I was there [the orphanage] for about a year, and I wasn’t treated very well because I had vitiligo,' DePrince told the AP in a 2012 interview. 'We were ranked as numbers, and number 27 was the least favorite and that was my number, so I got the least amount of food, the least amount of clothes and whatnot.' She added that she remembered seeing a photo of an American ballet dancer on a magazine page that had blown against the gate of the orphanage during Sierra Leone's civil war. 'All I remember is she looked really, really happy,' DePrince told the AP, adding that she wished 'to become this exact person.' She said she saw hope in that photo, 'and I ripped the page out and I stuck it in my underwear because I didn’t have any place to put it,' she said. Her passion helped inspire young Black dancers to pursue their dreams, her family said. 'We will miss her and her gorgeous smile forever and we know you will, too,' their statement said. Her sister, Mia Mabinty DePrince, recalled in the statement that they slept on a shared mat in the orphanage and used to make up their own musical theater plays and ballets. 'When we got adopted, our parents quickly poured into our dreams and arose the beautiful, gracefully strong ballerina that so many of you knew her as today. She was an inspiration,' Mia DePrince wrote. 'Whether she was leaping across the stage or getting on a plane and flying to third-world countries to provide orphans and children with dance classes, she was determined to conquer all her dreams in the arts and dance.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ballerina-deprince-whose-career-inspired-many-after-she-was-born-into-war-dies-at-29/7784422.html	2024-09-14T10:15:48-07:00	
Syria's president asks former minister to form new government	BEIRUT — Syrian President Bashar Assad issued a decree Saturday in which he named former Communications Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali as the head of the new government following July’s parliamentary election, state media reported. Jalali, 55, has been under European Union sanctions since October 2014 over the government crackdown during Syria’s conflict that has left nearly half a million people dead since 2011. As a government minister, he was 'collectively responsible for the regime’s violent repression against the civilian population,' the EU said at the time of announcing the sanctions. Jalali was communications minister for nearly two years starting in August 2014, according to the state news agency SANA. Syria’s outgoing government has been in a caretaker capacity since the mid-July parliamentary election. It's not clear how long it will take Jalali to form a new Cabinet. The EU first started imposing sanctions on Syria in 2011. The measures also include a ban on oil imports, investment restrictions, a freeze on central bank assets held in the EU, and export limits on equipment and technology that could be used to crack down on civilians or to monitor their phones and internet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-president-asks-former-minister-to-form-new-government/7784416.html	2024-09-14T10:04:24-07:00	
Iran says it is open to talks but rejects pressure from US, EU	DUBAI — Iran's foreign minister said that Tehran was open to diplomacy to solve disputes but not 'threats and pressure,' state media reported on Saturday, after the U.S. and three European powers imposed sanctions against the country's aviation sector. Abbas Araqchi's comments come a day after the European Union's chief diplomat said the bloc is considering new sanctions targeting Iran's aviation sector, in reaction to reports Tehran supplied Russia with ballistic missiles in its war against Ukraine. 'Iran continues on its own path with strength, although we have always been open to talks to resolve disputes ... but dialogue should be based on mutual respect, not on threats and pressure,' Araqchi said, according to the official news agency IRNA. Araqchi said on Wednesday that Tehran had not delivered any ballistic missiles to Russia and that sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States and three European powers would not solve any problems between them. The United States, Germany, Britain and France on Tuesday imposed new sanctions on Iran, including measures against its national airline, Iran Air.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-it-is-open-to-talks-but-rejects-pressure-from-us-eu/7784405.html	2024-09-14T09:56:36-07:00	
Algerian court certifies Tebboune's landslide reelection win	ALGIERS, Algeria — Algeria's constitutional court on Saturday certified the landslide victory of President Abdelmadjid Tebboune in last weekend's election after retabulating vote counts that he and his two opponents had called into question. The court said that it had reviewed local voting data to settle questions about irregularities that Tebboune’s opponents had alleged in two appeals Monday. 'After verification of the minutes of the regions and correction of the errors noted in the counting of the votes,' it had lowered Tebboune's vote share and determined that his two opponents had won hundreds of thousands more votes than previously reported, said Omar Belhadj, the constitutional court's president. The court's decision makes Tebboune the official winner of the September 7 election. His government will next decide when to inaugurate him for a second term. The court's retabulated figures showed Tebboune leading Islamist challenger Abdellali Hassan Cherif by around 75 percentage points. With 7.7 million votes, the first-term president won 84.3% of the vote, surpassing the 2019 win by millions of votes and a double-digit margin. Cherif, running with the Movement of Society for Peace, won nearly 950,000 votes, or roughly 9.6%. The Socialist Forces Front's Youcef Aouchiche won more than 580,000 votes, or roughly 6.1%. Notably, both challengers surpassed the threshold required to receive reimbursement for campaign expenses. Under its election laws, Algeria pays for political campaigns that receive more than a 5% vote share. The results announced by the election authority last week showed Cherif and Aouchiche with 3.2% and 2.2% of the vote, respectively. Both were criticized for participating in an election that government critics denounced as a way for Algeria's political elite to make a show of democracy amid broader political repression. Throughout the campaign, each of the three campaigns emphasized participation, calling on voters and youth to participate and defy calls to boycott the ballot. The court announced nationwide turnout was 46.1%, surpassing the 2019 presidential election, when 39.9% of the electorate participated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/algerian-court-certifies-tebboune-s-landslide-reelection-win/7784401.html	2024-09-14T09:47:50-07:00	
US historian leads Kyiv charity run highlighting plight of Ukrainian POWs	KYIV, Ukraine — U.S. historian and author Timothy Snyder led a charity run in Kyiv Saturday to raise awareness of the conditions under which Ukrainian prisoners of war are held in Russia as the conflict approaches a third winter. The race came following a recent escalation in Russian missile and drone attacks, largely aimed at Ukraine's electricity infrastructure. People clapped and cheered after Snyder, a 55-year-old Yale University professor who has written extensively on eastern Europe and the global resurgence of authoritarian regimes and is much admired in Ukraine, addressed the nearly thousand runners. He then joined a workout and participated in the run. 'Thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers are illegally held in captivity during an illegal war,' Snyder told The Associated Press just ahead of the run. 'This race is about reminding everyone of that and expressing solidarity with Ukrainians and giving Ukrainians a chance to do something together.' The 5K and 10-kilometer runs took place around a sprawling park in the Ukrainian capital created out of a renovated Soviet-era exhibition center. The runners included members of the public, service people and veterans, as well as wives of the POWs. Among them was 27-year-old Anastasia Ofyl, whose husband Oleksandr was captured by the Russians. 'We have to fight for him,' she said. 'That’s why I’m running.' Ukrainian soldiers often give harrowing accounts of their conditions in Russian captivity when they return home as part of regular prisoner exchanges. In a report issued in July, a United Nations human rights agency said it 'continued to document the widespread use of torture and ill-treatment, including sexual violence, against civilians and Ukrainian prisoners of war held by the Russian Federation.' Snyder, who has organized fundraisers as part of the country’s war-relief effort, enjoys near-celebrity status in Ukraine. On Tuesday, he visited President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who thanked him for his charity work. The Ukrainian head of state also received former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and the American actor Michael Douglas this week. After Saturday’s race, Snyder was surrounded by admirers, many of whom waited in line for autographs and selfies. Some asked the historian to sign translated copies of his widely read books on Ukraine, 'Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin' and 'The Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America.' Saturday’s race was organized by the Kyiv School of Economics’ charity foundation which, according to its website, has been raising funds for charitable assistance for Ukrainians since the start of the Russian invasion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-historian-leads-kyiv-charity-run-highlighting-plight-of-ukrainian-pows-/7784364.html	2024-09-14T09:06:58-07:00	
Salvagers again attempt to tow tanker damaged by Houthi rebels	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A new attempt has begun to try to salvage an oil tanker burning in the Red Sea after attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, a European Union naval mission said Saturday. The EU’s Operation Aspides published images dated Saturday of its vessels escorting three ships heading to the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion. The mission has 'been actively involved in this complex endeavor, by creating a secure environment, which is necessary for the tugboats to conduct the towing operation,' the EU said. A phone number for the mission rang unanswered Saturday. However, satellite images taken Saturday morning by Planet Labs PBC and later analyzed by The Associated Press showed what appeared to be the three salvage vessels close to the Sounion. A warship could be seen nearby. The Sounion came under attack from the Houthis beginning Aug. 21. The vessel had been staffed by a crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, who were taken by a French destroyer to nearby Djibouti. The Houthis later planted explosives aboard the ship and detonated them. That’s led to fears the ship’s 1 million barrels of crude oil could spill into the Red Sea. The Houthis have targeted more than 80 vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors. One of the sunken vessels, the Tutor, went down after the Houthis planted explosives aboard it and after its crew abandoned it due to an earlier attack, the rebel group later acknowledged. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/salvagers-again-attempt-to-tow-tanker-damaged-by-houthi-rebels/7784361.html	2024-09-14T08:56:40-07:00

5 dead in Romania as central Europe braces for severe flooding	BUCHAREST, Romania — Five people in eastern Romania were found dead after torrential rainstorms dumped unprecedented rain, leaving hundreds stranded in flooded areas, emergency authorities said Saturday. Rescue services scrambled to save people in the hard-hit eastern counties of Galati and Vaslui. The bodies of three elderly women and two men were found in the localities of Pechea, Draguseni, Costache Negri and Corod, the Department for Emergency Situations said. Authorities later added that one of the victims had been dead for two days and 'did not die due to the effects of the weather' but from other causes. Emergency authorities released video footage showing teams of rescuers evacuating people using small lifeboats through muddy waters and carrying some elderly people to safety. Some of the most significant flood damage was concentrated in Galati, where 5,000 households were affected. A Black Hawk helicopter was also deployed there to help with the search and rescue. The storms battered 19 localities in eight counties in Romania, with strong winds downing dozens of trees that damaged cars and blocked roads and traffic. Authorities sent text message alerts to residents to warn them of adverse weather as emergency services rushed to remove floodwaters from homes. By 1 p.m. Saturday, more than 250 people had been evacuated with the help of 700 Interior Ministry personnel deployed to affected communities, authorities said. Romania’s environment minister, Mircea Fechet, told The Associated Press that in some of the badly flooded areas, more than 160 liters of rain fell per one square meter, which he said is a rare occurrence. 'What we are trying to do right now is save as many lives as possible,' said the minister, who was on his way to Galati to assess the situation. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis offered his condolences to the victims' families, writing on Facebook: 'We must continue to strengthen our capacity to anticipate extreme weather phenomena. 'Severe floods that have affected a large part of the country have led to loss of lives and significant damage,' Iohannis said. 'We are again dealing with the effects of climate change, which are increasingly present throughout the European continent, with dramatic consequences on people.' Central Europe braces for intense flooding The stormy weather comes as several central European nations anticipate severe flooding to hit the Czech Republic, Poland, Austria, Germany, Slovakia and Hungary over the weekend. In the Czech Republic, river waters reached dangerous levels in dozens of areas across the country Saturday morning, flooding houses and roads in several towns and villages. Heavy rain and high winds left more than 63,000 households without power, the Czech power company CEZ said. A hospital in the country's second-largest city of Brno was forced to evacuate as dozens of citizens moved to safer grounds. Fallen trees and floodwaters caused a dozen railways across the country to also shutter. In neighboring Austria, authorities declared 24 villages in the northeast Lower Austria province disaster zones Saturday afternoon and began evacuating residents from those areas. 'The coming hours will be the hours of truth for flood protection, for our emergency forces and numerous compatriots,' State Governor Johanna Mikl-Leitner said, adding that in one area, 'we expect challenges of historical dimensions.' The torrential downpours have also caused a sharp rise in water levels on the Danube River in Austria's capital, Vienna, where special flood relief channels were built in the 1970s and ’80s and are likely to be tested over the weekend. The River Kamp, a tributary of the Danube, is also swelling due to the unprecedented weather. Heavy rain also hit Moldova on Saturday, where emergency workers pumped floodwater from dozens of peoples’ homes in several localities, authorities said. Meteorologists say a low-pressure system from northern Italy was predicted to dump much rain in most parts of the Czech Republic, including the capital and border regions with Austria and Germany in the south, and Poland in the north. 'We have to be ready for worst-case scenarios,' Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said after the government’s central crisis committee met. 'A tough weekend is ahead of us.' In Poland, dozens of people were evacuated as a precautionary measure Saturday from two villages near the town of Nysa, in the Nysa River basin, after meteorologists warned of unprecedented rainfall, and water levels on some rivers in the area sharply rose, according to Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak. 'The worst is yet to come,' he warned. Polish authorities appealed to residents Friday to stock up on food and to prepare for power outages by charging power banks. The weather change arrived following a hot start to September in the region. Scientists have documented Earth’s hottest summer, breaking a record set just one year ago. A hotter atmosphere, driven by human-caused climate change, can lead to more intense rainfall.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-romania-as-central-europe-braces-for-severe-flooding/7784322.html	2024-09-14T08:03:31-07:00	
Immigration takes center stage in debate, but no major proposals from candidates	When Kamala Harris and Donald Trump faced each other on the debate stage less than two months before Election Day, the two candidates were at odds on issues ranging from the economy to tariffs and Ukraine. But on immigration, their positions were especially different.

Prince Harry turns 40 as the royal scamp moves to middle age	LONDON — Prince Harry was always something different. From the moment he first appeared in public, snuggled in Princess Diana’s arms outside the London hospital where he was born in 1984, Harry was the ginger-haired scamp who stuck his tongue out at photographers. He grew to be a boisterous adolescent who was roundly criticized for wearing a Nazi uniform to a costume party, and then a young man who gave up the trappings of royal life and moved to Southern California with his American wife. Through it all, there was a sense that Harry was rebelling against an accident of birth that made him, in the harsh calculus of the House of Windsor, just 'the spare.' As the second son of the man who is now King Charles III, he was raised as a prince but wouldn’t inherit the throne unless brother William came to harm. Now the angry young man is turning 40, the halfway point in many lives, providing a chance to either dwell on the past or look forward to what might still be achieved. For the past four years, Harry has focused mainly on the past, making millions of dollars by airing his grievances in a wildly successful memoir and a Netflix docu-series. But he faces the likelihood that the royal aura so critical to his image may be fading, said Sally Bedell Smith, author of 'Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of an Improbable Life.' 'He is at a sort of crossroads,’’ Smith told The Associated Press. 'And he appears to be struggling with how he wants to proceed.’’ How did we get here? It wasn’t always this way. Six years ago, Harry and his wife were among the most popular royals, a glamorous young couple who reflected the multicultural face of modern Britain and were expected to help revitalize the monarchy. Their wedding on May 19, 2018, united a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II with the former Meghan Markle, a biracial American actress who had starred for seven years in the U.S. television drama 'Suits.' George Clooney, Serena Williams and Elton John attended their wedding at Windsor Castle, after which the couple were formally known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. But the optimism quickly faded amid allegations that Britain’s tabloid media and even members of the royal household treated Meghan unfairly because of racism. By January 2020, the pressures of life in the gilded cage had become too much, and the couple announced they were giving up royal duties and moving to America, where they hoped to become 'financially independent.' They signed lucrative deals with Netflix and Spotify as they settled into the wealthy enclave of Montecito, near Santa Barbara, California. Since then, Harry has missed few opportunities to bare his soul, most famously in his memoir, aptly titled 'Spare.' In the ghostwritten book, Harry recounted his grief at the death of Princess Diana, a fight with Prince William and his unease with life in the royal shadow of his elder brother. From accounts of cocaine use and losing his virginity to raw family rifts, the book was rife with damning allegations about the royal family. Among the most toxic was Harry’s description of how some family members leaked unflattering information about other royals in exchange for positive coverage of themselves. The prince singled out his father’s second wife, Queen Camilla, accusing her of feeding private conversations to the media as she sought to rehabilitate an image tarnished by her role in the breakup of Charles’ marriage to Diana. The allegations were so venomous that there is little chance of a return to public duty, Smith said. 'He criticized the royal family in such a powerful and damaging way. You can’t un-say those things,' she said. 'And you can’t unsee things like Meghan in that Netflix series doing a mock curtsey. It’s such a demeaning gesture to the queen.’’ Harry, who agreed not to use the honorific HRH, or 'his royal highness,' after he stepped away from front-line royal duties, is now fifth in line to the British throne, behind his brother and William’s three children. While he grew up in a palace and is said to be in line to inherit millions of dollars on his 40th birthday from a trust set up by his great-grandmother, applied developmental psychologist Deborah Heiser thinks that, in many ways, Harry is just like the rest of us. Like anyone turning 40, he is likely to have learned a few lessons and has a good idea of who his real friends are, and that will help him chart the next phase of his life, said Heiser, who writes a blog called 'The Right Side of 40' for Psychology Today. 'He has had a very public display of what a lot of people have gone through,' Heiser said. 'I mean, most people are not princes, but … they have all kinds of issues within their families. He’s not alone. That’s why he’s so relatable.’’ Harry's next chapter Of course, Harry’s story isn’t just about the drama within the House of Windsor. If he wants to write a new chapter, Harry can build on his 10 years of service in the British Army. Before retiring as a captain in 2015, the prince earned his wings as a helicopter pilot, served two tours in Afghanistan and shed the hard-partying reputation of his youth. Harry also won accolades for establishing the Invictus Games in 2014, a Paralympic-style competition to inspire and aid in the rehabilitation of sick and wounded servicemembers and veterans. Harry and Meghan made headlines this year with their two international trips to promote mental health and internet safety. While some in British media criticized them for accepting royal treatment in Nigeria and Colombia, the couple said they visited at the invitation of local officials. Will Charles see the grandkids? The prospects of reconciliation are unclear, although Harry did race home to see his father after Charles' cancer diagnosis. And in what may be seen as a tentative olive branch, the paperback edition of 'Spare' slated for October has no additions — so nothing new to stir the pot. But plainly at this point, Harry is thinking about his family in California. He told the BBC about the importance of his two young children, Archie and Lilibet. 'Being a dad is one of life’s greatest joys and has only made me more driven and more committed to making this world a better place,' the prince said in a statement released by his spokesperson.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prince-harry-turns-40-as-the-royal-scamp-moves-to-middle-age/7784290.html	2024-09-14T07:31:55-07:00	
Russia, Ukraine exchange 206 prisoners in second swap in two days	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russia and Ukraine conducted a major exchange of prisoners Saturday, 206 in all, in their second such swap in two days, following negotiations mediated by the United Arab Emirates, officials said. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that all 103 Ukrainians returned were from the military — 82 soldiers and privates and 21 officers. The Russian Defense Ministry said that the 103 Russian soldiers exchanged had been taken prisoner in the Kursk border region where Ukrainian forces launched a surprise incursion in August. 'Our people are home,' Zelenskyy said on the Telegram messaging app. 'We have successfully brought back another 103 warriors from Russian captivity to Ukraine.' Zelenskyy posted pictures of servicemen wrapped in the national blue and yellow flag, hugging each other, talking on mobile phones and posing for group photographs at an undisclosed location. The exchange was mediated by the UAE, Emirati state news agency WAM said. It was the country's eighth such mediation since the start of 2024, it said. Kyiv and Moscow have frequently exchanged prisoners since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, and Saturday's swap was the third since Ukraine began its incursion into the Kursk region. Ukrainian officials have previously said its troops had captured at least 600 Russian soldiers during the incursion, and that this would help it secure the return of captured Ukrainians. Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine's ombudsman, said most of the freed Ukrainians had been in Russian captivity since the early days of the invasion. He posted a short video on the Telegram messaging app showing the servicemen standing in front of a bus and shouting 'Glory to Ukraine.' Lubinets said that Kyiv had so far secured the return of 3,672 Ukrainians in 57 exchanges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-exchange-206-prisoners-in-second-swap-in-two-days/7784271.html	2024-09-14T07:04:43-07:00	
Israel strikes Gaza as American activist killed by Israeli fire is buried	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli airstrikes hit central and southern Gaza overnight into Saturday, killing at least 14 people as friends and family members of a Turkish-American activist killed by an Israeli soldier honored her in a funeral. The airstrikes in Gaza City hit one home housing 11 people, including three women and four children, and another strike hit a tent in Khan Younis with Palestinians displaced by the Israel-Hamas war, Gaza's Civil Defense said Saturday. They followed airstrikes earlier this week that hit a tent camp on Tuesday and a United Nations school sheltering displaced people on Wednesday. Polio vaccination campaign A campaign to inoculate children in Gaza against polio drew down, and the World Health Organization said about 559,000 people under the age of 10 — seven out of every eight children the campaign aimed to vaccinate — have recovered from their first dose. The second doses are expected to begin later this month as part of an effort in which the WHO said parties had already agreed to. 'As we prepare for the next round in four weeks, we’re hopeful these pauses will hold, because this campaign has clearly shown the world what’s possible when peace is given a chance,' Richard Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative in Gaza and the West Bank, said in a statement on Saturday. Turkish-American activist buried In Turkey, activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, the 26-year-old from Seattle who held U.S. and Turkish citizenships, was laid to rest in her hometown of Didim on the Aegean Sea. The Israeli military has said that Eygi was likely shot 'indirectly and unintentionally' by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank on September 6. Turkey announced it will conduct its own investigation into her death. An Israeli protester who witnessed the shooting said she was killed after a demonstration against Israeli settlements. 'We are not going to leave our daughter’s blood on the ground, and we demand responsibility and accountability for this murder,' Numan Kurtulus, the speaker of Turkey's parliament, told mourners. Eygi's body had been earlier brought from a hospital to her family home and Didim's Central Mosque. Thousands of people bid her farewell in the town's streets, which were lined with Turkish flags. Her death was condemned by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken as the United States, Egypt and Qatar push for a cease-fire and the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. Talks have repeatedly bogged down as Israel and Hamas accuse each other of making new and unacceptable demands. The war began when Hamas-led fighters killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in an October 7 terror attack on southern Israel. They abducted 250 people and are still holding about 100 hostages after releasing most of the rest in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire in November. About a third of the remaining hostages are believed to be dead. The United States, the U.K. and other Western countries designate Hamas as a terror group. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced roughly 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, often multiple times, and plunged the territory into a severe humanitarian crisis. Gaza’s Health Ministry says upwards of 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count, but says women and children make up just over half of the dead. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 militants in the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-strikes-gaza-as-american-activist-killed-by-israeli-fire-is-buried/7784260.html	2024-09-14T06:44:29-07:00	
Comoros president 'out of danger' after knife attack, minister says	MORONI, COMOROS — Comoros President Azali Assoumani is 'out of danger' after he was injured on Friday in a knife attack by a 24-year-old police officer who was found dead in his cell a day later, officials said Saturday. The attack occurred around 2 p.m. Friday in Salimani Itsandra, a town just north of the capital, Moroni. 'The president is doing well. He has no health problems; he is out of danger. A few stitches were given,' Energy Minister Aboubacar Said Anli said at a press conference in Moroni on Saturday. Azali was attacked as he attended a funeral, according to the presidency. The motive for the attack has not yet been determined. The attacker, Ahmed Abdou, went on leave Wednesday before orchestrating the attack on Friday. Abdou was placed in a cell after he was taken into custody. However, 'this Saturday morning, when investigators went to see him, they found him lying on the ground, his body was lifeless,' Ali Mohamed Djounaid, Comoros' public prosecutor, said at a separate press conference. He added that an investigation was being conducted to determine the motive of the attack and the cause of his death. In May, Assoumani was sworn in for a fourth term in office following a tense January election, which his opponents claim was tainted by voter fraud. Officials deny the allegations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/comoros-president-out-of-danger-after-knife-attack-minister-says/7784241.html	2024-09-14T06:19:34-07:00	
Tropical storm brings heavy rains over southern Gulf of California	MEXICO CITY — Mexico issued a tropical storm warning Saturday along the coast, from Altata to Huatabampito, and has discontinued all watches and warnings for Baja California Sur after rain from Storm Ileana pounded the resort-studded Los Cabos a day before. Ileana moved northward over the southern Gulf of California at 11 kph, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm was about 110 kilometers east of La Paz, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 65 kph, the center said. Tropical storm warnings have been issued for the coasts of northern Sinaloa and extreme southern Sonola. On Friday, a warning was in effect for portions of the Baja California Peninsula, including Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo. Juan Manuel Arce Ortega of Los Cabos Civil Protection said the municipalities of La Paz and Los Cabos were on red alert at the time and urged residents to avoid crossing rivers, streams and low areas where they can be swept away by water. All schools in Los Cabos were suspended Friday due to the storm. Oscar Cruces Rodriguez of Mexico’s federal Civil Protection said in a statement that residents should avoid leaving their homes until the storm passes and if residents are in an area at risk of flooding, to find temporary shelters. Authorities prepared 20 temporary shelters in San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas, according to Los Cabos Civil Protection. At the Hacienda Beach Club and Residences in Cabo San Lucas, valet worker Alan Galvan said the rain arrived late Thursday and has been constant. 'The rain isn’t very strong right now, but the waves are choppy,' he said. 'The guests are very calm and already came down for coffee,' Galvan said. 'There’s some flights canceled, but everything is OK at the moment.' Galvan said they are awaiting further advisories from authorities. The rain remained consistent through Los Cabos Friday afternoon, with several roads flooded and some resorts stacking up sandbags on their perimeters. Some people were still walking around boat docks with their umbrellas. 'The priority has to be safety, starting with the workers. We always have to check on our colleagues who live in risk areas,' said Lyzzette Liceaga, a tour operator at Los Cabos. 'We give them the information shared by the authorities — firefighters in risk areas — so that they can go to the shelters, if necessary.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-brings-heavy-rains-over-southern-gulf-of-california/7784228.html	2024-09-14T06:00:51-07:00	
Mourners pay respects to Ugandan athlete who died after partner set her on fire	BUKWO, Uganda — Dozens of mourners in Uganda paid respects to Rebecca Cheptegei, the Olympic athlete who died last week in Kenya after her partner set her on fire. Local leaders and others gathered at the local administration hall Saturday as they awaited her burial at her ancestral home in a village near the Kenya border. Cheptegei died after her body suffered 80% burns in the attack by Dickson Ndiema, who doused her in gasoline at her home in western Kenya’s Trans-Nzoia County on September 3. Ndiema sustained 30% burns on his body and later died. According to a report filed by the local chief, they quarreled over a piece of land the athlete bought in Kenya. The horrific gasoline attack shocked many and strengthened calls for the protection of female runners facing exploitation and abuse in the East African country. Cheptegei’s body was returned to Uganda Friday in a somber procession following a street march by dozens of activists in the western Kenyan town of Eldoret who demanded an end to physical violence against female athletes. Cheptegei, who was 33, is the fourth female athlete to have been killed by her partner in Kenya in a pattern of gender-based violence in recent years. Kenya’s high rate of violence against women has prompted several marches this year. Ugandan officials have condemned the attack, demanding justice for Cheptegei. Janet Museveni, who serves as Uganda’s education and sports minister, described the attack as 'deeply disturbing.' Don Rukare, chair of the National Council of Sports of Uganda, said in a statement on X that the attack was 'a cowardly and senseless act that has led to the loss of a great athlete.' Four in 10 dating or married Kenyan women have experienced physical or sexual violence perpetrated by their current or most recent partner, according to the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey. Many Ugandan athletes train across the border in Kenya, an athletics powerhouse with better facilities. Some of the region’s best runners train together at a high-altitude center in Kenya’s west. Cheptegei competed in the women’s marathon at the Paris Olympics, finishing in 44th place, less than a month before the attack. She had represented Uganda at other competitions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mourners-pay-respects-to-ugandan-athlete-who-died-after-partner-set-her-on-fire/7784220.html	2024-09-14T05:48:10-07:00	
Bomb blast in southwest Pakistan kills two police officers	ISLAMABAD — A bomb explosion in Pakistan’s violence-hit southwestern Baluchistan province ripped through a police vehicle Saturday, killing at least two officers and wounding as many others. Abdul Hameed, an area police officer, told VOA by phone that the attack occurred on a main highway passing through Kuchlak near the provincial capital of Quetta. He said that a homemade bomb targeted a police mobile unit and that an investigation into the incident was underway. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the deadly bombing in the natural resources-rich Pakistani province, where separatist ethnic Baluch groups routinely target security forces. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned Saturday’s attack on the police as a terrorist act, his office said in a statement in Islamabad. A daylong series of insurgent attacks rattled Baluchistan last month, killing more than 50 civilians and security personnel. The outlawed Baluch Liberation Army, the largest of all the separatist groups active in the province, claimed responsibility for orchestrating the violence, which targeted security installations and passenger vehicles. The BLA, designated as a global terrorist group by the United States, has lately intensified its attacks in Baluchistan. The province shares Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan and Iran and hosts major China-funded infrastructure projects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bomb-blast-in-southwest-pakistan-kills-two-police-officers/7784207.html	2024-09-14T05:02:21-07:00	
Iran says it successfully launched a satellite	TEHRAN, Iran — Iran launched a satellite into space Saturday with a rocket built by the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, state-run media reported, the latest for a program the West fears helps Tehran advance its ballistic missile program. Iran described the launch as a success, which would be the second such launch to put a satellite into orbit with the rocket. There was no immediate independent confirmation of the launch's success, nor did Iranian authorities immediately provide footage or other details. The launch comes amid heightened tensions gripping the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, during which Tehran launched an unprecedented direct missile-and-drone attack on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium to nearly weapons-grade levels, raising concerns among nonproliferation experts about Tehran's program. Iran identified the satellite-carrying rocket as the Qaem-100, which the Guard used in January for another successful launch. Qaem means 'upright' in Iran's Farsi language. The solid-fuel rocket put the Chamran-1 satellite, weighing 60 kilograms, into a 550-kilometer orbit, state media reported. The U.S. State Department and the American military did not immediately respond to requests for comment over the Iranian launch. The United States had previously said Iran's satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran's ballistic missile program expired last October. Under Iran's relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. Hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a protege of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, has pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May. It's unclear what Iran's new president, the reformist Masoud Pezeshkian, wants for the program as he was silent on the issue while campaigning. The U.S. intelligence community's worldwide threat assessment this year said Iran's development of satellite launch vehicles 'would shorten the timeline' for Iran to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile because it uses similar technology. Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for 'several' nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly has warned. Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003. The launch also came ahead of the second anniversary of the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, which sparked nationwide protests against Iran's mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law and the country's Shiite theocracy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-it-successfully-launched-a-satellite-/7784161.html	2024-09-14T02:04:03-07:00	
Women in Iran are going without hijabs as the 2nd anniversary of Amini's death nears	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — On the streets of Iranian cities, it's becoming more common to see a woman passing by without a mandatory headscarf, or hijab, as the second anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini and the mass protests it sparked approaches. There's no government official or study acknowledging the phenomenon, which began as Iran entered its hot summer months and power cuts in its overburdened electrical system became common. But across social media, videos of people filming neighborhood streets or just talking about a normal day in their life, women and girls can be seen walking past with their long hair out over their shoulders, particularly after sunset. This defiance comes despite what United Nations investigators describe as 'expanded repressive measures and policies' by Iran's theocracy to punish them — though there's been no recent catalyzing event like Amini's death to galvanize demonstrators. The country's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian campaigned on a promise to halt the harassment of women by morality police. But the country's ultimate authority remains the 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in the past said 'unveiling is both religiously forbidden and politically forbidden.' For some observant Muslim women, the head covering is a sign of piety before God and modesty in front of men outside their families. In Iran, the hijab — and the all-encompassing black chador worn by some — has long been a political symbol as well. 'Meaningful institutional changes and accountability for gross human rights violations and crimes under international law, and crimes against humanity, remains elusive for victims and survivors, especially for women and children,' warned a U.N. fact-finding mission on Iran on Friday. Amini, 22, died on September 16, 2022, in a hospital after her arrest by the country's morality police over not wearing her hijab to the liking of the authorities. The protests that followed Amini's death started first with the chant 'Women, Life, Freedom.' However, the protesters' cries soon grew into open calls of revolt against Khamenei. A monthslong security crackdown that followed killed more than 500 people and saw over 22,000 detained. Today, passersby on the streets of Tehran, whether its tony northern suburbs for the wealthy or the working-class neighborhoods of the capital's southern reaches, now routinely see women without the hijab. It particularly starts at dusk, though even during the daylight on weekends women can be seen with their hair uncovered at major parks. Online videos — specifically a sub-genre showing walking tours of city streets for those in rural areas or abroad who want to see life in the bustling neighborhoods of Tehran — include women without the hijab. Something that would have stopped a person in their tracks in the decades following the 1979 Islamic Revolution now goes unacknowledged. 'My quasi-courage for not wearing scarves is a legacy of Mahsa Amini and we have to protect this as an achievement,' said a 25-year-old student at Tehran Sharif University, who gave only her first name Azadeh out of fear of reprisal. 'She could be at my current age if she did not pass away.' The disobedience still comes with risk. Months after the protests halted, Iranian morality police returned to the streets. There have been scattered videos of women and young girls being roughed up by officers in the time since. In 2023, a teenage Iranian girl was injured in a mysterious incident on Tehran's Metro while not wearing a headscarf and later died in hospital. In July, activists say police opened fire on a woman fleeing a checkpoint in an attempt to avoid her car being impounded for her not wearing the hijab. Meanwhile, the government has targeted private businesses where women are seen without their headscarves. Surveillance cameras search for women uncovered in vehicles to fine and impound their cars. The government has gone as far as use aerial drones to monitor the 2024 Tehran International Book Fair and Kish Island for uncovered women, the U.N. said. Yet some feel the election of Pezeshkian in July, after a helicopter crash killed Iranian hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in May, is helping ease tensions over the hijab. 'I think the current peaceful environment is part of the status after Pezeshkian took office,' said Hamid Zarrinjouei, a 38-year-old bookseller. 'In some way, Pezeshkian could convince powerful people that more restrictions do not necessarily make women more faithful to the hijab.' On Wednesday, Iran's Prosecutor General Mohammad Movahedi Azad warned security forces about starting physical altercations over the hijab. 'We prosecuted violators, and we will,' Movahedi Azad said, according to Iranian media. 'Nobody has right to have improper attitude even though an individual commits an offense.' While the government isn't directly addressing the increase in women not wearing hijabs, there are other signs of a recognition the political landscape has shifted. In August, authorities dismissed a university teacher a day after he appeared on state television and dismissively referred to Amini as having 'croaked.' Meanwhile, the pre-reform newspaper Ham Mihan reported in August on an unpublished survey conducted under the supervision of Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance that found the hijab had become one of the most important issues in the country — something it hadn't seen previously. 'This issue has been on people's minds more than ever before,' sociologist Simin Kazemi told the newspaper.	https://www.voanews.com/a/women-in-iran-are-going-without-hijabs-as-the-2nd-anniversary-of-amini-s-death-nears/7784156.html	2024-09-14T00:56:38-07:00	
On the streets of a Colorado city, pregnant migrants struggle to survive	AURORA, Colorado — She was eight months pregnant when she was forced to leave her Denver homeless shelter. It was November. Ivanni Herrera took her 4-year-old son, Dylan, by the hand and led him into the chilly night, dragging a suitcase containing donated clothes and blankets away from the Microtel Inn & Suites. It was one of 10 hotels where Denver has housed more than 30,000 migrants, many of them Venezuelan, over the last two years. First, they walked to Walmart. There, with money she and her husband earned begging on the street, they bought a tent. They chose for their new home a grassy median along a busy thoroughfare in Aurora, the next town over, a suburb known for its immigrant population. 'We wanted to go somewhere where there were people,' Herrera, 28, said in Spanish. 'It feels safer.' That night, temperatures dipped to 32 degrees. And as she wrapped her body around her son's, Ivanni Herrera cried. Over the past two years, a record number of Venezuelans have come to the United States seeking a better life. Instead, they’ve found themselves in communities roiling over how much to help the newcomers — or whether to help at all. Unable to legally work without filing expensive and complicated paperwork, some have found themselves sleeping on the streets — even those who are pregnant. Herrera had found inspiration for her journey to the U.S. on social media. On Facebook and TikTok, young, smiling Venezuelan migrants in nice clothes stood in front of new cars. Some 320,000 Venezuelans have tried to cross the U.S. border since October 2022, according to U.S. Border Patrol reports — more than in the previous nine years combined. Just weeks after arriving in Denver, Herrera began to wonder if the success she had seen was real. She was seeing doctors and social workers at a Denver hospital where she planned to give birth because they served everyone, even those without insurance. They were alarmed their pregnant patient was now sleeping outside in the cold. In Colorado's third-largest city, Aurora, officials have turned down requests to help migrants. In February, the City Council passed a resolution telling other cities and nonprofits not to bring migrants into the community because it 'does not currently have the financial capacity to fund new services.' Yet still they come, because of its lower cost of living and Spanish-speaking community. Former President Donald Trump last week called attention to the city, suggesting a Venezuelan gang had taken over an apartment complex. Authorities say that hasn’t happened. The doctors urged Herrera to sleep at the hospital. It wouldn’t cost anything, they assured her, just as her birth would be covered by emergency Medicaid. Herrera refused. 'How,' she asked, 'could I sleep in a warm place when my son is cold on the street?' Denver struggled to keep up with the rush of migrants, many arriving on buses chartered by Texas to draw attention to the impact of immigration. All told, Denver officials say they have helped some 42,700 migrants since last year, either by giving them shelter or a bus fare to another city. Initially, the city offered migrants with families six weeks in a hotel. But any migrants arriving since May have received only three days in a hotel. After that, some have found transportation to other cities, scrounged for a place to sleep or wandered into nearby towns like Aurora. Today, fewer migrants are coming to the Denver area. But Candice Marley, founder of a nonprofit called All Souls, still receives dozens of outreaches per week from social service agencies looking to help homeless migrants. All Souls had run encampments for migrants, but Denver shut them down because they lacked a permit. 'It’s so frustrating that we can’t help them,' Marley said. 'That leaves families camping on their own, unsupported, living in their cars. Kids can’t get into school. There’s no stability.' When Herrera started feeling labor pains in early December, she waited until she couldn’t bear the pain anymore and could feel the baby getting close. She called an ambulance. The paramedics didn’t speak Spanish but called an interpreter. They told Herrera they had to take her to the closest hospital, instead of the one in Denver, since her contractions were so close together. Her son was born healthy at 7 pounds, 8 ounces. She took him to the tent the next day. A few days later the whole family, including the baby, had contracted chicken pox. 'The baby was in a bad state,' said Emily Rodriguez, a close friend living with her family in a tent next to Herrera’s. Herrera took him to the hospital, then returned to the tent before being offered a way out. An Aurora woman originally from Mexico invited the family to live with her — at first, for free. After a couple weeks, the family moved to a small room in the garage for $800 a month. To earn rent and pay expenses, Herrera and Rodriguez have cleaned homes, painted houses and shoveled snow while their children waited in a car by themselves. Finding regular work and actually getting paid for it has been difficult. While their husbands can get semi-regular work in construction, the women’s most consistent income comes from standing outside with their children and begging. On a good day, each earns about $50. Herrera and her husband recently became eligible to apply for work permits and legal residency for Venezuelans who arrived in the United States last year. But it will cost $800 each for a lawyer to file the paperwork, along with hundreds of dollars in government fees. They don't have the money. What's worse, they're deeply in debt. Despite what the hospital had said when she was pregnant, Herrera was never signed up for emergency Medicaid. She says she owes $18,000 for the ambulance ride and delivery of her baby. Now, she avoids going to the doctor or taking her children because she’s afraid her large debt will jeopardize her chances of staying in the U.S. 'I’m afraid they’re going to deport me,' she says. Herrera and Rodriguez now hold cardboard signs along a busy street in Denver and then knock on the doors of private homes, never returning to the same address. They type up their request for clothes, food or money on their phones and translate it to English using Google. They hand their phones to whoever answers the door. Herrera recently sent $500 to her sister to make the monthslong trip from Venezuela to Aurora with Herrera’s 8-year-old daughter. 'I’ll have my family back together,' she says. And she believes her sister will be able to watch her kids so Herrera can look for work. The problem is, Herrera hasn’t told her family back in Venezuela how she spends her time. 'They think I’m fixing up homes and selling chocolate and flowers,' she says. 'I’m living a lie.' Finally, her sister and daughter are waiting across the border in Mexico. When we come to America, her sister asks, could we fly to Denver? The tickets are $600. Herrera has to come clean. Life is far more difficult than she has let on. She texts back: No.	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-the-streets-of-a-colorado-city-pregnant-migrants-struggle-to-survive/7780514.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
Ohio city reshaped by Haitian immigrants lands in unwelcome spotlight	SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — Many cities have been reshaped by immigrants in the last few years without attracting much notice. Not Springfield, Ohio. Its story of economic renewal and related growing pains has been thrust into the national conversation in a presidential election year — and maliciously distorted by false rumors that Haitian immigrants are eating their neighbors' pets. Donald Trump amplified those lies during Tuesday's nationally televised debate, exacerbating some residents' fears about growing divisiveness in the predominantly white, blue-collar city of about 60,000. At the city's Haitian Community Help and Support Center on Wednesday, Rose-Thamar Joseph said many of the roughly 15,000 immigrants who arrived in the past few years were drawn by good jobs and the city's relative affordability. But a rising sense of unease has crept in as longtime residents increasingly bristle at newcomers taking jobs at factories, driving up housing costs, worsening traffic and straining city services. 'Some of them are talking about living in fear. Some of them are scared for their life,' Joseph said. A 'Welcome To Our City' sign hangs from a parking garage downtown, where a coffee shop, bakery and boutique line Springfield's main drag, North Fountain Street. A flag advertising 'CultureFest,' the city's annual celebration of unity through diversity, waves from a pole nearby. Melanie Flax Wilt, a Republican commissioner in the county where Springfield is located, said she has been pushing for community and political leaders to 'stop feeding the fear.' 'After the election and everybody's done using Springfield, Ohio, as a talking point for immigration reform, we are going to be the ones here still living through the challenges and coming up with the solutions,' she said. Ariel Dominique, executive director of the Haitian American Foundation for Democracy, said she laughed at first at the absurdity of the false claims. But seeing the comments repeated on national television by the former president was painful. 'It is so unfair and unjust and completely contrary to what we have contributed to the world, what we have contributed to this nation for so long,' Dominique said. The falsehoods about Springfield's Haitian immigrants were spread online by Trump's running mate, JD Vance, on the eve of Tuesday's debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. It's part of a timeworn American political tradition of casting immigrants as outsiders. 'This is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame,' Trump said at the debate after repeating the falsehoods. When challenged by ABC News moderator David Muir over the false claims, Trump held firm, saying 'people on television' said their dogs were eaten, but he offered no evidence. Officials in Springfield have tried to tamp down the misinformation by saying there have been no credible or detailed reports of any pets being abducted or eaten. State leaders are trying to help address some of the real challenges facing the city. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said Tuesday he would add more law enforcement and health care resources to an aid package the state has already provided to Springfield. Many Haitians have come to the U.S. to flee poverty and violence. They have embraced President Joe Biden's new and expanded legal pathways to enter, and have shunned illegal crossings, accounting for only 92 border arrests out of more than 56,000 in July, the latest data available. The Biden administration recently announced an estimated 300,000 Haitians in the U.S. could remain in the country at least through February 2026, with eligibility for work authorization, under a law called Temporary Protected Status. The goal is to spare people from being deported to countries in turmoil. Springfield, about 72 kilometers from the state capital of Columbus, suffered a steep decline in its manufacturing sector toward the end of the last century, and its population shrank as a result. But its downtown has been revitalized in recent years as more Haitians arrived and helped meet the rising demand for labor as the economy emerged from the pandemic. Officials say Haitians now account for about 15% of the population. The city was shaken last year when a minivan slammed into a school bus, killing an 11-year-old boy. The driver was a Haitian man who recently settled in the area and was driving without a valid license. During a city commission meeting on Tuesday, the boy's parents condemned politicians' use of their son's death to stoke hatred. Last week, a post on the social media platform X shared what looked like a screengrab of a social media post apparently out of Springfield. The post claimed without evidence that the person's 'neighbor's daughter's friend' saw a cat hanging from a tree to be butchered and eaten, outside a house where it claimed Haitians lived. It was accompanied by a photo of a Black man carrying what appeared to be a goose by its feet. On Monday, Vance posted on X: 'Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country.' The next day, he posted again, saying his office had received inquiries from Springfield residents who said 'their neighbors' pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants.' Longtime Springfield resident Chris Hazel, who knows the park and neighborhood where the pet and goose abductions were purported to have happened, called the claims 'preposterous.' 'It reminds me of when people used to accuse others and outsiders as cannibals. It's dehumanizing a community,' he said of the accusations against the city's Haitian residents. Sophia Pierrilus, the daughter of a former Haitian diplomat who moved to the Ohio capital of Columbus 15 years ago and is now an immigrant advocate, agreed, calling it all political. 'My view is that's their way to use Haitians as a scapegoat to bring some kind of chaos in America,' she said. With its rising population of immigrants, Springfield is hardly an outlier. So far this decade, immigration has accounted for almost three-quarters of U.S. population growth, with 2.5 million immigrants arriving in the United States between 2020 and 2023, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Population growth is an important driver of economic growth. 'The Haitian immigrants who started moving to Springfield the last few years are the reason why the economy and the labor force has been revitalized there,' said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, which provides legal and social services to immigrants across the U.S. Now, she said, Haitians in Springfield have told her that, out of fear, they are considering leaving the city.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ohio-city-reshaped-by-haitian-immigrants-lands-in-unwelcome-spotlight/7781154.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00

Share of foreign-born people in US is at highest rate in over a century, survey says	miami — The percentage of U.S. residents who were foreign-born last year grew to its highest level in more than a century, according to figures released Thursday from the most comprehensive survey of American life. The share of people born outside the United States increased in 2023 to 14.3% from 13.9% in 2022, according to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's annual American Community Survey, which tracks commuting times, internet access, family life, income, education levels, disabilities, military service and employment, among other topics. International migrants have become a primary driver of population growth this decade, increasing their share of the overall population as fewer children are being born in the U.S. compared with numbers from years past. The rate of the foreign-born population in the United States hasn't been this high since 1910, when it was 14.7%, driven by waves of people emigrating in search of a better life. 'We knew that here you can have savings, live well. Here you can have normal services such as water and electricity,' said Luciana Bracho, who moved legally to Miami from Venezuela as part of a humanitarian parole program with her boyfriend, parents and brother in April 2023. 'I like Miami and the opportunities that I have had.' In 2023, international migrants accounted for more than two-thirds of the population growth in the United States, and so far this decade they have made up almost three-quarters of U.S. growth. The growth appears to have been driven by people coming from Latin America, whose share of the foreign-born population increased year-over-year to 51.2% from 50.3%, according to the estimates. Latin America was the only world region of origin to experience an increase among those U.S. residents born in another country, as the share of foreign-born residents from Europe and Asia dropped slightly. Nicole Díaz, a Venezuelan opposition activist, left after receiving threats to her life and lived in Peru and Ecuador before moving to the Miami area legally in February 2023 with her husband and 9-year-old daughter. Díaz described herself as '100% happy' living in South Florida, where they pay $2,300 a month for a two-bedroom apartment. 'After being in different countries, working here is relaxed, despite the language,' Díaz said. 'But housing is very expensive, and we have been evaluating moving to another state because here all the salary goes for the rent.' Among the states with the largest year-over-year bumps in the foreign-born population was Delaware, going to 11.2% from 9.9%; Georgia, to 11.6% from 10.7%; and New Mexico, to 10.2% from 9.3% The share of the foreign-born population dropped slightly in Washington, D.C., Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and Oregon. The Census Bureau figures don't distinguish whether people are in the United States legally or illegally. Illegal immigration has become a top issue in the 2024 presidential race, even as illegal border crossings from Mexico plunged this summer after reaching a record last December. The share of U.S. residents who identify as Hispanic, no matter what race, rose last year to 19.4% from 19.1% in the previous year, according to the survey. At the same time, those who identify as non-Hispanic white alone dropped from 57.7% to 57.1%. The share of U.S. residents who identify as Black alone dropped slightly, from 12.2% to 12.1%, and it increased slightly for those who identify as Asian alone from 5.9% to 6%. Residents in the United States continued to get older, with the median age increasing from 39 in 2022 to 39.2 in 2023. The nation's aging is taking place as a majority of baby boomers have become senior citizens and millennials are entering middle age. While the share of children under age 18 remained steady at 21.7% year-over-year, the share of senior citizens age 65 and over increased to 17.7% from 17.3%. Meanwhile, a post-pandemic bump in working from home continued its slide back to pre-COVID-19 times, as the share of employees working from home dropped last year to 13.8% from 15.2% in the previous year. In 2021, the first full year after the pandemic's start, almost 18% of employees were working from home, up from 5.7% in 2019. But return-to-office mandates in the past two years have reversed that trend and caused commute times to bump up slightly last year, growing on average to 26.8 minutes from 26.4 minutes. The survey also showed that the median cost of renting, plus utilities and related expenses, grew faster than median home values in 2023 for the first time in a decade. The 3.8% jump in rental costs was the largest annual increase since at least 2011. Despite the spike in rental costs, the share of renter income spent on rent and utilities remained unchanged at 31% in 2023, suggesting that incomes kept pace with rent hikes, the Census Bureau said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/share-of-foreign-born-people-in-us-is-at-highest-rate-in-over-a-century-survey-says-/7782615.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
New York City lawmakers approve bill to study slavery and reparations	NEW YORK — New York City lawmakers approved legislation Thursday to study the city's significant role in slavery and consider reparations to descendants of enslaved people. If signed into law, the package of bills passed by the City Council would follow in the footsteps of several other municipalities across the U.S. that have sought ways to address the country's dark history, as well as a separate New York state commission that began working this year. New York fully abolished slavery in 1827. But businesses, including the predecessors of some modern banks, continued to benefit financially from the slave trade — likely up until 1866. The lawmakers behind the proposals noted that the harms caused by the institution are still felt by Black Americans today. 'The reparations movement is often misunderstood as merely a call for compensation,' Council Member Farah Louis, a Democrat who sponsored one of the bills, told the City Council on Thursday. She explained that systemic forms of oppression are still impacting people through redlining, environmental racism and services in predominantly Black neighborhoods that are underfunded. The bills still need to be signed by Democratic Mayor Eric Adams. City Hall signaled his support in a statement calling the legislation 'another crucial step towards addressing systemic inequities, fostering reconciliation, and creating a more just and equitable future for all New Yorkers.' The bills would direct the city's Commission on Racial Equity to suggest remedies to the legacy of slavery, including reparations. It would also create a truth and reconciliation process to establish historical facts about slavery in the state. One of the proposals would also require that the city install an informational sign on Wall Street in Manhattan to mark the site of New York's first slave market, which operated between 1711 and 1762. A sign was placed nearby in 2015, but Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation, said its location is inaccurate. The commission would work with the existing state commission, which is also considering the possibility of reparations. A report from the state panel, which held its first public meeting in late July, is expected in early 2025. The city effort wouldn't need to produce recommendations until 2027. The city's commission was created out of a 2021 racial justice initiative during then-Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration, which also recommended the city track data on the cost of living and add a commitment to remedy 'past and continuing harms' to the city charter's preamble. 'Your call and your ancestors' call for reparations had not gone unheard,' Linda Tigani, executive director of the racial equity commission, said at a news conference ahead of the council vote. A financial impact analysis of the bills estimated that the studies would cost $2.5 million. New York is the latest city to study reparations. Tulsa, Oklahoma, where a notorious massacre of Black residents took place in 1921, announced a similar commission last month. Evanston, Illinois, became the first city to offer reparations to Black residents and their descendants in 2021, including distributing some payments of $25,000 in 2023, according to PBS. The eligibility was based on harm suffered as a result of the city's discriminatory housing policies or practices. San Francisco approved reparations in February, but the mayor later cut the funds, saying that reparations should instead be carried out by the federal government. California budgeted $12 million for a reparations program that included helping Black residents research their ancestry, but it was defeated in the state's Legislature this month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-city-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-study-slavery-and-reparations/7784062.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
Animal rights groups object to Buckingham Palace guards' bearskin caps	london — An animal rights group trying to get real fur out of the bearskin caps worn by King's Guards at Buckingham Palace took aim Thursday at the cost of the ceremonial garb. The price of the caps soared 30% in a year to more than 2,000 pounds ($2,600) apiece for the hats made of black bear fur, the Ministry of Defense said in response to a freedom of information request by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. 'Stop wasting taxpayer pounds on caps made from slaughtered wildlife and switch to faux fur today,' the group said in a statement. A luxury fake fur maker has offered to supply the army with free faux bear fur for 10 years, PETA said. Military willing to consider alternatives The military said it was open to exploring alternatives if they pass muster in durability, water protection and appearance. But 'no alternative has met all those criteria to date,' a ministry spokesperson said in a statement. The distinctive tall black hats, worn by guards in bright scarlet tunics, are seen by millions who watch the regular changing of the guard ceremony at the palace. They also appear at other royal events including the annual Trooping the Color ceremony honoring the monarch's birthday in June. The cost of the caps rose from 1,560 pounds ($2,035) each in 2022 to 2,040 pounds ($2,660) in 2023, the ministry said. More than 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) was spent on them in the past decade. The price went up because of a contract change for fur that comes from bears killed in licensed hunts in Canada, the military said. PETA, which has been pushing for more than two decades to scrap the fur hats, said each cap requires one bear pelt. The group claimed that the defense department is propping up the 'cruel' Canadian bear-hunting industry. The ministry denied that charge and said if it stopped buying the pelts, it would not reduce the numbers of bears being killed. Petition calls for fake fur Parliament debated the issue in July 2022 after an online petition with more than 100,000 signatures called for using fake fur in the caps. 'This hunting involves the violent killing of bears, with many bears being shot several times,' Martyn Day, then a Scottish National Party member of Parliament, said at the time. 'It seems undeniable, therefore, that by continuing to purchase hats made from the fur of black bears the MOD is funding the suffering of bears in Canada by making the baiting and killing of those animals and the sale of their pelts a profitable pursuit for the hunters.' Day said a poll at the time found 75% of the U.K. population found real bearskins were a bad use of taxpayer money and supported replacing the hats. He noted that the late Queen Elizabeth II had ceased buying fur for her wardrobe. Earlier this year, Queen Camilla, wife of King Charles III, pledged to buy no more fur products.	https://www.voanews.com/a/animal-rights-groups-object-to-buckingham-palace-guard-s-distinctive-bearskin-caps-/7784068.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
Limited role for US Navy SEAL Team in defense of Taiwan	Washington — The United States Navy's elite SEAL Team Six would likely have a limited role in defending Taiwan should China invade the self-governing and democratic island, say analysts responding to a Financial Times report that the unit has been training for it for more than one year. Lyle J. Morris, senior fellow for foreign policy and national security at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis, tells VOA Mandarin if the unit is indeed preparing for an attack by Beijing, it may indicate that the U.S. is more deeply involved in defending Taiwan than previously thought. However, he stressed that the secret and precise combat characteristics of SEAL Team Six mean its role in resisting China's invasion of Taiwan would be very limited, and the focus would be on carrying out special tasks. 'As far as their sheer capability to repel an invasion. I think that's more limited,' he says. 'I think it's in a very discreet, narrow way of coming in for a specific task that Taiwan might need, whether it's helping to protect, let's say, an airfield in Taiwan or protect a communication asset in Taiwan, in Taipei, they could come in and out very discreetly and very lethally to protect that asset.' SEAL Team Six specializes in performing sensitive, highly difficult missions. In 2009, the unit rescued Richard Phillips, captain of the MV Maersk Alabama, who was taken hostage by Somali pirates. The elite unit gained an international reputation after the successful raid on al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan in 2011. It is one of the most highly regarded U.S. military units, along with the United States Army's Delta Force, the 75th Ranger Regiment's Regimental Reconnaissance Company, the Intelligence Support Activity, and the Air Force's 24th Special Tactics Squadron, and part of the Joint Special Operations Command. 'Navy SEALs usually deployed from submarines or, most likely, small ships. And are useful for targeting vulnerabilities in enemies’ presentation,' Richard D. Fisher Jr., senior fellow with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, tells VOA. Analysts say the U.S. military likely revealed the SEAL Team Six training program to the Financial Times to send a warning to Beijing amid China’s increasingly assertive moves in the region. 'This is one way the U.S. is bolstering deterrence towards China, towards preventing a Chinese invasion of Taiwan,' says Morris. 'So, I think this is just an added factor getting China to second guess or to reconsider what it will face if it were to invade Taiwan.' Dennis Wilder, a senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University and a former Central Intelligence Agency military analyst, posted on social media platform X, 'It is sure to get under Beijing's skin.' In a written response to VOA Mandarin, Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said, 'The Taiwan question is the very core of China’s core interests and the first red line that must not be crossed in the China-U.S. relationship.' He urged 'the U.S. to earnestly abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, stop enhancing military contact with the Taiwan region or arming it by any means or under whatever pretext, stop creating factors that could heighten tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and stop conniving at and supporting the separatists’ attempt to seek ‘Taiwan independence’ by force.' Taiwan split from China during the civil war that saw the Communist Party seize power in Beijing in 1949 and the Nationalist Party flee to the island, which developed into a flourishing democracy. But China’s one-party, authoritarian state never gave up its claim to Taiwan and considers it a renegade province that must one day reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary. Admiral Philips Davidson, former commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, warned in 2021 that China could attack Taiwan within six years. President Joe Biden has repeatedly stressed that if China invades Taiwan, the U.S. will intervene militarily to defend it. The U.S. Department of Defense declined to confirm or deny the Financial Times report. Pentagon spokesperson John Supple said in an email to VOA, 'The DoD and our service members prepare and train for a wide range of contingencies. We will not comment on specifics, but will restate that we are committed to our longstanding one China policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances. As we have said before, conflict is neither imminent nor inevitable.' America’s one-China policy is a strategically ambiguous agreement it made in 1972 to establish relations with China that recognizes Beijing as the only government of China and acknowledges, but does not endorse, Beijing’s claim that Taiwan is part of China. Washington has unofficial relations with Taiwan defined through the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques with Beijing, and the Six Assurances with Taipei, which underscore U.S. opposition to attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo and determination to help Taiwan defend itself through weapons sales. There has been previous U.S. military training for Taiwan’s defense, both on the island and in the United States. Reuters reported last year the U.S. was set to expand the number of troops helping train Taiwanese forces on the island and Taiwanese officials confirmed more of their troops would be training in the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/limited-role-for-us-navy-seal-team-in-defense-of-taiwan/7784108.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
US-Russia battle for influence in Africa plays out in Central African Republic	BANGUI, Central African Republic — Hours after Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin rebelled against his country's top military leaders, his private army's biggest client in Africa panicked, turning for help to his foe in the West. Officials from Central African Republic, where some 1,500 of Prigozhin's Wagner Group mercenaries were stationed, wrote a letter that day, requesting to 'rapidly' arrange a meeting with a private U.S. security firm to discuss collaboration. Dated June 23, 2023, the day Prigozhin launched the armed rebellion, the letter sparked a series of meetings, culminating in a deal with the central African nation and Bancroft Global Development. That sparked backlash from Russian mercenaries, according to a dozen diplomats, locals, and analysts. The tensions in Central African Republic are a window into a larger battle playing out across the continent as Moscow and Washington vie for influence. The Russian mercenaries — using success in staving off rebels in this impoverished nation as a model for expansion — have long been accused by locals and rights groups of stripping natural resources such as minerals and timber and are linked to the torture and death of civilians. In the wake of Prigozhin's rebellion and suspicious death in a plane crash, the Russians are recalibrating their Africa operations. The United States, which has been largely disengaged from the region for years, is attempting to maintain a presence and stymie Russian gains as it pushes African countries to distance themselves from the mercenaries. U.S. officials blame Russia for anti-American sentiment in the region and say they're trying to shift the narrative. 'If the U.S. can't regain a foothold, it could give Russia greater economic and political leverage,' said Samuel Ramani of the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank. 'If Russia loses Central African Republic, its flagship model on the continent, there could be a domino effect in other countries.' Russia's influence In recent years, Russia has emerged as the security partner of choice for a growing number of governments in the region, displacing traditional allies such as France and the U.S. Moscow expanded its military cooperation by using mercenaries like Wagner, which since around 2017 has operated in at least half a dozen countries by protecting African leaders and in some cases helping fight rebels and extremists. They're also plagued by their human rights record. Two years ago in Mali, Wagner and the army were accused of executing about 300 men — some suspected of being Islamist extremists, but most civilians — in what Human Rights Watch called the worst single atrocity reported in the country's decade-long armed conflict. And in Central African Republic, mercenaries train the army on torture tactics, including how to tburn people alive, according to watchdog The Sentry. Central African Republic Central African Republic was one of the first places the mercenaries entered. The country has been in conflict since 2013, when predominantly Muslim rebels seized power and forced the president from office. Six of the 14 armed groups that signed a 2019 peace deal later left the agreement. Locals and the government credited Wagner with fighting back rebels who tried to overtake Bangui, the capital, in 2021. The Russians soon expanded to Burkina Faso and Niger, and have ambitions for further growth. Russia is refurbishing a military base some 80 kilometers from Bangui. Alexander Bikantov, Russia's ambassador to Central African Republic, said the base will improve the country's security. Fidele Gouandjika, adviser to President Faustin-Archange Touadera, said the base aims to have 10,000 fighters by 2030 to engage with more African nations. Touadera's office didn't reply to written requests for comment for this story. His adviser to the country's spy agency declined to be interviewed. Pressure from United States The U.S. had been pushing Central African Republic to find an alternative to Wagner for years. A more assertive U.S. approach came as it faced new setbacks and tried to rework agreements in the region. Its troops left Chad and Niger, where they were no longer welcome. Still, the State Department said in a statement this year that it wasn't involved in the decision to establish Bancroft Global Development's presence in Central African Republic. But Washington could deny such contracts if it wanted, said Sean McFate, a former contractor in Africa and author of 'The New Rules of War.' The U.S. has used private military companies to reduce American 'boots on the ground' in Africa, McFate said, and companies like Bancroft have to play by Washington's rules if they want future government work. In response to AP questions, the U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said it uses private contractors in Africa to help countries operate more effectively, with U.S. government oversight to ensure accountability. The official said the State Department has overseen Bancroft's work in Somalia but not Central African Republic or elsewhere. Bancroft's background Washington-based Bancroft is a nonprofit working in nine countries — five in Africa. Its involvement in Central African Republic has been shrouded in secrecy since signs emerged of its presence last fall. During an AP visit months later, rumors swirled about Bancroft's activities, fueling speculation the U.S was bringing its own Wagner to oust Russia. But according to Bancroft founder Michael Stock, the group entered at Bangui's behest. Stock received the letter from the presidency within a day of Prigozhin's mutiny, and the two signed a deal in September, he said. Fewer than 30 Bancroft personnel work there, Stock said, helping Central African Republic with intelligence systems, interagency cooperation and law enforcement. Bancroft has invested some $1.4 million there, Stock said. Much of Bancroft's funding has come from U.S. and United Nations grants. From 2018 to 2020, it received more than $43 million from the U.S., according to audits required as part of tax forms. Amal Ali, a former U.S. intelligence analyst, is among critics who say that despite its yearslong presence in Somalia, Bancroft hasn't contributed to any eradication of terrorism. Stock dismissed such comments as uninformed and said the Somali and U.S. governments 'agree Bancroft has done a great deal to damaging illegal armed groups and developing the capacity of the government to perform its national defense functions professionally.' Backlash on the ground Rights groups say a lack of transparency about Bancroft's operations has fostered an atmosphere of distrust in a country already rampant with armed actors. Wagner, a U.N. peacekeeping mission and Rwandan troops are all on the ground to try to quell violence. 'Operating in a vague and nontransparent way in the Central African Republic only leads to suspicion,' said Lewis Mudge, of Human Rights Watch. Stock defended Bancroft's work and policies. 'It is perfectly normal for a government not to publicize how it is defending the people and the state,' he told AP. Unclear future As the U.S. and Russia jockey for power, African governments say they want to make their own choices. Central African Republic officials approached Bancroft, which shows that these governments haven't become Russian puppets, said Jack Margolin, an expert on private military companies. But, he added, Russia's reaction to Bancroft could hurt Moscow's standing with other nations. After Prigozhin's death, Russia moved quickly to take control of Wagner's assets, and the defense ministry told countries where Wagner operated that it would take over. The country and its military intelligence arm have taken a more direct role in Africa operations, deploying more official detachments from its army. In Central African Republic, it's unclear how much sway the Russian state has with the mercenaries, who are beloved by many. For most people here, there's little interest in squabbles among foreign nations. 'There are problems between the Americans and Russians, but that doesn't matter to us,' said Jean Louis Yet, who works at Bangui's market. 'We are here working, trying our best to make a living. All we want is security.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-us-russia-battle-for-influence-in-africa-plays-out-in-central-african-republic-/7782634.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
As warming threatens polar bear tourism, a Canadian town adapts and thrives	CHURCHILL, Manitoba — Change has broken, remade and continues to reshape this remote town where tundra meets forest on the shore of Hudson Bay. The economic base collapsed when the military left town. Rail service and cargo ships — the lifeblood of supplies for a town not connected to the rest of the world by roads — blinked out. The weather is warming, signature animals are dwindling and even the ground is shifting. Through it all, Churchill has adapted. The town turned to tourism, luring people eager to see its plentiful polar bears. Leaders figured out ways to revitalize its port and railway. As climate change has edged into the picture, they've begun designing more flexible buildings and seeking to entice more varied visitors if, as scientists fear, shrinking sea ice crashes the bear population. Residents, government officials and experts say the town is a model for coping with dramatic shifts and attribute it to the rural mindset that focuses on fixing, not whining. Churchill sits about 1,700 kilometers north of Winnipeg. The town had thousands of people before the military base and a rocket research launch site shut down decades ago. Those sites fell into decay, and what had been a bustling port closed. Train service stopped for more than a year as weather shattered poorly maintained tracks. As the town dwindled, bears began coming to town more often, no longer frightened away by noise from the base and rocket launches and made desperate as climate change shrank the Hudson Bay ice they depend on as a base for hunting. A local mechanic built a fat-tired, souped-up recreational vehicle to see bears safely. Photos and documentaries attracted tourists, who spend $5,000 a visit on average and millions of dollars overall. Churchill now bills itself as the polar bear capital of the world, and though it has no stoplights, it features upscale restaurants and plenty of mom-and-pop hotels. If that comes to an end, Churchill hopes to be ready. The town is promoting tourism for beluga whales, although those too may be harmed as the entire Hudson Bay ecosystem, including the food the belugas eat, shifts to one usually seen further south. It's also highlighting visitors' prospects for seeing the northern lights, spotting birds they can't see at home, and even trying dogsledding. 'In time you're going to lose bear season. And we know that. Anyway, it's just a matter of we're going to have to adapt to that change,' said Mike Spence, mayor since 1995. 'You can't stew over it. That's not going to get you any points.' Spence grew up with the military installation 'and all of a sudden it closes and then all of a sudden you get the tourists, the abundance of wildlife and the aurora. That's where you take advantage of it. You sort of tweak things and you improve life.' The shuttered port and the damaged train tracks? The town took them over and got both running again. Ground sinking because the weather is getting rainier and permafrost is thawing? New buildings like the ones at Polar Bears International, a nonprofit conservation organization with headquarters in the city, have metal jacks that can be adjusted when a corner sinks nearly half a foot in five years. Lauren Sorkin, executive director of the Resilient Cities Network, said every city should have a plan to adapt to climate change's effect on economy and tourism. 'Churchill is a standout example of a city that is planning ahead to protect communities and preserve our natural environment and its biodiversity,' she said. Spence, who is Cree, grew up with no electricity or running water in 'the flats' on the outskirts of town, which was run by a white minority. Churchill is about two-thirds Indigenous with Cree, Metis, Inuit and Dene. Spence recalls his father saying that if only he spoke better English he could tell officials how to fix the town. 'I think I'm doing that for him,' Spence said. 'You don't just say 'I got a problem.' You go there with the fix.' You can't drive to Churchill. Food, people, cargo, everything gets there by rail, boats or plane. Rail is the cheapest, and most residents travel by taking the overnight train to Thompson, then driving south from there. Until a few years ago the train tracks, which had been leased to a private company, were not being maintained properly and the wet, stormy spring of 2017 created 22 washouts of the line between Churchill and points south, Spence said. The company couldn't afford to fix them. Big storms in Churchill are as much as 30% rainier than 80 years ago because of human-caused climate change, said Cornell University climate scientist Angie Pendergrass. 'Service stopped dead' for 18 months, Spence said. 'It was just devastating.' Meanwhile, there weren't enough goods coming into the aging port. Spence said that shipping hub and rail lines needed to operate as an integrated system, and not be run by an absentee U.S. owner, so the town negotiated with the federal and provincial governments for local control and federal financial help. In 2018, Arctic Gateway Group, a partnership of 41 First Nations and northern communities, took ownership of the port and rail line. Rail service returned on Halloween that year. Manitoba officials said that in the last two years 610 kilometers of track have been upgraded and 10 bridges repaired. Shipping in the port has more than tripled since 2021, including the return of its first cruise ship in decade, they said. Earlier this year, officials announced another $60 million in port and rail funding. Local ownership is key in Churchill, said former Chamber of Commerce president Dave Daley, who left town in the 1980s but returned after five years because he and his wife missed it. Big hotel chains poked around once and said they could fix up the town's infrastructure and build something big. 'We all stood and said 'no',' Daley said. 'We're a tight-knit group. We have our different opinions and everything else but we know how we want Churchill to be.' As Churchill evolves, its forgotten past has surfaced at times as tourists ask about residents and their history, said longtime resident Georgina Berg, who like Spence lived on the flats as a child. That past includes 'not-so-happy stories' about forced relocation, missing women, poverty, subsistence hunting, being ignored, deaths and abuse, said Berg, who is Cree. Daley, a dogsled racer and president of Indigenous Tourism Manitoba, tells of how the Metis people were especially ignored, abused and punished, yet he ends the history lesson with an abrupt shift. 'We can't change five minutes ago, but we can change five minutes from now,' Daley said. 'So that's what I teach my kids. You know it's nice to know the history and all the atrocities and everything that happened, but if we're going to get better from that we have to look forward and look five minutes from now and what we can do to change that.' Meanwhile, Daley and Spence notice the changes in the weather — not only warmer, but they're getting thunder here, something once unimaginable. The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world. While Churchill isn't quite as bad off because it's south of the Arctic Circle, 'it's something we take seriously,' Spence said. 'It's a matter of finding the right blend in how you adapt to climate change,' Spence said. 'And work with it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-warming-threatens-polar-bear-tourism-a-canadian-town-adapts-and-thrives/7781156.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
Brazil officially welcomes return of sacred Indigenous cloak from Denmark	RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil formally received on Thursday the return from Denmark of an Indigenous cloak made with 4,000 red feathers of the scarlet ibis bird, a sacred mantle that was taken by Europeans during the 17th century colonial era. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attended the ceremony outside Brazil's National Museum in Rio de Janeiro, marking the importance that Brazil gives to the item's repatriation. The cloak, a feathered ceremonial cape used in religious rituals of the Tupinamba people of Bahia in northeastern Brazil, was removed during the Dutch occupation of the area. Its first mention comes in a Danish inventory in 1689, although it is thought to have been taken from Brazil some 50 years before. By the 21st century it was held in the ethnographic collection of Denmark's National Museum, the Nationalmuseet. In 2000, the museum lent the cloak out for an exhibition in Sao Paulo. A Tupinamba leader saw it there and demanded its return. Last year, after lengthy diplomatic negotiations, the Danish museum announced it would donate the cloak to Brazil's National Museum, and it was repatriated in July. Some 170 Tupinamba traveled from southern Bahia to Rio to celebrate its return. 'It is crucial they return what isn't theirs and rightfully belongs to us. Our heritage strengthens our identity,' said cacique, or chief, Jamopoty Tupinamba to Agencia Brasil on Wednesday. From the first Portuguese voyages to Brazil in the early 16th century, Indigenous cultural items were taken to Europe as evidence of the 'discovery' of new territories and then entered museums or private collections. A fresco painted in 1674 on the ceiling of the Apollo Salon at the Palace of Versailles, the king's throne room, depicts newly found America as a woman wearing a Tupinamba cloak as if it were a headdress. According to cultural heritage activist Gliceria Tupinamba, there are another 10 such cloaks in Europe, held in museums and libraries in Italy, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Denmark, where the National Museum still has one large and three partial ones. 'It took more than 20 years to get the cloak back. Its return is a symbol of the protection of our cultural and land rights that are under threat today in Brazil,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-officially-welcomes-return-of-sacred-indigenous-cloak-from-denmark/7782592.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
Brazil's Lula pledges to finish paving road experts say could worsen Amazon deforestation	brasilia — In a visit to see the damage caused by drought and fire in the Amazon, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pledged to pave a road that environmentalists and some in his own government say threatens to vastly increase destruction of the world's largest tropical forest — and contribute to climate change. The BR-319 roadway is a mostly dirt road through the rainforest that connects the states of Amazonas and Roraima to the rest of the country. It ends in Manaus, the Amazon's largest city with over 2 million people, and runs parallel to the Madeira River, a major tributary of the Amazon River. The Madeira is at its lowest recorded level, disrupting cargo navigation, with most of its riverbed now endless sand dunes under a sky thick with smoke. 'We are aware that, while the river was navigable and full, the highway didn't have the importance it has now, while the Madeira River was alive. We can't leave two capitals isolated. But we will do it with the utmost responsibility,' Lula said Tuesday during a visit to an Indigenous community in Manaquiri, in Amazonas state. He didn't specify what steps the government would take to try to prevent deforestation from increasing after paving. Hours later, he oversaw the signing of a contract to pave 52 kilometers (32 miles) of the road, and promised to begin work before his term ends in 2026 on the most controversial section of the road — a 400-kilometer (249-mile) stretch through old-growth forest. A permit for the longer stretch was issued under Lula's far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, who favored development in the Amazon and weakened environmental protections. In July, a federal court suspended the permit in a lawsuit brought by the Climate Observatory, a network of 119 environmental, civil society and academic groups. Lula's government had appealed the suspension, but it wasn't until his visit on Tuesday that Lula made clear his plan to move ahead with paving. The Climate Observatory lamented the move. 'Without the forest, there is no water, it's interconnected,' said Suely Araujo, a public policy coordinator with the group. 'The paving of the middle section of BR-319, without ensuring environmental governance and the presence of the government in the region, will lead to historic deforestation, as pointed out by many specialists and by Brazil's federal environmental agency in the licensing process.' Lula has sought to portray himself as an environmental protector, and deforestation has slowed significantly since he took over for Bolsonaro. But he has also struck out at times against pressure from richer nations on preserving the Amazon, an invaluable resource for the planet in storing the carbon driving atmospheric warming, and did so again on Tuesday. 'The world that buys our food is demanding that we preserve the Amazon,' he said. 'And why? Because they want us to take care of the air they breathe. They didn't preserve their own lands in the last century during the Industrial Revolution.' Brazil is enduring its worst drought ever recorded, with 59% of the country under stress — an area about half the size of the U.S. In the Amazon, rivers' low levels have stranded hundreds of riverine communities, with shortage of potable water and food. Lula announced a wide distribution of water filters and other measures during his visit to the region. Meanwhile, most of Brazil has been under a thick layer of smoke from wildfires in the Amazon, affecting millions of people in faraway cities such as Sao Paulo, Brasilia and Curitiba and reaching as far south as Argentina and Paraguay. At Lula's event, Environment Minister Marina Silva blamed the extreme drought brought by climate change for the widespread fires in a rainforest usually resistant to fire, calling it 'a phenomenon we don't even know how to handle.' Silva has been more cautious than Lula about paving the roadway. At a congressional hearing earlier, she called the Bolsonaro era's permit a 'sham' and praised the judicial ruling that suspended it. Brazil is the world's fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, contributing nearly 3% of global emissions, according to Climate Watch, an online platform managed by the World Resources Institute. Almost half these emissions stem from destruction of trees in the Amazon rainforest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-s-lula-pledges-to-finish-paving-road-that-experts-say-could-worsen-amazon-deforestation-/7782627.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
China condemns German navy's transit of Taiwan Strait	BEIJING — China's military on Saturday condemned the transit of two German navy ships through the Taiwan Strait, saying it increased security risks and sent the 'wrong' signal, adding that Chinese forces monitored and warned the vessels. China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own, says it alone exercises sovereignty and jurisdiction over the strait. Both the United States and Taiwan say the strait -- a major trade route through which about half of global container ships pass -- is an international waterway. The People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command said the passage of the two ships -- a frigate and a supply vessel -- was 'public hyping,' and that its navy and air forces monitored and warned them throughout. 'The German side's behavior increases security risks and sends the wrong signal. Troops in the theater are on high alert at all times and will resolutely counter all threats and provocations,' it said in a statement. China's embassy in Germany said in a separate statement it had lodged 'representations' with Berlin, saying Taiwan belonged to China, a position the democratically elected government in Taipei strongly rejects. 'The question of Taiwan is not a matter of 'freedom of navigation,' but of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity,' it said. The Taiwan Strait is Chinese waters 'and there are no so-called 'international waters' at all,' the embassy added. China urges Germany to avoid any 'interference' that would jeopardize the healthy and stable development of bilateral relations, it added. Taiwan's government says only the island's people can decide their future. U.S. warships sail through the strait around once every two months, drawing the ire of Beijing, and some U.S. allies like Canada and Britain have also made occasional transits. China, which has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, has over the past five years stepped up military activities around the island, including staging war games.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-condemns-german-navy-s-transit-of-taiwan-strait/7784135.html	2024-09-13T23:01:55-07:00	
In Belarus, the native language is vanishing as Russian takes prominence	TALLINN, Estonia — When school started this year for Mikalay in Belarus, the 15-year-old discovered that his teachers and administrators no longer called him by that name. Instead, they referred to him as Nikolai, its Russian equivalent. What's more, classes at his school — one of the country's best — are now taught in Russian, not Belarusian, which he has spoken for most of his life. Belarusians like Mikalay are experiencing a new wave of Russification as Moscow expands its economic, political and cultural dominance to overtake the identity of its neighbor. It's not the first time. Russia under the czars and in the era of the Soviet Union imposed its language, symbols and cultural institutions on Belarus. But with the demise of the USSR in 1991, the country began to assert its identity, and Belarusian briefly became the official language, with the white-red-white national flag replacing a version of the red hammer and sickle. But all that changed in 1994, after Alexander Lukashenko, a former Soviet collective farm official, came to power. The authoritarian leader made Russian an official language, alongside Belarusian, and did away with the nationalist symbols. Now, with Lukashenko in control of the country for over three decades, he has allowed Russia to dominate all aspects of life in Belarus, a country of 9.5 million people. Belarusian, which like Russian uses the Cyrillic alphabet, is hardly heard on the streets of Minsk and other large cities anymore. Official business is conducted in Russian, which dominates the majority of the media. Lukashenko speaks only Russian, and government officials often don't use their native tongue. The country depends on Russian loans and cheap energy and has created a political and military alliance with Moscow, allowing President Vladimir Putin to deploy troops and missiles on its soil, which was used as a staging area for the war in Ukraine. 'I understand that our Belarus is occupied. … And who is the president there? Not Lukashenko. The president is Putin,' said Svetlana Alexievich, who won the 2015 Nobel Prize for literature and lives in Germany in effective exile. 'The nation has been humiliated and it will be very difficult for Belarusians to recover from this.' Belarusian cultural figures have been persecuted and hundreds of its nationalist organizations have been closed. Experts say Moscow is seeking to implement in Belarus what the Kremlin intended to do in neighboring Ukraine when the war there began in 2022. 'It is obvious that our children are being deliberately deprived of their native language, history and Belarusian identity, but parents have been strongly advised not to ask questions about Russification,' said Mikalay's father, Anatoly, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition his last name not be used, for fear of retribution. 'We were informed about the synchronization of the curriculum with Russia this year and were shown a propaganda film about how the Ukrainian special services are allegedly recruiting our teenagers and forcing them to commit sabotage in Belarus,' he said. Mikalay's school was one of the few where paperwork and some courses were conducted in Belarusian. In recent years, however, dozens of teachers were fired and the Belarusian-language section of its website vanished. Human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski, convicted in 2023 on charges stemming from his Nobel Peace Prize-winning work, demanded his trial be conducted in Belarusian. The court rejected it and sentenced him to 10 years. Lukashenko derides his native language, saying 'nothing great can be expressed in Belarusian. … There are only two great languages in the world: Russian and English.' Speaking to Russian state media, Lukashenko recounted how Putin once thanked him for making Russian the dominant language in Belarus. 'I said, 'Wait, what are you thanking me for? ... The Russian language is my language, we were part of one empire, and we're taking part in [helping] that language develop,'' Lukashenko said. Belarus was part of the Russian empire for centuries and became one of 15 Soviet republics after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Daily use of the Belarusian language decreased and continued only in the country's west and north and in rural areas. In 1994, about 40% of students were taught in Belarusian; it's now down to under 9%. Although Belarusian, like Russian, is an eastern Slavic language, its vocabulary is considerably different. In 1517, Belarusian publisher Francysk Skaryna was one of the first in Eastern Europe to translate the Bible into his native language. Even speaking Belarusian is seen as a show of opposition to Lukashenko and a declaration of national identity. That played a key role in the mass protests after the disputed 2020 election gave the authoritarian leader a sixth term. In the harsh crackdown that followed, a half-million people fled the country. 'The Belarusian language is increasingly perceived as a sign of political disloyalty and is being abandoned in favor of Russian in the public administration, education, culture and the mass media, upon orders from the hierarchy or out of fear of discrimination,' said Anaïs Marin, the United Nations special rapporteur for human rights in Belarus. At the same time, 'more people want to speak Belarusian, which has become one of the symbols of freedom, but they're afraid to do it in public,' said Alina Nahornaja, author of Language 404, a book about Belarusians who experienced discrimination for speaking their native language. Like Ukraine, Belarusians had a desire for rapprochement with Europe that accompanied their nationalist sentiment, said Belarusian analyst Valery Karbalevich. 'But the Kremlin quickly realized the danger and began the process of creeping Russification in Belarus,' he added. That prompted pro-Russian organizations, joint educational programs and cultural projects to spring up 'like mushrooms after the rain — against the backdrop of harsh repressions against everything Belarusian,' Karbalevich said. Censorship and bans affect not only contemporary Belarusian literature but also its classics. In 2023, the prosecutor's office declared as extremist the 19th-century poems of Vincent Dunin-Martsinkyevich, who opposed the Russian Empire. When the Kremlin began supporting Lukashenko against the anti-government protests in 2020, it ensured his loyalty and received carte blanche in Belarus. 'Today, Lukashenko is paying Putin with our sovereignty,' said exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. 'Belarusian national identity, cultures and language are our strongest weapons against the Russian world and Russification.' Four cities in Belarus now host a 'Russia House' to promote its culture and influence, offering seminars, film clubs, exhibitions and competitions. 'The goal is to plant Russian narratives so that as many Belarusians as possible view Russian as their own,' said analyst Alexander Friedman. 'The Kremlin spares no expense and acts on a grand scale, which could be especially effective and dangerous in a situation where Belarus has found itself in information isolation, and there is almost no one left inside the country to resist the Russian world.' Almost the entire troupe of the Yanka Kupala Theater, the country's oldest, fled Belarus amid the political crackdown. Its former director, Pavel Latushka, now an opposition figure abroad, said the new management couldn't recruit enough new actors, and had to invite Russians, 'but it turned out that no one knew the Belarusian language.' 'Putin published an article denying the existence of an independent Ukraine back in 2021, and even then we understood perfectly well that he was pursuing similar goals in Belarus,' Latushka said. 'The main course was supposed to be Ukraine,' he added, with a Russified Belarus 'as a dessert.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-belarus-the-native-language-is-vanishing-as-russian-takes-prominence/7784130.html	2024-09-13T22:52:01-07:00	
Biden meets UK’s Starmer to discuss Ukraine, Israel	US President Joe Biden met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House on Friday to discuss support for Ukraine amid a push by Kyiv for Western partners to lift restrictions on using their long-range missiles to attack targets deep inside Russian territory.

Slave to fear': Ghosts of the gulag haunt modern Russia	Moscow — When Russians started being arrested for opposing the Ukraine offensive, Maria felt the same kind of fear she guessed her ancestors, victims of repression under Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, must have lived through. Now 2½ years into its military offensive, Russia has imprisoned hundreds for protesting or speaking out against the campaign -- even in private -- in a crackdown that has paralyzed the Kremlin's domestic critics. 'It's not normal when you start behaving like your ancestors did. Twitching every time the phone rings ... thinking all the time about who you are talking with and what you are talking about,' Maria, a 47-year-old from Moscow, told AFP. 'My fear is growing.' Leafing through a book with photos of victims of Stalin's purges, Maria pointed to her great-grandfather. Of Polish origin, he was declared an 'enemy of the people' and executed in 1938 for 'spying.' He was posthumously rehabilitated after Stalin's death in 1953. His wife was also targeted, spending four years in the gulag, the Soviet network of harsh prison labor camps. Maria's grandmother, who had to live with the stigma of her parents being dubbed 'enemies of the people,' constantly worried she too would be arrested. Maria now feels a similar fear, concerned she could be labelled a 'foreign agent' -- a modern-day label with Stalin-era connotations that is used to marginalize critics of President Vladimir Putin's regime. Self-censorship Putin's Russia also has harsher legal tools at its disposal to target its opponents. Under military censorship laws, people can be convicted for up to 15 years for spreading 'false information' about the military campaign in Ukraine. In such a climate, Maria, an English professor at a university, is cautious about how she behaves and what she says in public. Outside her circle of close friends, she hides her pacifist convictions and her fondness for Ukrainian culture. She doesn't discuss politics with her colleagues, and lives in fear that somebody could denounce her for reading Western news or social media sites blocked in Russia that she accesses through a VPN. English itself is now considered an 'enemy language' that raises suspicions, said Maria, who asked for her surname to be withheld. When she is reading news articles on her phone on public transport, she said she 'immediately closes' the page and starts playing a game 'if I realize there is a person next to me not reading anything but just looking around.' Fearing her phone will be searched at passport control, she cleanses it before traveling of any chats where the fighting in Ukraine might have been mentioned. She is also afraid to wear her vyshyvanka, a traditional stitched Ukrainian shirt, in public, and shuns combining yellow and blue clothes -- the colors of the Ukrainian flag. 'Do not dare' After a brief eruption of anticonflict rallies in February 2022, the Kremlin has since stymied almost all shows of public opposition. 'People do not dare to protest, do not dare to speak out,' said Svetlana Gannushkina, a prominent Russian rights activist who has been labelled a 'foreign agent.' Heavy sentences for regime critics along with harsh treatment of prisoners has scared many into silence, she said. Gannushkina pointed to what she called a 'historical, maybe even genetic, fear' in a country that has seen multiple bouts of political repression -- from serfdom in the Russian Empire, the Bolsheviks' 'Red Terror' after the 1917 Revolution and the 1930s purges under Stalin. Her Memorial group worked to preserve the memory of victims of Communist repression and campaigned against modern rights violations until Russian authorities shut it down in 2021. Through history, repression has repeatedly 'divided society into those who were ready to submit and those who did not want to, understood that resistance leads to nothing, and left,' Gannushkina told AFP. 'History has made a kind of natural selection. ... And now we've got a whole generation of people who are not ready to resist.' 'Slave to fear' For Soviet dissident Alexander Podrabinek, 71, fear 'is not an ethnic, national or genetic peculiarity' specific to Russia. 'I have visited several totalitarian countries besides the Soviet Union and the situation is basically the same everywhere,' he told AFP. 'Fear is the main obstacle to a normal life in our country. ... Fear demoralizes people, deprives them of their freedom.' 'Someone who is afraid is no longer free. They become a slave to their fear, living without being able to realize their potential,' he added. Podrabinek was exiled to Russia's Siberia in 1978 and then imprisoned in 1981 after writing a book on punitive psychiatry in the USSR. Despite pressure from the KGB security services, he refused to leave the country. 'The only thing that can overcome fear,' he said, 'is the conviction that you are right.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/slave-to-fear-ghosts-of-the-gulag-haunt-modern-russia/7784121.html	2024-09-13T21:29:03-07:00	
Myanmar junta makes rare request for foreign aid to cope with deadly floods	Yangon, Myanmar — Myanmar's junta chief made a rare request Saturday for foreign aid to cope with deadly floods that have displaced hundreds of thousands of people who have endured three years of war. Floods and landslides have killed almost 300 people in Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand in the wake of Typhoon Yagi, which dumped a colossal deluge of rain when it hit the region last weekend. In Myanmar more than 235,000 people have been forced from their homes by floods, the junta said Friday, piling further misery on the country where war has raged since the military seized power in 2021. 'Officials from the government need to contact foreign countries to receive rescue and relief aid to be provided to the victims,' Min Aung Hlaing said on Friday, according to the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper. 'It is necessary to manage rescue, relief and rehabilitation measures as quickly as possible,' he was quoted as saying. The junta gave a death toll on Friday of 33, while earlier in the day the country's fire department said rescuers had recovered 36 bodies. A military spokesman said it had lost contact with some areas of the country and was investigating reports that dozens had been buried in landslides in a gold-mining area in the central Mandalay region. Aid restrictions Myanmar's military has previously blocked or frustrated humanitarian assistance from abroad. Last year it suspended travel authorizations for aid groups trying to reach around a million victims of powerful Cyclone Mocha that hit the west of the country. At the time the United Nations slammed that decision as 'unfathomable.' AFP has contacted a spokesperson for the U.N. in Myanmar for comment. After cyclone Nargis killed at least 138,000 people in Myanmar in 2008, the then-junta was accused of blocking emergency aid and initially refusing to grant access to humanitarian workers and supplies. Military trucks carried small rescue boats to flood-hit areas around the military-built capital Naypyidaw on Saturday, AFP reporters said. On Friday hundreds of villagers waded or swam through chin-high waters to safety following floods around the capital. Some told AFP they had sheltered in trees overnight to escape the raging flood waters below. State media said flooding in the area around the capital had caused landslides and destroyed electricity towers, buildings, roads, bridges and houses. More than 2.7 million people were already displaced in Myanmar by conflict triggered by the junta's 2021 coup.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-junta-makes-rare-request-for-foreign-aid-to-cope-with-deadly-floods/7784118.html	2024-09-13T20:48:15-07:00	
South Sudan postpones elections by 2 years, citing incomplete preparations	JUBA, South Sudan — The government in South Sudan has postponed elections scheduled for December for two years citing the need to complete processes such as a census, the drafting of a permanent constitution and the registration of political parties. The Presidential Adviser on National Security Tut Gatluak on Friday said the extension would provide an opportunity to complete critical processes before the new election date of December 22, 2026. This is the second time the country, which gained independence in 2011, is postponing elections and extending a transitional period that started in February 2020. President Salva Kiir and his former rival turned deputy, Riek Machar, signed a peace agreement in 2018 that ended a five-year civil war in which more than 400,000 people died. Cabinet Affairs Minister Martin Elia Lomuro said the extension followed recommendations from both electoral institutions and the security sector. Last month, the chairperson of National Election Commission, Professor Abednego Akok, told The Associated Press the country was behind the electoral calendar, which required voter registration to have started in June but was still pending due to a shortage of funds. The country is going through an economic crisis that has seen civil servants go unpaid for almost one year, after it's oil exports were affected by a damaged pipeline in war-torn neighboring Sudan through which it exports. The Tumaini initiative peace talks that have been going on in neighboring Kenya, believed to provide a foundation for the inclusion of non-signatory groups to sustain peace, have also stalled. A new security act that allows for warrantless detentions became law in August despite concerns from human rights groups that it would create fear in the runup to the elections. Andrea Mach Mabior, an independent political analyst, warned that any sham elections may result in a waste of resources and chaos. 'Going for elections that do not meet international standards will be a waste of money,' Mabior told the AP. But others like Edmund Yakani, executive director of the Community Empowerment Progress Organization, said delays to the elections or any extension of the transitional period would create a possibility of violence erupting across the fragile country. 'If we fail to conduct the elections in December 2024 the chance of the country turning into violence is higher than if we go for the elections,' Yakani told the AP in August. The country, which has gone through the shocks of civil war and climate change is in need of humanitarian aid with an estimated 9 million people — 73% of the country's population — projected to be in need of humanitarian assistance during 2024, according to the 2024 UN Humanitarian Needs Overview for South Sudan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-sudan-postpones-elections-by-2-years-citing-incomplete-preparations-/7784116.html	2024-09-13T20:39:58-07:00	
Dozens of Hong Kong journalists threatened in harassment campaign, says HKJA	BANGKOK — Dozens of Hong Kong journalists and their families have been harassed and intimidated in the past three months, according to the chair of a local press club. The Hong Kong Journalists Association or HKJA said Friday it had tracked 'systematic' and 'organized' attacks on journalists from June to August this year. At least 15 journalists and their family members, employers and neighbors were harassed both online and offline, the press club said. Selina Cheng, the chair of the HKJA, said in a press conference Friday that it is the biggest case of intimidation that the association has ever seen. 'I don’t believe this is right, and that’s why we are making a loud call today to say we do not accept such behavior,' she said. 'This type of intimidation and harassment, which includes sharing false and defamatory content and death threats, damages press freedom,' she added. Journalists from multiple Hong Kong media outlets have been affected, with anonymous threats and harassment made via social media email or in the mail, the HKJA said in a statement. Some of those targeted received threats to their personal safety and were warned to give up their employment or position within associations, the HKJA added. 'HKJA has gathered detailed information on a number of affected journalists and organisations,' the statement read. Those affected include two journalism education institutions and 13 media outlets, including the executive committee of the HKJA, Hong Kong Free Press, InMediaHK, and HK Feature. Many of the letters and emails warned that association with the named organizations or people could be a violation of Hong Kong’s national security laws. The emails and letters were sent anonymously, with emails sent from Microsoft Outlook accounts. On social media, posts showed photos of journalists and members of the HKJA executive committee pictured alongside images of knives, blood, shooting targets and 'memorial' signs. The Hong Kong Free Press condemned the attacks. In a statement shared on social media, it said that the landlord of the news website’s director, Tom Grundy, had received threatening letters, saying 'unimaginable consequences' would occur unless Grundy was evicted from his property. Grundy reported the threats to police, the news website said. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders or RSF called on the international community to take action. 'We strongly condemn this harassment campaign led against the independent media outlets that managed to survive the previous waves of government repression,' said Cedric Alviani, RSF’s Asia-Pacific bureau director. 'We urge the international community to intensify its pressure on the Chinese regime so press freedom is fully restored in the territory.' VOA requested comment late Friday from the Hong Kong Police Force but did not immediately receive a response. Hong Kong’s undersecretary for security, Michael Cheuk, told media 'no one should be intimidated, insulted, or so-called harassed.' Cheuk urged anyone who felt under pressure to report it to law agencies, Reuters reported. The HKJA said that it has contacted Meta, which owns Facebook, and Wikimedia Foundation, the two main platforms used in the harassment campaign. Cheng told VOA she believes a person or group of people are responsible. 'Bots means they are machine-controlled. I don’t think that’s the case,' she added. Details of the intimidation campaign come as critics warn that press freedom is being eroded in Hong Kong. Since Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020 — which carries life imprisonment for those found guilty of what are deemed as sedition, subversion, foreign interference or terrorism — news outlets have shuttered and there is greater self-censorship on sensitive issues, say media experts. Activists, political figures, lawmakers and reporters are cautious about speaking on the record to the media, with most declining to be interviewed for fear of reprisal. Media unions like the Hong Kong Journalist Association have also come under pressure, after being criticized by authorities and Chinese state media for alleged links to activist organizations. The governments of Hong Kong and China have said that the security law has brought stability back to the former British colony. But since 2020, dozens of people have been arrested under the legislation. At least 28 of those arrested were journalists or press freedom defenders. In August, two journalists from the now-defunct Stand News website were found guilty of sedition in a landmark case. And the pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai is in prison and on trial under the national security law for charges he denies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-of-hong-kong-journalists-threatened-in-harassment-campaign-says-hkja/7784104.html	2024-09-13T19:19:17-07:00

Iraqi, US forces kill top IS commander, other militants in joint operation	baghdad — Iraqi forces and American troops have killed a senior commander with the Islamic State group who was wanted by the United States, as well as several other prominent militants, Iraq's military said Friday. The operation in Iraq's western Anbar province began in late August, the Iraqi military said, and involved members of the Iraqi National Intelligence Service and Iraq's air force. Among the dead was an IS commander from Tunisia, known as Abu Ali Al-Tunisi; the U.S. Treasury Department had offered $5 million for information about him. Also killed was Ahmad Hamed Zwein, the IS deputy commander in Iraq. Despite their defeat, attacks by IS sleeper cells in Iraq and Syria have been on the rise over the past years, with scores of people killed or wounded. Friday's announcement was not the first news of the operation. Two weeks ago, officials said that the U.S. military and Iraq launched a joint raid targeting suspected IS militants in the country's western desert that killed at least 15 people and left seven American troops hurt. Five of the American troops were wounded in the raid itself, while two others suffered injuries from falls during the operation. One who suffered a fall was transported out of the region, while one of the wounded was evacuated for further treatment, a U.S. defense official said at the time, speaking on condition of anonymity. In Friday's announcement, the Iraqi military said the operation also confiscated weapons and computers, smartphones and 10 explosives belts. It added that 14 IS commanders were identified after DNA tests were conducted. It made no mention of the 15th person killed and whether that person had also been identified. The U.S. military has not commented on the August raid. The Islamic State group seized territory at the height of its power and declared a caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014 but was defeated in Iraq in 2017. In March 2019, the extremists lost the last sliver of land they once controlled in eastern Syria. At its peak, the group ruled an area half the size of the United Kingdom where it enforced its extreme interpretation of Islam, which included attacks on religious minority groups and harsh punishment of Muslims deemed to be apostates. Earlier Friday, the U.S. Central Command said its forces killed an IS attack cell member in a strike in eastern Syria. It added that the individual was planting an improvised explosive device for a planned attack against anti-IS coalition forces and their partners, an apparent reference to Syria's Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. In August last year, the U.S. had agreed to enter into talks to transition U.S. and anti-IS coalition forces from their long-standing role in assisting Iraq in combating IS. There are approximately 2,500 U.S. troops in the country, and their departure will take into account the security situation on the ground, and the capabilities of the Iraqi armed forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iraqi-us-forces-kill-top-is-commander-other-militants-in-joint-operation/7784098.html	2024-09-13T18:47:00-07:00	
China’s retirement age, among youngest in world, set to rise	BEIJING — Starting next year, China will raise its retirement age for workers, which is now among the youngest in the world's major economies, in an effort to address its shrinking population and aging work force. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's legislature, passed the new policy Friday after a sudden announcement earlier in the week that it was reviewing the measure, state broadcaster CCTV announced. The policy change will be carried out over 15 years, with the retirement age for men raised to 63 years, and for women to 55 or 58 years depending on their jobs. The current retirement age is 60 for men and 50 for women in blue-collar jobs and 55 for women doing white-collar work. 'We have more people coming into the retirement age, and so the pension fund is (facing) high pressure. That's why I think it's now time to act seriously,' said Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at Victoria University in Australia who studies China's population and its ties to the economy. The previous retirement ages were set in the 1950's, when life expectancy was only around 40 years, Peng said. The policy will be implemented starting in January, according to the announcement from China's legislature. The change will take effect progressively based on people's birthdates. For example, a man born in January 1971 could retire at the age of 61 years and 7 months in August 2032, according to a chart released along with the policy. A man born in May 1971 could retire at the age of 61 years and 8 months in January 2033. Demographic pressures made the move long overdue, experts say. By the end of 2023, China counted nearly 300 million people over the age of 60. By 2035, that figure is projected to be 400 million, larger than the population of the U.S. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences had previously projected that the public pension fund will run out of money by that year. Pressure on social benefits such as pensions and social security is hardly a China-specific problem. The U.S. also faces the issue as analysis shows that currently, the Social Security fund won't be able to pay out full benefits to people by 2033. 'This is happening everywhere,' said Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'But in China with its large elderly population, the challenge is much larger.' That is on top of fewer births, as younger people opt out of having children, citing high costs. In 2022, China's National Bureau of Statistics reported that for the first time the country had 850,000 fewer people at the end of the year than the previous year, a turning point from population growth to decline. In 2023, the population shrank further, by 2 million people. What that means is that the burden of funding elderly people's pensions will be divided among a smaller group of younger workers, as pension payments are largely funded by deductions from people who are currently working. Researchers measure that pressure by looking at a number called the dependency ratio, which counts the number of people over the age of 65 compared to the number of workers under 65. That number was 21.8% in 2022, according to government statistics, meaning that roughly five workers would support one retiree. The percentage is expected to rise, meaning fewer workers will be shouldering the burden of one retiree.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-retirement-age-among-youngest-in-world-set-to-rise-/7784095.html	2024-09-13T18:41:22-07:00	
US drone was struck, recovered in Middle East, defense official says	pentagon — A U.S. MQ-9 drone was struck but safely recovered while operating in the Middle East this week, a U.S. defense official told VOA on Friday. 'We can confirm that a U.S. Air Force MQ-9 drone was struck but then landed safely and was recovered by U.S. partner forces on September 9. An investigation into the incident is underway. There were no reported injuries,' the defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss national security sensitivities, said in a statement. The news came days after Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi militants claimed they shot down an MQ-9 drone flying over that country. Houthi spokesperson Brigadier General Yahya Saree said in a prerecorded video message Sunday that the drone had been shot down over Yemen's Marib province, home to key oil and gas fields. The province has been held by allies of a Saudi-led coalition that has been at war with the Houthis for years. It was unclear from the U.S. statement where in the Middle East the drone was struck or who struck it. It was also unclear if the drone was struck and recovered on the same day — Monday — or struck before the Monday recovery. When VOA asked for clarification, it was told there were 'no additional details to share at this time.' The Houthis have downed U.S. drones several times since 2014, when the Iranian-backed group seized Yemen's capital. The attacks on U.S. drones, along with attacks on commercial and military vessels transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, have drastically increased since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. The Houthis' continuous assault campaign has disrupted commercial shipping in the important corridor, prompting many shipping companies to reroute ships. The militants have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October, seizing one, sinking two and killing at least four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets. The Houthi militant campaign began after Israel launched a retaliatory attack against Hamas in Gaza following Hamas' October 7 terror attack, and the Houthis claim they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians during the war. MQ-9 drones, also known as Reapers, cost around $30 million each, can fly up to 24 hours before landing, and can reach altitudes of about 15,000 meters. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over Yemen for years. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-drone-was-struck-recovered-in-middle-east-defense-official-says-/7784085.html	2024-09-13T18:21:01-07:00	
Mounting North Korean threats await next US president	washington — Recent moves by Pyongyang have focused attention on what will be one of the first major foreign policy challenges facing the next U.S. president: how to deal with North Korea’s rapidly developing nuclear threat. In a set of rapid-fire developments on Friday: — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an 'exponential increase' in the size of his nation’s nuclear arsenal, according to the state-run news agency KCNA. He made the same call in speeches on Tuesday and on the last day of 2022. — State media released photos for the first time of the Nuclear Weapons Institute where North Korea processes uranium for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. The photos, which showed a sophisticated array of centrifuges, were made public as Kim toured the facility. — North Korea announced that it had tested a new type of 600 mm multiple rocket launcher the previous day. South Korea said on Thursday that North Korea test-fired several short-range ballistic missiles into the waters off the eastern coast. The developments came in the context of enhanced military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, which is believed to be helping Pyongyang to develop its weapons capabilities in exchange for munitions used in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. 'The threat from North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs has been growing steadily and virtually unchecked over the course of several U.S. administrations,' said Evans Revere, a former State Department official with extensive experience negotiating with North Korea. 'Whoever the next U.S. president is, she or he will face a more sophisticated and dangerous North Korean threat.' Revere said in an interview that the winner of the U.S. election would have to find ways to weaken the link between Moscow and Pyongyang 'and demonstrate to Beijing that its ‘partnership without limits’ with Russia is a dangerous and ill-advised path that will yield no benefits' for China. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping declared in May a 'new era' in opposition to the U.S. and reaffirmed the 'no limits' partnership that was first announced just days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. While China has held back on providing Russia with arms for its war effort, the United States has accused it of delivering electronic components and other dual-use items that are keeping Moscow’s arms industry afloat. Pyongyang, for its part, denies participating in any arms transfers to Russia, an act that would violate United Nations sanctions. But a report this week by Conflict Armament Research, a U.K.-based group that tracks weapons in armed conflicts, said parts from four North Korean missiles have been found in Ukraine. The missiles, examined by Kyiv, are either KN-23 or KN-24, known as Hwasong-11 short-range missile series, and thought to have been used in attacks in July and August, the report said. Pyongyang-Moscow military ties have also been expanded to include tourism, trade, and economic and technical cooperation. This makes the use of sanctions less effective as a policy tool to counter North Korea’s nuclear buildup, according to Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration. 'That’s not as much leverage now as it was before because of the Russian-North Korean relationship,' said Samore. 'The U.S. doesn’t have very strong economic leverage that it can use with North Korea.' With few obvious policy options available, the two presidential candidates – former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris – have largely confined themselves to criticizing each other’s approach without laying out any specific plans to roll back the North Korean threat. At Tuesday night’s televised debate, Harris criticized Trump for exchanging 'love letters with Kim Jong Un' during his presidency while Trump disapproved of the current administration’s handling of the issue, saying, 'Look at what’s going on in North Korea.' During his presidency, Trump held three summits with Kim but the diplomatic effort ultimately failed when Trump refused Kim’s demand for sanctions relief in exchange for a partial rollback of his nuclear program. There have been no formal talks between the two countries since, although the Biden administration insists it is open to negotiations without preconditions, a policy that Harris could be expected to continue if elected. The Biden administration also maintains that its goal remains the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, even as many experts suggest it is time to acknowledge that Pyongyang will not give up its weapons and say the international community should focus on containment. Samore predicted that a Harris administration would continue to say that 'as an ultimate objective ... the U.S. seeks denuclearization in the long term.' A second Trump administration, he theorized, may say 'denuclearization is no longer possible' and 'accept North Korea as a nuclear power.' Robert Rapson, who served as charge d’affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, said much would depend on how the winner of the election decides to work with regional allies South Korea and Japan. 'In the likely absence of any grand outreach towards Pyongyang, Harris will have to carefully manage the relationship with ally Seoul, with a focus for the foreseeable future on maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula,' he said. He added that it was 'uncertain at this moment' whether Trump would feel compelled to reach out to Kim and whether he would diminish the value of the alliances with South Korea and Japan.

Pentagon: $5.9B in Ukraine aid is left to be spent before October 1	pentagon — The Pentagon says it has nearly $6 billion in funding for Ukraine left that could expire at the end of this month unless Congress or the State Department acts to extend the military's authority to draw weapons from its stockpiles to send to Kyiv. 'We have $5.9 billion left in Ukraine Presidential Drawdown Authority, all but $100 million of which will expire at the end of the fiscal year,' Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said Friday. 'The department will continue to provide drawdown packages in the near future and is working with Congress to seek an extension of PDA [presidential drawdown] authorities beyond the end of the fiscal year.' A defense official, who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity, said Congress' monthslong deadlock in passing the supplemental funding bill for Ukraine was a 'contributing factor' as to why billions of dollars for weapons remained unspent. The money was expected to be allocated for Ukraine last year, but the U.S. House was unable to pass the $95 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan until late April of this year. Of that, about $61 billion was earmarked for Ukraine. The official said the delay left the Pentagon with less time to identify and send military aid to Kyiv from its stockpiles. The nearly $6 billion left in funding amounts to less than 10% of the aid allocated in April to address the conflict in Ukraine. Speaking in response to a VOA question earlier this month, deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said the Pentagon would 'use everything we can that's available to us to make sure that we are continuing to provide Ukraine what it needs, both in the short term and the long term.' 'We're in this fight with Ukraine for the long haul,' she said. Two ways to ensure access There are two ways to make sure that access to the remaining funds will not expire at the beginning of October, Mykola Murskyj, director of advocacy for the NGO Razom for Ukraine, told VOA. The first is that Congress has to approve it again. This requires lawmakers to pass a provision that would extend the authority to use the remaining amount in the next budget year. House members from both sides of the aisle have expressed support for extending the authorities so that all the allocated funding for Kyiv can be used. 'If we need to extend it, we'll extend it,' Representative Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, told VOA. Representative Mike Lawler, a Republican on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, added that he would 'push to get it done' if the funding was not all spent by the deadline. The second way to ensure the military can access the remaining funds is for the State Department to notify Congress of its intent to use the funds, according to Murskyj. In this case, lawmakers will not need to vote on the extension, but formal notification must be issued by the secretary of state, as has been done in the past. A State Department spokesperson would not comment on whether it would issue the extension, saying it would not discuss communications with lawmakers and their staffs, but would continue 'to coordinate closely with Congress concerning the steadfast support that the United States, our allies and our partners worldwide are providing to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia's premeditated, unprovoked and unjustified war.' Murskyj told VOA his advocacy group was working with members of Congress to extend the funds. 'However, I am not going to put all of my eggs in that basket,' he said, because 'it is very difficult to predict what Congress will do, and there's always the potential for some kind of last-minute derailment.' In a letter to the administration, members of pro-Ukrainian nongovernmental organizations said extending these funds 'would send a powerful message to Ukraine, Russia and American voters that the administration wants Ukraine to win.' Kateryna Lisunova of VOA's Ukrainian Service contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-5-9b-in-ukraine-aid-is-left-to-be-spent-before-october-1-/7783763.html	2024-09-13T16:56:03-07:00

US slams RT as 'de facto' arm of Russian intelligence	washington — The United States and some of its allies have launched a global campaign to undercut efforts by RT and other Russian state-backed media outlets, accusing them of operating on behalf of the Kremlin’s intelligence agencies. The State Department on Friday announced sanctions against two people and three entities, including RT’s Moscow-based parent company, saying new intelligence leaves no doubt that they are no longer engaged in providing anything that resembles news and information. RT’s parent company and its subsidiaries 'are no longer merely fire hoses of Russian government propaganda and disinformation,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters at the State Department. 'They are engaged in covert influence activities aimed at undermining American elections and democracy, functioning like a de facto arm of Russia's intelligence apparatus,' he said, adding the Russian operations also seek to 'meddle in the sovereign affairs of countries around the world.' Blinken and other U.S. officials declined to share details about the new intelligence, saying only that some of it comes from RT employees, and that it shows how the Russian-controlled television network is playing a key role in running cyber operations and even acquiring lethal weapons for Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. RT quickly ridiculed the U.S. accusations both on social media and in a response to VOA. 'RT: *Lives rent free in the State Department head*,' the outlet posted on X. 'We’re running out of popcorn, but we’ll be here live, laughing hard...' In response to a query from VOA, RT pointed to comments by editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan on her Telegram channel. 'American intelligence services have uncovered that we are helping the front lines,' Simonyan wrote, according to a translation from Russian. 'We’ve been doing this openly, you idiots. Should I send you a list of what we've bought and sent? We regularly publish this, just so you know.' The Russian Embassy in Washington has not yet responded to a request from VOA for comment. U.S. officials, though, said comments like the ones from RT’s Simonyan only give more weight to the allegations. 'They've admitted it,' said James Rubin, the special envoy for the State Department's Global Engagement Center. 'They have said they're operating under direct instruction of [Russian President] Vladimir Putin. That's what they say they're doing.' And the U.S. says the intelligence shows those Kremlin-assigned responsibilities go far beyond what could be considered normal broadcast operations, including oversight of a crowdsourcing campaign to provide Russian troops in Ukraine with sniper rifles, body armor, drones, night vision equipment and other weaponry. 'That's not what a TV station normally does. That's what ... that's what a military entity does,' Rubin said. RT is 'a fully fledged member of the intelligence apparatus and operation of the Russian government on the war in Ukraine.' The U.S. intelligence also points to Kremlin-directed RT operations in Argentina, Germany and the South Caucasus – some linked to a Russian military intelligence cyber team that has been embedded within the company. U.S. officials also said evidence shows RT is 'almost certainly' coordinating with traditional Russian intelligence services to meddle in next month’s presidential elections in Moldova. 'RT is going to be used to try to manipulate an election and, if they don't win the election, manipulate a crowd to try to generate violence for the possibility of overthrowing [the government],' Rubin said. U.S. officials also called out RT for covert influence operations in Latin America and Africa that have had serious consequences. 'One of the reasons why so much of the world has not been as fully supportive of Ukraine as you would think they would be — given that Russia has invaded Ukraine and violated rule number one of the international system — is because of the broad scope and reach of RT,' Rubin said. The State Department said Friday that it had instructed its diplomats to share evidence about RT’s efforts with countries around the world. 'We urge every ally, every partner, to start by treating RT’s activities as they do other intelligence activities by Russia within their borders,' Blinken said. Friday’s sanctions came a little more than a week after the U.S. took action against what it described as two Russian plots, one of them involving RT, aimed at undermining the U.S. presidential elections in November. The U.S. Department of Justice announced the takedown of 32 fake websites designed by Russia to mimic legitimate news sites, to bombard U.S. voters with propaganda aimed at building support for Russia in its war against Ukraine and bolstering support for Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump. The U.S. also unsealed indictments against two RT employees, accusing them of funneling nearly $10 million to a U.S. company in Tennessee to promote and distribute English-language material favorable to the Russian government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-slams-rt-as-de-facto-arm-of-russian-intelligence-/7783709.html	2024-09-13T14:55:08-07:00

Critics denounce $1.3B in US military aid to Egypt despite alleged rights abuses	washington — The Biden administration’s approval this week of a $1.3 billion military aid package for Egypt despite its failure to hit human rights benchmarks has been criticized by rights experts. The bill’s approval Wednesday overrode human rights benchmarks required to release a certain portion of the aid. A group of senators had earlier urged the administration in a letter to withhold the aid, citing the Egyptian government’s 'targeting of political opponents and journalists.' Egypt, a longtime ally of the U.S., was far from reaching those benchmarks, Yeganeh Rezaian of the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, told VOA. 'No one can say Egypt is making human rights progress,' Rezaian said. The senators’ letter cited Egypt’s failure to investigate 'allegations of human rights abuses,' including enforced disappearances and torture in prison, especially for journalists and political dissidents. This was the first time during Biden’s presidency that Egypt received the full amount of U.S. foreign military financing allocated to Cairo. In previous years, a portion of aid had been withheld because of human rights concerns, according to CPJ. This year, the human rights requirements were waived in the interest of advancing cease-fire negotiations in Gaza, territory that borders Egypt, a spokesperson for Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Reuters. 'Egypt plays an important role in accessing Gaza for peace talks in Israel,' Rezaian told VOA. 'But that’s why the security of journalists and freedom of information in the country is very important for everyone, inside and outside.' CPJ researchers believe the world’s increased focus on the Israel-Hamas war has drawn attention away from other allegations of human rights violations in the same region. In Egypt, CPJ has documented the arrests of four journalists who were subjected to enforced disappearances since March. Their cases highlight the 'shameful record' of media persecution in Egypt, according to a joint statement published Monday by the CPJ and 34 other international rights groups. The statement called for the release of Ashraf Omar, Khaled Mamdouh, Ramadan Gouida and Yasser Abu Al-Ela. Authorities took all four journalists to undisclosed locations before their appearances in Egypt’s court. At least two have been subjected to physical torture during their imprisonment, according to CPJ. 'By releasing these folks, the government can show they believe in press freedom and democracy,' Rezaian told VOA. Among those detained is Omar, a cartoonist for independent news website Al-Manassa. Omar was subjected to electric shocks and other forms of physical torture, his wife told an Egyptian news website. Omar had published multiple 'critical cartoons' about the policies of his government, Sophie Brondel of Cartooning for Peace told VOA. She added that authorities have questioned him about his cartoons during detainment. Cartooning for Peace was one of the 34 co-signers of CPJ’s statement. 'We can see in many authoritarian regimes that cartoonists are often among the first targets,' Brondel told VOA. 'With their drawings, they have the capacity to also reach out to a broader public.' Freemuse, another artistic freedom organization that signed the document, has been monitoring Egypt’s media landscape for years. The organization noted an increase in how the government has 'hammered down on freedom of expression,' Sverre Pedersen, Freemuse’s executive director, told VOA. 'Without free expression and free art, it’s not possible to have democracy,' Pedersen said. Egypt has consistently been a top-10 jailer of journalists worldwide, according to CPJ data. The watchdog contends that torture and enforced disappearance of media workers are common practices under President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. In the decade since el-Sissi came to power, media repression in Egypt has intensified. The country has become 'one of the world’s most oppressive countries towards journalists,' with dozens of arrests and the blocking of over 500 news websites, according to Reporters Without Borders. The Egyptian Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA's email requesting comment. 'Our statement is the first step in terms of raising awareness,' said Rezaian of CPJ. 'We want the statement to be amplified as much as possible and are hoping to move towards international pressure.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/critics-denounce-1-3b-in-us-military-aid-to-egypt-despite-alleged-rights-abuses/7783692.html	2024-09-13T14:28:19-07:00	
Malawi battles fresh cholera outbreak	Blantyre, Malawi — Malawi is recording new cases of cholera two months after it declared the end of the country's worst cholera outbreak, which began in March 2022 and killed nearly 2,000 people. New cases have been reported in Chitipa district in northern Malawi and Machinga district in the south. Records from Chitipa District Health Office, released Friday, show the district has recorded 22 cases of cholera, with one death, since the onset of the new outbreak last week. That includes nine new cases registered Friday, with eight people hospitalized. Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease that can kill within hours if left untreated. Machinga district hospital in southern Malawi registered its first cholera case in the new outbreak this week. 'It has been three days now since we registered that case,' said Wongani Nyirenda, the hospital’s spokesperson. 'However, we are doing everything to make sure that people are using safe water. We have given them some chlorine and a water guard to treat their water.' He said health surveillance assistants are also on the ground educating people about good hygiene practices. The resurgence of cholera cases comes two months after Malawi declared the end of the country's worst cholera outbreak, which began in March 2022 and killed nearly 2,000 people. Government authorities told VOA in July that they had stopped the outbreak by increasing access to safe water and administering an oral cholera vaccination campaign that began in December 2022. George Jobe, executive director of the Malawi Health Equity Network, is concerned about the resurgence. 'It is worrisome,' he said. 'Our hope and expectation was that we would have a breather. A longer breather, especially considering that in 2022 we had a big suffering from cholera which took us over a year. So, we wouldn’t want to go back to such a bad experience.' Jobe believes the resurgence means Malawi is still struggling to address the challenges of making safe water available. He said water contaminated by sewage is the main cause of cholera. 'We have issues to do with behavioral change where hygiene issues should be borne in mind, like washing hands with soap, having pit latrines and good waste management,' he said. The co-chairperson for the presidential task force on COVID-19 and cholera in Malawi, Dr. Wilfred Chalamira Nkhoma, did not respond to calls and texts from VOA seeking comment on the new outbreak. However, Ministry of Health officials told local media this week that Malawians should not panic, saying the government is putting measures in place to control the spread of the disease.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malawi-battles-fresh-cholera-outbreak/7783671.html	2024-09-13T13:58:54-07:00

Report details how China retaliates against people for engaging with UN	washington — China is among the foreign governments that retaliate against people for engaging with the United Nations, according to a report released this week by the U.N. Secretary-General. The report highlights how hard Beijing tries to silence its critics, according to Sophie Richardson, an expert on human rights in China. 'These [U.N.] mechanisms are some of the only ones available to people inside China, at least on paper, to provide any modicum of redress or justice for the human rights abuses either they’ve endured or the communities they work with have endured,' Richardson told VOA. 'That’s why you see the Chinese government go to extraordinary lengths to silence people who are simply trying to take reports to some of these human rights experts or bodies,' Richardson said. A former China director at Human Rights Watch, Richardson is currently a visiting scholar at Stanford University. The annual report chronicles government retaliation against people for engaging with the U.N. In addition to China, other countries named in the report include Colombia, India, Nicaragua, the Philippines and Russia. 'In my perfect world, governments that get referenced in these reprisals reports shouldn’t be members of the Human Rights Council,' said Richardson, who is based in Washington. China is a current member of the council in Geneva. China’s Washington embassy, as well as its U.N. offices in New York and Geneva, did not reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment for this story. One of the incidents included in the report’s China section is harassment against two members of the international legal team supporting Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy publisher. Lai is on trial in Hong Kong on national security charges that are widely viewed as politically motivated. The 76-year-old is in prison following convictions in other cases that supporters also view as sham cases. Members of Lai’s legal team have faced death and rape threats, as well as attempts by unknown sources to hack their email and bank accounts, according to the report. Sebastien Lai thanked the U.N. for shedding light on his father’s case. 'These intimidation tactics will not succeed. I will not rest until my father is freed,' he said in a statement. Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, a barrister leading Jimmy’s international legal team, also condemned the attacks. The reprisals 'are personally unpleasant and distressing,' Gallagher said in a statement. 'But they are also an attack on the legal profession and on the international human rights system.' The reprisals make it harder for Jimmy Lai to use U.N. mechanisms to achieve justice in his case, Gallagher said. Hong Kong’s government has tried to argue that the legal team interfered in Hong Kong’s judicial process by bringing his case to U.N. human rights mechanisms, according to the report. 'It’s just so nakedly in tension with its obligations under international law,' Richardson said. On Thursday, Lai’s international legal team submitted an urgent appeal to the U.N. special rapporteur on torture. The appeal raised several concerns, including that the elderly publisher has been in solitary confinement since late 2020 and that the British national has been denied access to independent medical care, according to a statement from his legal team. Lai’s trial began in December 2023. It was initially expected to last around 80 days but is now expected to resume in November. Press freedom groups have called the trial a sham, and the U.S. and British governments have called for his immediate release. Hong Kong officials, however, have said he will receive a fair trial. Other incidents cited in the U.N. report include the case of Cao Shunli, a Beijing-based human rights defender who was arrested following an attempt to engage in a universal periodic review of China’s human rights record at the Human Rights Council. Cao died in custody in 2014. Another case is that of the Beijing-based activists Li Wenzu and Wang Quanzhang, who are married. The couple have faced significant retaliation, including police surveillance and evictions, and their son is unable to enroll in school due to pressure from state authorities, the report said. 'If one reads these cases, you get a sense of what risks — what unbelievable risks — people are taking to do this kind of work,' Richardson said. The report doesn’t mention specific incidents involving Uyghurs or Tibetans, but Richardson says their absence underscores how difficult it is for some groups to access U.N. mechanisms in the first place, as well as how some people may be too scared to report such incidents to the U.N. The Chinese government has engaged in severe human rights abuses against both ethnic groups, according to myriad reports. Multiple governments and international human rights organizations have accused Beijing of committing genocide and crimes against humanity against the Uyghurs, which the Chinese government rejects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-details-how-china-retaliates-against-people-for-engaging-with-un/7783526.html	2024-09-13T12:35:16-07:00	
China, US resume top-level military communication amid ongoing tension	Taipei, Taiwan — The United States and China are taking steps to resume top-level military-to-military communication, which analysts say is aimed at avoiding miscommunication and preventing tensions in the Indo-Pacific region from spiraling out of control. The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Sam Paparo, and the head of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Southern Theater Command, General Wu Yanan, held a video call Tuesday. The Chinese defense ministry said the two commanders had an 'in-depth exchange of views on issues of common concern' while Paparo urged the Chinese military 'to reconsider its use of dangerous, coercive and potentially escalatory tactics in the South China Sea and beyond.' On Thursday, the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Wu is expected to attend a defense conference held by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii next week, citing anonymous U.S. defense officials. Meanwhile, Michael Chase, the U.S. assistant secretary of defense for China, Taiwan and Mongolia, is holding defense policy coordination talks with Chinese defense officials while attending the annual Xiangshan Security Dialogue held in Beijing. The U.S. delegation led by Chase will 'engage with regional allies and partners on the sidelines of the Xiangshan Forum to underscore the United States' shared vision for the region ‘underpinned by a set of enduring beliefs,’' said the U.S. Department of Defense in a readout released Thursday. The Biden administration has been working to restore communication between Chinese and American militaries since the U.S. president’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in California last November. It also follows the first meeting between U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and China’s vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, Zhang Youxia, last month. During that meeting, Zhang said maintaining military security is 'in line with the common interests of both sides' and Sullivan highlighted the two nations’ shared responsibility to 'prevent competition from veering into conflict or confrontation.' Some analysts see a potential for further communication and engagement between the two militaries. 'I won’t rule out the possibilities that Beijing and Washington may look to establish a hotline between the two militaries, and whether that mechanism could be extended to the theater command level remains to be seen,' Lin Ying-Yu, a military expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. While the resumption of top-level communication allows Beijing and Washington to avoid miscalculations, other experts say it is unclear whether China and the U.S. can establish a more sustainable mechanism to cope with potential crises. 'While having contact and knowing your interlocutors are positive things during non-crisis times, the real test is whether these contacts can hold back any unintended escalation when incidents happen,' said Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore. Chong said since theater commanders from the U.S. and China oversee implementing rather than formulating policies, it is unclear whether the latest development can become established protocols. 'If there’s a persistence of [maintaining military-to-military communication], then it would suggest that it has become a policy,' he told VOA by phone. Tensions remain high over contentious issues Tensions remain high between China and the U.S. over a range of issues, including the repeated collision between Chinese and Philippine vessels near disputed reefs in the South China Sea and Beijing’s increased maneuvers in waters and airspace near Taiwan and Japan. During the Xiangshan Forum, Lieutenant General He Lei, the former vice president of the PLA Academy of Military Sciences, characterized the Philippines’ attempt to safeguard its territorial claims in the South China Sea as 'a unilateral change of the status quo' while accusing the U.S. of undermining security across the Taiwan Strait by selling weapons to Taiwan. 'The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army will never allow any external forces to interfere in China's internal affairs or invade China's territory,' he told Chinese state broadcaster CGTN in an interview. Some analysts say there are limits to what military-to-military communications can do to ease tensions over what are essentially political disagreements. 'The military tension is only a manifestation of their political differences over Taiwan and the South China Sea, so if their disagreements are not resolved, the military tension is very unlikely to see a permanent resolution,' Yun Sun, China program director at the Stimson Center in Washington, told VOA by phone. With less than two months until the U.S. presidential election, Chong in Singapore said Beijing and Washington’s recent efforts may be an attempt to lay the foundation for bilateral military-to-military communication to be continued after the November election. 'On the Democrat side, if some of the current team stays [after November], perhaps we would see this momentum continue,' he told VOA. 'On the Republican side, things are a bit messier, because you have those who prefer the isolationist approach, those who advocate a containment approach in Asia, and people who talk about competing against China to win,' Chong added. Sun said if Donald Trump wins the election in November, Beijing will expect instability in bilateral relations and be prepared for the military relationship to be affected.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-us-resume-top-level-military-communication-amid-ongoing-tension/7783487.html	2024-09-13T11:53:08-07:00	
Mexican cartel leader 'El Mayo' Zambada pleads not guilty to US charges	new york — Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, a powerful leader of Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, pleaded not guilty Friday to U.S. narcotics trafficking charges in a case accusing him of engaging in murder plots, ordering torture and channeling tons of drugs into the United States. Participating in a court hearing through a Spanish-language interpreter, Zambada gave yes-or-no answers to a magistrate’s standard questions about whether he understood various documents and procedures. Asked how he was feeling, he said, 'Fine, fine.' His lawyers entered the not guilty plea on his behalf. Outside court, Zambada attorney Frank Perez said his client wasn't contemplating making a deal with the government, and the attorney expects the case to go to trial. 'It's a complex case,' he said. Sought by American law enforcement for more than two decades, Zambada has been in U.S. custody since July 25, when he landed in a private plane at an airport outside El Paso, Texas, in the company of another fugitive cartel leader, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, according to federal authorities. Zambada later said in a letter that he was kidnapped in Mexico and brought to the U.S. by Guzman Lopez, a son of imprisoned Sinaloa co-founder Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman. Zambada's lawyer did not elaborate on those claims Friday. U.S. Magistrate Judge James Cho ordered Zambada detained until trial. His lawyers did not ask for bail, and U.S. prosecutors in Brooklyn asked the judge to detain him. 'He was one of the most, if not the most, powerful narcotics kingpins in the world,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Francisco Navarro said. 'He co-founded the Sinaloa cartel and sat atop the narcotics trafficking world for decades.' Zambada sat quietly as he listened to the interpreter. Leaving court after the brief hearing, he appeared to accept some help getting out of a chair, then walked out slowly but unaided. The 76-year-old had used a wheelchair at a court appearance in Texas last month. But Perez said after court Friday that Zambada was healthy and 'in good spirits.' Sketch artists were in the small courtroom, but other journalists could observe only through closed-circuit video because of a shortage of seats. In court and in a letter earlier to the judge, prosecutors said Zambada presided over a vast and violent operation, with an arsenal of military-grade weapons, a private security force that was almost like an army, and a corps of 'sicarios,' or hitmen, who carried out assassinations, kidnappings and torture. His bloody tenure included ordering the murder, just months ago, of his own nephew, the prosecutors said. 'A United States jail cell is the only thing that will prevent the defendant from committing further crimes,' Navarro said. Zambada also pleaded not guilty to the charges at an earlier court appearance in Texas. His next court appearance is scheduled for October 31. According to authorities, Zambada and 'El Chapo' Guzman built the Sinaloa cartel from a regional syndicate into a huge manufacturer and smuggler of cocaine, heroin and other illicit drugs to the U.S. Zambada has been seen as the group's strategist and dealmaker and a less flamboyant figure than Guzman. Zambada had never been behind bars until his U.S. arrest in July. His apprehension has touched off fighting in Mexico between rival factions in the Sinaloa cartel. Gunfights have killed several people. Schools and businesses in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa, have closed amid the fighting. The battles are believed to be between factions loyal to Zambada and those led by other sons of 'El Chapo' Guzman, who was convicted of drug and conspiracy charges and sentenced to life in prison in the U.S. in 2019. It remains unclear why Guzman Lopez surrendered to U.S. authorities and brought Zambada with him. Guzman Lopez is awaiting trial on a separate drug trafficking indictment in Chicago, where he has pleaded not guilty.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexican-cartel-leader-el-mayo-zambada-pleads-not-guilty-to-us-charges-/7783468.html	2024-09-13T11:41:56-07:00	
Comoros president slightly injured in knife attack, spokesperson says	MORONI — Comoros President Azali Assoumani was slightly injured in a knife attack on Friday, the archipelago nation's government spokesperson said, adding that the attacker has been taken into custody. The incident occurred around 2 p.m. local time in Salimani Itsandra, a town just north of the capital, Moroni, a local source told Reuters. 'President Azali Assoumani was slightly injured with a knife during the funeral of a great sheik of the country. His injuries are not serious, and he has returned home,' government spokesperson Fatima Ahamada told Reuters. The motive for the attack was not immediately clear. The source from the town of Salimani Itsandra added that the attacker is a former policeman in his 20s. In May, Assoumani was sworn in for a fourth term in office following a tense January election which his opponents claim was tainted by voter fraud.	https://www.voanews.com/a/comoros-president-slightly-injured-in-knife-attack-spokesperson-says/7783427.html	2024-09-13T11:04:19-07:00

How propaganda outlets cover — or ignore — aspects of US election	Washington — When Kamala Harris and Donald Trump met in a presidential debate on Tuesday, they spoke about a range of foreign policy issues, including China and Russia’s war in Ukraine. But while the debate attracted large audiences and coverage in the United States and Europe, Beijing and Moscow’s state-run media were relatively quiet on the event. The minimal coverage is a contrast to the presidential debate between Joe Biden and Trump in June. Chinese media After that debate, Beijing-run outlets — like media around the world — were flooded with coverage of Biden’s poor performance. But Harris-Trump coverage was noticeably slimmer in state-run outlets such as Xinhua, the Global Times and the People’s Daily newspaper, China media analysts say. The shift is a subtle but significant distinction, according to China media analysts, that reflects how the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, employs its propaganda apparatus. The relative lack of coverage wasn’t all that surprising to Kenton Thibaut, a senior resident China fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab in Washington. The Chinese government is probably still figuring out how to move forward following Biden’s abrupt withdrawal, said Thibaut. She believes that’s a primary reason for the reduced coverage of this week’s debate. 'This is really reflective of how China handles changes in foreign policy issues,' Thibaut said. 'They just stick to very fact-based coverage, basically restating what the candidate said, until they — the propaganda department and such — can figure out basically how to cover it globally and domestically.' Another reason for the reduced coverage may have to do with democracy itself, according to China experts. 'The presidential debate is important for U.S. democracy, and democracy is always a sensitive topic for the CCP,' Anne-Marie Brady, a professor and specialist in Chinese politics at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, told VOA in an email. Jonathan Hassid, an Iowa State University professor who specializes in Chinese media, agreed. 'Chinese media does not like covering democratic successes,' Hassid told VOA. 'Democratic failures are highlighted, but the successes are not.' That helps explain the difference between the coverage of the two debates. During the first debate, which by many accounts was a fiasco, Biden sounded hoarse and frail, and his repeated fumbles highlighted concerns over the 81-year-old’s capacity to serve another four-year term as president. In coverage of that debate, Chinese state media relied on narratives about how democracy doesn’t work well, Hassid said. For instance, Hu Xijin, a Chinese media commentator and former state media editor, wrote, 'Objectively speaking, the low-quality performance of these two old men was a negative advertisement for Western democracy.' By contrast, Hassid said, this week’s debate may have been perceived as a better display of democracy. Still, China also didn’t even feature that largely in the latest debate. While Harris didn’t go into much detail, she said that 'a policy about China should be in making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the 21st century.' Trump, meanwhile, has previously proposed tariffs up to 100% on Chinese products. When asked about Harris and Trump’s views about tariffs on imports from China, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning on Wednesday said she had no comment. 'The presidential elections are the United States’ own affairs,' she said. 'That said, we are opposed to making China an issue in U.S. elections.' A spokesperson for China’s embassy replied to VOA’s request for comment with a similar statement: 'On the issue of the U.S. election, China’s position is consistent and clear. China has no intention and will not interfere in it. At the same time, we hope that the U.S. side will not make accusations against China in the election.' Russian media Russia — another propaganda powerhouse — also didn’t offer much coverage of the debate. 'But that doesn’t mean that they don’t drop in plenty of spin,' according to Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University’s Media Forensics Hub. Based on his analysis of Russian state media coverage of the debate, Linvill said outlets such as RT and Sputnik were focused on downplaying Harris and playing up Trump. There were some outliers, such as a Sputnik article in which a psychiatrist claimed Harris was trying to 'hide her imposter syndrome' during the debate. But most of the coverage was subtler, Linvill said. Articles tended to be anodyne and not necessarily critical of either side, Linvill said, but they still reveal Moscow’s well-documented preference for Trump. U.S. officials are again warning about Russian efforts to influence this year’s election. Last week, the Justice Department accused two Russians who work at the Kremlin-backed RT of money laundering by funneling nearly $10 million to a conservative Tennessee-based media outlet that is a leading platform for pro-Trump voices. While it’s important to monitor disinformation in the lead-up to and during an election, according to Thibaut, the period immediately after is perhaps even more important, especially if the election is close. 'This is a prime time for threat actors to take advantage of information, the polarizing narratives, the charged-up atmosphere to really sow social division,' Thibaut said. 'We have to really remain vigilant after the election as well.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-propaganda-outlets-cover-or-ignore-aspects-of-us-election/7783317.html	2024-09-13T10:12:54-07:00	
US-China rivalry for military influence in Africa ramps up	Johannesburg — While the U.S. was forced to downsize and pull its troops out of Niger this year, China is increasing its military cooperation on the continent, recently announcing a plan to spend $140 million to train 6,000 military personnel — a move, a U.S. defense official said Friday, was for China’s 'own economic growth and benefit.' Among the many ways that the U.S. and China are competing for influence in Africa, analysts say military cooperation on the continent is one that is seeing rising rivalry between the two superpowers. At a summit that focused on China-Africa cooperation last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping made the pledge to train the 6,000 military personnel. He also invited 500 African officers to visit China. ‘Most explicit’ pledge China has been cooperating with Africa in several areas of security for years, including participating in U.N. peacekeeping missions, holding joint military drills, and providing training and education for officers. However, analysts said the latest announcement was particularly noteworthy. 'This year’s military pledge was by far the most explicit,' Lauren Johnston, associate professor of China studies at the University of Sydney, told VOA. 'Never seen anything so measured and direct.' Asked by VOA about whether Xi’s pledge means China is outperforming the U.S. when it comes to security cooperation on the continent, a spokesperson for U.S.-Africa Command, or AFRICOM, said: 'We recognize that the PRC is adept at creating opportunities to expand influence on the continent.' The PRC is the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China. 'Its long-term vision for Africa is tied to its own economic benefit and growth,' said the spokesperson, Kelly Cahalan. 'The PRC is the second-largest arms supplier in Africa after Russia, with defense exports of small arms, missile systems, aerial munitions, naval vessels, combat aircraft, infantry vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles.' However, the AFRICOM spokesperson added that the U.S. 'would welcome the PRC's cooperation on issues such as climate change, global health security, arms control and non-proliferation.' Niger exodus In a blow to Washington earlier this year, the U.S. military was forced to pull troops out of Niger, after the junta there demanded the U.S. close its $100 million airbase combatting extremist groups in the Sahel region. Since then, the U.S. has been in talks with other West African nations, including Ivory Coast, Ghana and Benin 'as we start to reset and recalibrate some of our assets,' General Michael Langley commander of U.S.-Africa Command, or AFRICOM, told journalists in an online press briefing Thursday. Langley was speaking from Kenya, after also visiting Somalia to speak with the government about counter-terrorism efforts against al-Shabab. He has spent a lot of time on the continent recently, having also visited a number of North African countries earlier this year. Asked in the press briefing about China’s influence in Africa, General Langley said the choice lay with African governments. 'When we have engaged with our African partners, we don’t give them an ultimatum of who to choose for a security partner,' he said. 'All our activities and our partnership-centric type approach should be African-led and U.S.-enabled.' Darren Olivier, director of the conflict research consulting firm African Defense Review, said the U.S. is trying to shore up support after the blow it received in West Africa. 'The U.S. was clearly shaken by the junta takeovers in Sahelian countries like Burkina Faso & Niger and their subsequent ending of security cooperation and basing agreements,' he said in a written response to VOA, noting that the U.S. had been criticized for not being consultative enough with its African partners. 'General Langley’s tour therefore appears to be not just about shoring up support for new cooperation agreements and basing locations, but to reinforce the U.S.’s new message of listening first and advising second,' Olivier added. Playing the long game Efforts by the U.S. in Africa come as China is working to grow its ties as well. Jana de Kluiver, an analyst with the Institute for Security Studies based in South Africa, said China was looking to foster long-term connections with the people who will go on to become Africa’s military top brass and political elite. 'The 6,000 military personnel trained by China will later on become higher ranking figures in their respective countries, enhancing Beijing's soft power across the continent,' she told VOA. In 2022, China launched what it called the Global Security Initiative, or GSI, as a counterpoint to the U.S.-led security order. One of the main tenets of the initiative is China’s principle of non-interference. 'As Chinese economic interests expand across the continent, the need for a stable security environment becomes critical. However, Beijing is careful to avoid appearing too assertive, as its broader narrative seeks to contrast with the perceived interventionism of the West,' said the Institute for Security Studies’ de Kluiver. African Defense Review’s Olivier said it will be interesting to see how African nations that are used to Western military support and training now juggle their options. If they opt for Chinese training, they could then choose to 'silo their armed forces into units trained by Western countries and units trained by China, which will have its own impacts from incompatible doctrines and standards,' he told VOA. China always positions itself as a no-strings attached ally of Africa and Olivier said it would also depend where China placed any pre-conditions on military cooperation. 'Western countries are traditionally skittish about training units that might commit human rights violations,' he said. 'This might provide the opportunity for some countries frustrated with those restrictions to turn to Beijing for training instead.' Base concerns Washington has also long been concerned about the possibility that China is looking to establish a second permanent base in Africa. Beijing already has one on the continent’s east coast, in Djibouti, and is said to be seeking a foothold in West Africa. That would give Beijing a military presence across the Atlantic from America’s East Coast, a move that analysts say would be perceived by the U.S. as a threat to national security. China was believed to be looking to Equatorial Guinea, but those talks have reportedly stalled. Last week Bloomberg reported the U.S. is assembling a $5 million security package, including special forces training, for Gabon. The report quoted unnamed sources, but said the deal was aimed at preventing China from establishing a base in the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-china-rivalry-for-military-influence-in-africa-ramps-up/7783311.html	2024-09-13T09:56:32-07:00	
Polish MPs vote to reform controversial constitutional court	Warsaw, Poland — Poland's lower house of parliament on Friday adopted legislation to reform the controversial constitutional court that remains under the control of the nationalists previously in power. To enter into effect, the legislation still needs to be signed by President Andrzej Duda — an ally of the preceding right-wing Law and Justice, or PiS, party government — who has not indicated what he plans to do. The constitutional court had been a source of contention between the PiS government and Brussels, which believed the tribunal damaged the independence of Poland's judiciary and extended the party's influence over the courts. Over the years, Poland's constitutional court has repeatedly challenged the primacy of EU law over national law. The parliament today 'took a huge step forward' towards reestablishing the rule of law in Poland, parliament speaker Szymon Holownia told reporters. The legislation notably calls for constitutional court judges to be chosen by a three-fifths majority vote — thus taking opposition votes into consideration — in contrast to the current absolute majority rule. Candidates would also be rejected if during the previous four years they had served as a lawmaker, senator, member of the European Parliament or government member or had been part of a political party. Holownia called on the president to sign the legislation into law and thereby 'repair' the judicial system leftover from the previous administration. He added that in case of a presidential veto, there would be no choice but to wait until a new head of state is elected next year. Since taking office in December, pro-EU Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk's government has sought to reverse policies introduced by the previous administration that had been seen by Brussels as backsliding on democracy. In February, Brussels formally approved the release of EU funds — that had been blocked for several years under the PiS government — to Poland after Warsaw made progress on judicial reforms. In March, Polish Justice Minister Adam Bodnar announced a set of measures to 'redress the situation' at the constitutional court, which continues to oppose various legislative and governmental initiatives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polish-mps-vote-to-reform-controversial-constitutional-court/7783243.html	2024-09-13T09:25:07-07:00	
Former Botswana president returns from self-imposed exile, appears in court	Gaborone, Botswana — Botswana’s former president, Ian Khama, has made a surprise return to the country after a nearly three-year self-imposed exile. Khama, who faces criminal charges, fled the southern African country in 2021, saying his life was in danger after a fallout with President Mokgweetsi Masisi. Khama appeared Friday in a Gaborone court, where his lawyers asked that a warrant of arrest against him be dropped. He faces 14 charges, which include illegal possession of firearms and money laundering. His lawyer, Unoda Mack, told reporters outside court that the warrant of arrest has been set aside. 'They wanted him, we brought him. The warrant has been set aside. He will appear in court, he will be coming. He brought himself,' Mack said. Khama, who leads a splinter opposition party, the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF), has denied the criminal charges and says they are part of persecution by Masisi. Khama handpicked Masisi to succeed him in 2018. BPF Secretary General Lawrence Ookeditse said Khama, who led Botswana between 2008 and 2018, is back to fight the 'bogus' charges. 'He went to the magistrate court to try to get the bogus warrant of arrest that was brought on him quashed,' Ookeditse said. Khama’s return comes just weeks before Botswana holds its general election on October 30. Ookeditse said the former president will participate in campaigns for his party. 'We have been very consistent and General Khama has also been very consistent to the effect that we are going to cause an upset in these elections and he is going to be on the ground campaigning for the BPF, as we are going to do all we can to effect regime change in a democratic way in Botswana,' Ookeditse said. President Masisi has previously said Khama must return to face the law, and denied accusations of persecuting his predecessor. Khama will be back in court on September 23.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-botswana-president-returns-from-self-imposed-exile-appears-in-court-/7783177.html	2024-09-13T08:52:02-07:00	
Apple faces challenges in Chinese market against Huawei's tri-fold phone	Taipei, Taiwan — The U.S.-China technology war is playing out in the smartphone market in China, where global rivals Apple and Huawei released new phones this week. Industry experts say Apple, which lacks home-field advantage, faces many challenges in defending its market share in the country. The biggest highlight of the iPhone 16 is its artificial intelligence system, dubbed Apple Intelligence, while the Huawei Mate XT features innovative tri-fold screen technology. But at a starting price of RMB 19,999, about $2,810, the Mate XT will cost about three times as much as the iPhone 16. According to data from VMall, Huawei's official shopping site, nearly 5.74 million people in China preordered the Mate XT as of late Thursday, 5½ days after Huawei began accepting preorders. But in a survey conducted on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo by Radio France International, half of the 9,200 respondents said they would not purchase a Mate XT because the price is prohibitive. An additional 3,500 said they are not in the market for a new phone now. 'I suggest that Huawei release some products that ordinary people can afford,' a Weibo user wrote under the name 'Diamond Man Yang Dong Feng.' The iPhone 16 is not available for preorder until Friday, but some e-commerce vendors in China have promised to deliver the new devices to consumers within half a day to two days of sale. In the competition between Apple and Huawei, iPhone 16 has some inherent disadvantages, said Shih-Fang Chiu, a senior industry analyst at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research. 'Apple's strength is information security and privacy, but this is difficult to achieve in the Chinese market, where the government can control the data in China's market to a relatively high degree. In the era of AI mobile phones, this will bring challenges to Apple's development in the Chinese market,' Chiu said. Apple’s AI service on its iPhone 16 will roll out at a gradual pace in different languages, first in English and other languages later this year. The Chinese version will not be available until 2025. There are other challenges Apple faces as well, Chiu added, such as regulatory controls, consumer sentiment favoring local brands and weakening spending power amid China's economic slowdown. According to Counterpoint Research's statistics, Huawei held a market share of 15% in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing Apple's 14% market share. That compares with Apple’s 17.3% share in 2023 as reported by the industry research firm International Data Corporation China, or IDC China. Ryan Reith, the program vice president for IDC's Mobile Device Tracker suite, said in a written response to VOA that the iPhone 16 has not made significant hardware upgrades and that AI applications alone are not attractive because consumers have GPT and other AI solutions. AI applications are also another hurdle. Analyst Chih-Yen Tai said iPhone 16's AI services involve personal data collection, information application and cloud computing, which will require collaboration with Chinese service providers. That, along with the ban on Chinese civil servants and employees at state-owned enterprises from using their iPhone at work in recent years, will affect the sales of Apple products, said Tai, the deputy director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Evaluation at Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research in Taipei. 'China's patriotism has led to a strong number of preorders' for Huawei's tri-fold phones, Tai said. 'The competitors in China will sell the idea [to consumers] that iPhones will soon be edged out of the premium smartphone market. So, in the next stage, the affordable iPhone versions will be the key to whether it [Apple] can return to China or its previous glorious sales era,' Tai said. Tzu-Ang Chen, a senior consultant in the digital technology industry in Taipei, said use of Huawei's HarmonyOS operating system surpassed that of Apple's iOS in China in the first quarter of this year, representing China's determination to 'go its own way' and create 'one world, two systems.' 'The U.S.-China technology war has extended to smartphones,' Chen said. 'IPhone sales in China will get worse and worse, obviously because Huawei is doing better, and coupled with patriotism, Apple's position in the hearts of 1.4 billion people will never return.' He said that as China seeks to develop pro-China markets among member countries of the Belt and Road Initiative in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa, China-made mobile phones may become their first choice.

Scenic California mountain town walloped by blizzard is now threatened by wildfire	RUNNING SPRINGS, California — In the Southern California mountain town of Running Springs, residents live between two scenic lake resorts — a seemingly serene spot but one also caught between the swings of devastating winter snowstorms and menacing summer wildfires. Niko Rynard is currently evacuated from his home due to the Line Fire, which has charred 58 square miles (150 square km) since the weekend. About a year and a half ago, the director of the Running Springs Area Chamber of Commerce raced down the mountains during a break in the relentless snowfall his neighbors came to call 'Snowmageddon.' Roads were blocked for days. The 29-year-old, who moved to the area nine years ago from the East Coast, is now staying with friends nearby but said others are shelling out hundreds of dollars to cram into hotel rooms until it's safe to return. The blaze is one of three major wildfires that have ravaged the mountains east of Los Angeles, destroying dozens of homes and forcing the evacuations of thousands of people. While California is only now confronting the height of wildfire season, the state already has seen nearly three times as much acreage burn than during all of 2023. Much of this, Rynard said, 'comes with the territory' and is part of living in a beautiful area. He said long-time residents have told him the massive wildfires are cyclical, much like the snow. To add to people's rattled nerves, Southern California was rocked by a 4.7-magnitude earthquake Thursday morning. Running Springs is dubbed the 'gateway to the San Bernardino Mountains' and perched more than a mile high. The town was among the communities snowed in when a blizzard walloped the area in 2023. Now, the community has been doused with bright fire-red retardant to protect it. 'It can be tough to live in these environments,' said Dawn Rowe, a San Bernardino County supervisor whose district covers mountain communities. 'It’s beautiful — a lot of people come to visit and they find they might want to relocate for one reason or another. I would encourage everybody to spend an amount of time doing their due diligence.' The Line Fire is burning through dense vegetation that grew after two back-to-back wet winters that included snowstorms that caused tree branches to break, leaving behind a lot of 'dead and down fuel,' said Cal Fire Operations Section Chief Jed Gaines. Another wildfire threatened the mountain community of Wrightwood about a 50-mile (80-kilometer) drive to the west. The fires have threatened tens of thousands of homes and other structures across Southern California since they escalated during a triple-digit heat wave over the weekend. Cooler weather was helping firefighters slowly gain the upper hand in battling the blazes. No deaths have been reported, but at least a dozen people, mainly firefighters, have been treated for injuries, mostly heat-related, authorities said. In one daring rescue caught on video, Cal Fire Riverside County Battalion Chief Mike Martinez saved a lone woman walking within feet of the Airport Fire in Orange County, driving his SUV up to the edge of the blistering flames so she could enter the vehicle. 'This is one of those moments ... you hope you never come across,' he told the Los Angeles Times. 'I’ve been doing this for almost 30 years. We’re used to extreme fire behavior but to see a civilian walking down the middle of the street was surreal.' Jason Anderson, district attorney for San Bernardino County, said Thursday that nine arson-related charges have been filed against a suspect accused of starting the Line Fire. 'This is particularly galling in a community that unfortunately over the last couple of years has dealt with the scourge of wildfires,' he told reporters, adding that the suspect’s vehicle has been linked to three areas where fires were started. The suspect is due to be arraigned in court on Friday. The full extent of the damage caused by the wildfires remains unclear. The three blazes are: — The Airport Fire in Orange County, which has burned more than 36 square miles (93 square kilometers). The fire was 5% contained Thursday morning and was reportedly sparked by workers using heavy equipment in the area. Ten firefighters and two residents were injured in the blaze, according to the Orange County Fire Authority. The fire has been difficult to tame because of the steep terrain and dry conditions — and because some areas hadn’t burned in decades. — The Line Fire in the San Bernardino National Forest, which was 18% contained Thursday and has threatened more than 65,000 homes. The blaze has injured three firefighters. — The Bridge Fire east of Los Angeles, which grew tenfold in a day and has burned 80 square miles (207 square km), torched at least 33 homes and six cabins, and forced the evacuation of 10,000 people. The cause of the fire is not yet known. It remained zero percent contained Thursday. In northern Nevada, the worst danger appears to have passed near Reno where a wildfire on the Sierra’s eastern front forced 20,000 evacuations over the weekend. The blaze closed all schools for four days and threatened to burn over the top of the mountains into the Lake Tahoe basin. Part of the state highway from Reno to Tahoe remained closed Thursday. Authorities further relaxed evacuation orders after 600 firefighters held fire lines despite winds gusting up to 70 mph (112 kph) the day before and bolstered containment of the 9-square-mile (23-square-kilometer) Davis Fire, now estimated at 37%. Most of the 8,000 residents that began the day under evacuation orders were downgraded to evacuation warnings, allowing them to begin to return to their homes. 'All containment lines ... are holding at this time,' Jason Clawson, an operations section chief for the federal firefighting team said at a briefing in Reno late Thursday. 'Absolutely no concerns. We have crews, equipment, engines all spread out around the entire fire.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/scenic-california-mountain-town-walloped-by-blizzard-is-now-threatened-by-wildfire-/7783041.html	2024-09-13T07:22:19-07:00

Analysts say Vietnam officials US trip could set path to C-130 deal	HO CHI MINH CITY — Analysts say this week’s visit to Washington by Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang shows advances in cooperation between the two countries, despite rising Vietnamese nationalism that may indicate rising anti-American sentiment in Vietnam. A U.S.-based analyst told VOA on September 12 that Giang’s trip set the groundwork for Hanoi to potentially purchase military cargo planes from the United States this year. Giang met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon on Monday. [September 9] Both leaders 'reaffirmed the importance of the U.S.-Vietnam partnership,' the Defense Department said in a statement, and noted the one-year anniversary of the elevation of the countries’ ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest tier in Hanoi's diplomatic hierarchy. The leaders also underscored the importance of working together to address the lasting impacts of the U.S.-Vietnam War. Austin announced that the U.S. would budget $65 million over the next five years to complete the decontamination of Bien Hoa airbase of dioxin, bringing the total from department to $215 million. The airbase was the primary storage site for the toxic chemical Agent Orange during the U.S.-Vietnam War and remains an environmental and public health hazard for those nearby. Andrew Wells-Dang, who leads the Vietnam War Legacies and Reconciliation Initiative at the United States Institute of Peace, told VOA by phone on September 5 that diplomatic visits are key to advancing war-remediation efforts, including finding and identifying the remains of missing soldiers. He said that along with the U.S. visit of Deputy Defense Minister Vo Minh Luong in July, visits from authorities provide 'opportunity for them to have high level support.' Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington and an expert on Southeast Asia, said joint war-reconciliation efforts also set the groundwork for defense cooperation more broadly. 'The United States is very pleased with the growth in bilateral defense relations, and it started from very low levels and was built on humanitarian missions,' Abuza said during the August 29 call. 'We've just continued to build on that,' he added. Cargo planes Reuters reported in July that Hanoi was considering purchasing Lockheed Martin C-130 cargo planes from the U.S., according to unnamed sources. The U.S.-based analyst, who asked that his name to be withheld because he has not been cleared to discuss the topic, said the C-130 deal was discussed but not finalized during Giang's visit. The analyst said the deal was held back by the 'massive [U.S.] bureaucracy' and because solidifying the purchase during the Washington visit would be 'too inflammatory for the Chinese.' Ian Storey, senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, noted Vietnam's delicate diplomatic balancing act, illustrated by Giang's travel itinerary before the Washington trip. 'Vietnam aims to keep its relations with the major powers in balance,' he wrote in an email on August 30. 'As such, Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang visited Russia and China in August.' Storey added that the purchase of C-130 planes would not pose a threat to China in its maritime territorial disputes with Vietnam. 'C-130 aircraft would enable the Vietnamese to transport troops and supplies to its occupied atolls in the South China Sea, but these assets are non-strategic and won't shift the dynamics in the South China Sea,' he wrote. Nguyen The Phuong, a maritime security expert at the University of New South Wales Canberra, said the C-130 purchase would be a 'symbolic move.' 'Vietnam will try to explore more areas of security and defense cooperation between Vietnam and the United States to upgrade to a higher, more meaningful level,' he told VOA on August 30. 'The C-130 would be the symbol of that kind of evolving relationship,' he said. Phuong said a C-130 is a likely entry point as there is still mistrust between the former foes regarding lethal weapons, and the deal would not rankle China too much. 'It could be quite advantageous for Vietnam,' he said of a potential C-130 purchase. 'Vietnam can improve its relationship with the United States, and at the same time, we could not anger China because Vietnam would just buy non-lethal weapons.' Rising nationalism Although there are positive signs to improving Hanoi-Washington relations, there have also been recent instances of anti-Western sentiment that could be an impediment to the countries relations, Phuong said. Fulbright University Vietnam, which has significant backing from the United States, is facing accusations of fomenting a 'color revolution,' similar to the popular uprisings in former Soviet republics. On August 21, Vietnam National Defense TV aired a critique of Fulbright for allegedly not displaying the Vietnamese flag at a graduation ceremony and facilitating a color revolution. The report has since been taken down, but Phuong said the Fulbright issue and other recent incidents show tension between Vietnam's conservative and liberal factions. 'It's a presentation of a continuous struggle between different factions, one conservative and one liberal,' Phuong said. Abuza said that Vietnamese authorities may be attempting to tighten control ahead of the anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. 'Next April is the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon,' he said. 'The Vietnamese want to control that narrative 100%. There are a lot of sensitivities.' Along with the Fulbright incident, Phuong pointed to recent uproar around Vietnamese celebrities who were pictured with the South Vietnam flag while traveling to the United States. In addition, a Vietnamese high school student faced cyber bullying and was summoned by police after posting in September that he wanted to leave the country and would 'probably never see the [Communist] Party positively again.' 'There's extreme nationalism in Vietnam at the moment,' Phuong said. 'It's against Western values.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-rushes-to-repair-damaged-energy-plants-in-time-for-winter-/7782903.html	2024-09-13T05:54:35-07:00

White House takes aim at Chinese fast fashion	Washington — The White House said on Thursday it is acting on Democratic lawmakers' demands to close what they see as a legal loophole that allows manufacturers — most from China — to dodge tariffs on low-priced goods and flood the U.S. with illegal and unsafe products. The Biden administration is targeting the 'de minimis' exemption, which allows parcels valued at less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty free. More than 1 billion such parcels entered the U.S. in fiscal 2023, U.S Customs and Border Protection said. White House officials attribute the more than fivefold increase from several years ago to the growth of Chinese e-commerce platforms such as Shein and Temu, and administration officials name-checked both of those popular fast-fashion retailers in a briefing with journalists on Thursday. Daleep Singh, deputy national security adviser for international economics, said these moves to close the loophole would have a big effect on Chinese apparel, and 'will drastically reduce the number of shipments entering through the de minimis exemption.' This would likely hamper Americans' ability to score items like an $8 T-shirt – available in a range of colors – that features a gunslinging, pants-wearing cartoon cowboy duck who proclaims, 'you just yee'd your last haw.' Or a $6 crop top that reads, in English, LIVE LAUGH LOBOTOMY. Or an $8 bra made of two fuzzy, dead-eyed cat faces shorn of their noses, mouths, whiskers and facial expressions, strung together and tied halter-style around the neck. Or an $8 item that can only be described as a business-formal bra, as it is made entirely of ties. It is available in a patchwork of leopard-, zebra- and tiger-print ties, presumably for a formal office that is animal themed. Singh added that the administration also seeks to tighten information collection requirements and consumer safety standards – and block products that don't make the cut. And further, he said, the White House is calling on Congress to pass a law this year to 'comprehensively reform the de minimis exemption.' In a Wednesday letter, 126 House Democrats urged the president to use his executive authority, saying they could not act 'amid interminable stagnation in Congress that has precluded legislation from passing.' 'While lawmakers would rather see the de minimis issue dealt with legislatively, the Democrats on the call said their patience was wearing thin,' the letter read. 'Despite the fact that the concept of de minimis reform has engendered broad bipartisan support, politicking has precluded a concrete resolution.' Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, one of the initiative's leaders, expressed concerns over fast fashion's documented use of forced labor to make their cut-rate clothing. Rights group Amnesty International has reported that Shein, in particular, upholds 'questionable labor and human rights standards.' Shein's model, the group says, leans on subcontracting the making of garments, which leaves no room for transparency or accountability for worker conditions, and gives workers no right to unionize or assemble. Navtej Dhillon, deputy director of the National Economic Council, also said the moves address concerns over fentanyl shipments and for declining U.S. industry. 'Some foreign companies are attempting to use this pathway to ship illegal and dangerous products for our health, avoid our health and safety and consumer protection laws, and evade tariffs to undermine American manufacturers,' he said. 'Textile and apparel manufacturing supports tens of thousands of jobs in key states like Georgia and North Carolina. These American workers and manufacturers deserve to compete on a level playing field.' The congressional group pushing the administration cited approval from law enforcement and industry groups. 'The de minimis loophole is severely exacerbating our nation's opioid crisis,' said Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations. 'Closing it would help staunch the flow of fentanyl and other narcotics coming across our borders and help safeguard the lives of our children, families, and friends.' And Kim Glas, president and CEO of the National Council of Textile Organizations, said the industry group 'strongly supports closing the de minimis loophole,' noting the closure of 18 textile plants in the U.S. in the past year. 'De minimis is a free trade agreement for the world at the expense of U.S. manufacturers, retailers, and consumers,' she said in a statement. 'Shockingly, it has now become a black market for dangerous products facilitating fentanyl, precursors and pill presses. De minimis is destruction.' Shein said last year that they support 'responsible reform' of the policy but did not give precise recommendations. 'The de minimis exemption needs a complete makeover to create a level playing field for all retailers,' SHEIN Executive Vice Chairman Donald Tang said in a statement. 'At the same time, American consumers deserve to know that the products they purchase are authentic and ethically produced. We believe de minimis reform can and should achieve both.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-takes-aim-at-chinese-fast-fashion-/7782826.html	2024-09-13T04:24:44-07:00	
US and British leaders meet as Ukraine pushes to ease weapons restrictions	Washington — United States President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer are meeting Friday amid an intensified push by Ukraine to loosen restrictions on using weapons provided by the U.S. and Britain to strike Russia. The talks come amid signs that the White House could be moving toward a shift in its policy, and as Russia's President Vladimir Putin warned that Ukraine's use of long-range weapons would put NATO at war with Moscow. Ukrainian officials renewed their pleas to use Western-provided long-range missiles against targets deeper inside Russia during this week's visit to Kyiv by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Blinken said he had 'no doubt' that Biden and Starmer would discuss the matter during their visit, noting the U.S. has adapted and 'will adjust as necessary' as Russia's battlefield strategy has changed. The language is similar to what Blinken said in May, shortly before the U.S. allowed Ukraine to use American-provided weapons just inside Russian territory. The distance has been largely limited to cross-border targets deemed a direct threat out of concerns about further escalating the conflict. While the issue is expected to be at the top of the leaders' agenda, it appeared unlikely that Biden and Starmer would announce any policy changes during this week's visit, according to two U.S. officials familiar with planning for the leaders' talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the private deliberations. In addition to Blinken, Biden also has hinted a change could be afoot. In an exchange with reporters earlier this week about whether he was ready to ease weapons restrictions on Ukraine, he responded, 'We're working that out now.' Putin warned Thursday that allowing long-range strikes 'would mean that NATO countries, the United States, and European countries are at war with Russia. … If this is so, then, bearing in mind the change in the very essence of this conflict, we will make appropriate decisions based on the threats that will be created for us.' His remarks were in line with the narrative the Kremlin has actively promoted since early in the Ukraine war, accusing NATO countries of de-facto participation in the conflict and threatening a response. Earlier in the year, Putin warned that Russia could provide long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets in response to NATO allies allowing Ukraine to use their arms to attack Russian territory, saying it 'would mark their direct involvement in the war against the Russian Federation, and we reserve the right to act the same way.' Starmer, in response to the Russian leader's Thursday comments, said on his way to the U.S. that Britain does not seek any conflict with Russia. 'Russia started this conflict. Russia illegally invaded Ukraine. Russia could end this conflict straight away,' Starmer told reporters. 'Ukraine has the right to self-defense and we've obviously been absolutely fully supportive of Ukraine's right to self-defense — we're providing training capability, as you know.' 'But we don't seek any conflict with Russia — that's not our intention in the slightest,' Starmer said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pressed U.S. and allied military leaders to go much further. He argues that the U.S. must allow Ukraine to target Russian air bases and launch sites far from the border as Russia has stepped up assaults on Ukraine's electricity grid and utilities ahead of the coming winter. Zelenskyy also wants more long-range weaponry from the United States, including the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, for strikes in Russia. ATACMS wouldn't be the answer to the main threat Ukraine faces from long-range Russian glide bombs, which are being fired from more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) away, beyond the ATACMS' reach, said Lt. Col. Charlie Dietz, Pentagon spokesperson. American officials also don't believe they have enough of the weapon systems available to provide Ukraine with the number to make a substantive difference to conditions on the ground, one of the U.S. officials said. During a meeting of allied defense ministers last week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he did not believe providing Ukraine with long-range weapon systems would be a game-changer in the grueling war. He noted that Ukraine has already been able to strike inside Russia with its own internally produced systems, including drones. 'I don't believe one capability is going to be decisive, and I stand by that comment,' Austin said. 'As of right now, the policy has not changed,' Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said Thursday. Starmer said he was visiting Washington for 'strategic meetings to discuss Ukraine and to discuss the Middle East.' It's the prime minister's second meeting with Biden since his center-left government was elected in July. It comes after Britain last week diverged from the U.S. by suspending some arms exports to Israel because of the risk they could be used to break international law. Both countries have downplayed their differences over the issue. Biden and Starmer's meeting also comes ahead of this month's annual meeting of global leaders at the United Nations General Assembly. The Oval Office meeting was scheduled in part to help the two leaders compare notes on the war in Ukraine, languishing efforts to get a cease-fire deal in Gaza and other issues ahead of the U.N. meeting. The White House also has sought in recent days to put a greater emphasis on the nexus between the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East sparked after Iranian-backed Hamas militants in Gaza launched attacks on Israel on Oct. 7. The Biden administration said this week that Iran recently delivered short-range ballistic weapons to Russia to use against Ukraine, a transfer that White House officials worry will allow Russia to use more of its arsenal for targets far beyond the Ukrainian front line while employing Iranian warheads for closer-range targets. In turn, the U.S. administration says Russia has been tightening its relationship with Iran, including by providing it with nuclear and space technology. 'This is obviously deeply concerning,' White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said of the missile transfer. 'And it certainly speaks to the manner in which this partnership threatens European security and how it illustrates Iran's destabilizing influence now reaches well beyond the Middle East.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-and-british-leaders-meet-as-ukraine-pushes-to-ease-weapons-restrictions-/7782817.html	2024-09-13T03:56:55-07:00	
IS-claimed attack kills 14 Shiite Muslims in Afghanistan	Islamabad — Gunmen in central Afghanistan killed at least 14 Shiite Muslims in an overnight attack that was claimed by a local affiliate of the Islamic State group, multiple sources said Friday. The Interior Ministry spokesperson in Kabul, Abdul Matin Qani, told the local TOLO news channel that assailants targeted a group of civilians in the Afghan province of Daykundi on Thursday. He did not, however, immediately share any details about the number of casualties or the nature of the attack. The media outlet quoted area residents and sources as confirming that the violence had resulted in the deaths of at least 14 people and injuries to four others. The Islamic State group said through its Amaq news agency that 'soldiers' of its Afghan offshoot, the Islamic State Khorasan, also known as IS-K, were behind the shooting. It claimed that '15 Shiite [Muslims] were killed and six others wounded.' Daykundi residents said the victims had gathered to welcome pilgrims returning from the Shiite holy site of Karbala in Iraq. Richard Bennett, the United Nations special rapporteur on the Afghan human rights situation, denounced Thursday’s violence. 'Yesterday’s appalling ISKP-claimed killings of #Hazara from #Daykundi…. bears hallmarks of int'l crimes,' Bennett said Friday on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. 'I’m alarmed about the spate of ISKP-claimed attacks. Need for prevention, protection & [international] accountability #Afghanistan,' he wrote, using an acronym for IS-K. The Taliban regained control of Afghanistan three years ago and say their counterterrorism operations have since 'almost decimated' IS-K in the country. However, U.S. officials and recent United Nations reports dispute the claims, identifying IS-K as a growing terrorism threat to the region and beyond. Earlier this month, IS-K claimed a suicide bombing in the Afghan capital that killed six people. In May, the group took responsibility for an attack by gunmen in the central Bamiyan province that killed three Spanish tourists and their local translator. In March, IS-K claimed that it was behind an attack on a Moscow concert hall that killed 145 Russians. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid reiterated in a statement last week that 'concerns raised by Western countries and institutions regarding the presence and escalating threat' of IS-K in Afghanistan were 'unfounded and driven by propaganda.' Mujahid claimed that 'the entire Afghan territory remains firmly under the control of the Islamic Emirate, leaving no room for independent or external groups to operate.' The Taliban refer to their administration as the Islamic Emirate. No country has officially recognized the Taliban government in Kabul, mainly because of human rights concerns and extensive restrictions the Islamist Taliban have placed on women's access to education, work, and public life at large.	https://www.voanews.com/a/is-claimed-attack-kills-14-shiite-muslims-in-afghanistan/7782808.html	2024-09-13T03:48:05-07:00	
Boeing factory workers go on strike after rejecting contract offer	SEATTLE — Aircraft assembly workers walked off the job early Friday at Boeing factories near Seattle after union members voted overwhelmingly to go on strike and reject a tentative contract that would have increased wages by 25% over four years. The strike started at 12:01 a.m. PDT, less than three hours after the local branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers announced 94.6% of voting workers rejected the proposed contract and 96% approved the work stoppage, easily surpassing a two-thirds requirement. The labor action involves 33,000 Boeing machinists, most of them in Washington state, and is expected to shut down production of the company's best-selling airline planes. The strike will not affect commercial flights but represents another setback for the aerospace giant, whose reputation and finances have been battered by manufacturing problems and multiple federal investigations this year. The striking machinists assemble the 737 Max, Boeing's best-selling airliner, along with the 777, or 'triple-seven' jet, and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington. The walkout likely will not stop production of Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which are built by nonunion workers in South Carolina. The machinists make $75,608 per year on average, not counting overtime, and that would rise to $106,350 at the end of the four-year contract, according to Boeing. However, the deal fell short of the union's initial demand for pay raises of 40% over three years. The union also wanted to restore traditional pensions that were axed a decade ago but settled for an increase in Boeing contributions to employee's 401(k) retirement accounts. Outside the Renton factory, people stood with signs reading, 'Historic contract my ass' and 'Have you seen the damn housing prices?' Car horns honked and a boom box played songs such as Twisted Sister's We're Not Gonna Take It and Taylor Swift's Look What You Made Me Do. Boeing responded to the strike announcement by saying it was 'ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.' 'The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members. We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union,' the company said in a statement. Very little has gone right for Boeing this year, from a panel blowing out and leaving a gaping hole in one of its passenger jets in January to NASA leaving two astronauts in space rather sending them home on a problem-plagued Boeing spacecraft. As long as the strike lasts, it will deprive the company of much-needed cash it gets from delivering new planes to airlines. That will be another challenge for new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who six weeks ago was given the job of turning around a company that has lost more than $25 billion in the last six years and fallen behind European rival Airbus. Ortberg made a last-ditch effort to salvage a deal that had unanimous backing from the union's negotiators. He told machinists Wednesday that 'no one wins' in a walkout and a strike would put Boeing's recovery in jeopardy and raise more doubt about the company in the eyes of its airline customers. 'For Boeing, it is no secret that our business is in a difficult period, in part due to our own mistakes in the past,' he said. 'Working together, I know that we can get back on track, but a strike would put our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together.' The head of the union local, IAM District 751 President Jon Holden, said Ortberg faced a difficult position because machinists were bitter about stagnant wages and concessions they have made since 2008 on pensions and health care to prevent the company from moving jobs elsewhere. 'This is about respect, this is about the past, and this is about fighting for our future,' Holden said in announcing the strike. The vote also was a rebuke to Holden and union negotiators, who recommended workers approve the contract offer. Holden, who had predicted workers would vote to strike, said the union would survey members to decide which issues they want to stress when negotiations resume.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-factory-workers-go-on-strike-after-rejecting-contract-offer/7782758.html	2024-09-13T02:01:54-07:00	
European politicians say migration is out of control; numbers tell a different story	BARCELONA, Spain — Unauthorized migration to European Union countries dropped significantly overall in the first eight months of this year, even as political rhetoric and violence against migrants increased and far-right parties espousing anti-immigration policies made gains at the polls. There was, however, a spike in migrant arrivals to the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago close to the African coast that is increasingly used as an alternate stepping stone to continental Europe. Irregular migration dominated the European parliamentary elections in June and influenced recent state elections in eastern Germany, where a far-right party won for the first time since World War II. The German government this week announced it was expanding border controls around its territory following recent extremist attacks. What do the numbers show? Despite the heated debates, irregular crossings over the southern borders of the EU — the region that sees the most unauthorized migration — were down by 35% from January to August, according to the latest preliminary figures compiled by the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration. Nearly 115,000 migrants — less than 0.03% of the EU's population — have arrived without permission into the EU via Mediterranean and Atlantic routes so far this year, compared to 176,252 during the same period last year, the U.N. says. In contrast, more than a million people, most of them fleeing conflict in Syria, entered the EU in 2015. Data shared by the EU's border and coast guard agency Frontex shows a similar trend: Unauthorized crossings over the region's southern borders fell 39% overall this year compared to last year. 'The emergency is not numerical this year, nor was it last year,' Flavio di Giacomo, a spokesperson with the IOM office for the Mediterranean, told The Associated Press. Camille Le Coz, an associate director of the nonprofit Migration Policy Institute in Europe, said irregular migration is 'getting way too much attention compared to the scope of the issue and compared to other issues Europe should be tackling, such as climate change.' The most commonly used route for migrants is from North Africa, across the dangerous Central Mediterranean to Italy. Yet roughly 64% fewer migrants disembarked in Italy this year than during the same period in 2023, according to IOM and Frontex numbers. Experts say that's a result of the EU-supported crackdown in Tunisia and Libya, which comes at a price for migrants, many of whom are systematically rounded up and dumped in the desert. How long the downward trend will hold remains to be seen, however. Smugglers are always quick to adapt and find new routes around border controls. In the Eastern Mediterranean, the second-most-used route, smuggling networks are now using speedboats in increasingly aggressive ways to avoid controls and targeting islands farther away from the Turkish coast in the central Aegean, according to Greek authorities. The number of migrants arriving in Greece by sea and overland during the first eight months of the year rose by 57%, U.N. data shows. An alarming spike in the Atlantic Meanwhile, irregular migration from West Africa to the Canary Islands via the Atlantic, the third-most-used route, has more than doubled: More than 25,500 migrants — mostly from Mali, Senegal and other West African countries — had arrived in the islands as of August 31, the U.N. says. Countless other migrants have gone missing along the route, where rough winds and strong Atlantic currents work against them. Several migrant boats, carrying only the remains of Malian, Mauritanian and Senegalese citizens, have been found this year drifting as far away as the Caribbean and off Brazil. Precise numbers are hard to verify, but the Spanish migrant rights group Walking Borders has reported more than 4,000 dead or missing. The trend has Spanish authorities on alert for the fall, when conditions in the Atlantic are most favorable for the journey. The treacherousness of the route seems to have done little to dissuade would-be migrants, whose ranks have swelled to include people from Syria and Pakistan, according to rescuers. 'There are situations that need to be addressed, like the situation in the Canary Islands,' Le Coz acknowledged. A humanitarian crisis The adult migrants who successfully make it to the Canaries usually keep moving, headed for the promise of jobs and safety in mainland Spain or other European countries farther north. But that is not the case for thousands of unaccompanied minors. Under Spanish law, these young migrants must be taken under the wing of the local government, leading to overcrowded shelters and a political crisis. Earlier this year, island leaders fought unsuccessfully to have other regions of Spain share the responsibility. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez recently traveled to three West African countries in an attempt to curb migration. In Senegal, he and President Bassirou Diomaye Faye signed agreements to promote temporary work opportunities in Spain for Senegalese nationals and vocational training in Senegal. They also agreed to step up police cooperation. No magic solutions Current anti-immigrant sentiments notwithstanding, Europe's aging population, declining birth rates and labor shortages have only increased the need for immigrant workers to sustain pensions and boost economic growth. And as long as migrants lack opportunities in their own countries, their exodus will continue. Add to this the growing instability and conflict in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia that have displaced millions. 'There is no magic deterrence,' Le Coz said. 'Migrants end up taking the toll of all of this: They are risking their lives, doing jobs in Europe where they face uncertain legal status for years and are vulnerable to all sorts of exploitation.' While long-term solutions to tackle unauthorized migration are being implemented, such as temporary work programs for migrants, they are still falling short. 'That's one step in the right direction, but this needs to happen at a much larger scale, and they need the private sector to be more involved,' Le Coz added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-politicians-say-migration-is-out-of-control-numbers-tell-a-different-story/7782754.html	2024-09-13T01:48:03-07:00

Rajapaksa clan heir runs for Sri Lanka president after family forced out of power	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — When an uprising ousted Sri Lanka's president, many saw it as the end of his powerful family's hold on the island nation after more than 12 years of rule. Now, as Sri Lanka prepares to elect a new leader, Namal Rajapaksa is running for president. The 38-year-old is the son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the nephew of the ousted President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Namal Rajapaksa is presenting himself as an agent of change, but many see his bid for presidency as an attempt by the controversial political dynasty to regain power. By mid-2022, the clan's political career seemed in ruins. Some of its members were forced into hiding in military camps after angry protesters stormed their residences. Others simply gave up their seats in the government as people blamed them for hurtling the country of more than 20 million people into an economic crisis. Two years later, the family — shunned and pushed to political wilderness — is trying make a comeback via the Rajapaksa heir apparent who is styling himself as someone who could deliver Sri Lanka into a prosperous future. But for Namal Rajapaksa, it's more than just a political choice — it's a deeply personal one. He wants to shed the widespread allegations that the Rajapaksa clan ran the country as a family business that led to the economy crashing in 2022 — as well as the guilty verdict on corruption charges against them. 'The corruption charges are not something common to my family or to myself. If you look at all politicians in this country or in the world, including our region … all have been accused of being corrupt,' Namal told the Associated Press on a recent afternoon. 'People will understand, you know, because if you look at the current stage, everyone is blaming each other.' Sri Lanka was once an economic hope in South Asia, before it plunged into an economic crisis in 2022 when unsustainable debt and the COVID-19 pandemic led to a severe shortage of essentials. The crisis morphed into a popular uprising, with angry street protesters taking over the president's and prime minister's offices and other key buildings, forcing Gotabaya to flee the country and later resign. Many blamed the Rajapaksas. The family still had a big parliamentary majority, and voted Ranil Wickremesinghe to serve the remainder of the presidential term. Wickremesinghe ensured them protection in return for their support to pass laws in Parliament, enabling the clan to mark a return in politics. 'We didn't run away, we never ran away. It's just that some people thought we were hiding,' said Namal. Namal's prospects for a political comeback appear grim, as the main contest appears to be between three other candidates: Wickremesinghe, the parliamentary opposition leader and a left-leaning politician with a powerful alliance. Alan Keenan, senior consultant on Sri Lanka at the International Crisis Group, said the younger Rajapaksa's bid for the presidency is a test run that would establish 'his position as the heir apparent' of the political dynasty. 'I think they [the Rajapaksas] know that Namal will not win. But his candidature effectively reasserts the family's ownership of the party,' Keenan said. The Rajapaksa family has been a mainstay in Sri Lankan politics for decades. They influenced nearly everything — from bureaucracy to courts, police, business and sports. Namal Rajapaksa's father was a prime minister and then a two-term president from 2005 to 2015. Even though Mahinda Rajapaksa was adored by the country's majority Buddhist Sinhalese for defeating the ethnic Tamil separatists after a 26-year bloody civil war, allegations of human rights violations and corruption led to his defeat in 2015. The family, however, returned more powerful four years later, when Mahinda's brother was elected president. Gotabaya Rajapaksa whipped up majority Buddhist Sinhalese sentiments after the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings, blamed on Islamic extremist groups, killed 290 people. But the family's popularity quickly eroded under a tanking economy and alienation among ethnic Tamils, Muslims and other minorities. With hopes to reinvent himself as a young, modern leader removed from his family's tainted past, Namal Rajapaksa's efforts mirror that of his father, who still enjoys considerable support among some voters who credit him for crushing the Tamil separatists. Like his father, Namal Rajapaksa wears the trademark outfit that highlights his Buddhist Sinhalese culture, with a maroon scarf around his neck, a sarong and a white robe. During campaigns he can be seen touching his father's feet in reverence, a practice most locals consider noble. He is also promising to free the island nation from its debt crisis, create more jobs and eradicate corruption by digitizing the administrative systems. Still, many in Sri Lanka are done with the family, and public opposition to Rajapaksa's candidacy is particularly palpable among the Tamil community that makes up about 11% of Sri Lanka's population. The group was crushed in a 2009 government offensive headed by Mahinda and Gotabaya Rajapaksa to end the separatist civil war that broke out in 1983 and left at least 100,000 on both sides, with many more missing. Though not all Tamils were part of or supported the rebel group, their defeat has effectively become a political defeat to the community. They also blame the Rajapaksas for alleged human rights violations against civilians during the war. Vellaiyan Sivaprakash, a Tamil who works as an auditor in central Sri Lanka, said he constantly lived in fear of violence during the Rajapaksa rule and doubted whether he could live in Sri Lanka anymore. 'Their rule was like a monarchy and they behaved like princes and treated us like slaves,' Sivaprakash said. 'They should never come back to power.' Rajapaksas still have a large chunk of supporters who appreciate their role in ending the war and in big infrastructure projects including a road network, an airport and a seaport built on high-interest Chinese loans. Even though many of them believe Namal Rajapaksa has no chance of winning, they are banking on his future prospects. 'I will vote for Namal because I got my job under his father's government. He is still young and one day he can be the president,' said R. M. Lasantha, who works as a pipe fitter at the state-owned petroleum corporation. Some Sri Lankans say it would take the Rajapaksas at least a decade to make a political comeback. 'Their name is associated with corruption and bankruptcy, so rebuilding [their image] is a major challenge,' said Manilal Ranasinghe, who works in the tourism industry. 'At the same time,' Ranasinghe said, 'we know that Sri Lankans have a short memory.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/rajapaksa-clan-heir-runs-for-sri-lanka-president-after-family-forced-out-of-power-/7782716.html	2024-09-12T23:33:26-07:00	
North Korea’s Kim tours uranium enrichment site, calls for more weapons	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea offered a rare glimpse into a secretive facility to produce weapons-grade uranium as state media reported Friday that leader Kim Jong Un visited the area and called for stronger efforts to 'exponentially' increase the number of his nuclear weapons. It's unclear if the site is at the North's main Yongbyon nuclear complex, but it's the North's first disclosure of a uranium-enrichment facility since it showed one at Yongbyon to visiting American scholars in 2010. While the latest unveiling is likely an attempt to apply more pressure on the U.S. and its allies, the images North Korea's media released of the area could provide outsiders with a valuable source of information for estimating the amount of nuclear ingredients that North Korea has produced. During a visit to the Nuclear Weapons Institute and the production base of weapon-grade nuclear materials, Kim expressed 'great satisfaction repeatedly over the wonderful technical force of the nuclear power field' held by North Korea, the official Korean Central News Agency reported. KCNA said that Kim walked around the control room of the uranium enrichment base and a construction site that would expand its capacity for producing nuclear weapons. North Korean state media photos showed Kim being briefed by scientists while walking along long lines of tall gray tubes, but KCNA didn't say when Kim visited the facilities and where they are located. KCNA said Kim stressed the need to further augment the number of centrifuges to 'exponentially increase the nuclear weapons for self-defense,' a goal he has repeatedly stated in recent years. It said Kim ordered officials to push forward the introduction of a new-type centrifuge, which has reached its completion stage. Kim said North Korea needs greater defense and preemptive attack capabilities because anti-North Korea 'nuclear threats perpetrated by the U.S. imperialists-led vassal forces have become more undisguised and crossed the red-line,' KCNA said. South Korea's Unification Ministry said it strongly condemned North Korea's unveiling of a uranium-enrichment facility and Kim's vows to boost his country's nuclear capability. A ministry statement said North Korea's 'illegal' pursuit of nuclear weapons in defiance of U.N. bans is a serious threat to international peace. It said North Korea must realize it cannot win anything with its nuclear program. North Korea first showed a uranium enrichment site in Yongbyon to the outside world in November 2010, when it allowed a visiting delegation of Stanford University scholars led by nuclear physicist, Siegfried Hecker, to tour its centrifuges. North Korean officials then reportedly told Hecker that 2,000 centrifuges were already installed and running at Yongbyon. Satellite images in recent years have indicated North Korea was expanding a uranium enrichment plant at its Yongbyon nuclear complex. Nuclear weapons can be built using either highly enriched uranium or plutonium, and North Korea has facilities to produce both at Yongbyon. It's not clear exactly how much weapons-grade plutonium or highly enriched uranium has been produced at Yongbyon and where North Korea stores it. 'For analysts outside the country, the released images will provide a valuable source of information for rectifying our assumptions about how much material North Korea may have amassed to date,' said Ankit Panda, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'Overall, we should not assume that North Korea will be as constrained as it once was by fissile material limitations. This is especially true for highly enriched uranium, where North Korea is significantly less constrained in its ability to scale up than it is with plutonium,' Panda said. In 2018, Hecker and Stanford University scholars estimated North Korea's highly enriched uranium inventory was 250 to 500 kilograms, sufficient for 25 to 30 nuclear devices. The North Korean photos released Friday showed about 1,000 centrifuges. When operated year-round, they would be able to produce around 20 to 25 kilograms of highly enriched uranium, which would be enough to create a single bomb, according to Yang Uk, a security expert at Seoul's Asan Institute for Policy Studies. The new-type centrifuge Kim wants to introduce is likely an advanced carbon fiber-based one that could allow North Korea to produce five to 10 times more highly enriched uranium than its existing ones, said Lee Choon Geun, an honorary research fellow at South Korea's Science and Technology Policy Institute. Some U.S. and South Korean experts speculate North Korea is covertly running at least one other uranium-enrichment plant. In 2018, a top South Korean official told parliament that North Korea was estimated to have already manufactured up to 60 nuclear weapons. Estimates on how many nuclear bombs North Korea can add every year vary, ranging from six to as many as 18.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-tours-uranium-enrichment-site-calls-for-more-weapons/7782705.html	2024-09-12T22:24:02-07:00	
Pope wraps up Asia-Pacific tour, defies health fears along the way	Singapore — Pope Francis wrapped up an arduous 12-day tour of the Asia-Pacific on Friday, defying health concerns to connect with believers from the jungle of Papua New Guinea to the skyscrapers of Singapore. The 87-year-old pontiff flies home to Rome from Singapore, completing his longest trip in duration and distance since he became head of the world's estimated 1.4 billion Roman Catholics more than 13 years ago. The Argentine pope has relied on a wheelchair since 2022 because of knee pain and sciatica. He had a hernia operation in June 2023, and earlier this year he battled flu and bronchitis. Occasionally, during his four-nation trip, the pope struggled to keep his eyes open when listening to late-night liturgical readings or to remain engaged during formal military parades. But he was clearly energized by more freewheeling exchanges — cheerfully goading young people to shout out their agreement with his calls to help those in need. In a lively final inter-religious meeting with young Singaporeans, the pope urged them to respect other beliefs, avoid being slaves to technology and to get out of their comfort zones. 'Don't let your stomach get fat, but let your head get fat,' the pope said, raising a laugh from his audience. 'I say take risks, go out there,' he said. 'A young person that is afraid and does not take risks is an old person.' The historic tour, initially planned for 2020 but postponed by the COVID-19 pandemic, has included 43 hours of flight time and a distance of 32,000 kilometers. But neither the pace — 16 speeches and up to eight hours of time difference — nor the heat, nor multiple meetings have forced any rescheduling of his international odyssey. On a trip that took him to the outer edges of the church's world, the pope delivered a sometimes uncomfortable message for leaders not to forget the poor and marginalized. In Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority state, he visited the Istiqlal Mosque to deliver a joint message against conflict and climate change. In sweltering Papua New Guinea, he donned a bird of paradise headdress in a remote, jungle village where he told inhabitants to halt violence and renounce 'superstition and magic.' Addressing political and business leaders, he insisted that the country's vast natural resources should benefit the entire community — a demand likely to resound in a nation where many believe their riches are being stolen or squandered. And in staunchly Roman Catholic East Timor, he addressed nearly half the population, drawing about 600,000 rapturous believers in the tropical heat to a celebration of mass on the island's coast. Francis addressed East Timor's leaders, hailing a new era of 'peace' since independence in 2002. But he also called on them to do more to prevent abuse against young people, in a nod to recent Catholic Church child abuse scandals. In the affluent city-state of Singapore, the pope called for 'special attention' to be paid to protecting the dignity of migrant workers. 'These workers contribute a great deal to society and should be guaranteed a fair wage,' he said. There are an estimated 170 million migrant workers around the world. Most live in the Americas, Europe or Central Asia. But the Argentine pope was otherwise full of praise for the 'entrepreneurial spirit' and dynamism that built a 'mass of ultra-modern skyscrapers that seem to rise from the sea' in his final destination. Sandra Ross, 55, a church administrator in Singapore, said she was still 'feeling the warmth and joy' after attending mass led by the pope. 'I was deeply touched by Pope Francis' courage and dedication to his mission, despite his health challenges. His spirit and enthusiasm are truly inspiring,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-wraps-up-asia-pacific-tour-defies-health-fears-along-the-way/7782694.html	2024-09-12T21:35:31-07:00	
US presidential debate resonates across South Asia amid regional news	washington — This week’s U.S. televised debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris broke through an intensely busy news cycle in South Asia to garner attention across most major news outlets. Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi visited the United States. Bangladesh's interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, delivered his second major speech to the nation. And Pakistan suspended security officials over the controversial arrest of lawmakers from Parliament. Despite these significant developments and a nine- to 10-hour time difference from Washington, the pivotal showdown between the two contenders to succeed Joe Biden as U.S. president still drew high interest, underscoring the significance of U.S. electoral politics for the region. 'The news cycle in these countries is so fast and the issues they are dealing with internally are so intense that probably their focus has shifted from what is happening elsewhere,' said Awais Saleem, a former Pakistani journalist who is now a professor at Lamar University in the U.S. state of Texas. 'Nonetheless, [the U.S. election] is still keenly observed and keenly watched, because whatever happens in the U.S. invariably has an effect in other parts of the world, and South Asia is no exception,' Saleem said. India Take India, the region's most populous country and largest media market. Major Indian outlets, such as NDTV and CNN's local affiliate, dedicated significant coverage to the debate, even while prioritizing Gandhi's remarks in Washington. Aaj Tak, another leading channel, had a correspondent reporting on the debate from the spin room in Philadelphia. Large-circulation newspapers provided more substantial coverage, even while relying on international wire services for content. The Times of India, India's largest newspaper, featured a video analysis of the debate on its website. The Hindu, another major paper, ran multiple articles, including one focusing on Trump's pledge to end the Ukraine war and another on Hollywood's 'applause' for Harris. While much of the coverage was routine, some stood out. In addition to broadcasting the debate live, NDTV produced at least 10 stories and segments dedicated to what it termed a 'fiery presidential showdown.' These included highlights, key quotes and major takeaways. While Indians are as divided over Trump and Harris as Americans, most local outlets widely reported on the American media's verdict that Harris had outperformed Trump. Ahead of the debate, many Indians were skeptical of Harris, said Ashutosh, a veteran Indian journalist and co-founder of news outlet Satya Hindi. To find out how Harris did, Satya Hindi devoted a 30-minute segment featuring a U.S.-based Indian American academic, Ashutosh said. The verdict: Harris won the debate. 'There now is a feeling that Kamala Harris is not a weak candidate,' said Ashutosh, who goes by one name. India, like other South Asian countries, lacks an American-style tradition of live election debates. The concept intrigues many but faces cultural and political obstacles, experts say. On Satya Hindi, another guest, journalist Shravan Garg, questioned their feasibility. He asked whether Indian TV channels would 'dare' to host live debates and whether politicians would 'agree' to participate. Atul Singh, founder and editor-in-chief of Fair Observer, an international citizen journalism and civic education platform, said Indian interest in U.S. elections has surged in recent years, spurred by globalization and more recently by the Indian ancestry of Harris and Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance. But he said the level of interest varies across the country. States with stronger ties to the U.S., such as Gujarat, a source of migration to the U.S., and Maharashtra, a manufacturing hub for exports to the U.S., are gripped by U.S. election fever. In more rural regions such as Bihar, with fewer connections to the U.S., enthusiasm is far more subdued. 'So it depends on which part of the country you're in,' Singh said. 'I'd say some areas in India simply don't care, and others, the ones that are part of the global economy, are absolutely obsessed.' Pakistan In neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh, the debate received far less coverage despite comparable public interest. Geo TV, Pakistan's leading TV news channel, ran an international segment on the debate, reporting on the candidates' 'combative demeanor.' A wire story on its website noted that foreign policy 'largely took a backseat.' Leading English language newspaper Dawn highlighted the debate as its top international story, reporting how Harris put Trump 'on the defensive at a combative presidential debate.' A wire fact check about the debate was included among its 'must read stories' on its homepage. Express Tribune, another leading newspaper, picked up multiple wire service stories about the debate, posting three short video compilations on its websites, including a video of viral memes generated by Trump's comment that migrants were eating people's cats and dogs in Ohio. Atif Khan, a Pakistani journalist, said Harris' unexpected emergence as the Democratic nominee helped boost Pakistani public interest in the U.S. presidential election. 'Every political discussion on television now involves a mention of the U.S. election,' Khan said. 'There is talk about Trump. There is talk about Kamala Harris.' While Pakistani media generally don't cover elections in neighboring countries, some local outlets are already planning their U.S. election coverage and trying to secure U.S. visas for their reporters, he said. 'Pakistanis think that a change of president will inevitably have direct implications for not just Pakistan but also the region,' he said. Underscoring the Pakistani media's interest, Saleem, the Lamar University professor, noted receiving weekly invitations from various outlets to discuss the U.S. election campaign. Bangladesh In Bangladesh, the debate's coverage was overshadowed by continuing reverberations from the August 5 collapse of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government. While interim leader Yunus' speech dominated headlines on Wednesday, leading outlets provided more substantive coverage of the debate, drawing on international wire stories and analysis. Prothom Alo, Bangladesh's largest media outlet, called the debate 'the most important moment' before the November 5 election. Daily Star, one of the most reputable outlets, ran at least four stories, including a fact check and a video analysis. Daily Ittefaq, a Bengali language newspaper, ran a summary of U.S. media accounts of the debate, reporting that even the conservative Fox News had declared Harris the winner. Singh, founder of Fair Observer, said the post-Hasina political turmoil in Bangladesh likely contributed to the relatively thin coverage. 'They've got their own fish to fry,' he said. But, he added, political elites in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka – all dependent on International Monetary Fund largesse – are keenly watching the U.S. election campaign. 'They are in economic crisis, so they follow the election for practical reasons,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-presidential-debate-resonates-across-south-asia-amid-regional-news-/7782630.html	2024-09-12T18:52:18-07:00

Pakistan police officer kills blasphemy suspect in custody	quetta/islamabad — A police officer in Pakistan’s southwestern Baluchistan province shot and killed a man Thursday who was being held in custody on blasphemy allegations. The fatal shooting happened inside a highly protected police station in the provincial capital of Quetta, a day after the victim, a Muslim, was arrested for allegedly making derogatory remarks about the Prophet Muhammad. A senior local police officer, Muhammad Baloch, told reporters that they had arrested the policeman involved in the shooting and registered a murder case against him. He did not name the detainee. On Wednesday, witnesses reported that when the blasphemy suspect, Abdul Ali, was taken into custody in the Kharotabad neighborhood, a mob of dozens of residents quickly surrounded the police detention facility and demanded that he be handed over to them so they could kill him. Police officials reported the protesters also had thrown a grenade at the building, but the resulting blast did not cause any casualties. They said the violence forced them to transfer Ali to the police station in the central garrison area of Quetta, where he was fatally shot 'inside the lock-up by an on-duty policeman' on Thursday. Activists of a religious party later prevented Ali’s family from burying him in his hometown of Pishin, about 50 kilometers from Quetta, forcing those attempting to carry out the burial to flee the graveyard along with the body. In Islamabad, the national capital, an Islamic party senator, Abdul Shakoor Khan, while speaking in the upper house of parliament expressed solidarity with the alleged killer. Khan vowed to help get him a lawyer for his legal battle. 'We will not tolerate anyone issuing blasphemous remarks against the Holy Prophet,' Khan said. Blasphemy is a highly sensitive issue in majority-Muslim Pakistan, where mere allegations have led to mobs lynching scores of suspects, even some in police custody. Insulting the Quran or Islamic beliefs is punishable by death under the country's blasphemy laws, though no one has ever been officially executed. Thursday’s killing of a blasphemy suspect in custody by a police officer, however, is the first of its kind in Pakistan. In early June, a 73-year-old Pakistani man from the minority Christian community died in a hospital a week after being violently attacked by a mob following blasphemy accusations in his native Sargodha district in central Punjab province. Days later, on June 20, a Muslim man from Punjab was visiting the scenic Swat Valley in the northwestern Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when a mob violently lynched him for allegedly desecrating Islam's holy book, the Quran. Domestic and international rights groups have long sought reforms in the blasphemy laws, arguing they are often misused to settle personal vendettas or to target Pakistani minority communities. Hundreds of suspects, mostly Muslims, are languishing in jails in Pakistan because of fear of retaliation from religious groups deters judges from moving their trials forward.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-police-officer-kills-blasphemy-suspect-in-custody-/7782586.html	2024-09-12T17:04:49-07:00

Nine charged in police breakup of pro-Palestinian camp at US university	ann arbor, michigan — Authorities have filed charges against nine people who are accused of trespassing or resisting police during the May breakup of a pro-Palestinian camp at the University of Michigan. 'The First Amendment does not provide a cover for illegal activity,' Attorney General Dana Nessel said Thursday, a day after charges were filed in Washtenaw County. The camp on the Diag, known for decades as a site for campus protests, was cleared by police on May 21 after a month. Video posted online showed police using what appeared to be an irritant to spray people, who were forced to retreat. The university said the camp had become a threat to safety, with overloaded power sources and open flames. Nessel said two people were charged with trespassing, a misdemeanor, and seven more people were charged with trespassing as well as resisting police, a felony. Protesters have demanded that the school's endowment stop investing in companies with ties to Israel. But the university insists it has no direct investments and less than $15 million placed with funds that might include companies in Israel. That's less than 0.1% of the total endowment. U.S. Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Detroit Democrat who supports the protesters, said the charges were 'frivolous' and a 'shameful attack' on the rights of students. Separately, Nessel said state prosecutors charged two people for alleged acts during a counterdemonstration on April 25, a few days after the camp was created. Nessel said authorities still were investigating spring protests at the homes of elected members of the university's governing board.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nine-charged-in-police-breakup-of-pro-palestinian-camp-at-us-university/7782191.html	2024-09-12T16:11:53-07:00	
Zimbabwe proposes culling elephants to address food shortages, reduce effects of drought	Harare, Zimbabwe — Zimbabwe's government said Thursday it is considering a proposal to cull its elephant population to address food shortages and reduce the effects of an El Nino-induced drought. 'Zimbabwe has more elephants than our forests can accommodate,' said Sithembiso Nyoni, Zimbabwe's minister of environment, climate, and wildlife. 'We are having a discussion with ZimParks [Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority] and some communities to do like what Namibia has done, so that we can cull the elephants and mobilize the women to maybe dry the meat, package it, and ensure that it gets to some communities that need the protein.' Zimbabwe is one the five countries in southern Africa that the World Food Programme said has been hit hard by El Nino drought, leaving millions of people food-insecure. The proposal to cull elephants in Zimbabwe follows Namibia's recently announced plans to cull 723 wild animals — including 83 elephants — to mitigate the effects of the drought and distribute the meat to communities facing food shortages. Much as Namibia's decision attracted condemnation from conservationists, Zimbabwe's proposal to cull elephants will paint the country in a bad light, said Farai Maguwu of the Center for Natural Resource Governance. 'Elephants are protected by international conventions, such as CITES [the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]. They are in a world heritage,' said Maguwu. 'So, one does not just decide to say, 'I want to slaughter them.' They are not like goats, which a person can just say, 'I want to slaughter a goat and feed my family.' There are rules and procedures.' Maguwu said officials in Harare have long fought to change those rules. 'Zimbabwe has always been pushing for the right to kill elephants,' said Maguwu. 'We all know when you look at how our natural resources are being plundered right now, like minerals, the whole idea is to sell ivory. It's not even about the communities there.' Maguwu also said that 'there is a lot that government can do to cushion the people from the impacts of drought rather than killing elephants. I think they should stop that move.' Zimbabwe said it has about 100,000 elephants against its carrying capacity of about 45,000 and has not been able to sell some of the jumbos because of CITES. Minister Nyoni said Zimbabwe's culling would fall within the confines of the country's law. 'If Zimbabwe had a way, we would sell our elephants for ivory yesterday,' said Nyoni. 'The people who prevent us from selling our ivory are people who have already finished and killed off their own animals. They don't have elephants. And they don't have the experience of this human wildlife conflict that we are facing. And those are people who influence the decision of CITES. So, it is a problem that Zimbabwe is facing. … There is a thinking that we move out of CITES and then do our own thing. There are consequences for doing that. Zimbabwe would like to be independent; we would like to take charge of our own animals. But we can't because we are part of the global village.' Nyoni added that Zimbabwe would continue to negotiate with other CITES members so that Harare is allowed to trade in ivory and elephants by CITES. Efforts to reach CITES for comment did not yield results Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drought-hit-zimbabwe-plans-to-cull-elephants-amid-backlash/7782058.html	2024-09-12T14:28:53-07:00	
VOA interview: Chairman speaks on Republicans' Afghan withdrawal report	WASHINGTON — U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul’s office recently released detailed findings of an investigation into the chaotic August 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which has been criticized for poor planning. Speaking with Saba Shah Khan of VOA’s Urdu Service, McCaul, a Republican from Texas, denied that the latest probe is a 'political exercise' that coincides with a tight presidential race. He said its purpose is to ensure that 'an evacuation will never happen like this again.' On Tuesday, the committee's ranking Democrat, Representative Gregory Meeks from New York, issued a statement criticizing the report as a collection of 'cherry-picked witness testimony' that excludes 'anything unhelpful to a predetermined, partisan narrative about the Afghanistan withdrawal.' 'The Majority did not involve the Minority in this report, nor have they even provided a draft copy to us,' he wrote. In the following interview, McCaul accuses White House officials of 'stonewalling' the investigation and mentions his September 3 decision to subpoena Secretary of State Antony Blinken for testimony even though findings of the full report were released Monday. 'We’re still not finished with the investigation,' McCaul told VOA on Tuesday. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller last week issued a statement to The Hill stating that Blinken was unable to testify on the dates requested and offered 'reasonable alternatives' to comply with McCaul's request. The following has been edited for length and clarity. VOA: Why is the Foreign Affairs Committee report on U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan being released now? With less than two months left to Election Day, some would say the report is politically driven. U.S. Representative Michael McCaul: It's been three years since the ... chaotic evacuation. The first year, the majority — at that time, the Democrats — did nothing to investigate. So, I've had two years to put this very comprehensive, complete, historic account of what happened together. In the meantime, we served many subpoenas. We've had to threaten contempt proceedings. And I would have liked to have had this done a year ago. The administration has been, you know, stonewalling us and slowing down the delivery of the report. In fact, we're still not finished with the investigation. VOA: In light of the report, what do you think the Biden administration could have done differently to avoid the chaos and mayhem that unfolded during the withdrawal? McCaul: That’s one of the key takeaways here. The military is on the ground doing their job. That's to pull out by July [as dictated by a predetermined date of withdrawal negotiated by the prior administration]. The intelligence community sees what's happening. They report this information. It gets a little bit manipulated when it gets to the higher level. And then it is amplified that everything's fine in Afghanistan, when, in fact, on the ground, the conditions are getting very bad. The State Department is required by law to come out with an evacuation plan called the NEO [Noncombatant Evacuation Operations]. They kept resisting this because they thought evacuation means failure. So, they wait until the very day that the Taliban is overrunning Kabul before they finally initiate an evacuation plan. That is why it was so chaotic. That is why the 13 servicemen and women were left behind — with Taliban, by the way — to work with them to help Afghans get out. VOA: The report says that [President Joe] Biden kept Zalmay Khalilzad on as special representative [for Afghanistan reconciliation from September 2018 to October 2021], making it clear Biden embraced the [February 2020] Doha Accord. Sir, was that a good decision? McCaul: The complaint I had — and Zal and I, you know, I've known him for a long time, and I have respect for him — but he did not include the Afghan government in the Doha talks. So, it was just between Zal Khalilzad and the Taliban. That sent a terrible message to the Afghan government. They felt like they were sidelined. ... The Doha Agreement had conditions. Most important is the Taliban cannot hit U.S. forces. They were continuing to do that. But according to President Biden's press guy [former State Department spokesperson Ned Price], Doha was 'immaterial' as to the evacuation. He was going to go to zero — that means zero troops, zero contractors, zero air power — one way or the other. That was going to happen. He made that decision on day one. VOA: The [Doha] negotiations and the decision to leave Afghanistan was made during the Trump administration. Chairman, do you think.... McCaul: ... that isn’t accurate, because the Taliban were in violation of the Doha conditions. Twenty-five hundred troops were left on the ground — General [Kenneth] McKenzie and [Mark] Milly said that was sufficient to stabilize, along with 6,500 NATO and air power and contractors. That they could stabilize both Bagram and HKIA [Hamid Karzai International Airport] when it went to zero. That's when it changed. VOA: The date of withdrawal was decided by the Trump administration… McCaul: ... if conditions were met, which they weren't ... VOA: ... do you think that it is fair to hold the Biden administration solely responsible for the failure? McCaul: And we don't. We actually fault Zal Khalilzad. We list a lot of top D.O.D. [Department of Defense] and State Department officials that Congress, in a resolution, will condemn for their actions. Zal Khalilzad, he's a dear friend, but by not letting the Afghan government participate — to me, that was a major error. And a lot of this, by not executing a plan of action to get out and evacuate, according to the top generals and the intelligence community, was the fatal flaw, leaving behind Americans, Afghan allies, and most importantly, the women. VOA: The report also says that the U.S. did not keep track of whether the Taliban were following the Doha Agreement. In your opinion, how could the U.S. have made Taliban comply? McCaul: In my opinion, they were in violation at the time the president made the decision to go to zero. But according to his press spokesperson, that was immaterial to the withdrawal. It was going to happen one way or the other. What people don't understand is it's not just the military being pulled out, it's the air cover, it's the contractors. When everything is pulled out, the Afghan army was virtually defenseless. VOA: It is also said in the report that Afghanistan is a hotbed of terrorist activities. Can U.S. leave Taliban to their doings? And what is the way forward? McCaul: It’s very, very dangerous. I was the chairman of Homeland Security Committee. What we're seeing now, and we saw it before, is the Haqqani [network and] Taliban protecting Zawahiri, [the] number two Al-Qaeda [figure], who was taken by drone strike not too long after the evacuation. We know that they were collaborating — ISIS-K and Taliban — because United States is a common enemy. Most disturbingly is Bagram, the prisons in Bagram. They [the Taliban] released thousands of ISIS prisoners that have now gone to the Khorasan region — that's Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan — [for] external operations. Just recently, the FBI indicated to us that eight of them have been detained in the United States coming across the southwest border. ... So, when Americans think Afghanistan is some faraway, distant land, it is all interconnected and it does threaten the homeland. VOA: What is the way forward? What do you think the U.S. strategy should be to handle this? McCaul: Number one, we don't want to see this happen again. This was not a political exercise for me. As a [former] federal prosecutor, I just wanted to get to the facts and the evidence, wherever that took me. I didn’t have conclusions in advance. ... So, to answer your question, we want to propose a new way to do this legislatively, through Congress, so that an evacuation will never happen like this again. Saigon was bad. This is worse. VOA: The report quotes a study that 118 girls were sold as child brides in Afghanistan, in a village. And, in the same village, 116 parents are waiting for a buyer. So, my question to you is that it seems like there is no hope for women and girls in Afghanistan. What is your suggestion? And what can the U.S do? McCaul: I mean, can you imagine being 25 years old as a woman and never lived under Sharia law, and now you have to go backwards to the stone age? And that's essentially what has happened there. I got four busloads of the American School of Music girls out through Abbey Gate, because I knew the Taliban — the way they feel about women and music — their days would be numbered. Now, it's very difficult. Do you normalize the Taliban? Do you treat them as a foreign terrorist organization? I think any aid or assistance we give to Afghanistan has to be conditioned on treatment of women and children. And they should be allowed to go to school, they should be allowed to go outside their homes, they should not be beaten. Just fundamental rights.

Exclusive interview: US boosts diplomacy, security support in Somalia	MOGADISHU, SOMALIA/WASHINGTON — In an exclusive interview, U.S. Ambassador to Somalia Richard Riley shed light on the ongoing diplomatic efforts and security challenges facing the East African nation, including U.S. efforts to find a peaceful diplomatic solution to the ongoing dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia. Somalia and Ethiopia have been in a dispute that was ignited at the beginning of this year when Ethiopia signed a memorandum of understanding, or MoU, with the breakaway region of Somaliland — a deal Somalia sees as an infringement on its sovereignty. The agreement gives Ethiopia leasing rights to a large portion of the Red Sea coastline in Somaliland. During the interview conducted at the U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu, Riley, who was sworn in to his post in May, shared with VOA his insights on the U.S. commitment to finding peaceful resolutions and supporting the Somali government in combating terrorism. Diplomatic resolution 'We are very much aware and working collaboratively to make sure there is a diplomatic resolution of this current situation,' he said. 'It is an unfortunate situation, very disruptive, and started ... with this MoU between Somaliland and Ethiopia. Of course, we do not recognize it, and we are trying to solve it through diplomatic channels.' Turkey, a key Somali partner, has been trying to mediate the dispute between the neighboring countries, holding two rounds of talks in Ankara that ended without an agreement. The Ethiopian and Somali foreign ministers who represented their countries at the meeting did not hold direct talks. Turkey’s foreign minister shuttled between them. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan described the talks at the time as 'candid, cordial and forward-looking.' Abdi Aynte, a former Somali minister of planning and international cooperation who was involved in the negotiations, said the only thing the two sides agreed upon was to reconvene on September 17. 'The core issue remains Ethiopia’s refusal to annul the MoU with Somaliland, which is Somalia’s position, and if Ethiopia continues to insist on its position of not withdrawing from the MoU, I think there is nothing to expect from any talks between the two countries,' Aynte said. Another analyst who spoke with VOA earlier this year, Cameron Hudson, who is a researcher at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, questioned the United States’ commitment and ability to quell tensions in the volatile region. Riley said he is hopeful, though, that a solution may come from the third round of talks in Turkey. 'There are negotiations ongoing,' he said. Concerns about potential conflict Fears have been growing in Somalia that the boiling tensions could turn into an armed conflict between Ethiopian soldiers currently stationed in Somalia and Somalis. Riley said such confrontation is 'unacceptable.' 'No one can accept there would be any kind of conflict, much less war,' he said. 'That is why everybody in the international community is working nonstop. We certainly are, from the United States and from Washington, to find the proper resolution of this conflict between Ethiopia and Somalia. This is absolutely needed. It is needed soon very quickly, and you have the full power and support, Somalia does, to make sure there is a proper diplomatic solution.' Ethiopian troops became part of the African Union mission, known as ATMIS, in Somalia in January 2012. Under the mission, at least 3,000 Ethiopian soldiers officially operate as part of an AU peacekeeping mission fighting al-Shabab. An additional 5,000 to 7,000 Ethiopian soldiers are stationed in several regions under a bilateral agreement. Last month, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 2748, which allows ATMIS troops to stay in Somalia through December 2024. Somalia says all Ethiopian troops should be out of the country by the end of 2024, especially after the expiration of ATMIS. Somali Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre said last month that Ethiopian forces would not be part of the upcoming African Union Support Mission in Somalia, or AUSSOM, unless Ethiopia withdraws from the controversial memorandum of understanding. Commitment to Somalia’s security Riley said the U.S. is Somalia’s largest donor and security partner, providing tens of billions of dollars over the years in personnel, equipment and funding. 'The United States, for example, just forgave over $1 million of Somali sovereign debt,' he said. He added that the U.S. will extend full support to any mission whose objective is to make Somalia a peaceful place. 'We absolutely have always strongly supported the current ATMIS force here. We are very grateful to the troop-contributing countries, who have provided very brave personnel for many years to assist the federal government to bring stability and security here,' Riley said. 'We are looking forward to this transition so that it is a proper one, it is well organized, and it is efficient, and it does the job. That is the main issue to make sure that the mandate of the follow-on force under AUSSOM will be suited to the need.' Two urgent issues He said there are imperative challenges in Somalia that the U.S. wants to help the country handle. 'There are two immediate urgencies: to ensure that the Somali National Army and armed forces, including the police, receive all the resources they need to fight against horrific terrorist groups like al-Shabab and ISIS,' he said. 'The other challenge is to ensure that the economy of Somalia continues to grow, with more investment and connectivity to international markets. Somalia needs both physical and economic security.'

Report: Iran boosts ties with criminal networks to attack critics in US, Europe		https://www.voanews.com/a/report-iran-increases-ties-with-criminal-networks-to-attack-critics-in-us-europe-/7781915.html	2024-09-12T11:25:05-07:00	
US Attorney General says he won't let Justice Department be used as political weapon	WASHINGTON — Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday he will not allow the Justice Department 'to be used as a political weapon,' as he denounced 'conspiracy theories' and 'dangerous falsehoods' targeting federal law enforcement. Speaking to U.S. attorneys gathered in Washington and other Justice Department members, Garland forcefully defended the department's integrity and impartiality against claims of politicization by Republicans. Garland said norms protecting the department from political interference matter 'now more than ever.' 'Our norms are a promise that we will not allow this department to be used as a political weapon. And our norms are a promise that we will not allow this nation to become a country where law enforcement is treated as an apparatus of politics,' Garland said to applause in the Great Hall at Justice Department headquarters. Garland's comments come amid an onslaught of attacks from Republicans, who claim the Justice Department has been politically weaponized to go after former President Donald Trump. Trump was indicted in two separate criminal cases by special counsel Jack Smith, who Garland brought in from outside the department to run the investigations. Trump has vowed if returned to the White House in November to 'completely overhaul' what he has described as the 'corrupt Department of Injustice.' He has also threatened to jail those 'involved in unscrupulous behavior' this election, writing in a recent post on X that they will face 'long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again.' Garland did not mention Trump or Republicans in his speech. But he condemned what he described as 'outrageous' attacks he says put law enforcement in harm's way. 'These attacks have come in the form of conspiracy theories, dangerous falsehoods, efforts to bully and intimidate career public servants by repeatedly and publicly singling them out, and threats of actual violence,' Garland said. 'Through your continued work, you have made clear that the Justice Department will not be intimidated by these attacks.' Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly used social media to go after Smith and other prosecutors as well as the judges handling his cases. Republicans have also falsely claimed that the New York criminal case, in which Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts in May, was orchestrated by Democratic President Joe Biden and the Justice Department. Garland came into office pledging to restore the department's reputation for political independence after four tumultuous years under Trump. But he has faced an onslaught of criticism over his department's handling of politically sensitive cases, including the prosecution of Biden's son Hunter, who pleaded guilty last week to federal tax charges in a case brought by a different special counsel. Garland said that department employees have made clear through their work that they 'do not bend to politics' and that they 'will not break under pressure.' 'We must treat like cases alike,' Garland said, adding. 'There is not one rule for friends and another for foes, one rule for the powerful and another for the powerless, one rule for the rich and another for the poor, one rule for Democrats and another for Republicans, or different rules depending on one's race or ethnicity. 'To the contrary, we have only one rule: we follow the facts and apply the law in a way that respects the Constitution and protects civil liberties.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-attorney-general-says-he-won-t-let-justice-department-be-used-as-political-weapon/7781869.html	2024-09-12T11:19:23-07:00	
China tries to reshape Tibet, Xinjiang narratives with new propaganda efforts	Taipei, Taiwan — Chinese authorities have rolled out new propaganda efforts aimed at countering Western narratives about the human rights situation in the northwest Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and Tibet. In recent weeks, they have continued to invite foreign vloggers to visit Xinjiang, home to millions of Uyghur people, a majority Muslim ethnic minority group. Also this month, China inaugurated an international communication center to produce content portraying some 'positive developments' in Tibet, such as Tibetan people’s growing income. Since 2017, the United States, United Nations, European Parliament and rights organizations have condemned China for interning up to 1 million Uyghurs, forcing hundreds of thousands of Uyghur women to go through abortion or sterilization, and forcing Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang to work in factories, which prompted the United States to pass the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act in 2021. In Tibet, human rights organizations and Western countries, including the U.S., have accused the Chinese government of erasing the Tibetan language and culture through compulsory Chinese language education for Tibetan children, forcing hundreds of thousands of rural Tibetans to relocate to urban areas and replacing the name 'Tibet' with the Romanized Chinese name 'Xizang' in official documents. Taiwan said on September 5 it knows of reports China has been recruiting Taiwanese influencers to visit Xinjiang and help promote a more positive narrative about the region through their videos. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, which oversees cross-strait exchanges, said it was still looking into the recent surge of Xinjiang-related content produced by Taiwanese influencers and urged them to avoid violating an anti-infiltration law by accepting payment from Beijing. Taiwanese Youtuber Potter Wang claimed in June that the Chinese government had been inviting Taiwanese influencers on paid trips to China to produce content. His claims prompted several Taiwanese YouTubers who have recently published videos about Xinjiang to deny receiving payment from Beijing. In response to warnings from Taiwanese authorities, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said Beijing welcomed 'Taiwan compatriots' to visit China and enjoy 'the magnificent mountains and rivers, taste the various kinds of food, experience the local customs, and share what they have seen and heard.' Apart from inviting Taiwanese influencers to visit Xinjiang, Beijing has been inviting foreign journalists and vloggers to visit Xinjiang since the start of 2024. In several reports, China’s state-run tabloid Global Times said these foreigners learned about 'Xinjiang's latest economic achievements, religious freedom, and ethnic integration' following visits to local industry, religious venues and residential homes. Some experts say Chinese authorities usually impose tight control over foreign influencers’ itineraries in Xinjiang to ensure the content they produce is aligned with the positive narrative that Beijing aims to promote, which is contrary to existing foreign media reports about mass internment of Uyghurs, forced labor of ethnic minorities or harsh birth control programs. 'Foreign influencers usually spend time in Xinjiang’s capital, Urumqi, and visit places like the Grand Bazaar, where they will try local food and watch dance performances that could seem to suggest that cultural forms of the Uyghur people are protected,' said Timothy Grose, a professor of China Studies at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Indiana. In addition to showcasing aspects of Uyghur culture, Grose said, foreign influencers’ Xinjiang videos will often portray Uyghurs being employed and local signs containing Chinese and Uyghur characters. 'Beijing believes this is an effective strategy [to counter existing international narratives about Xinjiang] if they are indirectly controlling the types of pictures that are exported out of Xinjiang,' he told VOA by phone. By flooding social media platforms with Xinjiang content produced by these foreign influencers, Grose said, the Chinese government is trying to reach and influence casual viewers, especially younger audiences, with no deep knowledge about China or Xinjiang. 'These casual viewers don’t have expertise in China, so they won’t know where to find signs of oppression in the videos since they are unfamiliar with the Uyghur culture or China’s ethnic policy,' he said. Since China is directly or indirectly filling social media platforms with content aligned with their preferred narrative for Xinjiang, Grose said, it will be difficult for academics, activists, and journalists to counter Beijing’s propaganda efforts with content that reflects the reality in the region. Telling the Tibet stories Beijing has also launched a new initiative to 'tell the Tibet story well.' On September 2, several local and central Chinese government agencies inaugurated an 'international communication center' in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, that aims to enhance Beijing’s ability to promote its preferred narratives about Tibet. During a roundtable event focusing on 'building a more effective international communication system for Tibet-related issues,' French writer Margot Chevestrier, who works for China’s state-run China International Communications Group, said that many young Chinese people are affected by 'biased reporting' on global social media and that these misunderstandings often stem from 'misleading reporting by some media or individuals.' The new international communication center will 'enable more people at home and abroad to know Tibet, understand Tibet, and love Tibet,' according to China’s state-run China News, an online news website. Some analysts say the communication center may serve as a centralized institution to 'coordinate' Beijing’s propaganda efforts focusing on Tibet. 'Since there doesn’t seem to be as much propaganda efforts on Tibet as on Xinjiang, Beijing might be thinking how they can use this tactic,' said Sarah Cook, an independent researcher on China and former China research director at nonprofit organization Freedom House. Cook said the amount of propaganda effort that China dedicated to Xinjiang and Tibet shows that these two issues are of a high priority for Beijing. 'While Tibet and Xinjiang are their priorities, the tactics that the Chinese propaganda apparatus deploys are similar, including spreading disinformation through fake accounts, restricting foreign journalists’ access to certain places, and suppressing information that contradicts their preferred narrative,' she told VOA by phone. Since its propaganda efforts have been seemingly successful, Grose said, Beijing will continue to employ the same set of strategies to challenge existing facts about the situation in Xinjiang and Tibet. To push back against Beijing’s campaigns, he said, Xinjiang and Tibet-focused groups should try to increase their presence on social media platforms and create more 'captivating and moving' visual content that is 'properly contextualized' but can influence young audiences. Additionally, Cook said it’s important for individuals concerned about the situation in Tibet and Xinjiang to work with like-minded research groups and expose the different propaganda campaigns that China is pushing. 'They can try to produce short videos informing people of Beijing’s tactics,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-tries-to-reshape-tibet-xinjiang-narratives-with-new-propaganda-efforts/7781836.html	2024-09-12T11:10:15-07:00	
US imposes sanctions on Cambodian tycoon over scam centers	washington — The United States announced sanctions on Thursday on Cambodian businessman and ruling party senator Ly Yong Phat as well as several entities over alleged abuses related to workers who were trafficked and forced to work in online scam centers. The move comes at a delicate phase in relations between the United States and Cambodia, which has moved ever closer to Washington's strategic rival China despite U.S. efforts to woo its new leader Hun Manet, son of longtime strongman Hun Sen. Ly Yong Phat was appointed Hun Sen’s personal adviser in 2022. The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control said the sanctions targeted Ly's L.Y.P. Group Co. conglomerate and O-Smach Resort. It said it was also sanctioning Cambodia-based Garden City Hotel, Koh Kong Resort, and Phnom Penh Hotel for being owned or controlled by Ly. Bradley Smith, the Treasury's acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said the move was made to 'hold accountable those involved in human trafficking and other abuses, while also disrupting their ability to operate investment fraud schemes that target countless unsuspecting individuals, including Americans.' Cambodia and other countries in Southeast Asia have emerged in recent years as the epicenter of a multibillion-dollar criminal industry targeting victims across the world with fraudulent crypto and other schemes, often operating from fortified compounds run by Chinese syndicates and staffed by trafficked workers. The Treasury statement said scammers leverage fictitious identities and elaborate narratives to develop trusted relationships and deceive victims. In many cases, this involves convincing victims to invest in virtual currency, or in some cases, over-the-counter foreign exchange schemes, it said. The statement said traffickers force victims to work up to 15 hours a day and, in some cases, 'resell' victims to other scam operations or subject them to sex trafficking. It noted that the U.S. State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report this year highlighted abuses in O’Smach and Koh Kong and that official complicity in trafficking crimes remained widespread, resulting in selective and often politically motivated enforcement of laws. Americans have been targeted by many of the scams. In 2022, in the U.S alone, victims reported losses of $2.6 billion from pig butchering – a type of long-term scam – and other crypto fraud, more than double the previous year, according to the FBI. The Treasury reportsaid that for more than two years the O-Smach Resort has been investigated by police and publicly reported on 'for extensive and systemic serious human rights abuse.' It said victims reported being lured there with false employment opportunities, having phones and passports confiscated upon arrival and being forced to work scam operations. 'People who called for help reported being beaten, abused with electric shocks, made to pay a hefty ransom, or threatened with being sold to other online scam gangs,' it said, adding that there had been two reports of victims jumping to their death from buildings within the resort. The report said local authorities had conducted repeated rescue missions, including in October 2022 and March 2024, freeing victims of various nationalities, including Chinese, Indian, Indonesian, Malaysian, Singaporean, Thai and Vietnamese. The U.S state department said in June that Cambodian government officials were complicit in trafficking and that some officials owned facilities used by scam operators. Spokespeople for Cambodia's government and foreign ministry did not answer phone calls or respond to messages seeking comment when asked about the sanctions. The U.S. and other governments have repeatedly engaged with Cambodia to put an end to the scam centers. Washington had considered sanctions for months, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters. They said the decision was initially expected earlier this year but had been delayed. A change of leadership to West Point-educated Hun Manet last year was seen by U.S. officials as an opportunity to mend ties with Cambodia, but despite U.S. efforts, its ties with China have steadily grown. Beijing sent warships to Cambodia this year and is backing the expansion of a key naval base.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-sanctions-on-cambodian-tycoon-over-scam-centers/7781840.html	2024-09-12T11:07:00-07:00	
Biden to host Quad summit in Delaware	White House — President Joe Biden will host his second and final Quad leaders’ summit in his home state of Delaware on September 21, the White House announced Thursday. Biden is planning to host the three other leaders of the group, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan. The summit will be held on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, happening concurrently in New York. The leaders are expected to enhance cooperation including the existing Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, a key initiative aimed at countering China’s aggression in the South China Sea. 'The Quad Leaders Summit will focus on bolstering the strategic convergence among our countries, advancing our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, and delivering concrete benefits for partners in the Indo-Pacific in key areas,' said White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre in a statement Thursday. Biden hosted the first Quad leaders’ summit at the White House in 2021. The group has since met twice more in person in Japan. In a reflection of the importance of the group, Biden has hosted all the leaders for subsequent state visits at the White House. India was scheduled to host this year, but the four leaders agreed that New Delhi will instead do so in 2025. 'President Biden’s visit to India in September 2023 for the G20 summit meant that it was difficult for him to return to India in January 2024, on the sidelines of India’s Republic Day in January 2024, as per India’s original planning,' said Aparna Pande, director of the Hudson Institute’s Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia. Both India and the U.S. then became caught up in their own electoral cycles, making travel and summit-hosting respectively challenging, Pande told VOA. With Biden and Kishida set to leave office, the Wilmington summit will be the last gathering of the current leaders. Whoever wins the U.S. November election, whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump, will be invited to the Delhi summit next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-host-quad-summit-in-delaware/7781833.html	2024-09-12T10:50:21-07:00	
Report: IS-Somalia becomes financial hub; leader could be top IS chief	Nairobi, Kenya — The International Crisis Group says Islamic State in Somalia has become an important financial influence for terrorism, and a report suggests the leader of the branch might become the new overall head of the militant group. IS-Somalia is not as active on the battlefield as its local counterpart, the al-Qaida-linked terror group al-Shabab, which controls large parts of southern and central Somalia, but it is building relations with other IS branches, the International Crisis Group said in a report released Thursday. In addition, the report says, IS-Somalia is able to finance terror operations in other African countries. Omar Mahmood, a senior researcher with the International Crisis Group, or ICG, said IS-Somalia plays a bigger role outside Somalia than al-Shabab does. 'Al-Shabab is by far and away a bigger threat,' Mahmood said. 'But at the same time, Islamic State Somalia has, one, persisted despite some significant odds against it. And two, it's carved out a role for itself within the wider Islamic State network, particularly when it comes to serving as a financial hub between some of the affiliates and other parts of the Islamic State.' The ICG said the Islamic State restructured its African operations in 2020, placing affiliates from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mozambique under the watch of IS headquarters in Somalia’s Puntland region. IS-Somalia is reported to have between 100 and 400 fighters stationed in the northern part of the country. According to ICG, about half of the fighters are believed to be foreigners. Early this year, Puntland authorities arrested six Islamic State members who were Moroccans; they were later deported. According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, since May of this year, the group has been increasingly active and has waged several attacks against security forces and business centers. IS-Somalia has also increased its activities in the port city of Bosaso and its surroundings, carrying out an extortion racket that it uses to support its fighters and activities. Richard Tuta, a Kenyan counterterrorism expert, said Somalia’s weak central government has enabled Somalia to be the financial hub of the IS group. 'Somalia ... does not have strong institutions, so it's easy for such institutions to be compromised,' Tuta said. 'It's easy to undertake both illegal and legal ways of fundraising towards terrorism activity. And because of the country's strategic location, it has a porous border, surrounded by an ocean, which is very hard to keep [under] surveillance.' In May, the U.S. carried out airstrikes in Somalia targeting IS leader Abdulqadir Mumin. Mumin survived. Mahmood said that if Mumin becomes the overall head of Islamic State, his rise would signal the group's growing influence in Africa. 'Now whether he's actually the head of the movement is something that's disputed,' Mahmood said. 'There's a couple other figures that are thrown out there as well. And so that's a bit uncertain. It would be quite a big jump ... for the Islamic State to designate someone on the African continent, but it would also symbolize the growing role of Islamic State within ... the African continent.' Puntland authorities have arrested dozens of IS members in the Bari region. Some have been handed jail terms. Others were executed for their involvement in terror activities and the deaths of civilians or government security forces. The ICG called for cooperation between the Somali government in Mogadishu and Puntland regional authorities to tackle IS-Somalia and urged outside actors to pay closer attention to the group’s activities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-is-somalia-becomes-financial-hub-leader-could-be-top-is-chief/7781793.html	2024-09-12T10:20:15-07:00	
New York City police commissioner to resign after his phone was seized in federal investigation	new york — New York City Police Commissioner Edward Caban said he would resign Thursday, one week after it emerged that his phone was seized as part of a federal investigation that touched several members of Mayor Eric Adams' inner circle. Caban said he made the decision to resign after the 'news around recent developments' had 'created a distraction for our department,' according to an email to the police department obtained by The Associated Press. 'I am unwilling to let my attention be on anything other than our important work, or the safety of the men and women of the NYPD,' he added. It was not immediately clear who will replace Caban as police commissioner. Inquiries to the police department were not returned. Caban was one of several high-ranking city officials whose electronic devices were seized last week by federal investigators, according to people familiar with the matter. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation. The subject of the investigation, which is being led by U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, remains unclear. It was not immediately clear whether federal authorities were seeking information linked to one investigation or several. Federal authorities are also investigating Caban's twin brother, James Caban, who runs a nightclub security business, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person could not publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Edward Caban, 57, had been in charge of the nation's largest police department for about 15 months. Of Puerto Rican heritage, he was the first Latino to lead the 179-year-old NYPD. Other officials whose devices were recently seized include First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright; Philip Banks, the deputy mayor for public safety; his brother David Banks, the city's schools chancellor; and Timothy Pearson, a mayoral adviser and former high-ranking NYPD official. The searches added to a flurry of investigative activity around Adams' administration and his campaign. Adams, a first-term Democrat, was subpoenaed in July, eight months after federal agents seized his cell phones and an iPad while he was leaving an event in Manhattan. Federal authorities haven't publicly accused him or any officials of any crimes, and Adams has denied any wrongdoing. The investigation that led to Caban's devices being seized is not believed to be tied to a probe that led federal investigators to seize Adams' devices last November, according to two people familiar with the matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. On Tuesday, Adams acknowledged that the sudden increase in federal scrutiny had 'raised a lot of questions and a lot of concerns.' Caban joined the department as a patrol officer in 1991 in the Bronx, where he grew up. His father, retired Detective Juan Caban, had served with Adams, a former police captain, when they were both on the city's transit police force. Three of Caban's brothers were also police officers. Caban worked in precincts across the city, rising to sergeant, lieutenant, captain, executive officer, commanding officer, deputy inspector and inspector. He was the department's first deputy commissioner, second-in-command, before being named commissioner last year. Caban replaced Keechant Sewell, the first woman to lead the force. She resigned 18 months into a tenure clouded by speculation that she was not truly in control of the department after Adams appointed ex-NYPD chief Philip Banks as his deputy mayor of public safety. She is now the senior vice president of security and guest experience for the New York Mets. From January 1 to September 1, the department tallied 243 murders, compared with 279 in the same period last year. Burglary, grand larceny and auto thefts were also down. At the same time, there was a 17.8% spike in reported hate crimes, 11.1% jump in rapes and smaller increases in some other categories. Caban was also criticized for his handling of officer discipline. In April, he declined to take any internal department disciplinary action against two involved in the fatal 2019 shooting of a Black man, Kawaski Trawick, inside his Bronx apartment. Caban said the officers 'acted within the law' and that the city's police watchdog agency waited too long to bring administrative charges. In August, Caban upheld a department administrative trial judge's recommendation to drop a disciplinary case against Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey, who was accused of ordering officers to void the November 2021 arrest of a retired officer who previously worked for him. The trial judge, Rosemarie Maldonado, said the watchdog agency didn't have jurisdiction to investigate the case.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-city-police-commissioner-to-resign-after-his-phone-was-seized-in-federal-investigation-/7781789.html	2024-09-12T10:17:02-07:00

Six months on, key measures languish in Pacific Islands pact with US	WASHINGTON — More than six months after a crucial security deal between Washington and some Pacific Island nations was signed into law, key features of the Compacts of Free Association have not been implemented, raising questions in the region about U.S. commitment to its Pacific partners in the face of an increasingly assertive Beijing. In March, the passage of the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA, extended $7 billion in economic aid over 20 years to three Pacific Island nations: Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands. Additionally, COFA says Washington provides for their defense and can deny China access to their territorial waters, a maritime area larger than the continental United States. Since then, however, some parts of the deal have yet to be implemented, including services and health benefits for veterans who live on the islands. Currently, veterans must travel to nearby islands such as Guam or as far away as Hawaii to get the help they need. 'The Biden-Harris administration has failed' to deliver veterans services to these Pacific Island nations, said Arkansas Republican Bruce Westerman, who is chair of the U.S. House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee, during an oversight hearing on COFA this week. The U.S. State Department also has yet to establish a mandatory new office dedicated to diplomacy with the three islands. In addition, Washington’s federal programs and services agreement with Palau has not been renewed, and the current agreement expires on September 30. Federal services in limbo range from welfare benefits and food stamp programs to the U.S. Postal Service and veterans’ health benefits. 'Many of our veterans living in Palau are suffering,' Hersey Kyota, Palau’s ambassador to the U.S., told the Indian and Insular Affairs Subcommittee in the oversight hearing, Tuesday. Palau is home to around 20,000 people; with that small population, it has the highest per capita rate of U.S. military volunteers. Kyota said at least three Palauan veterans have died by suicide since January. 'They need medication; they need to travel to Guam or Hawaii, but most of them do not have enough resources to pay for their own ticket,' he said. Andrew Harding of the Heritage Foundation said the delays play to Beijing’s advantage. 'The implementation process is failing,' Harding told VOA. 'If we really want to prove that we are the preferred partner in the Pacific, especially to our COFA partners, we can’t have these types of questions be raised.' Greg Brown, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said, 'This doesn’t look good. Now, it’s hurry up and wait, and who are we waiting for? We're waiting for ourselves. We're waiting for the Americans.' At the hearing on Tuesday, Anka Lee, deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia, acknowledged the critical need for U.S. engagement with Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. 'We know that the PRC is aggressive. They are pushing very hard, and we have to compete with them toe to toe,' he said to lawmakers, using the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China. During the oversight hearing, Taylor Ruggles, the senior COFA adviser at the U.S. State Department, blamed some of the delay on communication issues between the White House and Congress and a focus on rolling out additional embassies in other Pacific Island nations such as Vanuatu. He said there’s an interagency meeting this week to get all the federal agencies together to move the process forward. That meeting, the second this year, is scheduled for Thursday. The first was held in April. Dr. Miguel H. Lopez, assistant undersecretary for health at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, said this week the department would 'provide a comprehensive model of care' to Pacific veterans that is equal to treatment veterans receive in the continental United States. Ambassadors to Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands told lawmakers at the hearing that they received letters from the Veterans Administration Monday night, just hours before the oversight hearing. 'The [veterans] agreement calls for a one-year duration. We’re within six to seven months now, and we have not heard anything,' said Jack Soram, the Federated State of Micronesia ambassador to the United States. 'We don’t have that much time. Veterans need this help,' said Representative Ed Case, a Democrat from Hawaii.	https://www.voanews.com/a/six-months-on-key-measures-languish-in-pacific-islands-pact-with-us/7781649.html	2024-09-12T08:50:43-07:00	
US sanctions 16 allies of Venezuela's president over accusations of obstructing election	WASHINGTON — The U.S. government on Thursday responded to Venezuela's disputed July presidential election by imposing sanctions against 16 allies of President Nicolas Maduro, accusing them of obstructing the vote and carrying out human rights abuses. Those targeted by the Treasury Department include the head of the country's high court, leaders of state security forces and prosecutors. The move came days after the departure into exile of Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, the former diplomat who represented the main opposition parties and claimed to have won the July 28 presidential election by a wide margin. Venezuela's electoral authorities declared Maduro the victor hours after polls closed, but unlike previous elections, they never released detailed vote tallies to back up their claim. Global condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask Venezuela's high court, stacked with ruling party loyalists, to audit the results. The court reaffirmed his victory. Experts from the United Nations and the Carter Center, which at the invitation of Maduro's government observed the election, determined the results announced by electoral authorities lacked credibility.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sanctions-16-allies-of-venezuela-s-president-over-accusations-of-obstructing-election-/7781644.html	2024-09-12T08:30:45-07:00	
Kansas prison where 'In Cold Blood' killers were executed will soon open for tours	LANSING, Kansas — The shuttered Kansas prison where the killers chronicled in Truman Capote's In Cold Blood were executed is now a tourist attraction. Starting Friday, former wardens and corrections officers will lead two-hour tours of the stone-walled building in Lansing that first began housing inmates in the 1860s, The Kansas City Star reported. The building, originally called the Kansas State Penitentiary, was without purpose after the Kansas Department of Corrections opened the newly constructed Lansing Correctional Facility in 2020. But instead of demolishing it, the Department of Corrections transferred control of the building to the Lansing Historical Society and Museum. Upcoming events include a car show inside the prison walls later this month. 'We’re expecting the prison to open up to large crowds who want to know what went on inside those walls,' Debra Bates-Lamborn, president of the society, said after state prison officials handed over the keys this week. For years, the prison carried out executions by hanging at the gallows — a site that visitors will not be able to access during tours. Since removed from prison grounds, the wooden gallows are now disassembled and under the state’s custody. Among the notable inmates executed at the prison were Richard 'Dick' Hickock and Perry Smith, who were convicted of murdering four members of the Clutter family on Nov. 15, 1959, in the family's home near Holcomb, Kansas. Capote, along with his close friend and fellow writer Harper Lee, visited the prison while doing research for the book about the killings. Hickock and Smith were executed in April 1965, among the last inmates to be hanged in the state. One spot on the tour is the Chow Hall, where the late country music legend Johnny Cash performed for inmates in 1970. 'Johnny Cash has always said that audiences in prisons are the most enthusiastic audience he’s ever played to,' Bates-Lamborn said. The prison tour is modeled off of a similar tour in Missouri. About a year ago, a state lawmaker approached the Lansing Historical Society and Museum with the idea of preserving the prison by converting it into a tourist attraction. Bates-Lamborn said she and another board member made the trip to Jefferson City to tour the Missouri State Penitentiary, which has been open for tours since 2009. 'Afterwards, I thought ours is a shoo-in and we’re so much better,' she said. Tours of the facility will be held on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and are scheduled to run until October 26. Since the facility has no heat or electricity, the tours stop over the winter and will return in the spring.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kansas-prison-where-in-cold-blood-killers-were-executed-will-soon-open-for-tours-/7780460.html	2024-09-12T08:17:13-07:00	
Harvey Weinstein indicted on additional sex crimes charges ahead of New York retrial	NEW YORK — Disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein has been indicted on additional sex crimes charges ahead of his retrial in New York, Manhattan prosecutors said at a hearing Thursday. The indictment will remain under seal until Weinstein's arraignment on the new charges, which is scheduled for September 18. Weinstein, 72, is recovering from emergency heart surgery Monday at a Manhattan hospital to remove fluid on his heart and lungs and was not at Thursday's hearing. Prosecutors retrying Weinstein's overturned rape conviction disclosed last week that they had begun presenting to a grand jury evidence of up to three additional allegations against Weinstein, dating as far back as the mid-2000s. They include alleged sexual assaults at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, now known as the Roxy Hotel, and in a Lower Manhattan residential building between late 2005 and mid-2006, and an alleged sexual assault at a Tribeca hotel in May 2016. Because the indictment is under seal, it was not known whether the new charges involved some or all of the additional allegations. Prosecutors had been seeking to retry Weinstein after New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, overturned his 2020 conviction on rape and sexual assault charges earlier this year and ordered a new trial. It remains to be seen whether the new charges will be included in the retrial, as prosecutors hope, or handled as a separate case by the court. The new charges come after prosecutors in Britain announced last week that they would no longer pursue charges of indecent assault against Weinstein, who was the most prominent villain of the #MeToo movement in 2017 when women began going public with accounts of his behavior. Weinstein, who co-founded the film and television production company Miramax, has long maintained that any sexual activity was consensual. At Thursday's hearing, Judge Curtis Farber ruled that because of Weinstein's health concerns, he will be allowed to remain at Bellevue Hospital indefinitely instead of being moved back to the city's Rikers Island jail complex. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office had signaled for months that new charges were imminent against Weinstein, who was once one of the most powerful people in Hollywood, having produced films such as Pulp Fiction and The Crying Game. In July, prosecutors told a judge they were actively pursuing claims of rape that occurred in Manhattan within the statute of limitations. They said some potential accusers who were not ready to come forward during Weinstein's first New York trial had indicated they were now willing to testify. New York's highest court threw out Weinstein's 2020 conviction in April after determining the trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Prosecutors have said one of the accusers in that case, Jessica Mann, is prepared to testify against him again. It's unclear if the second accuser, Mimi Haley, would participate. Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, declined to comment. The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann did. Weinstein, who had been serving a 23-year sentence in New York when his conviction was quashed, was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial in Los Angeles. Weinstein has remained in custody in New York's Rikers Island jail complex while awaiting the retrial.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harvey-weinstein-indicted-on-additional-sex-crimes-charges-ahead-of-new-york-retrial/7781592.html	2024-09-12T08:04:57-07:00	
US commander: Support for Somalia in the works as country readies for withdrawal of AU mission	Nairobi, Kenya — A U.S. Marine Corps general who commands forces in Africa says stability and support programs for Somalia are in the works as the country prepares for the withdrawal of African Union troops in December. General Michael Langley, head of the U.S. Africa Command, said that after meeting this past weekend with Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and his top military official, Major General Ibrahim Sheikh Muhyadin Addow, he’s confident the country can manage its own security after the December withdrawal of the African Union Transitional Mission in Somalia, known as ATMIS. Langley's remarks, in a virtual briefing to reporters Thursday, came 2 1/2 years after the multidimensional mission was authorized by the U.N. Security Council, in part to help stabilize the country following years of insurgency by the militant group al-Shabab. Langley said that Somali authorities have told him military operations in the southern and central parts of the country are focused on liberating some areas from the militants and stabilizing others. 'The operations are ebbing and flowing,' Langley said. 'I’ll just use some of their narratives. They have a young army, it’s a building army, so there are some successes and some setbacks, but I think the morale across the forces is building and they are very enthusiastic they’re going to be able to keep al-Shabab back on their heels going forward in future operations.' In a briefing to the Security Council in June, Mohamed el-Amine Souef, head of ATMIS, told the council that the threat posed by al-Shabab remains unpredictable. Citing a recent attack on Somali security forces in the Galmudug region, and a mortar attack on the ATMIS camp in Baidoa, he said the group still retains the ability to conduct devastating assaults. Although Somali forces supported by ATMIS have achieved significant gains in the fight against al-Shabab, support from international partners is essential to maintain the momentum, he said. After visiting Somalia, Langley arrived in Kenya, which contributes troops to ATMIS, where he said he plans to engage with the Kenyan military leadership to explore future prospects on how to help the Somali army hit its operational objectives. 'They have been a tremendous partner with the Somali national army, institutionalizing, professionalizing, helping them to be able to operate in various areas, collaborating along the border to ensure the defeat of al-Shabab,' Langley said. In West Africa, U.S. troops recently withdrew from Niger, where they were ordered to leave after a military junta took power. Juntas that took power by force also rule Mali and Burkina Faso. Langley said the way forward on security cooperation across the Sahel is still to be determined, but added that U.S. forces will stay engaged. 'In the interim, yes, we are pivoting to some degree on like-minded countries with democratic values and shared objectives and shared challenges across the coast of West Africa,' he said. 'So yes, we are in talks with Cote D’Ivoire, in talks with Ghana and Benin, as well as we start to reset and calibrate some of our assets.' He said those countries are facing threats from terrorist groups like al-Qaida and Islamic State, which initially operated in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, but are now moving toward other countries across the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-commander-support-for-somalia-in-the-works-as-country-readies-for-withdrawal-of-au-mission/7781558.html	2024-09-12T07:59:47-07:00	
Pope ends his longest trip in religiously diverse Singapore	Pope Francis is in Singapore for the final leg of his tour of Asia and Oceania. It has been the longest and farthest trip of his tenure, taking in four countries and covering more than 30,000 kilometers. He has delivered a message of interfaith harmony throughout, and as Adam Hancock has been finding out, that theme will be prominent during his stay in the Southeast Asian financial hub.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-ends-his-longest-trip-in-religiously-diverse-singapore/7781520.html	2024-09-12T07:30:58-07:00	
Iran summons 4 European envoys over accusations it supplied missiles to Russia	TEHRAN, Iran — Iran's government on Thursday summoned the envoys of Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands over their accusations that Tehran supplied short-range ballistic missiles to Russia to use against Ukraine. State-run IRNA news agency reported that the country's foreign ministry summoned the envoys separately on Thursday to strongly condemn the accusations. IRNA said the ministry also condemned Britain, France, and Germany for issuing a joint statement against Iran and called it an 'unconventional and non-constructive statement.' The joint statement, issued Tuesday, condemned the alleged transfer of missiles, calling it 'an escalation by both Iran and Russia' and 'a direct threat to European security.' The three countries also announced new sanctions against Iran, including the cancellation of air services agreements with Iran, which will restrict Iran Air's ability to fly to the U.K. and Europe. IRNA said that Iran's foreign ministry told the envoys that their insistence on taking such positions is seen as part of the West's ongoing hostile policy against the Iranian people. The actions will 'be met with an appropriate response from the Islamic Republic of Iran.' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week that Iran had ignored warnings that the transfer of such weapons would be a profound escalation of the conflict. He told reporters during a trip to London that dozens of Russian military personnel had been trained in Iran to use the Fath-360 close-range ballistic missile system, which has a maximum range of 120 kilometers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-summons-4-european-envoys-over-accusations-it-supplied-ballistic-missiles-to-russia/7781498.html	2024-09-12T07:26:56-07:00	
Firefighters hope cooler weather will aid battle against 3 major Southern California fires	Wrightwood, California — Firefighters battling three major wildfires in the mountains east of Los Angeles took advantage of cooler weather Wednesday as they slowly gained the upper hand, but not before dozens of homes were destroyed and thousands of people were forced to evacuate. California is only now heading into the teeth of the wildfire season but already has seen nearly three times as much acreage burn than during all of 2023. The wildfires have threatened tens of thousands of homes and other structures across Southern California since they accelerated during a triple-digit heat wave over the weekend. No deaths have been reported, but at least a dozen people, mainly firefighters, have been treated for injuries, mostly heat-related, authorities said. In the small community of Wrightwood, about 90 minutes outside Los Angeles, authorities implored residents to flee the exploding Bridge Fire, which has burned more than a dozen homes in the area. Resident Erin Arias said she was racing up the mountain when she got the order to leave and did, grabbing her passport and dog. On Wednesday, she and her husband doused water on the roof of their still-standing home. Their cat was missing, she said. 'It's absolutely scary,' Arias said, looking at the burned embers of her neighbor's home. 'We're really lucky.' UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said the fire moved extraordinarily fast across complex terrain, likely giving residents less time to evacuate than usual and surprising even seasoned fire officials. The Bridge Fire 'had to go up mountain sides, burn down slope, jump across valleys, burn across new ridges, and then make it down slope again at least two other times in effectively one burning period,' he said. The full extent of the damage caused by the fires remained unclear. The three blazes are: — The Airport Fire in Orange County, which has burned more than 91 square kilometers. The fire was 5% contained Wednesday night and was reportedly sparked by heavy equipment operating in the area. Orange County Fire Capt. Steve Concialdi said eight firefighters have been treated for injuries, mostly heat-related. One resident suffered smoke inhalation and another burns, he said. Several homes burned in El Cariso Village. — The Line Fire in the San Bernardino National Forest, which was 18% contained Wednesday and had charred 148 square kilometers. The blaze has injured three firefighters. Authorities said it was caused by arson in Highland. A suspect was arrested Tuesday. — The Bridge Fire east of Los Angeles, which grew tenfold in a day and has burned 202 square kilometers, torched at least 33 homes and six cabins and forced the evacuation of 10,000 people. The cause of the fire is not yet known. It remained zero percent contained Wednesday night. Gov. Gavin Newsom sent National Guard troops in to help with evacuations, and the White House said President Joe Biden was monitoring the situation. In El Cariso Village, a community of 250 people along Highway 74 in Riverside County, an Associated Press photographer saw at least 10 homes and several cars engulfed in flames. Orange County Fire Authority Incident Commander Kevin Fetterman said the blaze has been difficult to tame because of the terrain and dry conditions and because some areas hadn't burned in decades. More than 5,500 homes in Riverside County were under evacuation orders, affecting more than 19,000 residents. Several recreational cabins and structures in the Cleveland National Forest have been damaged. In San Bernardino County, some 65,600 homes and buildings were under threat by the Line Fire, and residents along the southern edge of Big Bear Lake were told to leave Tuesday. The Line Fire blanketed the area with a thick cloud of dark smoke, which provided shade for firefighters trying to get ahead of winds expected later Wednesday, said Fabian Herrera, a spokesperson for those battling the Line Fire. A man from the town of Norco suspected of starting the Line Fire on Sept. 5 was arrested and charged with arson, San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said. Officials did not specify what was used to start the fire. Investigators collected evidence from the man's vehicle and home that suggests he could have been involved in starting other fires, San Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus said Wednesday. On the Nevada border with California near Reno, the Davis Fire forced thousands of people to evacuate over the weekend, destroyed one home and a dozen structures and charred nearly 23 square kilometers of timber and brush along the Sierra Nevada's eastern front. Rich Meyr and Evelyn Kelley were the first arrivals at an evacuation center set up Wednesday at a recreation center in south Reno. Both said they refused to evacuate previous fires but decided to play it safe this time. 'My son's wedding is Saturday. I threw all the flowers and gowns in the RV and we left. It looks like a garden shop inside that RV,' Kelley said. 'But who wants to burn alive?' More than 600 firefighters kept the blaze from growing Wednesday despite high winds that grounded all aircraft that had dropped retardant on the flames over the past two days. The fire was about 30% contained Wednesday night.	https://www.voanews.com/a/firefighters-hope-cooler-weather-will-aid-battle-against-3-major-southern-california-fires/7781406.html	2024-09-12T05:50:51-07:00

Pope Francis, in Singapore, urges fair wages for migrant workers	Singapore — Pope Francis on Thursday urged political leaders in Singapore, a leading global financial hub, to seek fair wages for the country's million-plus lower-paid foreign workers. In likely the last major speech of an ambitious 12-day tour across Southeast Asia and Oceania, the 87-year-old pontiff expressed concern for Singapore's rapidly aging population and its migrant workforce, centered in the construction and domestic services industries. 'I hope that special attention will be paid to the poor and the elderly ... as well as to protecting the dignity of migrant workers,' the pope said in an address to about 1,000 politicians and civil and religious leaders. 'These workers contribute a great deal to society and should be guaranteed a fair wage,' he said. There were 1.1 million foreigners on work permits in Singapore who earned less than S$3,000 ($2,300) per month as of December 2023, including 286,300 domestic workers and 441,100 workers in the construction, shipyard and process sectors, government data shows. Many of the migrant workers come from nearby countries such as Malaysia, China, Bangladesh and India. Many also come from the Philippines, a majority Catholic country. A Singapore NGO that provides services for migrant workers, Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics, welcomed the pope's remarks, saying they were in 'full agreement' with his call for fair wages. Singapore's workforce ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Concern for migrants has been a common theme for Francis. Earlier on his trip, he asked leaders in Papua New Guinea to work for fair wages as that country becomes a major target of international companies for its gas, gold and other reserves. 'Example to follow' Francis' speech came after private meetings with President Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Prime Minister Lawrence Wong at the country's parliament building, where the pope was presented with a white orchid plant, a new hybrid that was named in his honor. Francis praised Singapore's efforts to confront climate change, calling them a model for other countries. Singapore's government says rising sea levels due to global warming could have major implications for its low-lying coastline and it is planning to spend S$100 billion ($77 billion) over the course of the century on the issue. 'Your commitment to sustainable development and the preservation of creation is an example to follow,' the pope said. Francis, who has prioritized trips to places never visited by a pope, or where Catholics are a small minority, is only the second pope to visit Singapore, following a brief 5-hour layover by the late John Paul II in 1986. Singapore, with a population of 5.92 million, is plurality Buddhist, with about 31% of people identifying with that faith. The Vatican counts about 210,000 Catholics in the country, although that number is higher if foreign workers are included. There are also strong Muslim, Hindu and Taoist communities, and Francis praised Singapore as 'a mosaic of ethnicities, cultures and religions living together in harmony.' Hong Kong presence Francis celebrated a Mass the Vatican said drew some 50,000 people to Singapore's national sports stadium, a venue that has also hosted performers such as Taylor Swift, who played six concerts there in March. People queued outside the stadium, under tight security measures, at least five hours before the start of the event. Connie Rodriguez, a Filipino Catholic in Singapore, said it was 'overwhelming' to see the pope. 'You really feel so blessed,' she said. Francis toured the stadium at the beginning of the event in a white golf cart decorated with the Vatican seal. He greeted dozens of schoolchildren, babies, and disabled people. He also took a few selfies. Among those who attended the Mass, which featured a prayer in Mandarin, were Catholics who traveled from Hong Kong for the event, including the territory's archbishop, Cardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan. The Vatican is currently renegotiating a controversial deal with China over the appointment of Catholic bishops in the country, which is up for renewal in October. Francis' 12-day tour has also included stops in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and East Timor. He returns to Rome on Friday.

Francine weakens moving inland from Gulf Coast after hurricane winds cause power outages	MORGAN CITY, La. — Francine weakened Thursday after striking Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane that knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses, sent storm surge rushing into coastal communities and raised flood fears in New Orleans and beyond as drenching rains spread over the northern Gulf Coast. The tropical storm was forecast to be downgraded to a tropical depression as it churned northward over Mississippi, the National Hurricane Center said. Some 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 centimeters) of rain were possible in parts of Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, with up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) possible in some spots in parts of Alabama and Florida, forecasters said, warning of the potential threat of scattered flash flooding as farflung as Jackson, Mississippi; Birmingham, Alabama; Memphis, Tennessee; and Atlanta. Francine slammed the Louisiana coast Wednesday evening with 100 mph (155 kph) winds in coastal Terrebonne Parish, battering a fragile coastal region that hasn't fully recovered from a series of devastating hurricanes in 2020 and 2021. It then moved at a fast clip toward New Orleans, pounding the city with torrential rains. There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries. TV news broadcasts from coastal communities showed waves from nearby lakes, rivers and Gulf waters thrashing sea walls. Water poured into city streets amid blinding downpours. Oak and cypress trees leaned in the high winds, and some utility poles swayed back and forth. 'It's a little bit worse than what I expected to be honest with you,' said Alvin Cockerham, fire chief of Morgan City about 30 miles (50 kilometers) from where the storm's center made landfall. 'I pulled all my trucks back to the station. It's too dangerous to be out there in this.' Power outages in Louisiana topped 390,000 early Thursday in Louisiana, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us, with an additional 46,000 outages reported in Mississippi. Sheltering at her mother's home just outside Morgan City, Laura Leftwich said blasts of wind had swept away two large birdhouses outside. She had a generator powering an internet connection so she could video chat with friends, holding her computer to a window to show them water overflowing in the street. If the storm had been any more intense, 'I wouldn't have the guts to look outside,' said Leftwich, 40. 'It's a little scary.' The sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Francine drew fuel from exceedingly warm Gulf of Mexico waters, strengthening to a Category 2 storm before landfall. It weakened late Wednesday to a tropical storm. In addition to torrential rains, there was a lingering threat of spin-off tornadoes from the storm Thursday in Florida and Alabama. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said the National Guard would fan out to parishes impacted by Francine. They have food, water, nearly 400 high-water vehicles, about 100 boats and 50 helicopters to respond to the storm, including for possible search-and-rescue operations. Since the mid-19th century, some 57 hurricanes have tracked over or made landfall in Louisiana, according to The Weather Channel. Among them are some of the strongest, costliest and deadliest storms in U.S. history. Morgan City, home to around 11,500 people, sits on the banks of the Atchafalaya River in south Louisiana and is surrounded by lakes and marsh. It's described on the city's website as 'gateway to the Gulf of Mexico for the shrimping and oilfield industries.' President Joe Biden granted an emergency declaration to help Louisiana secure expedited federal money and assistance. Landry and Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves also declared states of emergency. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said it distributed more than 100,000 sandbags to the southern part of the state and the Department of Education reported a number of school district closures for Wednesday and Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/francine-weakens-moving-inland-from-gulf-coast-after-hurricane-winds-cause-power-outages/7781319.html	2024-09-12T04:25:29-07:00	
South Korea approves building two nuclear reactors	Seoul — South Korea approved the construction of two nuclear reactors on its east coast Thursday, reversing a previous administration's anti-nuclear policy as Seoul now works to expand its atomic energy capabilities. The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission approved permits to build the Shin Hanul 3 and 4 reactors after it 'confirmed the safety' of the project in southeast Uljin city. 'No factors have been found at the reactor construction site that could cause geological disasters such as subsidence or ground collapse,' it said. Each reactor will have a capacity of 1.4 gigawatts, and they are scheduled to be built by 2033. Seoul sought to phase out nuclear energy under the leadership of Moon Jae-in, whose government aimed to make South Korea completely nuclear-free by 2084. But since Yoon Suk Yeol took office in 2022, his government has ambitions to increase the share of power generated from nuclear energy to 36 percent by 2038, up from the current 30 percent. The new reactors will 'contribute to the development of cutting-edge technologies such as AI by providing a stable supply of clean and reliable energy,' said Sung Tae-yoon, Yoon's chief of staff for policy. The development could also 'help the country secure reactor construction bids overseas,' he told reporters. The approval came eight years after Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Company first submitted the permit request. The process was suspended in 2017 amid the then-government's push to reduce the country's dependence on nuclear energy. Thursday's decision was criticized by Korean activist group Energy Justice Actions as an 'irresponsible move that threatens the safety of the people, in opposition to the global trend towards an energy shift' towards renewable resources. The two new reactors will be Uljin's ninth and tenth, the group said, calling such a concentration a 'global rarity.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-approves-building-two-nuclear-reactors/7781297.html	2024-09-12T04:04:26-07:00	
Indonesian leader spends final weeks of his term in unfinished new capital	Jakarta — Indonesian President Joko Widodo will from Thursday spend the final weeks of his term in the country's planned new capital, Nusantara, amid doubts about the continued pace of development of his flagship $32 billion megaproject. The massive infrastructure undertaking on the island of Borneo has suffered a series of setbacks, including construction delays, land issues, and a lack of foreign investment. This June the two top officials overseeing Nusantara abruptly resigned. Jokowi, as the outgoing leader is known, reiterated on Thursday that it could be decades before Nusantara is finished. 'It could take 10, 15, or even 20 years,' Jokowi told top military and police officials during a meeting in Nusantara's recently completed eagle-shaped palace. 'Moving to the new capital is not only about moving to a new building, palace or location,' he added. 'But is a change of mindset and working patterns.' Intended to ease the burden on the congested, polluted and densely populated current capital Jakarta, the parliament in 2022 passed a law to move its capital. But ahead of the Oct. 20 inauguration of president-elect Prabowo Subianto and Jokowi's eldest son, vice president-elect Gibran Rakabuming Raka, doubts have grown about Nusantara's future viability. Analysts say the development of Nusantara is unlikely to continue at the same breakneck speed in the next administration. Prabowo, who ran on a platform of continuing Jokowi's policies, is expected to prioritize his own signature $28 billion 'free nutritious food program' targeting malnutrition and stunted growth in schoolchildren across the world's fourth-most populous nation. Jokowi told officials on Thursday that Prabowo had promised to speed up construction. Located on the eastern side of Borneo island, Nusantara is about 1,200 km from Jakarta. Nusantara's presidential palace and its first hotel were recently completed, while housing for state officials, an airport and toll roads are still under way. On Friday Jokowi is expected to hold his second cabinet meeting in Nusantara and may announce several new investments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesian-leader-spends-final-weeks-of-his-term-in-unfinished-new-capital/7781279.html	2024-09-12T03:35:51-07:00

Vietnam death toll climbs to 199 as typhoon aftermath brings flash floods, landslides	HANOI, Vietnam — Nearly 200 people have died in Vietnam in the aftermath of Typhoon Yagi and 128 are missing as flash floods and landslides take their toll, state media reported Thursday. Vietnam's VNExpress newspaper reported that 199 people have died while more than 800 have been injured. In the capital, flood waters from the Red River receded slightly but many areas were still inundated with water neck-high in some places. In Hanoi's Tay Ho district, people waded through muddy brown water above their knees to make their way along one street, some still wearing their bicycle and motorcycle helmets after abandoning their vehicles along the way. A few paddled along the road in small boats as empty water bottles, a plastic foam cooler and other flotsam drifted by; one man pushed his motorbike toward drier ground in an aluminum sloop. Pedestrians hiked up their shorts as high as possible to avoid being soaked by the wake caused by a delivery truck powering its way through the water. Bakery owner Mai Anh evacuated the area with her family to shelter with her parents, but returned Thursday to check on her shop and found more than half a meter of water still inside. 'I can't do business with the flood like this,' she said. 'The goods in my shop are all destroyed.' The flooding in Hanoi has been reportedly the worst in two decades. Residents started evacuating the area Tuesday as the flood waters rose, and power and drinking water have been cut since Wednesday. The flood waters damaged the doors to Hoang Anh Tu's home, from which he operates a beer shop. Though he and his family were able to relocate to his parents' house, they have had to take turns guarding the building. 'It's very difficult,' he said. 'We haven't even been able to assess the damage because the flood came so fast.' Yagi was the strongest typhoon to hit the Southeast Asian country in decades. It made landfall Saturday with winds of up to 149 kph. Despite weakening on Sunday, downpours continued and rivers remain dangerously high. The death toll spiked earlier in the week as a flash flood swept away the entire hamlet of Lang Nu in northern Vietnam's Lao Cai province Tuesday. Hundreds of rescue personnel worked tirelessly Wednesday to search for survivors, but as of Thursday morning 53 villagers remained missing, VNExpress reported, while seven more bodies were found, bringing the death toll there to 42. Floods and landslides have caused most of the deaths, many of which have come in the northwestern Lao Cai province, bordering China, where Lang Nu is located. Lao Cai province is also home to the popular trekking destination of Sapa. On Monday, a bridge collapsed and a bus was swept away by flooding, killing dozens of people. The steel bridge in Phu Tho province over the engorged Red River collapsed, sending 10 cars and trucks along with two motorbikes into the river. The bus carrying 20 people was swept into a flooded stream by a landslide in mountainous Cao Bang province. Experts say storms like Typhoon Yagi are getting stronger due to climate change, as warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel them, leading to higher winds and heavier rainfall.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-death-toll-climbs-to-199-as-typhoon-aftermath-brings-flash-floods-landslides/7781246.html	2024-09-12T02:34:13-07:00	
Ukraine businesses hire more women and teens as labor shortages bite	KYIV, Ukraine — After spending years in what she described as 'boring, sedentary' roles in the offices of several Ukrainian companies, Liliia Shulha landed her dream job as a truck driver with Ukraine's leading retailer, Fozzy Group. 'I always dreamed about big cars. Instead of (playing with) dolls, I drove cars when I was a child,' she told Reuters. 'Now the situation is such that they take people without experience and they train. I was lucky,' said Shulha, 40, wearing a company uniform in front of a large truck. As the war with Russia drains the labor force, businesses are trying to cover critical shortages by hiring more women in traditionally male-dominated roles and turning to teenagers, students and older workers. With millions of people, mostly women and children, abroad after fleeing the war, and tens of thousands of men mobilized into the army, the jobs crisis could endanger economic growth and a post-war recovery, analysts say. Ukraine has lost over a quarter of its workforce since Russia's invasion in February 2022, central bank data showed. Nearly 60% of businesses said finding skilled workers was their main challenge, an economy ministry survey of over 3,000 companies showed. 'The situation is indeed critical,' said Tetiana Petruk, chief sustainability officer at steel company Metinvest, one of Ukraine's largest employers with a workforce of about 45,000. It has about 4,000 vacancies. 'The staff deficit that we feel has an impact on our production,' Petruk told Reuters in an online interview. 'We are not the only ones who feel the staff shortages, all companies in the regions feel that, including our contractors.' Reuters spoke to representatives of nine Ukrainian companies, from big industrial firms to retail groups and small private entrepreneurs. All said staff shortages and a growing mismatch of skills were big challenges. Businesses said they were changing recruitment and business practices, automating, rotating existing staff and expanding their job descriptions, re-hiring retirees and offering more benefits, especially for younger workers. They also have had to increase wages. The average monthly wage now is about $470 compared to about $350 a year ago. 'There is a noticeable shift away from gender and age bias in candidate selection as employers adjust criteria to attract needed employees,' said the Kyiv School of Economics. 'This trend also extends to entrepreneurship, where the share of female entrepreneurs is growing significantly.' More women Male-dominated industries are more affected by staff shortages, the central bank said. The construction sector, transport, mining and others have all suffered because of military mobilization, for which men aged 25 to 60 are eligible. To keep the economy running, the government provides full or partial deferrals for critical companies. In the energy and weapons production sectors, 100% of staff are eligible for draft deferral. In some other sectors, firms can retain 50% of male staff. But the process to secure deferral is long and complicated. As the government toughened mobilization rules this year, the number of men preferring informal employment - allowing them to stay off public data records - grew, some enterprises said. In the agricultural southern region of Mykolayiv, women are being trained as tractor drivers. Women are also increasingly working as tram and truck drivers, coal miners, security guards and warehouse workers, companies say. 'We are offering training and jobs for women who have minimal experience,' said Lyubov Ukrainets, human resources director at Silpo, part of Fozzy Group. Including Shulha, the company has six female truck drivers and is more actively recruiting women for other jobs previously dominated by men, including loaders, meat splitters, packers and security guards. The share of female employees is growing in industries such as steel production. Petruk said female staff accounted for about 30-35% of Metinvest's workforce and the company now hired women for some underground jobs. Metinvest was unable to provide comparative figures for before the war. Some other women are unable or unwilling to join the workforce because of a lack of childcare. Shulha, who works 15-day stretches on the road, has moved back in with her parents to ensure care for her 14-year-old son and 16-year-old daughter. Young people Businesses and economists expect labor market challenges to persist. Employers are turning their attention to young people by offering training, job experience and targeted benefit packages. Metinvest, which previously focused on students, is now increasingly working with professional colleges, Petruk said. Silpo is more actively hiring teenagers for entry-level jobs in supermarkets and has launched a specialized internship program for students. Mobile phone operator Vodafone repackaged its youth program, creating an opportunity for about 50 teenagers in 12 cities to get their first job experience. 'We want to offer the first proper experience of the official job to this young audience. Another objective is to build a talent pool,' said Ilona Voloshyna of Vodafone Retail. 'Also we want to understand the youth,' she said in a Vodafone shop in Kyiv as six teenagers consulted with visitors. The government and foreign partners have launched several programs to help Ukrainians reskill. 'We provide the opportunity for everyone at state expense to obtain a new profession which is in demand on the labor market, or to raise their professional level,' said Tetiana Berezhna, a deputy economy minister.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-businesses-hire-more-women-and-teens-as-labor-shortages-bite/7781233.html	2024-09-12T01:39:28-07:00

Botswana, US firm partner to conduct border pathogen monitoring	Gaborone, Botswana — Botswana and an American biotech firm, Ginkgo Bioworks, have partnered to conduct pathogen surveillance at the country’s entry points. Health officials say the proactive move is meant to safeguard public health as the world faces emerging disease threats. Botswana introduced mpox screening last month for travelers at its entry points. In a statement Wednesday, Ministry of Health spokesperson Christopher Nyanga said a pathogen-monitoring program is critical to detecting similar emerging health threats. Dr. Mbatshi Mazwiduma, a public health expert, said the pathogen-surveillance program will complement existing strategies to prevent disease threats. 'The initiative by the Ministry of Health is a very welcome development in the sense that it is at least demonstrating that they are both embracing traditional methods of surveillance and disease detection plus at the same time, they are looking at other innovative ways of disease detection,' he said. Through the collaboration, Boston-based Gingko Bioworks will work with the Ministry of Health to collect and monitor travelers’ samples. Nasal swabs will be used to collect the samples. Nyanga said testing will be done on a voluntary, anonymous basis. 'Although participation in this initiative is entirely voluntary, travelers are encouraged to participate because this early detection of pathogens is meant to safeguard the health of all citizens, visitors and residents of this country,' he said. 'The samples collected will be kept anonymous. The data collected from the samples will be vital in strengthening the country's robust health system and response to public health threats and emergencies.' But Mazwiduma said voluntary participation in the pathogen-monitoring program could hinder effective disease detection. 'Perhaps if non-invasive, non-intrusive, the technique should be compulsory because it ensures that the number of people who comply to sample acquisition is increased and, therefore, you can actually rapidly achieve suitable sample sizes for you to be able to ensure that you do not miss any patients, but also more importantly that it allows you to improve your validation of these particular technologies,' Mazwiduma said. Botswana and Gingko Bioworks previously collaborated in a 2022 pathogen-monitoring program to detect new and emerging COVID-19 variants. During the same year, Botswana was credited with the discovery of COVID-19 variant omicron.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-us-firm-partner-to-conduct-border-pathogen-monitoring/7781207.html	2024-09-11T23:38:23-07:00

Philippines stands firm on Sabina Shoal but looks to ease tension with China	MANILA/BEIJING, — The Philippines will stick to its position on Sabina Shoal, it said on Thursday, even while exploring ways to ease tension in the area during 'frank and candid' talks with China on managing disputes in the key waterway of the South China Sea. The Southeast Asian nation's sustained presence at the feature, aiming to monitor what it suspects to be China's small-scale reclamation activities has angered Beijing, turning the shoal into their latest flashpoint in the contested waters. During Wednesday's meeting of officials in Beijing, China vowed to 'firmly uphold its sovereignty' and reiterated a demand for the immediate withdrawal of a Philippine coast guard ship anchored at the shoal since April. 'I reaffirmed the Philippines' consistent position and explored ways to lower the tension,' Philippine Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Theresa Lazaro said on X, posting a picture of her handshake with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong. 'We agreed to continue discussions on areas of co-operation, especially on hotline mechanism, coastguard cooperation, and marine scientific and technological co-operation.' The two had a frank and candid exchange of views, the Philipine foreign ministry said in its statement. The Sabina Shoal, which China refers to as Xianbin Reef, and Manila as Escoda Shoal, lies 150 km west of the Philippine province of Palawan, well within its exclusive economic zone. The two nations have traded accusations of intentional ramming of each others' vessels in a series of clashes last month, just after reaching a pact on resupply missions to a beached Filipino naval ship in the Second Thomas Shoal. China claims sovereignty over most of the China Sea, overlapping into maritime zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. In 2016 the Hague arbitration tribunal voided China's expansive and historical claims, a decision Beijing rejects. The Philippine navy has said it has recently monitored 207 Chinese vessels, including 'maritime militia boats' within the country's EEZ, with dozens observed near Sabina Shoal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-stands-firm-on-sabina-shoal-but-looks-to-ease-tension-with-china/7781199.html	2024-09-11T22:26:14-07:00	
Blinken to discuss support for Ukraine in visit to Poland	WARSAW, Poland — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet with senior Polish government officials on Thursday to discuss support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia and deepening U.S. defense cooperation with Warsaw. Washington's top diplomat travels to NATO ally Poland following a visit to Kyiv on Wednesday, where he heard Ukrainian officials' appeals to be allowed to fire Western-supplied missiles deep into Russian territory. Blinken is scheduled to meet with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, President Andrzej Duda and Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, according to their offices. More than 2-1/2 years since Russia's invasion began, Ukrainian forces are being pressured on the battlefield by a better armed and bigger foe, as they try to fend off Russian gains in the east where Moscow is focusing its attacks. In a bid to regain some of the initiative and divert Russian forces, Kyiv last month sent troops into Russia's Kursk region, but progress has stalled. The security of Poland's eastern flank will also feature in the discussions with Blinken, said Mieszko Pawlak, head of the international policy bureau at Duda's office. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made defense a top priority for eastern members of the NATO alliance, and Poland has sought to strengthen the borders it shares with Belarus and Russia. Relations between Poland and Russia have deteriorated sharply since Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into neighboring Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Warsaw has ramped up defense spending in response and expects record defense spending in 2025 of $47.95 billion. Deepening energy cooperation is also expected to be a topic of discussion while Blinken is in Warsaw, the State Department said on Tuesday. Pawlak said cooperation on civilian nuclear energy including building the first Polish nuclear power plant would be on the agenda.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-to-discuss-support-for-ukraine-in-visit-to-poland/7781188.html	2024-09-11T21:51:25-07:00	
US supports two permanent UN Security Council seats for Africa	UNITED NATIONS — The United States supports creating two permanent United Nations Security Council seats for African states and one seat to be rotated among small island developing states, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield will announce on Thursday. The move comes as the U.S. seeks to repair ties with Africa, where many are unhappy about Washington's support for Israel's war in Gaza, and deepen relations with Pacific Islands nations important to countering Chinese influence in the region. Thomas-Greenfield told Reuters she hopes the announcement will 'move this agenda forward in a way that we can achieve Security Council reform at some point in the future,' describing it as part of U.S. President Joe Biden's legacy. The push for two permanent African seats and a rotating seat for small island developing states is in addition to Washington's long-held support for India, Japan and Germany to also get permanent seats on the council. Developing nations have long demanded permanent seats on the Security Council, the most powerful body in the United Nations. But years of talks on reform have proved fruitless and it is unclear whether U.S. support could fuel action. Ahead of making the announcement at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Thursday, Thomas-Greenfield clarified to Reuters that Washington does not support expanding veto power beyond the five countries that hold it. The Security Council is charged with maintaining international peace and security and has the power to impose sanctions and arms embargos and authorize the use of force. When the U.N. was founded in 1945, the Security Council had 11 members. This increased in 1965 to 15 members, made up of 10 elected states serving two-year terms and five permanent veto-wielding nations: Russia, China, France, the U.S. and Britain. Legitimacy problem U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres backs Security Council reform. 'You have a Security Council that corresponds exactly to the situation after the Second World War ... that has a problem of legitimacy, and that has a problem of effectiveness, and it needs to be reformed,' Guterres told Reuters on Wednesday. Any change to the Security Council membership is done by amending the founding U.N. Charter. This needs the approval and ratification by two-thirds of the General Assembly, including the Security Council's current five veto powers. The 193-member U.N. General Assembly has annually discussed reform of the Security Council for more than a decade. But momentum has grown in recent years as geopolitical rivalries have deadlocked the council on several issues, particularly after permanent veto-wielding member Russia invaded Ukraine. 'Much of the conversation around Security Council reform has been just that: a conversation,' Thomas-Greenfield will say on Thursday, according to prepared remarks reviewed by Reuters of her announcement that Washington supports moving to negotiations on a draft text to amend the U.N. Charter to expand the council. Thomas-Greenfield told Reuters she could not say how long it might take to get the General Assembly to vote on such a resolution. Each year the General Assembly elects five new members from different geographical groups for two-year terms on the Security Council. Africa currently has three seats rotated among states. 'The problem is, these non-permanent seats don't enable African countries to deliver the full benefit of their knowledge and voices to the work of the council ... to consistently lead on the challenges that affect all of us - and disproportionately affect Africans,' Thomas-Greenfield will say. She will also say that small island developing states deserve a rotating elected seat because they offer 'critical insights on a range of international peace and security issues: including, notably, the impact of climate change.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supports-two-permanent-un-security-council-seats-for-africa/7781186.html	2024-09-11T21:43:47-07:00

China ramping up transnational repression, Uyghur exiles in US say	washington — Many exiled Uyghurs in the U.S. say China has ramped up transnational repression against them, using their relatives who still live in China to threaten them into silence abroad. 'I’ve been targeted online with fake accounts. … Chinese trolls even registered for a webinar using fake emails and posted my home address, saying, ‘We are watching you,’ ' Elfidar Iltebir, president of the Uyghur American Association, a rights group, told VOA last week in a phone interview. The harassment prompted her to increase her home security. Iltebir said the repression has intensified, especially over the past two years. 'People are afraid to come out and advocate, fearing for their families’ safety,' she said. From 2017 to 2020, she said, nearly every Uyghur American had at least one family member detained in Xinjiang, spurring many to activism. But as China increased pressure on these exiles, many of them are thinking twice about their activist work. She described a climate of fear within her organization. 'Some of our supporters now ask if they can help behind the scenes, afraid to be seen publicly,' Iltebir said. Chinese agents, sending messages through Uyghur relatives in Xinjiang, 'tell us not to attend political or cultural events, not to join any organizations, to stay away from activists. 'They even dictate who to invite to weddings. I’ve seen community members receive these orders.' VOA reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment on the allegations of transnational repression targeting Uyghur Americans. The embassy did not respond to multiple inquiries. However, the FBI says it is aware of such activity targeting Uyghurs and other ethnic minority groups in the United States. 'Tactics and patterns morph with advancements in technology,' the federal police agency said in a statement to VOA. 'These acts – often identified as transnational repression (TNR) – represent severe violations of international norms, U.S. law, and individual rights and freedoms. TNR conducted by any government, against any person including Uyghur Americans, is unacceptable.' The agency says it has worked to raise awareness of the problem among state, local and university law enforcement partners and has conducted training to help vulnerable communities recognize repressive tactics and examples of transnational harassment. It also provides resources in 60 languages, including in Uyghur. Iltebir detailed her organization’s work with the FBI to support the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 Uyghur Americans in combating China’s transnational repression. China, Uyghurs and human rights Uyghurs are a largely Muslim minority group. Approximately 12 million Uyghurs live in China's northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where accusations of mass detention, forced labor and other human rights abuses have drawn global attention and condemnation. In recent years, the U.S., U.N., European Parliament and rights organizations have condemned China or its policies in the Uyghur region. Some have accused Bejing of committing genocide and crimes against humanity. Allegations include the arbitrary mass imprisonment of Uyghurs and other Muslim and Turkic groups, forced labor, forced sterilization, family separation and other abuses. China denies any wrongdoing in the region, labeling the targeted Uyghurs as extremists, terrorists and separatists and justifying its policies as necessary measures to combat terrorism and separatism. Fear and anonymity Fear often keeps exiles from speaking out or enabling the media to confirm accusations. One such U.S.-based Uyghur rights activist is a man who came to the U.S. for his education. He spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation and increased harassment of his family members in Xinjiang. In 2017, he said, his sibling and extended family were arbitrarily detained in Xinjiang. 'The only thing I was obsessed with was my academic work,' he said, but the detentions forced him into activism. After joining a Washington-based rights group advocating for human rights in China, including the Uyghurs, in 2019, he began receiving intimidating social media messages from Chinese authorities. 'I started receiving all sorts of intimidation from [Chinese] police through WhatsApp and other social media platforms,' he recalled. 'They even invited me to a third country to meet them there. I never agreed.' Despite the evolving nature of these tactics, he said, the harassment has never ceased. 'I have submitted details of these incidents to the FBI at least 15 times in the past and provided them with all the details of the communications I've received over the past few years,' he said. But ultimately, he said, the FBI can do nothing because the harassers are based outside the U.S. However, the agency has taken legal action against China’s transnational repression schemes in the U.S. In a case last month, Wang Shujun of New York was found guilty of acting as a covert Chinese agent. The FBI said he supported transnational repression by posing as a member of a pro-democracy group while feeding Beijing information about its members. Political response 'Chinese Communist agents should not be able to threaten and intimidate American residents without consequences, anywhere — especially and including here in the United States,' said Republican U.S. Representative Chris Smith, chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, in an email to VOA on Tuesday. Smith emphasized that while the FBI has made efforts, 'more can and must be done to stop transnational repression and abuse.' According to the FBI, China has long targeted diaspora communities, particularly what China describes as the 'five poisons' - groups seen as threats to Chinese Communist Party rule, including Uyghurs, Tibetans, democracy activists, Falun Gong practitioners and Taiwanese independence advocates. 'The PRC has used proxies, including private investigators, to harass dissidents in the U.S.,' the FBI told VOA. Despite the challenges, Iltebir remains determined to speak out. 'We cannot be silenced. If we don’t speak out, who will? Seeing non-Uyghurs stand with us inspires me to continue this fight for freedom, justice and human rights,' she said. Yihua Lee of VOA's Mandarin Service contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-ramping-up-transnational-repression-uyghur-exiles-in-us-say-/7781143.html	2024-09-11T19:09:31-07:00	
US grants Egypt $1.3 billion in military aid, overriding rights conditions	washington — The Biden administration is overriding human rights conditions on military aid to Egypt, a State Department spokesperson said on Wednesday, granting the U.S. ally its full allocation of $1.3 billion this year for the first time during this administration, despite ongoing concerns over human rights in the country. The announcement comes as Washington has relied heavily on Cairo, a longstanding U.S. ally, to mediate so far unsuccessful talks between Israel and Hamas on a cease-fire deal to end the war in Gaza. Of the $1.3 billion in U.S. foreign military financing allocated to Egypt, $320 million is subject to conditions that have meant at least some of that sum has been withheld in recent years. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Congress on Wednesday that he would waive a certification requirement on $225 million related to Egypt's human rights record this year, citing 'the U.S. national security interest,' the spokesperson said by email. 'This decision is important to advancing regional peace and Egypt’s specific and ongoing contributions to U.S. national security priorities, particularly to finalize a cease-fire agreement for Gaza, bring the hostages home, surge humanitarian assistance for Palestinians in need, and help bring an enduring end to the Israel-Hamas conflict,' the spokesperson said. Democrat Chris Murphy, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Middle East subcommittee, said Washington had previously withheld military aid from Egypt on human rights grounds while maintaining its strategic relationship with the country. 'It's no secret that Egypt remains a deeply repressive autocratic state, and I see no good reason to ignore that fact by waiving these requirements,' Murphy said. Cairo has remained a close regional ally of Washington despite accusations of widespread abuses under President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi's government, including torture and enforced disappearances. Sissi denies there are political prisoners in Egypt. He says stability and security are paramount and authorities are promoting rights by trying to provide basic needs such as jobs and housing. The war in Gaza, sparked by the October 7 attacks by Palestinian militants on southern Israel, has increased Washington's reliance on Cairo for diplomatic efforts like the cease-fire talks. Much-needed humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza also enters from Egypt. Blinken issued a similar waiver on the human rights conditions last year but withheld a portion of the military aid over Egypt's failure to make 'clear and consistent progress' on the release of political prisoners. This year, he determined that Egypt had made sufficient efforts on political prisoners to release $95 million tied to progress on the issue, the spokesperson said. They cited Egypt's efforts to draft legislation to reform pretrial detention and the broader penal code, its release of some political prisoners and a move to end travel bans and asset freezes associated with foreign funding for nongovernmental organizations. Seth Binder, director of advocacy for the Washington-based Middle East Democracy Center, said that while about 970 prisoners had been released since last September, at least 2,278 Egyptians were arbitrarily arrested over the same period, according to data collected by the center and Egyptian human rights groups. The State Department spokesperson said Washington was continuing 'a rigorous dialogue with the Egyptian government on the importance of concrete human rights improvements that are crucial to sustaining the strongest possible U.S.-Egypt partnership.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-grants-egypt-1-3-billion-in-military-aid-overriding-rights-conditions/7781141.html	2024-09-11T18:44:23-07:00	
Peru's Fujimori, divisive head of political dynasty, dies at 86	lima, peru — Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, who steered economic growth during the 1990s but was later jailed for human rights abuses stemming from a bloody war against Maoist rebels, died Wednesday. He was 86. Close colleagues visited him earlier in the day, reporting that he was in critical condition. 'After a long battle with cancer, our father ... has just departed to meet the Lord,' his daughter Keiko Fujimori wrote in a message on X, signed by the former leader's other children. Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, was the little-known chancellor of a farming university when elected to office in 1990. He quickly established himself as a cunning politician whose hands-on style produced results even as he angered critics for concentrating power. He slayed hyperinflation that had thrown millions of Peruvians out of work, privatized dozens of state-run companies, and slashed trade tariffs, setting the foundations for Peru to become, for a while, one of Latin America's most stable economies. Under his watch, the feared leader of the Maoist Shining Path, Abimael Guzman, was captured, dealing a crucial blow to a movement that in the 1980s seemed close to toppling the Peruvian state. Guzman died in prison in September 2021. But many Peruvians saw Fujimori as an autocrat after he used military tanks to shut down Congress in 1992, redrafting the constitution to his liking to push free-market reforms and tough anti-terrorism laws. A slew of corruption scandals during his 10-year administration also turned public opinion against him. Shortly after he won a third election in 2000 — amending the constitution to run — videos emerged of his top adviser and spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos doling out cash to bribe politicians. Fujimori fled to exile in Japan. He resigned via fax from Tokyo and then unsuccessfully campaigned for a Japanese senatorial seat. Montesinos was later captured in Venezuela and jailed, convicted by the hundreds of videos he recorded of himself handing out cash bribes to politicians and business and media executives. The cases against Fujimori piled up, including accusations that he had ordered the use of death squads in his battle against Shining Path militants. Fujimori was safe in Japan — he was a dual citizen, and Japan does not extradite its citizens. So many were shocked when in 2005 he decided to return to Peru, apparently in hopes of forgiveness and a return to politics. Instead, he was detained during a layover in Chile, extradited to Peru in 2007, and in 2009 he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Once jailed, Fujimori's public appearances were limited to hospital visits where he often appeared disheveled and unwell. While detractors dismissed his health complaints as a ploy to get out of prison, then-President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski briefly pardoned Fujimori in 2017. Months later Kuczynski was impeached, and the pardon overturned by Peru's top constitutional court, sending Fujimori back to the special prison that held him and no other inmates. The court restored the pardon in December 2023, releasing the ailing Fujimori, who had suffered from stomach ulcers, hypertension and tongue cancer. In May 2024, Fujimori announced he had been diagnosed with a malignant tumor. Fujimori's legacy has been most passionately defended by his daughter Keiko, who has been close to clinching the presidency herself three times on a platform that has included pardoning her father and defending his constitution. The late Fujimori was born in Lima on Peruvian Independence Day, July 28, 1938. A mathematician and agricultural engineer, Fujimori was a political nobody when he decided to run for the presidency, driving a tractor to his campaign rallies. He surprised the world by defeating renowned writer Mario Vargas Llosa in the 1990 election, with heavy support from the left. He touted himself as an alternative to the country's white elite and gained crucial support from Peru's large Indigenous and mixed-race populations. As Peru battled what was among the world's worst hyperinflation, Fujimori promised not to carry out drastic measures to tame it. But in his second week in office, he suddenly lifted the subsidies that kept food essentials affordable, in what became known as the 'Fuji-shock.' 'May God help us,' Fujimori's finance minister said on TV after announcing the measure. Inflation worsened in the short-term, but the bet paid off, eventually stabilizing the economy after over a decade of crisis. Even as support for him started to wane, Fujimori pulled off audacious stunts in his second term. In 1997, he devised a plan to dig tunnels under the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima to end a four-month hostage crisis after another insurgency, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, took 500 people captive for 126 days. In a surprise attack, Fujimori sent in more than 100 commandos in a raid that killed all 14 insurgents. Only two commandos and one of the remaining 72 hostages died. Television footage showed Fujimori calmly stepping over the corpses of the insurgents after the raid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/peru-s-fujimori-divisive-head-of-political-dynasty-dies-at-86/7781135.html	2024-09-11T18:37:16-07:00	
Haitian Americans fear for their safety after Trump repeats false claims about immigrants	WASHINGTON — Haitian Americans said they fear for their safety after Donald Trump repeated a false and derogatory claim during this week's presidential debate about immigrants in Ohio. Haitian community leaders across the U.S. said the Republican candidate's remarks about immigrants eating household pets during his debate with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris could put lives at risk and further inflame tensions in the small city of Springfield, Ohio, where thousands of recent Haitian arrivals have boosted the local economy but also strained the safety net. 'We have to be careful where we go,' said Viles Dorsainvil, 38, who says the Haitian community center he heads in Springfield has received threatening phone calls. The hostility has prompted one friend working at an Amazon warehouse to consider leaving, he said. 'He said that things are getting out of hand now; the way people are treating us, making bad comments about us,' Dorsainvil said. Trump's Tuesday remark that 'they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats' is the latest in a long line of lies about immigrants that have defined his political career. It followed a similar false claim spread by his running mate, U.S. Senator JD Vance of Ohio, on social media about Springfield's new residents. City officials say they have received no credible reports of anybody eating household animals. Karen Graves, a city spokesperson, said she was not aware of recent hate crimes targeting Haitian residents but that some had been victims of 'crimes of opportunity,' such as property theft. The Haitian Times reported that some Haitian families in Springfield, Ohio, were keeping their children home from school, while other sources told the newspaper that they were subject to bullying, assaults and intimidation in front of their homes amid racist rhetoric amplified by social media. The lie fed on frustrations of some in the western Ohio city, who say the 15,000 Haitians who have arrived in recent years to fuel the city's economy, have also stressed limited resources at local schools and health clinics and driven up rents. Tensions have increased since a Haitian driving without an Ohio license struck a school bus in 2023, killing 11-year-old Aiden Clark and injuring 26 other children. 'People are getting really fed up,' city resident Richard Jordan said at a city council meeting on Tuesday. 'Things are going to get ugly.' At that same meeting, Clark's father Nathan Clark criticized Trump and Vance for exploiting his son's death. 'They can vomit all the hate they want about illegal immigrants, the border crisis, and even untrue claims about fluffy pets being ravaged and eaten by community members,' Clark said. 'However, they are not allowed, nor have they ever been allowed, to mention Aiden Clark from Springfield, Ohio.' Last month, a white supremacist was ejected from a city council meeting after he made threatening statements towards Haitian immigrants. 'My heart fell' Ahead of the debate, billionaire Elon Musk amplified the lie further on his X social media platform, as did Republicans on the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. Guerline Jozef, who heads the national advocacy group Haitian Bridge Alliance, said her group had been trying to knock down the rumor before the debate. When Trump mentioned it, 'my heart fell to the floor,' she said. 'This has become a nationwide lie that people everywhere are repeating.' For Taisha Saintil, now an analyst with the immigrant advocacy group UndocuBlack Network, said Trump's remark brought back painful memories of being taunted when she arrived at a Florida elementary school in 2006. Some 1.1 million Haitian Americans live in the U.S., about half of whom are immigrants, according to the Census Bureau. Long established in Florida and New York, Haitian immigrants have recently been moving to states like North Carolina and California to pursue work, Jozef said. Seeking work Springfield officials say the majority of Haitian migrants are in the country legally, drawn by jobs at warehouses and factories. They have opened two restaurants and seven groceries, according to a city fact sheet. 'While we are experiencing challenges related to the rapid growth of our immigrant population, these challenges are primarily due to the pace of the growth,' city manager Bryan Heck said in a video on Wednesday. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, said on Tuesday the state is providing $2.5 million to help the new residents get vaccines and other health services, and state police are being brought in to help enforce traffic laws. He said President Joe Biden's administration should also provide aid to cities like Springfield that see a sudden increase in new migrants. Trump's comments could energize his supporters to help him win over undecided voters, particularly aggrieved white voters who feel a sense of their own decline in this country, said Republican strategist Mike Madrid, founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. 'The attempts to dehumanize people is a long-proven strategy to work at a time when society's undergoing change,' he said. But that strategy risks spurring violence, Haitian American leaders said. Democratic Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, the only Haitian-American in Congress, said Trump's rhetoric endangers Haitians across the country. 'We've heard these stereotypes for years about Haitian people, Black immigrants, doing all these things that we know aren't true,' she said. Gepsie Metellus, who heads the Sant La Haitian neighborhood center in North Miami, said Trump's comment was viewed as a 'cheap political shot' in her community, but directly endangers those in Springfield. 'This rhetoric has a way of turning out really badly,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haitian-americans-fear-for-their-safety-after-trump-repeats-false-claims-about-immigrants/7781117.html	2024-09-11T18:11:50-07:00

DACA case faces uncertainty again as US appellate court arguments loom	washington — The future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program remains in limbo with another court hearing set for October 10. Judges from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments on the case, initiated in 2018 by Texas and other Republican-led states seeking to end DACA. The program offers temporary protection from deportation and work permits to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children who are often referred to as 'Dreamers.' The case centers on whether DACA exceeds presidential authority, immigration advocates from the coalition 'Home is Here' said during a recent conversation with reporters. 'Our response to that is that presidential authority in the area of immigration, and particularly the discretion exercised by the executive branch, is very broad and certainly encompasses the type of program that DACA is, which is now a regulation,' Nina Perales, vice president of litigation at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said during the call. A central issue in the case is whether Texas and other states have the standing to sue. Texas and other Republican-led states have argued that DACA has harmed them financially because they are spending resources on education, health care and other services on undocumented immigrants who were allowed to remain in the country illegally. But Perales, who will be one of the attorneys arguing the case in October, said that 'Texas cannot show any injury as a result of DACA' because recipients contribute to their communities and states by paying taxes and more. A final decision could take a while, said Perales, who noted the 5th Circuit could take 'as long as 18 months' to rule. And the case could end in several ways: The 5th Circuit might dismiss the case, send it back to the lower court or rule against DACA, which could then be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. 'One possible scenario is that the 5th Circuit decides [U.S. District] Judge [Andrew] Hanen didn't evaluate the evidence properly and sends the case back to [him],' she said. If that happens, Perales said, DACA recipients might benefit from the current case's legal state, which allows recipients to continue renewing their DACA benefits while awaiting the courts' final resolution. The Biden administration continues to accept new applications but does not process them. How we got here Former President Barack Obama, frustrated with congressional inaction on the Dream Act, created DACA by executive order in 2012. Some DACA recipients arrived legally, but their families later overstayed their visas; others arrived by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border without authorization. They are now in their mid-20s to late 30s, and they come from around the world. In 2018, Texas and other Republican-led states sued the federal government, arguing not only that they were being harmed financially but also that only Congress has the authority to grant immigration benefits. In 2022, the Biden administration revised the program in hopes of satisfying one of the arguments made in federal courts by Republican-led states — that the program was not created properly. Biden officials issued the new version of DACA in late August. It went through a period of public comments as part of a formal rule-making process to increase its odds of surviving this legal battle. In a February 2023 statement, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, wrote in a statement on his website that 'the Obama and Biden programs are practically indistinguishable in both the negative harms that they will have on this country and in the illegal means used to implement them. I am therefore calling for the new DACA rule to end in the same way that the Obama-era rule did: struck down as unlawful.' But DACA has support. In October 2022, a coalition of dozens of influential corporations, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, sent a letter to Republicans and Democrats in Congress urging a bipartisan solution for the almost 600,000 immigrants who are enrolled in DACA. According to the Migration Policy Institute, DACA has 'improved recipients' employment outcomes, increased the labor force participation rates of those who are eligible, decreased their unemployment rates, and boosted earnings for those with the lowest incomes.' MPI's analysis shows that DACA holders contribute 'nearly $42 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product each year and add $3.4 billion to the federal balance sheet.' Bruna Bouhid-Sollod, a former DACA recipient and current senior political director at United We Dream, highlighted the emotional impact of the uncertainty. 'The importance of making [the impact] really clear is really important. … DACA recipients and their families are dealing with an extreme amount of stress,' she said. With renewal periods lasting just two years, many recipients are in constant limbo, unsure if their work permits and deportation protections will remain intact. There is a lot at stake, according to immigration lawyers and advocates. 'Unless you're living in it … you don't think about the impact it has on the people that are waiting for their lives to be decided by this case,' Bouhid-Sollod said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/daca-case-faces-uncertainty-again-as-us-appellate-court-arguments-loom/7780772.html	2024-09-11T17:39:28-07:00	
North Korea fires ballistic missile toward sea, South Korea says	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea fired a ballistic missile toward the sea Thursday morning, South Korea's military said, days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to put his nuclear force fully ready for battle with its rivals. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a brief statement that the launch took place off North Korea's eastern coast but gave no details, such as how far the weapon traveled. Japan's prime minister's office also alerted on its X account that North Korea had launched a suspected ballistic missile, but it did not provide details. The launch was North Korea's first public weapons firing in more than two months. On July 1, North Korea claimed to have tested a new tactical weapon capable of delivering a 'super-large' 4.5 ton-class warhead. In a speech Monday, Kim said he would redouble efforts to make his nuclear force fully ready for combat with the United States and its allies. He said North Korea faced 'a grave threat' because of what he called 'the reckless expansion' of a U.S.-led regional military bloc that is now developing into a nuclear-based one. Kim has made similar vows numerous times, but his latest threat came as outside experts believe North Korea will perform a nuclear test explosion or long-range missile test-launches ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. Last week, North Korea also resumed launches of trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea. Since 2022, North Korea has significantly accelerated its weapons testing in a bid to perfect its capabilities to launch strikes on the U.S. and South Korea. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding military drills that North Korea calls invasion rehearsals. Last month, Kim had held off from missile tests or other provocative military demonstrations as the United States and South Korea conducted large-scale summertime military exercises. North Korea issued statements berating the allies for raising tensions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missile-toward-sea-south-korea-says/7781097.html	2024-09-11T17:25:48-07:00	
Trump falsely accuses immigrants in Ohio of abducting, eating pets	COLUMBUS, Ohio — Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday amplified false rumors that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were abducting and eating pets, repeating during a televised debate the type of inflammatory and anti-immigrant rhetoric he has promoted throughout his campaigns. There is no evidence that Haitian immigrants in an Ohio community are doing that, officials say. But during the debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump specifically mentioned Springfield, Ohio, the town at the center of the claims, saying that immigrants were taking over the city. 'They're eating the dogs. They're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there,' he said. Harris called Trump 'extreme' and laughed after his comment. Debate moderators pointed out that city officials have said the claims are not true. Trump's comments echoed claims made by his campaign, including his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, and other Republicans. The claims attracted attention this week when Vance posted on social media that his office has 'received many inquiries' about Haitian migrants abducting pets. Vance acknowledged Tuesday it was possible 'all of these rumors will turn out to be false.' Officials have said there have been no credible or detailed reports about the claims, even as Trump and his allies use them to amplify racist stereotypes about Black and brown immigrants. While president, Trump questioned why the U.S. would accept people from 's—hole' countries such as Haiti and some in Africa. His 2024 campaign has focused heavily on illegal immigration, often referencing in his speeches crimes committed by migrants. He argues immigrants are responsible for driving up crime and drug abuse in the United States and taking resources from American citizens. Here's a closer look at how the false claims have spread. How did this get started? On September 6, a post surfaced on X that shared what looked like a screengrab of a social media post apparently out of Springfield. The retweeted post talked about the person's 'neighbor's daughter's friend' seeing a cat hanging from a tree to be butchered and eaten, claiming without evidence that Haitians lived at the house. The accompanying photo showed a Black man carrying what appeared to be a Canada goose by its feet. That post continued to be shared on social media. On Monday, Vance posted on X: 'Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country. Where is our border czar?' he said. The next day, Vance posted again on X about Springfield, saying his office had received inquiries from residents who said 'their neighbors' pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants. It's possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false.' Other Republicans shared similar posts. Among them was Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who posted a photo of kittens with a caption that said to vote for Trump 'So Haitian immigrants don't eat us.' Hours before Trump's debate with Harris, he posted two related photos on his social media site. One Truth Social post was a photo of Trump surrounded by cats and geese. Another featured armed cats wearing MAGA hats. A billboard campaign launched by the Republican Party of Arizona at 12 sites in metropolitan Phoenix plays off the false rumors. The billboard image resembles a Chick-fil-A ad, portraying four kittens and urging people to 'Vote Republican!' and 'Eat Less Kittens.' Chick-fil-A said the party didn't reach out to the restaurant chain before running the ad, declining to comment further. In a statement, the state party said the ad humorously underscores the need for border security. What do officials in Ohio say? The office of the Springfield city manager, Bryan Heck, issued a statement knocking down the rumors. 'In response to recent rumors alleging criminal activity by the immigrant population in our city, we wish to clarify that there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community,' Heck's office said in an emailed statement. Springfield police on Monday told the Springfield News-Sun that they had received no reports of stolen or eaten pets. Governor Mike DeWine held a news conference Tuesday to address the influx of Haitian immigrants to Springfield. He said he will send state troopers to Springfield to help local law enforcement deal with traffic issues and is earmarking $2.5 million over two years to provide more primary health care to immigrant families. DeWine declined to address the allegations, deferring comment to local officials. But he repeatedly spoke in support of the people of Haiti, where his family has long operated a charity. What do we know about a separate case 281 km away? An entirely unrelated incident that occurred last month in Canton, Ohio, quickly and erroneously conflated into the discussion. On Aug. 26, Canton police charged a 27-year-old woman with animal cruelty and disorderly conduct after she 'did torture, kill, and eat a cat in a residential area in front (of) multiple people,' according to a police report. But Allexis Ferrell is not Haitian. She was born in Ohio and graduated from Canton's McKinley High School in 2015, according to public records and newspaper reports. Court records show she has been in and out of trouble with the law since at least 2017. Messages seeking comment were not returned by several attorneys who have represented her. She is being held in Stark County jail pending a competency hearing next month, according to the prosecutor's office. What do advocates for Haitian immigrants say? The posts create a false narrative and could be dangerous for Haitians in the United States, according to Guerline Jozef, founder and executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, a group that supports and advocates for immigrants of African descent 'We are always at the receiving end of all kind of barbaric, inhumane narratives and treatments, specifically when it comes to immigration,' Jozef said in a phone interview. Her comments echoed White House national security spokesman John Kirby. 'There will be people that believe it, no matter how ludicrous and stupid it is,' Kirby said. 'And they might act on that kind of information, and act on it in a way where somebody could get hurt. So it needs to stop.' What is the broader context of Haitians in Ohio and the United States? Springfield, a city of roughly 60,000, has seen its Haitian population grow in recent years. It's impossible to give an exact number, according to the city, but it estimates Springfield's entire county has an overall immigrant population of 15,000. The city also says that the Haitian immigrants are in the country legally under a federal program that allows for them to remain in the country temporarily. Last month the Biden administration granted eligibility for temporary legal status to about 300,000 Haitians already in the United States because conditions in Haiti are considered unsafe for them to return. Haiti's government has extended a state of emergency to the entire country due to endemic gang violence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-falsely-accuses-immigrants-in-ohio-of-abducting-eating-pets/7781096.html	2024-09-11T17:19:22-07:00	
Threats in Indo-Pacific fuel debate over US nuclear redeployment	washington — Threats from China, Russia and North Korea have fueled debate in Washington about whether the United States should consider redeploying tactical nuclear weapons to the Indo-Pacific region, with leading U.S. Senate members expressing opposing views. Earlier in May, Republican Senator Roger Wicker, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, put forward a military spending plan that included the idea of redeploying U.S. tactical nuclear arms that were withdrawn from South Korea more than three decades ago. Another Republican, Senator James Risch, who is the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told VOA Korean last month in an email statement that the U.S. should 'explore options for returning nuclear weapons to the Pacific theater for the purpose of strengthening extended deterrence.' The term 'extended deterrence' refers to the U.S. commitment to respond in kind to a nuclear attack on South Korea. Drawing a contrast, Democratic Senator Jack Reed, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Monday in a phone conference that he didn't think that U.S. tactical nuclear weapons should be redeployed to the Korean Peninsula, adding that it could provoke a 'major response from the Chinese.' Redeployment of nukes The U.S. government has made it clear that the U.S. does not plan to redeploy its tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula. 'We believe that the only effective way to reduce nuclear threats on the peninsula is by curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons,' a State Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement to VOA last week. In 1991, the U.S. withdrew from South Korea all of its nuclear weapons, or about 100, according to some studies. The U.S. has been closely watching the growing military cooperation among China, Russia and North Korea, especially in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It has identified the three nations as threats to stability in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. On August 22, the White House confirmed to VOA that a new 'nuclear employment guidance' had been issued. The terms of the classified document are not public, but The New York Times quoted two senior administration officials as saying that it 'seeks to prepare the United States for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and North Korea.' 'The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat,' White House National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said in an email to VOA. 'We have repeatedly voiced concerns about the advancing nuclear arsenals of Russia, PRC [China] and the DPRK [North Korea].' Vipin Narang, who recently served as the acting assistant secretary of defense for space policy, said in an August forum held by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies that the United States may need to seek 'a change in the size or posture' of nuclear forces to deal with threats from China, Russia and North Korea. Growing threats In South Korea, there is growing uneasiness about the U.S. capability to protect South Korea from North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile weapons. North Korea’s state Korean Central News Agency on Sunday released a photo showing the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, inspecting a new 12-axle transporter erector launcher (TEL), which could be used to launch a new, longer missile to potentially attack the United States. The next day, in a speech celebrating the country’s founding anniversary, Kim vowed to increase the number of nuclear weapons 'exponentially.' Amid these geopolitical tensions, U.S.-based experts appear to be divided about whether the U.S. should redeploy tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula. Richard Lawless, former deputy undersecretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security, said the idea that South Korea would be intimidated by China, Russia or South Korea from even beginning a discussion on the subject with Washington 'is failed logic.' 'Many Americans continue to fail to appreciate the threat of North Korea and China, typically playing down the latter.' Robert Peters, a research fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile defense at the Heritage Foundation, told VOA Korean via email that he supported the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea. 'I’m concerned about the credibility of our deterrent in the face of North Korean nuclear expansion and Chinese nuclear breakout,' Peters said, adding that stationing nonstrategic nuclear weapons within the theater gives the U.S. president 'far more optionality when crafting a deterrence message during times of acute crisis or conflict than if he or she could rely solely on strategic nuclear weapons.' Opposing views But Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, said he was against redeploying U.S. tactical nuclear weapons. 'Placing such high-value weapons in a static, fixed bunker makes a very tempting preemptive target for North Korea,' Klingner told VOA Korean on Tuesday via email. 'During a crisis, it could even lower deterrence by making Pyongyang more likely to initiate a preemptive attack on the bunker prior to the weapons being deployed on mobile launch platforms.' Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said he didn't support the redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons to South Korea. 'From a strictly military standpoint, the U.S. can enforce extended deterrence with nuclear-armed submarines and long-range bombers that North Korea cannot defend against,' Samore told VOA Korean on Tuesday via email. 'Politically, redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea would be controversial with some Korean political parties and the Korean public and would increase tensions in the region, especially with China and North Korea, and even between South Korea and Japan,' Samore said. Sydney Seiler, who until last year was the national intelligence officer for North Korea on the U.S. National Intelligence Council, told VOA Korean via email Tuesday that 'there is a consensus among [U.S. and South Korean] leaders and their senior national security advisers that such a redeployment is unnecessary at this time.' The Chinese Embassy in Washington told VOA in an email Tuesday that the Chinese 'firmly oppose any country’s attempt to use the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue to harm China’s strategic security interests.' 'It is hoped that the U.S. can abandon the cold war mentality and hegemonic logic, adopt a rational and responsible nuclear policy, stop nuclear sharing, extended deterrence, expanding nuclear alliance, and other negative moves, and play a constructive role in maintaining regional and global peace and stability,' Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said Tuesday in a written statement via email, responding to an inquiry from VOA Korean.	https://www.voanews.com/a/threats-in-indo-pacific-fuel-debate-over-us-nuclear-redeployment/7780765.html	2024-09-11T16:57:29-07:00

US pledges support for Africa's AI goals	Abuja, Nigeria — The two-day pan-African AI conference co-hosted by the United States concluded Wednesday in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial hub. Hundreds of delegates including public officials, tech leaders, policy makers academics and entrepreneurs attended the conference to hold talks about the development and use of safe, secure and trustworthy AI systems in Africa. The U.S. deputy secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, spoke at the summit about the opportunity at hand. 'A global technology revolution is well under way — the race to develop and deploy new technologies, including artificial intelligence, is already shaping everything about our lives,' said Campbell. 'We aim to foster collaborations between the United States and Africa AI researchers, policy makers and industry leaders, so that we can work together to drive innovation and address common challenges. This will enable us to share the benefits of AI globally.' The conference is a significant step in Africa's technological future. Campbell said artificial intelligence can be used to address problems like global health, food security, education, energy and climate change, and asserted the conference has provided the ground for African voices in AI to shape emerging global AI systems. 'I cannot overstate Africa's growing importance in the global technology landscape,' said Campbell. 'By developing human capital and strengthening research and innovation ecosystems and building and AI ready institutional and regulatory environment, we can help AI work for Africa. The African Union's landmark AI strategy sets the roadmap for African countries to harness AI's potential to achieve developmental aspirations in education, health, agriculture, infrastructure, peace and security and good governance.' In July, the African Union launched the continent's Artificial Intelligence Strategy, saying AI is pivotal in transforming Africa into a global technology hub, and it called on member states to adopt the strategy. On Tuesday, Nigeria's minister of communication, innovation and digital economy, Bosun Tijani, announced a $61,000 grant for Nigeria's brightest AI startups. 'For us to truly harness artificial intelligence for our collective benefits, we must be deliberate and collaborative in our approach,' said Tijani. 'We just ensure that our digital transformation journey is inclusive, equitable and human focused.' Africa currently represents 2.5% of the global AI market, according to the Artificial Intelligence for Development Africa, or AI4D. But analysts say with more talks about safe use, AI applications could boost Africa's economy by $2.9 trillion by the year 2030 with Kenya, South Africa and Nigerian markets taking the lead.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-pledges-support-for-africa-s-ai-goals/7780639.html	2024-09-11T14:10:15-07:00	
International arms embargo on Darfur renewed as fighting rages	United Nations — The U.N. Security Council unanimously renewed for another year an arms embargo on parties in the Darfur region of Sudan, where the war between rival generals has intensified in recent months, exacerbating a dire humanitarian crisis. Sudan’s envoy welcomed the extension but urged the council to go further and sanction the entire Rapid Support Forces militia, the rival of the government-backed Sudanese Armed Forces. 'The militia, in its entirety, really needs to be listed, because it fulfills all the conditions,' Ambassador Al-Harith Idriss Al-Harith Mohamed said. 'There also needs to be an end to the financing of the militia.' The RSF as it is known, has captured most of Darfur, and a battle has been going on since May over North Darfur’s capital, El Fasher, which is the only Darfuri regional capital not to have fallen to the RSF. Sudan’s military has repeatedly accused the United Arab Emirates of supplying the RSF with arms and ammunition smuggled in through neighboring Chad. The UAE strongly denies the accusations. A report by a United Nations panel of experts earlier this year said there was substance to media reports that cargo planes originating in the UAE capital had landed in eastern Chad with arms, ammunition and medical equipment destined for the paramilitary group. At the meeting, Sudan’s envoy accused the UAE of profiting from his nation’s natural resources, including gold and uranium, and he urged the Security Council to act. 'We are calling for clear measures to be taken against those who seek to sabotage the Sudanese economy — namely businesses and companies whose headquarters are in the UAE,' Mohamed said. 'The repetition of baseless allegations does not make them true,' Emirati Ambassador Mohamed Abushahab told the council. He urged the army, known as the SAF, to show 'political courage' and participate in peace talks to end the war. The SAF sat out U.S.- and Saudi-brokered talks in Geneva in August because the UAE was invited to participate. The United States led the negotiations in the council on the renewal of the Darfur arms embargo, which was first put in place in 2004 during the genocide carried out by Arab Janjaweed fighters against non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur. Janjaweed fighters make up elements of today's RSF. 'Renewing the sanctions measures will restrict the movement of arms into Darfur and sanction individuals and entities contributing to, or complicit in, destabilizing activities of Sudan,' U.S. envoy Robert Wood said. 'All of this is critical to helping end the escalating conflict, alleviate humanitarian catastrophe and put Sudan back on the path to stability and security.' The U.S. also has proposed that the Security Council sanction two RSF commanders, but their designation remains in limbo after Russia put a hold on it on August 31. Rights groups said the embargo renewal did not go far enough and should include the whole of Sudan. 'The council should correct this failure as soon as possible and expand the arms restrictions to cover all of Sudan, to limit the flow of arms and curb widespread atrocities being committed in the country,' said Human Rights Watch’s Jean-Baptiste Gallopin. Sudan is facing a massive humanitarian crisis as a result of the war between the rival generals that began in April 2023. More than 10 million people have fled their homes in search of safety, and last month, international monitors confirmed famine in North Darfur. Across the country, the United Nations says, 26 million people are in crisis levels of hunger. Human rights violations are also rife. In June, the RSF and SAF were added to an annual U.N. blacklist for perpetrators of grave violations against children. They were named for violations committed last year, including the killing and maiming of children, for attacking schools and hospitals, and in the case of the RSF, for sexual violence and recruiting and using children in their ranks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/international-arms-embargo-on-darfur-renewed-as-fighting-rages/7780603.html	2024-09-11T13:37:39-07:00	
Aflatoxin kills hundreds of dogs in southern Malawi	Blantyre, Malawi — Malawi has recently recorded the sudden deaths of dogs that consumed meals prepared from maize husks contaminated with aflatoxins. Veterinary experts say the country has recorded 450 dog deaths since April, when the first cases were identified in Malawi’s commercial city, Blantyre. Aflatoxins are toxic substances produced by fungi that grow on pet food ingredients like peanuts, corn and other grains. Experts warn that the accumulation of those toxins in an animal’s body can lead to liver damage, blood clotting and, in severe cases, death. Timothy Banda is the veterinary clinic manager at the Blantyre Society for the Protection and Care of Animals, which has been testing the dogs. He told VOA that symptoms include a yellowish tint on the dog‘s skin, hemorrhagic diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, and sometimes vomiting. 'For the past two, three weeks, we haven’t received any death from the problem,' he said. 'But from the time it started somewhere around April up to somewhere around early August, the estimations could be somewhere around 450 dogs so far have died.' He said the aflatoxin contamination was suspected after it was observed that the dogs were not responding to treatment. 'Under normal circumstances, once we started the right treatment, we could get good results, but in this scenario, they were all dying despite whatever treatment was given. Nothing could work out,' Banda said. Banda said the affected dogs were those fed with nsima, a thick porridge prepared from maize or maize husks. Alfred Manda, a resident of Chirimba township, told VOA that he lost three dogs in August. 'The kind of food I mostly give out to my dogs is nsima flour made from leftover maize called madeya,' he said. 'To me, I thought it was a healthy diet. I wish I knew earlier. I could have done things better to save my dogs, but unfortunately this is the sad reality that I have faced.' Health experts warn that aflatoxins can also cause tumors in the livers of animals and humans. But health officials in Malawi, where maize is the staple food, have not reported any human deaths resulting from consuming contaminated maize. In Zambia, media reports indicate over 400 dogs died in July after consuming maize meal contaminated with aflatoxins. Malawi authorities are advising dog owners to switch to alternative foods, such as rice, until the problem is contained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/aflatoxin-kills-hundreds-of-dogs-in-southern-malawi-/7780590.html	2024-09-11T13:27:06-07:00	
Mexico's Senate OKs controversial judicial overhaul after protesters storm chamber	MEXICO CITY — Mexico's Senate voted early Wednesday to overhaul the country's judiciary, clearing the biggest hurdle for a controversial constitutional revision that will make all judges stand for election, a change that critics fear will politicize the judicial branch and threaten Mexico's democracy. The approval came in two votes after hundreds of protesters pushed their way into the Senate on Tuesday, interrupting the session after it appeared that Morena, the governing party of outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, had lined up the necessary votes to pass the proposal. Judicial employees and law students had protested for weeks, saying the plan, under which all judges would be elected, could threaten judicial independence and undermine the system of checks and balances. The legislation sailed through the lower chamber, where Morena and its allies hold a supermajority, last week. Approval by the Senate posed the biggest obstacle and required defections from opposition parties. Both of the Senate votes were 86-41. The chamber erupted into cheers and chants of 'Yes, we could!' The legislation must now be ratified by the legislatures of at least 17 of Mexico's 32 states. The governing party is believed to have the necessary support after major gains in recent elections. Oaxaca's legislature became the first to ratify it just hours after the Senate's approval. President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, who takes office October 1, congratulated lawmakers on passing the overhaul. The election of judges 'will strengthen the delivery of justice in our country,' Sheinbaum wrote on the social media platform X. 'The regime of corruption and privileges each day is being left farther in the past and a true democracy and true rule of law are being built.' López Obrador acknowledged Wednesday that many are against the plan, but said that 'it's incredibly important to put an end to corruption and impunity. We're going to make a lot of progress when the people can freely elect judges, magistrates and ministers.' Some experts and observers, however, have suggested that the overhaul could have the opposite effect, and allow corrupt individuals and criminals to have more sway over the justice system. On Tuesday evening, just hours after the governing party appeared to have wrangled the votes it needed, protesters with pipes and chains broke into the Senate chamber. The protesters said lawmakers were not listening to their demands. 'The judiciary isn't going to fall,' yelled the protesters, waving Mexican flags and signs opposing the overhaul. They were joined by a number of opposition senators as they chanted in the chamber. Others outside roared when newscasters announced the Senate was taking a recess. Among them was Alejandro Navarrete, a 30-year-old judicial worker who said he and his colleagues, 'knowing the danger the reform represents,' came to call on the Senate to strike down the proposal. 'They have decided to sell out the nation and sell out for political capital they were offered. We felt obligated to enter the Senate,' he said, carrying a Mexican flag. 'Our intention is not violent, we didn't intend to hurt them, but we intend to make it clear that the Mexican people won't allow them to lead us into a dictatorship.' López Obrador, a populist long averse to independent regulatory bodies who has ignored courts and attacked judges, says the plan would crack down on corruption by making it easier to punish judges. Critics say it would handicap the judiciary, stack courts with judges favoring the president's party, allow anyone with a law degree to become a judge and even make it easier for politicians and criminals to influence courts. It has spooked investors and prompted U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar to call it a risk to democracy and an economic threat.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-s-senate-oks-controversial-judicial-overhaul-after-protesters-storm-chamber-/7780547.html	2024-09-11T12:43:21-07:00	
Jordan's Islamist party bounces back in election clouded by Gaza war	AMMAN — Jordan's moderate Islamist opposition made significant gains in Tuesday's parliamentary election, initial official results showed on Wednesday, boosted by anger over Israel's war in Gaza. The Islamist Action Front (IAF) also benefited from a new electoral law that encourages a bigger role for political parties in the 138-seat parliament, though tribal and pro-government factions will continue to dominate the assembly. The IAF, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, won up to a fifth of the seats under the revamped electoral law, which for the first time allocated 41 seats for parties, according to preliminary figures seen by Reuters and confirmed by independent and official sources. 'The Jordanian people have given us their trust by voting for us. This new phase will increase the burden of responsibility for the party towards the nation and our citizens,' Wael al Saqqa, head of the IAF, told Reuters. The IAF win allowed it to capture 31 seats for the first time since parliamentary life was revived in 1989 after decades of martial law. The party has emerged as the largest political grouping in parliament. 'The elections reflect the desire for change and those who voted were not necessarily all Islamists but wanting change and had become fed up with the old ways,' said Murad Adailah, the head of the Muslim Brotherhood. The IAF, the only effective grassroots opposition, praised the authorities for not meddling in polls. Adailah told Reuters their win was a 'popular referendum' that backs their platform of support for the militant Palestinian group Hamas, their ideological allies, and their demand to scrap the country's peace treaty with Israel. In a country where anti-Israel sentiment runs high, they have led some of the largest protests in the region in support of Hamas in what their opponents say allowed them to increase their popularity. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the U.S., U.K., EU and others. The election represents a modest step in a democratization process launched by King Abdullah as he seeks to insulate Jordan from the conflicts at its borders and speed up the slow pace of political reforms. Under Jordan's constitution, most powers still rest with the king who appoints governments and can dissolve parliament. The assembly can force a cabinet to resign by a vote of no confidence. The monarch hopes nascent political parties under the new law will help pave the way for governments that emerge from parliamentary majorities. The voting system still favors sparsely populated tribal and provincial regions over the densely populated cities mostly inhabited by Jordanians of Palestinian descent, which are Islamist strongholds and highly politicized. Turnout among Jordan's 5.1 million eligible voters in Tuesday's poll was low at 32.25%, initial official figures showed, up slightly from 29% at the last election in 2020. The Muslim Brotherhood has been allowed to operate in Jordan since 1946. But it fell under suspicion after the Arab Spring, which saw Islamists pitted against established powers in many Arab countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jordan-s-islamist-party-bounces-back-in-election-clouded-by-gaza-war-/7780493.html	2024-09-11T12:16:13-07:00	
Soyuz craft heads to space station with 2 Russians, 1 American	MOSCOW — A Soyuz spacecraft carrying two Russians and an American blasted off Wednesday for an express trip to the International Space Station. The space capsule atop a towering rocket set off at 1623 GMT from Russia's manned space launch facility in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, and was scheduled to dock with the space station three hours later, in contrast to some missions that last for days. The mission commander is Alexei Ovchinin, with Russian compatriot Ivan Vagner and American Donald Pettit in the crew. The blast-off took place without obvious problems and the Soyuz entered orbit eight minutes after liftoff, a relief for Russian space authorities after an automated safety system halted a launch in March because of a voltage drop in the power system. On the space station, Pettit, Vagner and Ovchinin will join NASA's Tracy Dyson, Mike Barratt, Matthew Dominick, Jeanette Epps, Butch Wilmore, and Suni Williams, and Russians Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.	https://www.voanews.com/a/soyuz-craft-heads-to-space-station-with-2-russians-1-american/7780406.html	2024-09-11T11:45:20-07:00

Afghanistan, Turkmenistan begin work on long-delayed gas pipeline	ISLAMABAD — Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and neighboring Turkmenistan on Wednesday marked the resumption of work on a long-delayed gas pipeline designed to run through the two countries, Pakistan and India. The estimated $10 billion Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India, or TAPI, project is designed to annually transport up to 33 billion cubic meters of Turkmen natural gas from the southeastern Galkynysh field through the proposed 1,800-kilometer pipeline. Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund of the de facto Taliban government traveled to the Turkmen border region of Mary and joined top leaders of the host country to inaugurate construction of a vital section of the TAPI project. It is intended to link the city of Serhetabat in Turkmenistan to Herat in western Afghanistan. Turkmen President Serdar Berdimuhamedov joined and addressed the ceremony via video link. 'This project will benefit not only the economies of the participating countries but also the entire region,' he said. Taliban authorities declared a public holiday in Herat, the capital of the province of the same name, to mark the occasion, with posters celebrating the TAPI project plastered across the border city. Initially signed in the early 1990s to provide natural gas to energy-deficient South Asia, the TAPI project has faced repeated delays due to years of Afghan hostilities, which ended in 2021 when the then-insurgent Taliban recaptured power as all U.S. and NATO forces exited the country. While Turkmen leaders Wednesday pledged to enhance bilateral ties between Ashgabat and Kabul and carry forward the TAPI project, experts remain skeptical that the gas pipeline will become operational soon. They cite funding issues, U.S.-led Western economic sanctions on Afghanistan and the international community’s refusal to recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government over restrictions on Afghan women’s rights. Islamabad’s persistent diplomatic and military tensions with New Delhi are also considered a significant obstacle to the materialization of the TAPI project. According to officials of the participating countries, Pakistan and India, each one plans to purchase 42% of the gas exports, and Afghanistan will receive the rest. Kabul will also earn around $500 million in transit fees annually. Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan deteriorated after the Taliban takeover over terrorism concerns. Islamabad complains that Kabul shelters and facilitates fugitive anti-Pakistan militants to orchestrate cross-border terrorist attacks from Afghan sanctuaries, charges the Taliban reject.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghanistan-turkmenistan-begin-work-on-long-delayed-gas-pipeline/7780374.html	2024-09-11T10:55:13-07:00	
US House Republicans cancel vote on stopgap funding measure	WASHINGTON — U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson canceled a vote scheduled for Wednesday on his stopgap funding bill, saying more work is needed to build support for a measure, less than three weeks before a government shutdown deadline. 'No vote today, because we're in the consensus-building business here in Congress, with small majorities, and that's what you do,' Johnson told reporters at the Capitol. The vote had been set for later on Wednesday. Johnson added that Republicans will be working through the weekend to find a bill that would gain enough votes for passage, now that his measure, opposed by President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats, has faltered. House Republicans have attached a controversial provision requiring people to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote, a measure meant to force Democrats to take stances on the politically charged issue of non-citizen voting, which is already illegal in federal elections. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who continues to falsely claim his 2020 loss was the result of fraud, has urged Republicans to pass the voting measure ahead of the November 5 election. The federal government's fiscal year ends on September 30, when funding for many agencies expires. Without some sort of extension, federal programs not deemed essential would have to suspend many of their operations, forcing thousands of government workers to go on leave. Success for the funding bill was not guaranteed in the chamber that Republicans control by a narrow 220-211 margin. Several House Republicans have said they would vote against the measure, citing spending concerns, and many members of the caucus generally oppose stopgap spending measures. Two Republicans joined Democrats on Tuesday in voting against a procedural move to advance the bill. Democrats broadly see the citizenship registration requirement as meant to undermine confidence in administering elections. 'We're watching a movie we've seen over and over again,' said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday. 'House Republicans are trying to pass a bill so partisan that it even splits their own caucus. This proposal isn't even serious.' The White House on Monday said Biden would veto this funding package were it to pass, citing the 'unrelated cynical' voting requirement. The administration also wants a temporary funding period shorter than six months, as well as more money for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to fix infrastructure damaged by natural disasters. Lawmakers face an even more critical self-imposed deadline on January 1, before which they must act to raise or extend the nation's debt ceiling or risk defaulting on more than $35 trillion in federal government debt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-republicans-cancel-vote-on-stopgap-funding-measure/7780375.html	2024-09-11T10:50:42-07:00

Generation Z drives far-right support in Europe	London — Support for far-right figures among young voters appears to be growing in several European countries. Much of the focus is on Germany, where the Alternative for Germany party (AfD) is hoping to secure another victory in the upcoming Brandenburg state election in the east of the country on September 22. AfD secured a resounding victory in the Thuringia state election earlier this month, winning 32.8% of the vote, well ahead of second-place Christian Democrats at 23.6%. It was the first time the far right had won a state election since the end of World War II in 1945. 'More than a third of young people, almost 40% of 18- to 29-year-olds, [voted] for the AfD,' according to Ben Ansell, a professor at the University of Oxford and host of the podcast 'What’s Wrong with Democracy?' In contrast, only 1 in 5 voters over 70 years of age chose AfD. The party is hoping young voters will propel it to victory in the upcoming Brandenburg state election. '[Other parties] probably expected that the AfD is only a party for old people and that young people don't vote for the AfD. That is exactly wrong,' said AfD chairman in Brandenburg Hans-Christoph Berndt at a recent campaign event. What’s driving the popularity of the far right among younger people? Immigration appears to be a key factor, said Ansell. 'In eastern Germany, [AfD] are just really popular,' he said. 'It’s a part of the country that is poorer than the other parts, that is less ethnically diverse and therefore reacts more to the new diversity than Berlin does, or other parts of Germany.' 'Some people have argued that it's concerns about the war in Ukraine,' Ansell added. 'Other people have argued that it's a response to COVID, or a response to the housing crisis … it's getting on the housing ladder and things like that, having the same quality of life they thought their elders had.' The trend among young voters is not limited to Germany. In June’s European elections, France’s far-right National Rally was the most popular party among 18- to 34-year-olds, with 32% of the vote — much higher than over-65s. National Rally’s 28-year-old president, Jordan Bardella, has 1.6 million followers on TikTok, a social media platform popular among young people. 'TikTok is short videos that aim to shock. The skill that populist parties have in making videos and finding political moments that are short, sharp and shocking — to get people excited about politics,' said Ansell. Meanwhile, a recent study by El País newspaper suggested that a quarter of Spanish men aged between 18 to 26 — known as 'Generation Z' — believe that in some circumstances, authoritarianism may be preferable to democracy. Among the so-called baby-boomer generation, aged 59 and over, the figure is less than 10%. Preference for authoritarianism was also lower among female voters — a trend seen in other countries, said Ansell. 'It’s something that comes out actually most obviously in east Asia — that young men are reacting politically very differently to young women. In [South] Korea, that’s extremely stark, as young men have voted for explicitly anti-feminist movements. But you can see this huge gender gap among the under-30s opening up in all countries, including in the United States right now,' he said. It remains to be seen whether such trends among young voters will be replicated in the United States in the presidential election on November 5. Recent polls suggest the Democrats’ Kamala Harris has increased support among younger voters compared to her Republican rival, Donald Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/generation-z-drives-far-right-support-in-europe-/7780257.html	2024-09-11T09:48:13-07:00

Biden, Harris and Trump visit Sept. 11 site in New York	New York — President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump made a rare joint appearance on Wednesday at the New York City site that marks the Sept. 11 plane attacks in 2001 that killed nearly 3,000 people. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee and Trump, her Republican rival in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, shook hands and exchanged a few words, despite their a contentious debate the night before, then lined up for the commemoration. Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, also attended. Instead of formal remarks, the ceremony at the 'ground zero' site where planes brought down the World Trade Center's twin towers included wives, husbands, sisters, brothers and grandchildren reading the names of family members killed 23 years ago. The annual rite marks the suicide attacks by al Qaeda Islamist militants that hit Manhattan, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field. 'Richard J. O'Connor. We will always love and miss you,' a small red-headed boy said of his grandfather, who was killed in the World Trade Center that morning. A bagpipe and drum processional was accompanied by New York City's fire and police departments and Port Authority honor guards. The national anthem was performed and moments of silence were held at the times each target was struck. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg also attended, standing between Biden and Trump. After New York, Biden and Harris were flying to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where passengers on United Flight 93 overcame the hijackers and the plane crashed in a field, preventing another target from being hit. Then the president and vice president will head back to the Washington area to visit a memorial at the Pentagon. 'On this day 23 years ago, terrorists believed they could break our will and bring us to our knees. They were wrong. They will always be wrong. In the darkest of hours, we found light. And in the face of fear, we came together - to defend our country, and to help one another,' Biden said in an early morning statement. Trump, who also plans to visit the Pennsylvania memorial, told Fox News on Wednesday: 'It was very, very sad, horrible day. There's never been anything like it.' Biden earlier issued a proclamation honoring those who died as a result of the attacks, as well as the hundreds of thousands of Americans who volunteered for military service afterwards. 'We owe these patriots of the 9/11 Generation a debt of gratitude that we can never fully repay,' Biden said, citing deployments to Afghanistan, Iraq and other war zones, as well as the capture and killing of Sept. 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden and his deputy. U.S. congressional leaders on Tuesday posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal to 13 service members who were killed in the Aug. 26, 2021, suicide bombing at Kabul's airport during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7780183.html	2024-09-11T08:46:35-07:00	
Hellish' scene unfolds as wildfire races toward California mountain community	TRABUCO CANYON, California — Alex Luna, a 20-year-old missionary, saw the sky turn from a cherry red to black in about 90 minutes as an explosive wildfire raced toward the Southern California mountain community of Wrightwood and authorities implored residents to leave their belongings behind and get out of town. 'It was very, I would say, hellish-like,' Luna said Tuesday night. 'It was very just dark. Not a good place to be at that moment. ... Ash was falling from the sky like if it was snowing.' Luna was among those who heeded the evacuation order that was issued for the community of about 4,500 in the San Gabriel Mountains east of Los Angeles. The Bridge Fire, which had burned 189 square kilometers (73 square miles) as of late Tuesday with no containment, is one of three major wildfires burning in Southern California and endangering tens of thousands of homes and other structures. The fires sprung to life during a triple-digit heat wave that finally broke Wednesday. The cooler temperatures brought the prospect of firefighters finally making headway against the flames. Other major fires were burning across the West, including in Idaho, Oregon and Nevada, where about 20,000 people had to flee a blaze outside Reno. In Northern California, a fire that started Sunday burned at least 30 homes and commercial buildings and destroyed 40 to 50 vehicles in Clearlake City, 175 kilometers (109 miles) north of San Francisco. Roughly 4,000 people were forced to evacuate. California is only now heading into the teeth of the wildfire season but already has seen nearly three times as much acreage burn than during all of 2023. Evacuation orders were expanded Tuesday night in Southern California as the fires grew and included parts of the popular ski town of Big Bear. Some 65,600 homes and buildings were under threat by the Line Fire, including those under mandatory evacuations and those under evacuation warnings, nearly double the number from the previous day. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department announced Tuesday that a Norco man suspected of starting the Line Fire in Highland on September 5 had been arrested and charged with arson. He was held in lieu of $80,000 bail. Residents along the southern edge of Big Bear Lake were told to leave the area, which is a popular destination for anglers, bikers and hikers. As of late Tuesday, the blaze had charred more than 140 square kilometers (54 square miles) of grass and brush with 14% containment, according to CalFire. It blanketed the area with a thick cloud of dark smoke. The fire impacted key radio towers, including communication channels for those responding to the fire. Cooler weather could moderate fire activity toward the end of the week, CalFire said in an update. Public safety power shut-offs were anticipated in parts of the Big Bear and Bear Valley areas. The acrid air prompted several districts in the area to close schools through the end of the week because of safety concerns. Three firefighters have been injured since the blaze was reported Thursday, state fire managers said. For Wrightwood, a picturesque town 124 kilometers (77 miles) east of Los Angeles known for its 1930’s cabins. threatening wildfires have become a regular part of life. Authorities expressed frustration in 2016 when only half the residents heeded orders to leave. Janice Quick, the president of the Wrightwood Chamber of Commerce, lives a few miles outside town. Late Tuesday afternoon she was eating lunch outside with friends and they were rained on by embers the size of her thumbnail that hit the table and made a clinking sound. A friend texted to tell her that the friend's home had been consumed by fire, while another friend was watching through her ring camera as embers rained down on her home. 'I've never seen anything like this and I've been through fires before,' said Quick, who has lived in Wrightwood for 45 years. In neighboring Orange County, firefighters used bulldozers, helicopters and planes to control a rapidly spreading blaze called the Airport Fire that started Monday and spread to about 8 square kilometers (3 square miles) in only a few hours. The blaze was ignited by a spark from heavy equipment being used by public workers, officials said. By Tuesday night, it had charred more than 78 square kilometers (30 square miles) and was heading over mountainous terrain into neighboring Riverside County with no containment, said Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Steve Concialdi. It burned some communications towers on top of a peak, though so far officials said they did not have reports of the damage disrupting police or fire communication signals in the area. Concialdi said the fire was burning away from homes in Orange County, but there are 36 recreational cabins in the area. He said authorities don't yet know if the cabins were damaged or destroyed by the blaze. Two firefighters who suffered heat-related injuries and a resident who suffered from smoke inhalation were treated at a hospital and released. Sherri Fankhauser, her husband and her daughter set up lawn chairs and were watching helicopters make water drops on a flaming hillside a few hundred yards away from their Trabuco Canyon home on Tuesday. They didn't evacuate even though their street had been under a mandatory evacuation order since Monday. A neighbor did help Fankhauser's 89-year-old mother-in-law evacuate, Fankhauser said. The flames died down last night but flared up again in the morning. 'You can see fire coming over the ridge now,' Fankhauser said Tuesday afternoon. 'It's getting a little scarier now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hellish-scene-unfolds-as-wildfire-races-toward-california-mountain-community-/7780144.html	2024-09-11T08:27:52-07:00

Samsung Electronics plans global job cuts of up to 30%, sources say	SEOUL/NEW DELHI — Samsung Electronics, the world's top maker of smartphones, TVs and memory chips, is cutting up to 30% of its overseas staff at some divisions, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. South Korea-based Samsung has instructed subsidiaries worldwide to reduce sales and marketing staff by about 15% and the administrative staff by up to 30%, two of the sources said. The plan will be implemented by the end of this year and would impact jobs across the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa, one person said. Six other people familiar with the matter also confirmed Samsung's planned global headcount reduction. It is not clear how many people would be let go and which countries and business units would be most affected. The sources declined to be named because the scope and details of the job cuts remained confidential. In a statement, Samsung said workforce adjustments conducted at some overseas operations were routine, and aimed at improving efficiency. It said there are no specific targets for the plans, adding that they are not impacting its production staff. Samsung employed a total of 267,800 people as of the end of 2023, and more than half, or 147,000 employees, are based overseas, according to its latest sustainability report. Manufacturing and development accounted for most of those jobs and sales and marketing staff was around 25,100, while 27,800 people worked in other areas, the report said. The 'global mandate' on job cuts was sent about three weeks ago, and Samsung's India operation was already offering severance packages to some mid-level employees who have left in recent weeks, one of the direct sources said. The total employees who may need to leave the India unit could reach 1,000, the person added. Samsung employs some 25,000 people in India. In China, Samsung has notified its staff about the job cuts that are expected to affect about 30% of its employees at its sales operation, a South Korean newspaper reported this month. Big challenges The job cuts come as Samsung grapples with mounting pressure on its key units. Its bread-and-butter chip business has been slower than its rivals in recovering from a severe downturn in the industry that drove its profit to a 15-year low last year. In May, Samsung replaced the head of its semiconductor division in a bid to overcome a 'chip crisis' as it seeks to catch up with smaller rival SK Hynix in supplying high-end memory chips used in artificial intelligence chipsets. In the premium smartphone market, Samsung is facing stiff competition from Apple and China's Huawei, while it has long lagged behind TSMC in contract chip manufacturing. And in India, which earns Samsung around $12 billion in annual revenue, a strike over wages is disrupting production. One of the sources familiar with the plans said the job cuts were being made in preparation for a slowdown in global demand for technology products as the global economy slows. Another source said Samsung is seeking to shore up its bottom line by saving costs. It was not immediately clear if Samsung will also cut jobs in its headquarters in South Korea. One of the sources said Samsung would find it difficult to lay off workers in South Korea because it was a politically sensitive issue. Conglomerate Samsung Group, of which the electronics giant is the crown jewel, is the country's biggest employer and plays a key role in its economy. Job cuts could also stir labor unrest at home. A South Korean workers' union at Samsung Electronics recently went on strike for several days, demanding higher wages and benefits. Shares in Samsung Electronics, South Korea's most valuable stock, are trading at their lowest level in 16 months on Wednesday, as some analysts cut their profit estimates for the company recently, citing a weak recovery in demand for smartphones and personal computers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/samsung-electronics-plans-global-job-cuts-of-up-to-30-sources-say-/7780071.html	2024-09-11T08:03:47-07:00	
AI not a US election gamechanger yet	Washington — When the U.S. announced the seizure of 32 internet domains tied to Russian efforts to ply American voters with disinformation ahead of November’s presidential election, prosecutors were quick to note the use of artificial intelligence, or AI. The Russian operation, known as Doppelganger, drove internet and social media users to the fake news using a variety of methods, the charging documents said, including advertisements that were 'in some cases created using artificial intelligence.' AI tools were also used to 'generate content, including images and videos, for use in negative advertisements about U.S. politicians,' the indictment added. And Russia is far from alone in turning to AI in the hopes of swaying U.S. voters. 'The primary actors we've seen for election use of this are Iran and Russia, although as various private companies have noticed, China also has used artificial intelligence for spreading divisive narratives in the United States,' according to a senior intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive information. 'What we've seen is artificial intelligence is used by foreign actors to make their content more quickly and convincingly tailor their synthetic content in both audio and video forms,' the official added. But other U.S. officials say the use of AI to spread misinformation and disinformation in the lead-up to the U.S. election has so far failed to live up to some of the more dire warnings about how deepfakes and other AI-generated material could shake-up the American political landscape. 'Generative AI is not going to fundamentally introduce new threats to this election cycle,' according to Cait Conley, senior adviser to the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the U.S. agency charged with overseeing election security. 'What we're seeing is consistent with what we expected to see,' Conley told VOA. AI 'is exacerbating existing threats, in both the cyber domain and the foreign malign influence operation-disinformation campaigns,' she said. But little of what has been put out to this point has shocked officials at CISA or the myriad state and local governments who run elections across the country. 'This threat vector is not new to them,' Conley said. 'And they have taken the measures to ensure they're prepared to respond effectively.' As an example, Conley pointed to the rash of robocalls that targeted New Hampshire citizens ahead of the state’s first in the nation primary in January, using fake audio of U.S. President Joe Biden to tell people to stay home and 'save your vote.' New Hampshire's attorney general quickly went public, calling the robocalls an apparent attempt to suppress votes and telling voters the incident was under investigation. This past May, prosecutors indicted a Louisiana political consultant in connection with the scheme. More recently, the alleged use of AI prompted a celebrity endorsement in the U.S. presidential race by pop star Taylor Swift. 'Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site,' Swift wrote in an Instagram social media post late Tuesday. 'It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,' she wrote, adding, 'I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.' But experts and analysts say for all the attention AI is getting, the use of such technology in attacks and other influence operations has been limited. 'There's not a tremendous amount of it in the wild that's particularly successful right now, at least to my knowledge,' said Katie Gray, a senior partner at In-Q-Tel, the CIA's technology-focused, not-for-profit strategic investment firm. 'Most attackers are not using the most sophisticated methods to penetrate systems,' she said on September 4 at a cybersecurity summit in Washington. Others suggest that at least for the moment, the fears surrounding AI have outpaced its usefulness by malicious actors. ‘We jump to the doomsday science fiction,' said Clint Watts, a former FBI special agent and counterterror consultant who heads up the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC). 'But instead, what we're seeing is the number one challenge to all of this right now is access, just getting to the [AI] tools and accessing them,' he said, speaking like Gray at the cybersecurity summit. Over the past 14 months, MTAC has logged hundreds of instances of AI use by China, Russia and Iran, Watts said. And analysts found that Moscow and Tehran, in particular, have struggled to get access to a fully AI toolbox. The Russians 'need to use their own tools from the start, rather than Western tools, because they're afraid they'll get knocked off those systems,' Watts said. Iran is even further behind. 'They've tried different tools,' Watts said. 'They just can't get access to most of them for the most part.' U.S. adversaries also appear to be having difficulties with the underlying requirements to make AI effective. 'To do scaled AI operations is not cheap,' Watts said. 'Some of the infrastructure and the resources of it [AI], the models, the data it needs to be trained [on] – very challenging at the moment.' And Watts said until the products generated by AI get better, attempted deepfakes will likely have trouble resonating with the targeted audiences. 'Audiences have been remarkably brilliant about detecting deepfakes in crowds. The more you watch somebody, the more you realize a fake isn't quite right,' according to Watts. 'The Russian actors that we've seen, all of them have tried deepfakes and they've moved back to bread and butter, small video manipulations.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-not-a-us-election-gamechanger-yet/7780093.html	2024-09-11T08:03:15-07:00

Generation Z drives far-right support in Europe	Support for the far-right among young voters appears to be growing in several European countries – not least in Germany, where the AfD party is hoping to secure another victory in an upcoming state election.

Workers' protest grounds flights at Kenya's main airport	Nairobi — Hundreds of workers at Kenya's main international airport demonstrated on Wednesday against a planned deal between the government and a foreign investor. Planes have remained grounded, with hundreds of passengers stranded at the airport. The government has said that the build-and-operate agreement with India's Adani Group would see the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport modernized, and an additional runway and terminal constructed, in exchange for the group running the airport for 30 years. Kenya Airport Workers Union, in announcing the strike, said that the deal would lead to job losses and 'inferior terms and conditions of service' for those who will remain. Kenya Airways on Wednesday announced there would be flight delays and possible cancellations because of the ongoing strike at the airport, which serves Nairobi. The strike has affected local flights coming from the port city of Mombasa and the lake city of Kisumu, where delays have been reported by local media. At the main airport, police officers had taken up security check-in roles with long lines seen outside the departure terminals and worried passengers unable to confirm if their flights would depart as scheduled. The Kenya Airports Authority said in a statement that it was 'engaging relevant parties to normalize operations' and urged passengers to contact respective airlines to confirm flight status. The Central Organization of Trade Unions' secretary-general, Francis Atwoli, told journalists at the airport that the strike would have been averted had the government listened to the workers. 'This was a very simple matter where the assurance to workers in writing that our members will not lose jobs and their jobs will remain protected by the government and as is required by law and that assurance alone, we wouldn't have been here,' he said. Last week, airport workers had threatened to go on strike, but the plans were called off pending discussions with the government. The spotting of unknown people moving around with airport officials taking notes and photographs raised concerns that the Indian firm officials were readying for the deal, local media outlets reported last week. The High Court on Monday temporarily halted the implementation of the deal until a case filed by the Law Society and the Kenya Human Rights Commission is heard.	https://www.voanews.com/a/workers-protest-grounds-flights-at-kenya-s-main-airport/7779969.html	2024-09-11T06:32:57-07:00	
Gunmen kill Pakistan polio vaccinator and police guard near Afghan border	Islamabad — Gunmen in northwestern Pakistan killed an anti-polio worker and a policeman guarding him Wednesday, the second attack on healthcare teams trying to carry out a national immunization campaign against the paralytic virus. Area officials reported that the assailants targeted a polio team providing vaccine to children in the Bajaur district, bordering Afghanistan. The attack also injured a policeman. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the deadly attack in one of the militancy-hit districts of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The start of the immunization campaign Monday was marred by a roadside bombing of a polio vaccination team in the province’s South Waziristan district. That attack resulted in injuries to at least ten people, including three vaccinators and six police personnel. An Afghanistan-based Islamic State affiliate known as Islamic State-Khorasan reportedly claimed responsibility for the deadly blast. Militants in violence-affected districts often target polio vaccinators, suspecting them of spying on behalf of Pakistani security forces. Such attacks have killed dozens of vaccinators and police personnel escorting them in past years, mostly in areas near or adjacent to the Afghan border, dealing critical blows to polio eradication efforts. On Monday, the Pakistan Polio Eradication Program said that the country of about 240 million is facing an 'intense outbreak' of wild poliovirus this year, paralyzing 17 children so far nationwide. It reported that sewage samples tested positive in 66 districts for the highly contagious virus, threatening more children. The program noted that the ongoing house-to-house campaign aims to vaccinate more than 33 million children under five in 115 districts nationwide. Pakistan and Afghanistan, which reported nine paralytic polio cases so far in 2024, are the only two remaining polio-endemic countries globally. Polio immunization drives in both countries, which share a nearly 2,600-kilometer border, have long faced multiple challenges, such as security and vaccine boycotts, which have set back the goal of eradicating the virus from the globe. Officials at the World Health Organization have reported an improvement in Afghan vaccination efforts since the Islamist Taliban retook control of the country three years ago, ending years of nationwide hostilities and enabling polio teams to inoculate children in previously inaccessible areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunmen-kill-pakistan-polio-vaccinator-and-police-guard-near-afghan-border/7779922.html	2024-09-11T06:04:01-07:00	
US inflation reaches 3-year low as Federal Reserve prepares to cut interest rates	Washington — The post-pandemic spike in U.S. inflation eased further last month as year-over-year price increases reached a three-year low, clearing the way for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates next week. Wednesday’s report from the Labor Department showed that consumer prices rose 2.5% in August from a year earlier. It was the fifth straight annual drop and the smallest such increase since February 2021. From July to August, prices rose just 0.2%. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core prices rose 3.2% in August from 12 months earlier, the same as in July. On a month-to-month basis, core prices rose 0.3% last month, a pickup from July's 0.2% increase. Economists closely watch core prices, which typically provide a better read of future inflation trends. For months, cooling inflation has provided gradual relief to America’s consumers, who were stung by the price surges that erupted three years ago, particularly for food, gas, rent and other necessities. Inflation peaked in mid-2022 at 9.1%, the highest rate in four decades. Fed officials have signaled that they’re increasingly confident that inflation is falling back to their 2% target and are now shifting their focus to supporting the job market, which is steadily cooling. As a result, the policymakers are poised to begin cutting their key rate from its 23-year high in hopes of bolstering growth and hiring. A modest quarter-point cut is widely expected next week. Over time, a series of rate cuts should reduce the cost of borrowing across the economy, including for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The latest inflation figures could inject themselves into the presidential race in its final weeks. Former President Donald Trump has heaped blame on Vice President Kamala Harris for the jump in inflation, which erupted in early 2021 as global supply chains seized up, causing severe shortages of parts and labor. Harris has proposed subsidies for home buyers and builders in an effort to ease housing costs and backs a federal ban on price-gouging for groceries. Trump has said he would boost energy production to try to reduce overall inflation. A key reason why inflation eased again in August was that gas prices tumbled by about 10 cents a gallon last month, according to the Energy Inflation Administration, to a national average of about $3.29. Economists also expect the government’s measures of grocery prices and rents to rise more slowly. Though food prices are roughly 20% more expensive than before the pandemic, they have barely budged over the past year. Another potential driver of slower inflation is that the cost of new apartment leases has started to cool as a stream of newly built apartments have been completed. According to the real estate brokerage Redfin, the median rent for a new lease rose just 0.9% in August from a year earlier, to $1,645 a month. But the government’s measure includes all rents, including those for people who have been in their apartments for months or years. It takes time for the slowdown in new rents to show up in the government’s data. In July, rental costs rose 5.1% from a year ago, according to the government’s consumer price index. Americans’ paychecks are also growing more slowly — an average of about 3.5% annually, still a solid pace — which reduces inflationary pressures. Two years ago, wage growth was topping 5%, a level that can force businesses to sharply raise prices to cover their higher labor costs. In a high-profile speech last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that inflation was coming under control and suggested that the job market was unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure. Consumers have propelled the economy for the past three years. But they are increasingly turning to debt to maintain their spending and credit card, and auto delinquencies are rising, raising concerns that they may have to rein in their spending soon. Reduced consumer spending could lead more employers to freeze their hiring or even cut jobs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-inflation-reaches-a-3-year-low-as-federal-reserve-prepares-to-cut-interest-rates-/7779927.html	2024-09-11T06:03:09-07:00	
European business confidence in China is at an all-time low, report says	HONG KONG — China must reprioritize economic growth and reforms and boost investor confidence by leveling the playing field for all companies in the country, a European business group said Wednesday. With 'business confidence now at an all-time low' over lagging domestic demand and overcapacity in certain industries, the annual European Business in China Position Paper called on China to open its economy and allow a more free market to determine resource allocation. It also recommended introducing policies to boost domestic demand. Profit margins in China are at or below the global average for two-thirds of the companies surveyed earlier in the year, according to the paper published Wednesday by the European Chamber of Commerce in China. In August, China filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization over European Union tariffs on electric vehicles made in China. It also launched anti-dumping and subsidies investigations of European dairy products, brandy and pork exports. The tit-for-tat actions have raised fears that a trade war may break out. Many European businesses are deciding that the returns on investments in the world's second-largest economy are not worth the risks, due to issues including China's economic slowdown and a politicized business environment. 'For some European headquarters and shareholders, the risks of investing in China are beginning to outright the returns, a trend that will only intensify if key business concerns are left unaddressed,' Jens Eskelund, president of China's European Union Chamber of Commerce, said in a message at the beginning of the paper. The European Chamber's paper proposes over 1,000 recommendations for China to resolve challenges and problems faced by European businesses operating in the country and boost investor confidence. Among them are calls for China to refrain from punishing companies for the actions of their home governments. Others include ensuring that policy packages for attracting foreign investment are followed by implementation, and refraining from 'erratic policy shifts.' The report also recommended that the EU proactively engage with China and keep its responses 'measured and proportionate' when disagreements arise.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-business-confidence-in-china-is-at-an-all-time-low-report-says-/7779873.html	2024-09-11T05:00:01-07:00	
Wagner lost veteran fighters in Mali ambush, in setback to Russia's Africa campaign	LONDON/DAKAR — Among the dozens of Wagner mercenaries presumed dead after a lethal battle with Tuareg rebels during a desert sandstorm in Mali in July were Russian war veterans who survived tours in Ukraine, Libya and Syria, according to interviews with relatives and a review of social media data. The loss of such experienced fighters exposes dangers faced by Russian mercenary forces working for military juntas, which are struggling to contain separatists and powerful offshoots of Islamic State and Al Qaeda across the arid Sahel region in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. The Mali defeat raises doubts over whether Moscow, which has admitted funding Wagner and has absorbed many of its fighters into a defense ministry force, will do better than Western and U.N. troops recently expelled by the juntas, six officials and experts who work in the region said. By cross-referencing public information with online posts from relatives and fighters, speaking to seven relatives and using facial recognition software to analyze battlefield footage verified by Reuters, the news agency was able to identify 23 fighters missing in action and two others taken into Tuareg captivity after the ambush near Tinzaouaten, a town on the Algerian border. Several of the men had survived the siege of Bakhmut in Ukraine, which Wagner's late founder Yevgeny Prigozhin called a 'meat grinder.' Others had served in Libya, Syria and elsewhere. Some were former Russian soldiers, at least one of whom had retired after a full-length army career. Grisly footage of dead fighters has now circulated online, and some of relatives told Reuters the bodies of their husbands and sons had been abandoned in the desert. Reuters could not confirm how many of the men it identified were dead. Margarita Goncharova said her son, Vadim Evsiukov, 31, was first recruited in prison where he was serving a drug-related sentence in 2022. He rose through the ranks in Ukraine to lead a platoon of 500 men, she said. After coming home, he worked as a tailor but struggled with survivor's guilt and secretly traveled to Africa in April to join his former commander, she said. 'He wanted to fly to Africa many times. I discouraged him as much as I could,' Goncharova said in an interview with Reuters. 'I told him 'fate has given you a once-in-a-million chance. You can start your life again; you've won such a crazy lottery'.' The Russian Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Wagner did not respond to requests for comment for this story. After Prigozhin died in August last year, Wagner employees were invited to join a newly created group called the Africa Corps, under the defense ministry, 'to fight for justice and the interests of Russia,' according to the Africa Corps channel on social-media platform Telegram. On the channel, Africa Corps says about half its personnel are former Wagner employees who it allows to use Wagner insignia. Wagner's social media channels remain active. The Russian government has not publicly commented on the Tinzaouaten battle. Mali's armed forces-led government said the defeat had no impact on its goals. The Malian Armed Forces 'are committed to restoring the authority of the state throughout the country,' army spokesman Colonel Major Souleymane Dembele told Reuters. Wagner has acknowledged heavy losses in the Mali ambush but gave no figure. The Malian army, which fought alongside the Russians, also did not give a toll. Tuareg rebels, who are fighting for an independent homeland, said they had killed 84 Russians and 47 Malians. Reuters could not independently establish how many were killed in battle. One video, out of more than 20 sent to Reuters by a Tuareg rebel spokesman, showed at least 47 bodies, mostly white men, in military-style uniforms lying in the desert. Reuters verified the location and date of the video. Mikhail Zvinchuk, a prominent blogger close to the Russian defense ministry, said on social media platform RuTube in August that the defeat showed Wagner fighters who arrived from Ukraine had underestimated the rebels and the Al Qaeda fighters. Missing in action Wagner-linked Telegram accounts named two of the dead as Nikita Fedyakin, the administrator of The Grey Zone, a popular Wagner-focused Telegram channel with over half a million subscribers, and Sergei Shevchenko, who the accounts described as the unit commander. Reuters could not verify the identity of Shevchenko. Reuters separately identified 23 Wagner operators missing in Mali via relatives who posted in an official Wagner Telegram chat group, checking the names against social media accounts, publicly available data and facial recognition software. All the relatives received calls from Wagner recruiters on Aug. 6 to notify them their men were missing in action, they said in the chat group. Lyubov Bazhenova told Reuters she had no idea her son Vladimir Akimov, 25, who had briefly served in Russia's elite airborne forces as a conscript, had signed up. She was angry with Wagner for sharing no further information about his fate or the whereabouts of his body. She said letters to the prosecutor's office, defense ministry and foreign ministry had gone unanswered. Facial-recognition software was used to identify another two men captured by Tuareg fighters, based on photographs and videos of the ambush site published by Tuareg sources. The Tuareg rebels posted videos and photos of the two captives on social media. Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane, a spokesman for the rebel alliance, confirmed the men were in rebel captivity as of late August. One of the missing fighters, Alexei Kuzekmaev, 47, had no military experience, his wife Lyudmila Kuzekmaeva told Reuters. 'Neither my hysterics, nor tears, nor persuasion - nothing helped. He just confronted me a month before he left home. He said 'I bought a ticket and will be leaving.'' Among the most experienced men was Alexander Lazarev, 48, a Russian army veteran who served in wars against Chechen separatists in the 1990s and 2000s, according to his wife's posts in the Wagner channel. She declined to comment. Lazarev appears in many photos on the Russian Facebook equivalent VKontakte wearing military uniform, with symbols linked to several army subdivisions. Parastatal mercenary force Democratic governments in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger were overthrown since 2020 in a series of coups driven by anger with corrupt leaders and a near decade of failed Western efforts to fight insurgencies that have killed thousands and displaced millions. The military juntas have kicked out French and U.S. troops and U.N. peacekeepers. In Africa, Wagner emerged in Sudan in 2017 as the deniable face of Russian operations. Its enterprises soon ranged from protecting African coup leaders to gold mining and fighting jihadists. Wagner is also active in Central African Republic. It first appeared in Mali in late 2021. Wagner's fortunes rose and fell last year. In May, the group led Russia to its first significant Ukrainian battlefield victory in almost a year with the capture of Bakhmut. But after his criticism of Russian military leaders and his effort to lead a rebellion weeks after the Bakhmut victory, Prigozhin died in a fiery plane crash in August. The Kremlin has rejected as an 'absolute lie' U.S. officials' claim that Putin had Prigozhin killed. Eric Whitaker, the top U.S. envoy to Burkina Faso until retiring in June, who previously served in Niger, Mali and Chad, said the Putin administration has achieved complete control over the Wagner brand in the post-Prigozhin era. 'Africa Corps earns (the Russian government) hard-currency payments from host governments for its services and also gains a significant sources of revenue from gold derived from its activities in the Sahel,' he said. Russian mercenary activity soared in Mali after Africa Corps was formed, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a U.S.-based crisis-monitoring group. Based on media reports and social media documenting, the data shows violent events linked to Russian mercenaries rose 81% and reported civilian fatalities rose 65% over the past year, compared to the year before Prigozhin's death. Wagner does not publish recruitment figures. Jędrzej Czerep, an analyst at Warsaw-based think tank Polish Institute of International Affairs, estimated that around 6,000 Russian mercenaries serve in Africa, while three diplomatic sources said about 1,500-2,000 were in Mali. 'When Africa Corps started to promote and recruit, they were flooded with applications,' said Czerep. 'Being sent to one of the African missions was seen as far safer than Ukraine,' he said. Tuareg spokesman Ramadane said the rebel alliance was preparing for more clashes. Further losses could eventually drive Russia out, said Tibor Nagy, the top U.S. envoy to Africa in 2019, when Wagner withdrew from northern Mozambique months after around a dozen of its men were killed during a conflict with an Islamic State affiliate. 'They were out of there very quickly,' said Nagy. Wagner has not publicly commented on its plans in Mali.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wagner-lost-veteran-fighters-in-mali-ambush-in-setback-to-russia-s-africa-campaign-/7779865.html	2024-09-11T04:49:18-07:00	
China, Philippines to discuss South China Sea dispute amid clashes	Taipei, Taiwan — As China is set to host bilateral talks with the Philippines this month, their South China Sea dispute is expanding from sea to air, increasing the risk of military confrontation, analysts warn. The Chinese Communist Party’s People’s Daily newspaper on Monday published an article warning that 'China-Philippines relations stand at a crossroads' over the South China Sea dispute. The warning came after Filipino Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo told reporters at a diplomatic reception on September 4 that Beijing will host the next round of the Bilateral Consultative Mechanism meetings designed to manage differences between the two countries. Manalo did not say on which date the talks would start this month but expressed hope the two countries would discuss an incident in late August when coast guard ships from both sides collided at a disputed shoal. Both countries blame the other for the collision, though video released by the Philippine coast guard appears to show the Chinese coast guard ship ramming their vessel, BRP Teresa Magbanua. It was the second such collision of their coast guard ships in August at the disputed atoll. Vincent Kyle Parada, a former defense analyst for the Philippine Navy and a graduate student at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, says the frequency of the sea clashes is pushing the two sides to expand their operations to the air. 'Over the past few weeks, China has been actively working to disrupt resupply missions to the ship and crew, to the point that after one such failed attempt, the Philippine government announced that essential supplies reached critical levels,' he told VOA Mandarin. 'Manila did manage to resupply BRP Teresa Magbanua through a helicopter, signaling this potential shift.' Parada added, 'This potential shift from maritime to aerial resupply emissions in the future is obviously a risk because China has also been escalating aerial operations in the South China Sea. 'Beijing would increase its aerial presence in the Spratlys and send fighter jets to its artificial islands for extended deployments. I think the goal there really would be to make aerial resupply emissions an incredibly dangerous policy option for Manila. That way, it limits Manila's ability to sustain a long-term presence in the disputed territories.' According to the latest data from the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, the administration of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has lodged 176 diplomatic protests with the Chinese government, which claims almost the entire South China Sea, putting it in conflict with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and researcher at Xuanyuan (Hong Kong) Science and Technology Exchange Center, says any Chinese military moves in the airspace over the South China Sea are due to what he calls 'illegal expansion' by the Philippines. 'Whether it's Scarborough Shoal, Second Thomas Shoal or Sabina Shoal, these are all China's sovereign territories,' he told VOA Mandarin, repeating Beijing’s claims. 'If the Philippines wants to conduct patrols or resupply by air, this in itself is violating the security of China's airspace, and China will inevitably take certain measures to intercept it.' An article published on September 2 by the Beijing-based think tank South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative says since 2024, the Philippines has 'repeatedly dispatched military aircraft to invade the islands and reefs of Spratly Islands and Macclesfield Bank' and also sent military aircraft to carry out airdrops and replenishment missions over the sea, indicating that 'air intrusion is becoming another major path for the Philippines to cause trouble in the South China Sea.' The article warned that if the Philippines insists on carrying out an 'air invasion,' China will have to take corresponding measures, and 'once there is friction or even collision, the consequences will be much more serious than the collision with a ship.' Su Tzu-yun, a research fellow and director at the Division of Defense Strategy and Resources in Taiwan, says China is more likely to take coercive actions in the air, making it difficult for the Philippines to defend its sovereignty. 'China may first take measures to interfere, as it does with the United States and Australian military aircraft, and it will scatter thermal flares to interfere so that Philippine helicopters may not be able to get close,' Su told VOA Mandarin. 'It may use jets to create turbulence, meaning it uses air from the jet tail to interfere with the Philippine helicopter when it’s flying.' Su says Beijing is taking more aggressive interception actions, which greatly increase the risk of accidental conflict. 'The number of Chinese ships has increased. Second, coupled with the previous conflict between China and the Philippines in the sea, which caused injuries to Philippine coast guards, and now it threatens to use stronger means against the Philippine so-called aircraft, so it is moving the definition of gray zone operations closer to the direction of war.' Philippine National Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro in August said the Philippines plans to purchase 40 new multirole fighter jets and mid-range missiles to strengthen its territorial defense, Reuters reported. The U.S. in July repeated its commitment to the Philippines’ security after China’s increasingly assertive actions in the South China Sea. US reiterates 'ironclad' commitment to Philippines amid China actions in South China Sea. Parts of the disputed South China Sea are believed to be rich in oil and gas, and the waters are an important transit point for trillions of dollars in annual shipping. The Hague-based intergovernmental Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016 unanimously ruled that China’s claim to almost all the South China Sea had 'no legal basis,' which Beijing rejected.

Indonesia's dwindling middle class seen dimming economic outlook	KARAWANG, Indonesia — Rahmat Hidayat lost his job when the shoe factory he worked for closed down last year in the industrial town of Karawang in Indonesia's West Java. The 44-year-old now earns less than half of what he used to make by selling grilled meatballs. Unable to afford his wife's diabetes medication, Rahmat picks herbs to make a tonic instead. Like Rahmat, millions of working to middle class Indonesians have become poorer, largely due to an increase in layoffs and a drop in the number of job opportunities since the pandemic. This trend bodes ill for the outlook for Southeast Asia's biggest economy — household consumption accounts for over half of gross domestic product — as well as the widely held investment thesis that an expanding middle class will drive Indonesia's ambition to become a high-income nation by 2045. It also poses a challenge for the incoming administration of President Prabowo Subianto, who won a February election by a landslide on promises to boost economic growth and create 19 million of jobs. Prabowo takes office on Oct. 20. 'Pushing the economy to grow higher with weak consumption is difficult,' said Mohammad Faisal, an economist at the Jakarta-based Center of Reform on Economics. The government classifies those who spend between $132 to $643 a month as middle class, based on a World Bank criteria. This group is key to economic growth as their spending accounts for nearly 40% of private consumption, and more than 80% if combined with the aspiring middle class, who spend $57 to $132. The size of the middle class, however, has dropped from 21.5% of the total population in 2019 to 17.1% in 2024, according to official data released last month. Even though Indonesia's economy has bounced back after the pandemic, with growth of around above 5% a year since 2022 amid generally low inflation, this shrinking middle class is likely to pressure future growth, as the government will have to contend with lower tax revenues and a possibly more subsidies, said Jahen Rezki, an analyst from the University of Indonesia. 'In the long run, if the middle class dwindles, it will certainly be a big burden for the state,' he said. Big state spending One of the main reasons for the demise of the middle class is the changing labour market. A large portion of the foreign investment coming into Indonesia has targeted industries such as mining, which are becoming much less labour intensive as more cutting-edge technology is deployed. Also, stronger competition from lower cost destinations such as China, especially in the textile sector, has squeezed factories, leading to lay offs that the textile association said were the worst in the last decade. Prabowo's brother and adviser Hashim Djojohadikusumo said the incoming government will help the middle class by creating millions of new jobs from projects like the $28 billion free meals programme and the building of millions of homes. 'We want to create a lot of small, medium and micro entrepreneurs, for example through our housing program. We want to build 3 million units of houses, in villages and cities. That's to create middle class,' he told Reuters recently. However, how much the next government is able to spend on welfare schemes might be limited, especially next year when a large amount of government debt is due to mature, said Teguh Yudo Wicaksono, an economist at Islam Internasional Indonesia University. For former factory worker Rahmat, the best help the government can give is a handout he can use to expand his food business, as it has become increasingly difficult to find a job. His wife Fatimah said her children often ask for their favorite spicy meat dish, but she can only afford to feed them instant noodles with eggs most of the time. 'I could only tell my kids to please wait until dad got his fair compensation from the factory, we will cook a delicious meal again,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-dwindling-middle-class-seen-dimming-economic-outlook-/7779794.html	2024-09-11T03:29:30-07:00	
Hurricane Francine takes aim at Louisiana coast	BATON ROUGE, La. — Hurricane Francine barreled early Wednesday toward Louisiana and is expected to make landfall in coming hours as forecasters raised threats of potentially deadly storm surge, widespread flooding and destructive winds on the northern U.S. Gulf coast. Francine drew fuel from exceedingly warm Gulf of Mexico waters to jump from a tropical storm to a Category 1 hurricane on Tuesday night. The National Hurricane Center said Francine might even reach Category 2 strength with winds of 155 to 175 kph before crashing into a fragile coastal region that still hasn't fully recovered from a series of devastating hurricanes since 2020. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry warned at midday Tuesday — when Francine was still a tropical storm — that residents around south Louisiana and in the heavily populated state capital of Baton Rouge and nearby New Orleans — should 'batten down all the hatches' and finish last preparations before a 24-hour window to do so closed. Once Francine makes landfall, Landry said, residents should stay in place rather than venture out into waterlogged roads and risk blocking first responders or utility crews working to repair power lines. The governor said the Louisiana National Guard is being deployed to parishes that could be impacted by Francine. They are equipped with food, water, nearly 400 high-water vehicles, about 100 boats and 50 helicopters to respond to the storm, including possible search-and-rescue operations. Francine was centered Wednesday morning about 395 kilometers southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana, and was moving northeast at 17 kph with maximum sustained winds of 90 150 kmh, the Miami-based hurricane center said. Some additional strengthening is expected Wednesday morning and then Francine is expected to weaken quickly after it moves inland. A hurricane warning was in effect along the Louisiana coast from Cameron eastward to Grand Isle, about 80 kilometers south of New Orleans, according to the center. A storm surge warning stretched from the Mississippi-Alabama border to the Alabama-Florida border Such a warning means there's a chance of life-threatening flooding. In downtown New Orleans, cars and trucks were lined up for blocks on Tuesday to collect sandbags from the parking lot of a local YMCA. CEO Erika Mann said Tuesday that 1,000 bags of sand had already been distributed by volunteers later in the day to people hoping to protect homes from possible flooding. One resident picking up sandbags was Wayne Grant, 33, who moved to New Orleans last year and was nervous for his first potential hurricane in the city. The low-lying rental apartment he shares with his partner had already flooded out in a storm the year before and he was not taking any chances this time around. 'It was like a kick in the face, we've been trying to stay up on the weather ever since,' Grant said. 'We're super invested in the place, even though it's not ours.' Francine is the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. There's a danger of life-threatening storm surge as well as damaging hurricane-force winds, said Brad Reinhart, a senior hurricane specialist at the hurricane center. There's also the potential for 10 to 20 centimeters of rain with the possibility of 30 centimeters locally across much of Louisiana and Mississippi through Friday morning, Reinhart said. The hurricane center said parts of Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle were at risk of 'considerable' flash and urban flooding starting Wednesday, followed by a threat of possible flooding later in the week into the lower Mississippi Valley and lower Tennessee Valley as the soggy remnants of Francine sweep inland. Francine is taking aim at a Louisiana coastline that has yet to fully recover since hurricanes Laura and Delta decimated Lake Charles in 2020, followed a year later by Hurricane Ida. A little over three years after Ida trashed his home in the Dulac community of coastal Louisiana's Terrebonne Parish – and about a month after he finished rebuilding – Coy Verdin was preparing for another hurricane. 'We had to gut the whole house,' he recalled in a telephone interview, rattling off a memorized inventory of the work, including a new roof and new windows. Verdin, 55, strongly considered moving farther inland, away from the home where he makes his living on nearby Bayou Grand Caillou. After rebuilding, he said he's there to stay. 'As long as I can. It's getting rough, though,' he said. Francine's storm surge on the Louisiana coast could reach as much as 3 meters from Cameron to Port Fourchon and into Vermilion Bay, forecasters said. They said landfall was likely somewhere between Sabine Pass — on the Texas-Louisiana line — and Morgan City, Louisiana, about 350 kilometers to the east.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-francine-takes-aim-at-louisiana-coast/7779769.html	2024-09-11T02:49:33-07:00

Trump, Harris exchange barbs on debate stage	In the U.S. presidential election, the Republican Party’s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, clashed with his Democratic Party rival, Kamala Harris, Tuesday evening over issues such as abortion, immigration and foreign policy.

Vietnam's export hub factories may face weeks of disruption after Typhoon Yagi	HANOI, VIETNAM — Typhoon Yagi severely damaged a large number of factories and flooded warehouses in northern Vietnam's export-oriented industrial hubs, forcing plants to shut, with some expected to take weeks to resume full operations, executives said. The typhoon, the strongest in Asia this year, made landfall in Vietnam's northern coast on Saturday and was still causing deadly floods and landslides on Wednesday, killing dozens and ravaging key infrastructure, including power networks and roads. The disruptions could affect global supply chains as Vietnam hosts large operations of multinationals that mostly export their products to the United States, Europe and other developed countries. In the coastal city of Haiphong, one of the areas worst hit by the typhoon, 95% of businesses were expected to resume some activities on Tuesday, the body managing Haiphong industrial zones said on its website. 'Many businesses had their roofs blown off, some walls were torn and collapsed, gates, fences, signs, camera systems, garages and sliding metal doors were overturned, water flooded into factories,' said a report on its website. In the DEEP C industrial zones, which host factories in Haiphong and the neighboring province of Quang Ninh, 20 out of 150 investors' plants will be out of service for at least a few weeks, said Bruno Jaspaert, head of DEEP C industrial zones. Based on a review of his clients, he expected power consumption at those facilities would remain one-third below normal for weeks or months because many companies were busy rebuilding their damaged factories. Goods ready for export or delivery to clients were flooded in warehouses in the area, companies said. In another industrial park in Haiphong, South Korea's LG Electronics said it had partly resumed work on Tuesday, although the factory's walls were crushed on Saturday and a warehouse with refrigerators and washing machines had been flooded. 'Many of them are gone with the wind,' said Calvin Nguyen, head of Vietnamese logistics firm WeDo Forwarding Co., referring to products that were to be delivered to the United States and the European Union, without specifying which goods. The company's three warehouses in Haiphong had their roofs blown off and on Wednesday were still flooded, he said. The industry ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Power cuts Power outages were still affecting several areas in the north, as Vietnam's state-owned power distributor EVN worked to restore dozens of damaged electricity lines. In Quang Ninh, along the coast north of Haiphong, many factories still had no electricity or water service, Jaspaert said. Chinese solar panel maker Jinko Solar's factory in Quang Ninh was severely damaged, one of its workers said, noting on Tuesday work had not resumed as windows had been smashed and the roof had been blown away. Jinko was not immediately available for a comment. Far from the coast, the industrial hubs of Thai Nguyen and Bac Giang which host large factories of multinationals such as Samsung Electronics and Apple supplier Foxconn were also facing severe flooding. Samsung's large facilities in Thai Nguyen had not been visibly affected on Tuesday evening, according to a Reuters witness. Water was receding on Wednesday in the province, about 60 kilometers north of Hanoi, but more rain was expected.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-s-export-hub-factories-may-face-weeks-of-disruption-after-typhoon-yagi/7779700.html	2024-09-10T22:58:27-07:00	
Pope Francis’ visit puts Indonesia’s religious freedom under spotlight	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — During his three-day visit to Indonesia last week, Pope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church, urged Indonesians to live up to the promise represented by the nation’s own motto — 'Unity in Diversity.' While praising Indonesia’s constitution, which guarantees religious freedom, Francis also warned in an address following a meeting with President Joko Widodo that the diversity of the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation can also lead to conflict. Francis emphasized the importance of interfaith dialogue to eliminate prejudices and build mutual respect. 'This is indispensable for meeting common challenges, including that of countering extremism and intolerance, which through the distortion of religion attempt to improve their views by using deception and violence,' Francis said. Indonesia’s statistical agency says that 87% of the country’s 280 million people are Muslim. However, 2.9% of the total population is Catholic, making its Christian community the third largest in Asia after the Philippines and China. Indonesia’s struggle against religious intolerance Despite legal guarantees of religious freedom, which includes a Religious Harmony bill signed into law in 2006, research by Human Rights Watch indicates a flare-up of religious intolerance. Examples include the imprisonment of Jakarta’s Christian governor for blasphemy in 2016, violence against religious minorities; and problems faced by some Christian groups seeking to secure building permits for churches. Novi from Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, a Catholic, who traveled to Jakarta to witness Pope Francis' visit to Istiqlal Mosque, hopes the visit can encourage a revival of religious tolerance in the country. 'I’m really sad when I hear news reports saying that churches faced difficulties in setting up a church and require approval of the majority from the surrounding community and municipal and provincial office,' she said. In 2006, a group of religious and community leaders established the Religious Harmony Forum (FKUB), dedicated to protecting religious harmony, including making recommendations to the mayor or regent on the construction of any new house of worship. But according to Andreas Harsono, a senior Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch, the forum has been politicized over the years. In hopes of quelling religious intolerance, Minister of Religious Affairs Yaqut Cholil Qoumas said a new presidential regulation is being developed that will no longer allow the FKUB to recommend the establishment of a house of worship. That right will remain with the Ministry of Religious Affairs. Andreas Harsono of the Human Rights Watch sees this as a 'step in the right direction.' 'The FKUB recommendations are proven to be the most damaging of the 2006 regulations on religious harmony. The religious harmony regulation basically makes the so-called majority have veto power over the minorities in Indonesia. It's turning Indonesia into an intolerant Muslim-majority country,' he said. Halili Hasan, executive director of the SETARA Institute, agrees with abolishing the FKUB’s right to recommend. He added that FKUB has not been able to prevent and handle various violations of freedom of religion and belief. SETARA Institute is a think tank that advocates for democracy and human rights in Indonesia and releases an annual report on the condition of freedom of religion and belief. The report in 2023 listed at least 65 places of worship that experienced disturbances throughout that year, ranging from objections to the construction of a house of worship to the sealing off of places of worship. That compares to 50 such incidents in the previous year. Still, the Ministry of Religious Affair’s Religious Harmony Index survey for 2023 found a steady increase in religious harmony from 2020 to 2023. The index was scored from 0 to 100, with 100 being the most harmonious. The national score for 2023 was 76.02, the highest score recorded in the last five years. Eli Trisiana is a Muslim and government civil servant who came to see Pope Francis. 'We need to hold a heart-to-heart dialogue with those deemed religious intolerant,’’ Eli Trisiana said. ‘’We cannot deal with them using violence. I think that is the best method to solve differences of opinion. In Islam there are verses taught to us that reconcile with non-believers, which is 'unto you your religion and unto me my religion.' Interfaith dialogue During an interfaith dialogue at Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta, 87-year-old Pope Francis met with representatives of Indonesia’s six officially recognized religions — Islam, Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Protestantism and Catholicism — along with a representative for traditional beliefs. Francis and the grand imam of the Istiqlal Mosque, Nasaruddin Umar, signed a 'Human Fraternity' document declaring their commitment to interfaith harmony. The document calls for religious leaders to overcome two serious crises faced by the world: dehumanization and climate change. The grand imam said he won’t let this signing be in vain and that he plans to follow up with a future plan of action that supports interfaith dialogue and true religious harmony.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-visit-puts-indonesia-s-religious-freedom-under-spotlight/7779698.html	2024-09-10T22:51:59-07:00	
Iran president heads to Iraq on first foreign visit	Tehran, Ian — Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, is to visit neighboring Iraq on Wednesday as he moves to deepen already close ties on his first foreign visit since taking office. Pezeshkian has vowed to make relations with neighboring countries a priority as he seeks to ease Iran's international isolation and mitigate the impact of U.S.-led sanctions on its economy. His visit comes after Western powers on Tuesday announced fresh sanctions on Iran for supplying Russia with short-range missiles for use against Ukraine. It also comes amid turmoil in the Middle East sparked by the war in Gaza, which has drawn in Iran-backed armed groups around the region and complicated Baghdad's ties with Washington. On Tuesday night, an explosion was heard at the base of a U.S.-led anti-militant coalition at the Baghdad international airport, according to Iraqi security officials. A spokesperson for the Iranian-backed Ketaeb Hezbollah (Hezbollah Brigades) in Iraq said the Tuesday night attack aimed to 'disrupt the Iranian president's visit to Baghdad.' Ties between Iran and Iraq, both Shiite-majority countries, have grown closer since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 toppled the Sunni-dominated regime of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Pezeshkian has directly linked shoring up ties to sanctions pressure. 'Relations with neighboring countries ... can neutralize a significant amount of pressure of the sanctions,' he said last month. Iran has suffered years of crippling Western sanctions, especially after its arch-foe the United States, under then-president Donald Trump, unilaterally abandoned a landmark nuclear deal between the Islamic republic and major powers in 2018. Pezeshkian, who assumed the presidency in late July, has made the top diplomat who negotiated the 2015 deal, Mohammad Javad Zarif, his vice president for strategic affairs as part of his bid for a more open Iran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-president-heads-to-iraq-on-first-foreign-visit/7779694.html	2024-09-10T22:36:47-07:00	
Top takeaways from the Harris-Trump debate	WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off on Tuesday night in Philadelphia in a debate that comes less than two months before the presidential election. The race is tight between the two candidates. Among registered voters, Harris leads Trump by 1 point — 49% to 48% — according to the latest PBS/NPR/Marist poll. That result falls within the margin of error. The ABC debate marks the first face-to-face meeting between Harris, 59, and Trump, 78. A former prosecutor, Harris is the first woman, Black American and South Asian American vice president. Trump, a businessman who has been criticized for his sexist and racist remarks, is the first convicted felon to run for president and, if elected, would be 82 by the end of his term. During what could be their only debate, Harris and Trump sparred on issues ranging from the economy and immigration to democracy, abortion and the Israel-Hamas war. Here are some of the key takeaways from the debate. Economy The economy was the debate’s first topic, with Harris saying she wants to create an 'opportunity economy.' She cited her plan to increase the tax credit for starting new small businesses from $5,000 to $50,000. 'I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class,' she said, adding that Trump wants to help the rich with tax cuts. Trump has said he will further reduce the corporate tax rate from the current 21% to 15%. Harris wants to increase the rate to 28%. It was 35% before Trump’s 2017 tax bill. Trump spent much of his answer on the economy talking about immigration. However, he also said he created one of the best economies in the United States, without offering specifics, and that he will do it again. 'Look, we’ve had a terrible economy, because inflation, which is really known as a country buster,' Trump said. Immigration Immigration has been one of the biggest issues in this presidential campaign. Throughout the debate, Trump lambasted the Biden administration’s handling of immigration – often when the moderators asked questions unrelated to immigration. Trump repeated his false claims that immigrants are 'taking over the towns. They’re taking over buildings. They’re going in violently.' He also cited baseless conspiracy theories about Haitian immigrants in Ohio eating pet dogs and cats. Harris criticized Trump for killing a bipartisan bill earlier this year that would have put 1,500 more border agents on the U.S. southern border. Harris has said she would support the bill. Abortion Trump and Harris grew increasingly combative when debating the question of abortion. As president, Trump appointed three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. That decision laid the groundwork for states to impose restrictive rules on abortion around the country. 'The Supreme Court had great courage in doing it,' Trump said during the debate. When asked if he would support a national abortion ban, he said: 'No, I’m not in favor of abortion ban. But it doesn't matter because this issue has now been taken over by the states.' He also said he would not oppose abortion in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at risk. He also falsely claimed that Democrats support abortions 'after birth.' In response, Harris emphasized the importance of women’s reproductive rights. 'One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,' she said. She added that she would support Congress passing a bill to codify federal abortion protections and, as president, sign it into law. Rule of law, threats to democracy and Jan. 6 Harris was a prosecutor for a dozen years, first as San Francisco district attorney and then as California’s attorney general. A central component of Harris’ campaign has been portraying Trump as a threat to democracy. During the debate, Harris highlighted Trump’s status as a convicted felon. Trump replied with the unsubstantiated accusation that Harris and the Biden administration are 'weaponizing' the government to prosecute him When asked by the moderator whether Trump would acknowledge that he lost the 2020 presidential election, he replied with the false claim that he actually won the election. On the Jan. 6 insurrection, Trump said, 'I had nothing to do with that, other than they asked me to make a speech.' 'It’s time to turn the page,' Harris said. 'There is a place in our campaign for you to stand for our country, to stand for democracy, to stand for rule of law and to end the chaos and to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy,' she added. Russia-Ukraine War and Israel-Hamas War In addition to domestic policy, the moderators also pressed Harris and Trump on foreign policy issues, including the ongoing wars between Ukraine and Russia, and Israel and Hamas. On the Israel-Hamas war, Harris said the United States would defend Israel. She added that she supports a two-state solution. The war 'must end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal, and we need the hostages out,' Harris said. Trump claimed that 'Israel will be gone' if Harris becomes president, which is unsubstantiated. Trump also repeated his claim that the Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas in southern Israel would have never happened if he were president. Trump said the Russia-Ukraine war would not have happened if he were president. When asked if he wants Ukraine to win the war against Russia, Trump would only say, 'I want the war to stop.' Harris replied: 'If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-takeaways-from-the-harris-trump-debate-/7779682.html	2024-09-10T21:51:14-07:00	
Arrested Nigerian workers' union leader freed	Abuja, Nigeria — The Nigerian secret police released labor union leader Joe Ajaero on Tuesday after hours of interrogation over alleged terrorism financing. Ajaero's arrest Monday sparked criticism about what critics see as a government crackdown on dissent. Ajaero, was released by the Department of State Services, or DSS, after he was arrested at the Abuja airport while on his way to the United Kingdom to attend a labor conference. He said Tuesday that DSS kept his passport. He said the police questioned him for hours about alleged terrorism financing involving British national Andrew Wynne and last month's anti-government protests in Nigeria. Ajaero is a prominent critic of the Nigerian government and has led many demonstrations to denounce reforms introduced by President Bola Tinubu last year. Hamisu Santuraki, the spokesperson of the United Action Front of Civil Society, a coalition of civil society groups, said the government should have asked Ajaero to come in for questioning. 'It’s not done anywhere — arresting somebody without sending him an invitation, it is wrong, they should've sent him a letter,' Santuraki said. We just want them to release his passport, so we're having a meeting. Nigeria is our country.' Later Tuesday, a government spokesman, Bayo Onanuga, said Ajaero was invited to speak to a law enforcement agency and was stopped from traveling abroad because he 'snubbed' that invitation. In a statement released on X, Onanuga also said Nigeria 'categorically denies any human rights abuse.' Santuraki said the coalition and the Labor Congress are deciding on what steps to take. The Nigerian government is facing a wave of criticism from rights groups who accuse it of trying to stifle dissent and free expression. Investigative journalist Isaac Bristol was recently detained on charges of leaking classified and restricted documents, sedition, and tax evasion, among other allegations. Another journalist, David Hundeyin, was declared wanted by the police last week. Ajaero's arrest came days after he criticized a decision by Nigerian officials to increase the gasoline price by 39 percent. Nigerian authorities said global oil market forces determined the new pump price of refined petrol, which had more than quadrupled in Nigeria since President Tinubu scrapped fuel subsidies last year. On Monday, the Socio-Economic Rights Accountability Project, or SERAP, said state operatives also raided their offices. The group this week called for a probe of the national oil company. 'We consider this an act of aggression, intimidation and harassment by the government, and it might not be unconnected with the statement that SERAP had issued over the weekend calling on the president to direct the NNPC to reverse the price of petroleum,' said Kolawole Oluwadare, a deputy director at SERAP. 'We consider this as an instance of the escalation of attacks against the civic space and this of course is not acceptable in a democracy.' Ajaero was also arrested in November by police in southeastern Imo state, moments before he was to lead a rally.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arrested-nigerian-workers-union-leader-freed/7779664.html	2024-09-10T21:17:07-07:00	
Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris for president after debate ends	WASHINGTON — Taylor Swift, one of the music industry's biggest stars, endorsed Kamala Harris for president shortly after the debate ended on Tuesday night. 'I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,' Swift wrote in an Instagram post, which included a link to a voter registration website. Swift has a dedicated following among young women, a key demographic in the November election, and her latest tour has generated more than $1 billion in ticket sales. In a half hour, the post received more than 2.3 million likes. She included a picture of herself holding her cat Benjamin Button, and she signed the message 'Childless Cat Lady.' The remark is a reference to 3-year-old comments made by JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, about women without children not having an equal stake in the country's future. A Harris senior campaign official said the endorsement was not coordinated with the campaign. Tim Walz, Harris' running mate, appeared to learn about the endorsement in the middle of a live interview on MSNBC. As Rachel Maddow read the text, Walz broke into a smile and patted his chest. 'That was eloquent. And it was clear,' Walz said. 'And that's the kind of courage we need in America to stand up.' Swift wrote that her endorsement was partially prompted by Trump's decision to post AI-generated pictures suggesting that she had endorsed him. One showed Swift dressed as Uncle Sam, and the text said, 'Taylor wants YOU to VOTE for DONALD TRUMP.' Trump's posts 'brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,' Swift wrote. She added that 'I've done my research, and I've made my choice.' The Trump campaign dismissed Swift's endorsement. 'This is further evidence that the Democrat Party has unfortunately become a party of the wealthy elites,' said spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. 'There's many Swifties for Trump out there in America,' she said, herself included. Swift's endorsement was not exactly a surprise. In 2020, she supported President Joe Biden, and she cheered for Harris in her debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence. She also was openly critical of Trump, saying he had stoked 'the fires of white supremacy and racism.' Swift is a popular figure nationwide, but especially among Democrats. An October 2023 Fox News poll found that 55% of voters overall, including 68% of Democrats, said they had a favorable view of Swift. Republicans were divided, with 43% having a favorable opinion and 45% an unfavorable one. AP VoteCast suggests that a partisan divide on Swift was apparent as early as 2018. That's the year Swift made her first political endorsement, supporting Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen for Senate over Republican Marsha Blackburn. VoteCast found that among Tennessee voters that year, 55% of Democrats and just 19% of Republicans said they had a favorable opinion of Swift. Blackburn won by a comfortable margin in the deep red state. Swift is the leading nominee at Wednesday's MTV Video Music Awards. While it's unclear whether Swift will attend the show in New York, she could use any acceptance speeches to elaborate on her support of Harris.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-for-president-after-debate-ends/7779656.html	2024-09-10T21:00:13-07:00	
Vietnam death toll from Typhoon Yagi at 141 as Hanoi faces flood risk	HANOI, Vietnam — The death toll in Vietnam from Typhoon Yagi has risen to 141, the government said on Wednesday as it warned that flood waters were causing the Red River to rise rapidly and threaten to inundate downtown districts of the capital Hanoi. Heavy rains brought by Typhoon Yagi have triggered deadly landslides and floods throughout northern Vietnam, killing 141 people with 59 others missing, the disaster management agency said. There has also been severe property damage and disruption to business and industry. State media reports late on Tuesday said the water level of the Red River in Hanoi had been rising 10 centimeters every hour. Some schools in Hanoi have told students to stay home for the rest of the week due to flood concerns, while thousands of residents living in low-lying areas have been evacuated, according to sources, government and state media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-death-toll-from-typhoon-yagi-at-141-as-hanoi-faces-flood-risk/7779648.html	2024-09-10T20:38:11-07:00	
US, UK top diplomats head to Ukraine with eye on weapons	Przemysl, Poland — The top U.S. and British diplomats headed together into Ukraine on Wednesday to discuss further easing rules on firing Western weapons into Russia, whose alleged acquisition of Iranian missiles has raised new fears. In a rare joint trip, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was taking the train to Kyiv with Foreign Secretary David Lammy, whose 2-month-old Labor government has vowed to keep up Britain's role as a key defender of Ukraine. The pair, who boarded the train early Wednesday at the Polish border town of Przemysl, are expected to meet in Kyiv with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has kept pressing the West for weapons with more firepower and fewer restrictions. U.S. President Joe Biden, asked in Washington whether he would let Ukraine use longer-range weapons, said: 'We're working that out right now.' Biden, while strongly supportive of Ukraine, has previously made clear he wants to avoid devolving into direct conflict between the United States and Russia, the world's two leading nuclear powers. Blinken, speaking Tuesday in London alongside Lammy, said the United States was committed to providing Ukraine 'what they need when they need it to be most effective in dealing with the Russian aggression.' But Blinken, who is on his fifth trip to Kyiv since the war, said it was also important to see if Ukrainian forces could maintain and operate particular weaponry. Pressed later in an interview with Sky News on whether the United States would green-light long-range weapons, Blinken said, 'We never rule out, but when we rule in, we want to make sure it's done in such a way that it can advance what the Ukrainians are trying to achieve.' The renewed talk about long-range weapons comes after the United States said that Iran has sent short-range missiles to Russia, which could strike Ukraine with them within weeks. The Iranian shipments have raised fears that Moscow would be freed up to use its long-range missiles against comparatively unscathed areas in western Ukraine. Western powers announced new sanctions against Iran's clerical state over the sale, which defied repeated warnings. The United States earlier this year gave its blessing for Ukraine to use Western weapons to hit Russian forces when in direct conflict across the border. But Ukraine last month launched a surprise, daring offensive directly into Russian territory in Kursk, hoping to restore morale and divert Moscow as Russian troops trudge forward in the front lines of eastern Ukraine. British media reports said Biden, who meets Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday, was set to end objections to letting Ukraine fire long-range Storm Shadow missiles into Russia. Britain has repeatedly pushed the United States, by far Ukraine's biggest military supplier, to be more forward on weapons. One key ask of Ukraine is to loosen restrictions on U.S.-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, which can hit targets up to 300 kilometers away. In a joint letter to Biden, leading members of Congress from the rival Republican Party asked him to act on ATACMS immediately. 'As long as it is conducting its brutal, full-scale war of aggression, Russia must not be given a sanctuary from which it can execute its war crimes against Ukraine with impunity,' said the letter signed by Representative Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Republicans, however, are deeply divided over Ukraine, and a victory in November by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump over Biden's political heir Kamala Harris could dramatically shift US policy. Trump aides have suggested that if he wins, he would leverage aid to force Kyiv into territorial concessions to Russia to end the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-uk-top-diplomats-head-to-ukraine-with-eye-on-weapons/7779634.html	2024-09-10T20:19:20-07:00	
Tigray leader reports talks with archrival Eritrea	Mekelle/Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — The leader of Tigray People's Liberation Front Debretsion Gebremichael has reported previously undisclosed talks between his region and the leaders of Eritrea. Speaking at a press conference in the regional capital Mekelle, Ethiopia, on Tuesday, Debretsion said the first round of talks took place about six months ago in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. He told reporters that Getachew Reda, the president of the Tigray Interim Regional Administration, represented the TPLF at the talks in Dubai. Without indicating venue and date, Debretsion also said there have been subsequent meetings with the Eritrean leaders after the initial meeting in Dubai. 'This was decided by the TPLF Executive Committee,' he said. 'Accordingly, President Getachew Reda has engaged with Eritrea's leaders. This is something that I know and my party's Executive Committee knows.' He said the talks, which were aimed at creating peace between the two sides, had a positive result. 'The abduction of citizens, looting and other activities by the Eritrean forces has improved and eased as a result,' he said. He said the TPLF party’s intention is to 'make peace with all our neighbors, including the Fano forces and the Eritrean government.' 'Based on this principle, Getachew met with the Eritrean leaders, which is known by the honorable prime minister and my part. But this is for a good cause and for peace,' he said. Debretsion indicated that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been encouraging them to engage in the talks. He adds that Getachew has also briefed the Ethiopian leader about the talks. There has been no immediate reaction from Ethiopia prime minister’s office, Eritrea and from IRA leader Getachew. VOA’s Horn of Africa Service has reached out to the Ethiopia prime minister’s office and government communication service but has not received a response. Also, repeated attempts to get reaction from the Eritrea’s ministry of information were not successful. The governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea were allies during a deadly two-year war in Tigray that killed thousands. Human rights organizations and the United States have accused Eritrean and Ethiopian forces of committing war crimes during the war in Tigray, a charge the two governments denied. In November 2022, the Ethiopian government and TPLF signed the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in Pretoria, South Africa, committing to a permanent ending of fighting. Tigray regional officials allege that Eritrean troops remain in parts of their region despite the Pretoria agreement’s call for the withdrawal of foreign forces. The agreement called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and non-Ethiopian National Defense Forces, referring to the Eritrean forces and Ethiopian militias allied with the Ethiopian government. During his visit to Ethiopia, Hammer will review the implementation of the Pretoria Cessation of Hostilities Agreement on northern Ethiopia with the signatories, the State Department said in a statement. 'The United States remains committed to supporting the Ethiopian government and the Tigray Interim Regional Administration to achieve lasting peace, including through effective disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration for ex-combatants; an orderly and peaceful return of internally displaced persons; and advancing transitional justice and accountability,' the statement read. Hammer will also discuss with Ethiopian officials their efforts to advance dialogue to end violence in the Amhara and Oromia regions, it added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tigray-leader-reports-talks-with-archrival-eritrea/7779628.html	2024-09-10T20:12:08-07:00

China takes lead in critical technology research after 'switching places' with US	SINGAPORE — An Australian think tank that tracks tech competitiveness says China is now the world leader in research on almost 90% of critical technologies. In a newly released report, the research group adds there is also a high risk of Beijing securing a monopoly on defense-related tech, including drones, satellites and collaborative robots — those that can work safely alongside humans. Analysts say the huge leap forward for China is the result of heavy state investment over the past two decades. They add that despite the progress, Beijing is still dependent on other countries for key tech components and lacks self-sufficiency. The report from the government-funded Australian Strategic Policy Institute, or ASPI, released last Thursday, says China led the way in research into 57 out of 64 advanced technologies in the five years from 2019-2023. ASPI's Critical Technology Tracker ranks countries' innovation capabilities based on the number of appearances in the top 10% of research papers. It focuses on crucial technologies from a range of fields including artificial intelligence, biotechnology, cyber and defense. The report found that 'China and the United States have effectively switched places as the overwhelming leader in research in just two decades.' China led in only three of the 64 technologies between 2003 and 2007 but has shot up in the rankings, replacing the U.S., which is now a frontrunner in just seven critical technologies. Josh Kennedy-White is a technology strategist based in Singapore. He says China's huge leap is a 'direct result of its aggressive, state-driven research and development investments over the past two decades.' He adds that the shift toward China is 'particularly stark in fields like artificial intelligence, quantum computing and advanced aircraft engines, where China has transitioned from a laggard to a leader in a relatively short period.' ASPI also determines the risk of countries holding a monopoly on the research of critical technologies. They currently classify 24 technologies as 'high risk' of being monopolized — all by Beijing. Ten technologies are newly classified as 'high risk' this year, with many of them linked to the defense industry. 'The potential monopoly risk in 24 technology areas, especially those in defense-related fields like radars and drones, is concerning in the current and future geopolitical context,' Tobias Feakin, founder of consultancy firm Protostar Strategy, told VOA. Chinese President Xi Jinping has sought to boost his country's advanced manufacturing capabilities with the ambitious 'Made in China 2025' initiative. The policy, launched in 2015, aims to strengthen Beijing's self-reliance in critical sectors and make China a global tech powerhouse. Xi, according to Feakin, views advanced technologies as 'strategic priorities for China's development, national security and global competitiveness.' He adds that technologies are seen as a 'central component of China's long-term economic and geopolitical goals.' Beijing's ambitions are being closely watched in Washington, with the Biden administration working to limit China's access to advanced technology. Last week, the U.S. introduced new export controls on critical technology to China, including chip-making equipment and quantum computers and components. That announcement came shortly after U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan made his first ever visit to Beijing. He met with Xi and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Sullivan told reporters that Washington 'will continue to take necessary action to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine national security.' The continued efforts to curb China's chip industry mean that Beijing must look further afield for advanced technology. 'Even though it leads in areas like artificial intelligence and 5G, China still depends on Taiwan, the U.S. and South Korea to produce high-end semiconductors', Kennedy-White told VOA. Describing this as China's Achilles' heel, Kennedy-White says the lack of self-sufficiency in the semiconductor industry could 'stunt Beijing's progress in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and military applications.' As China continues its dominance in critical technology research, questions have been raised over exactly how the country is making these breakthroughs. Last October, officials from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States) issued a joint statement accusing China of stealing intellectual property. U.S. FBI director Christopher Wray described it as an 'unprecedented threat.' Kennedy-White, managing director of Singapore-based venture catalyst firm DivisionX Global, agrees with this assessment. He says China's jump up the ASPI rankings is 'not entirely organic.' 'There is a correlation between China's rise in certain technologies and allegations of intellectual property theft,' he added. ASPI also recommends ways for other countries to close the gap on China. It advises the AUKUS alliance of Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. to join forces with Japan and South Korea to try to catch up. The report also highlights the emergence of India as a 'key center' of global research innovation and excellence. The South Asian nation now ranks in the top five countries for 45 out of the 64 technologies that are tracked by ASPI. It's a huge gain compared with 2003-2007, when India sat in the top five for only four technologies. Feakin says countries across the Asia-Pacific 'will benefit from leveraging India's growing technology expertise and influence.' It will also provide a counterbalance to 'overdependence on China's technology supply chain,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-takes-lead-in-critical-technology-research-after-switching-places-with-us/7779603.html	2024-09-10T18:50:59-07:00	
Congress bestows highest honor on 13 troops killed during Afghanistan withdrawal	WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday presented Congress' highest honor — the Congressional Gold Medal — to 13 U.S. service members who were killed during the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, even as the politics of a presidential election swirled around the event. Both Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation to posthumously honor the 13 U.S. troops, who were killed along with more than 170 Afghans in a suicide bombing at the Abbey Gate at Kabul's airport in August 2021. President Joe Biden signed the legislation in December 2021. On Tuesday, the top Republican and Democratic leaders for both the House and Senate spoke at a somber ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda, hailing the lives and sacrifices of the service members. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called on the lawmakers gathered to 'ensure the sacrifices of all our servicemembers were not in vain.' 'We must care for them and their families and defend the values of freedom and democracy they so nobly fought for,' said Schumer, a New York Democrat. But rather than a unifying moment, the event took place against the backdrop of a bitter back-and-forth over who is to blame for the rushed and deadly evacuation from Kabul. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican and ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, scheduled the ceremony just hours before the first debate between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. 'They lost their lives because of this administration's catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan,' Johnson said at a news conference minutes before the ceremony. Then as the speaker opened the ceremony, he took another jab at how the Biden administration has defended its handling of the final months of America's longest war. 'To the families who are here, I know many of you have yet to hear these words, so I will say them: we are sorry,' Johnson said. 'The United States government should have done everything to protect our troops, those fallen and wounded at Abbey Gate deserved our best efforts, and the families who have been left to pick up the pieces continue to deserve transparency, appreciation and recognition.' Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee also released a scathing investigation on Sunday into the withdrawal that cast blame on Biden's administration and minimized the role of Trump, who had signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby on Monday criticized the House report as partisan and one-sided and said it revealed little new information and contained several inaccuracies. He noted that evacuation plans had started well before the pullout, and the fall of Kabul 'moved a lot faster than anyone could have anticipated.' He also acknowledged that during the evacuation 'not everything went according to plan. Nothing ever does.' 'We hold ourselves all accountable for that,' he said of the deaths. Top military and White House officials attended the ceremony Tuesday, including Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough and Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown, Jr. the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Pentagon reviews have concluded that the suicide bombing was not preventable and suggestions troops may have seen the would-be bomber were not true. Regardless, Trump has thrust the withdrawal, with the backing from some of the families of the Americans killed, into the center of his campaign. Last month, his political team distributed video of him attending a wreath-laying ceremony for the fallen service members at Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of the bombing, despite the cemetery's prohibition on partisan activity on the grounds as well as an altercation with a cemetery employee who was trying to make sure the campaign followed those rules. Most assessments have concluded Trump and Biden share blame for the disastrous end to the 20-year war, which saw enemy Taliban take over Afghanistan again before the last American troops even flew out of the Kabul airport. Over 2,000 U.S. troops were killed in Afghanistan. The main U.S. government watchdog for the war points to Trump's 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw all U.S. forces and military contractors as 'the single most important factor' in the collapse of U.S.-allied Afghan security forces and Taliban takeover. Biden's April 2021 announcement that he would proceed with the withdrawal set in motion by Trump was the second-biggest factor, the watchdog said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congress-bestows-highest-honor-on-13-troops-killed-during-afghanistan-withdrawal/7779578.html	2024-09-10T17:50:10-07:00

House speaker pushes funding bill that includes proof of citizenship mandate	washington — House Speaker Mike Johnson vowed Tuesday to press ahead with requiring proof of citizenship for new voters as part of a bill to avoid a partial government shutdown in three weeks, though the measure appeared likely to be voted down. Democrats overwhelmingly oppose the measure. Enough Republicans were also coming out against the bill, though for different reasons, that its prospects of passing the House appeared dim. Even if it does pass the House on Wednesday, the bill would go nowhere in the Senate. Johnson said the issue of election security is too critical to ignore, though research has shown that voting by non-citizens is extremely rare. It's also clear that Republicans see value in making House Democrats take another vote on the issue. The House approved a bill with the proof of citizenship mandate back in July 'If you have a few thousand illegals participate in the election in the wrong place, you can change the makeup of Congress and you can affect the presidential election,' Johnson said. 'The American people understand that.' The first test for the stopgap spending bill came Tuesday with a 209-206 vote that kept it moving ahead. But some Republicans who have said they will oppose the bill on final passage allowed it to proceed. The measure includes a six-month extension of federal funding to keep agencies and programs operating through March 28. But Democrats want a shorter-term extension so that the current Congress will set full-year spending levels for fiscal 2025 rather than the next president and Congress. They also want the proof of citizenship mandate stripped out of the bill, saying it's unnecessary because states already have effective safeguards in place to verify voters' eligibility and maintain accurate voter rolls. 'Is it any surprise that the speaker's purely partisan CR seems to be running into trouble?' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, using Washington parlance for the short-term continuing resolution needed to prevent a shutdown. 'The answer is very simple. The House should stop wasting time on a CR proposal that cannot become law.' Schumer called on Johnson to consult with Democratic leaders and the White House on a bipartisan package that can pass both chambers. A few House Republicans have also come out against the bill. Some won't vote for any continuing resolution. They want Congress to return to passing the dozen annual appropriations bills individually. Others say the continuing resolution funds programs at levels they consider inappropriate at a time of nearly $2 trillion annual deficits. 'I'm a firm no on bankrupting the nation and a yes on election integrity,' said Representative Cory Mills in announcing his opposition. Representative Tim Burchett said Republican leadership was asking him to vote for what he called 'a Nancy Pelosi-Schumer budget.' 'I just think that's a bad idea,' Burchett said. Republicans can afford to lose only four votes from their ranks if every Democrat votes against the bill. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday seemingly encouraged a government shutdown if Republicans in the House and Senate 'don't get assurances on Election Security.' He said on the social media platform Truth Social that they should not go forward with a continuing resolution without such assurances. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell disagreed when asked about Trump's post. 'Shutting down the government is always a bad idea, no matter what time of the year it is,' McConnell said. House Republicans met behind closed doors Tuesday morning to discuss the path forward. Representative Jim Jordan, a co-founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told colleagues 'this is the best fight we've ever had,' said Representative Kevin Hern. By holding another vote on the proof of citizenship requirement for voter registration, House Republicans are making Democrats in competitive swing districts take another vote on the issue ahead of the election. Last time, five Democrats sided with Republicans in support of the requirement. And their votes this time will be highly scrutinized. Lawmakers said no plan B was discussed for government funding and that Johnson was determined to hold a vote regardless of the likely outcome. 'This is important to him,' said Representative Ralph Norman. 'This is the hill to die on.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/house-speaker-pushes-funding-bill-that-includes-proof-of-citizenship-mandate-/7779214.html	2024-09-10T17:14:09-07:00

Questions continue to swirl around China's 'disappeared' foreign minister	washington — More than a year after China's former foreign minister, Qin Gang, disappeared from public view, raising a host of questions, the Chinese government remains silent on his whereabouts. A new report this week from The Washington Post, citing two former U.S. government officials, suggests Qin has been spared any jail time and now is nominally holding a low-ranking position at a publishing house under the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Earlier reports speculated that he was sentenced to life in prison or had died from suicide or torture. Some are skeptical about the Washington Post report, while others see it as evidence of uncertainty and impermanence within the political system directed by the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP. According to Sunday's Washington Post report, Qin, 58, now works, at least on paper, for the World Affairs Press, a state-owned publishing house under the Foreign Ministry. One of the former officials said Qin is 'not going to jail, but his career is over.' Before he disappeared from public view in July of last year, Qin was the youngest foreign minister since the founding of the CCP. A leading theory among Chinese political analysts is that Qin was removed because he had an affair with Fu Xiaotian, a prominent Chinese television journalist, and that the pair had a child born out of wedlock in the United States. Some reports suggested that the Chinese government suspected Fu of sharing state secrets with foreign intelligence agencies, but these rumors have never been confirmed. Like Qin, Fu disappeared from public life for more than a year ago. During a top-level political meeting in July, the Third Plenum of the 20th Central Committee, the CCP agreed to Qin's request that he be removed from his post as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chinese state media reported. That followed an official announcement in February that said Qin had resigned as a parliamentary deputy. A reporter from The Washington Post recently visited the bookstore of the World Affairs Press in Beijing, but employees there told the newspaper that they had not heard that Qin worked at the publishing house. A staff member who answered the phone said she did not know if the news was true. China's Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Some observers pointed out that the Washington Post's report is based on an anonymous source who has left office, and the authenticity still needs to be verified. Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, said on social media platform X, 'The rumors of Qin Gang moving to World Affairs Press have been around for months. Sources are U.S. ex-officials and I don't know what they do. But @nakashimae & @cdcshepherd are top reporters.' Charles Smith, an encryption security expert, said on X that he doesn't believe the article, which 'even notes the 'bookstore' employees have never seen Qin. ... He's on an extended fishing vacation.' His tweet was accompanied by an image of a skeleton fishing underwater. Last December, online news outlet Politico reported that Qin had been arrested for undermining national security and was tortured to death or committed suicide. Yen-Ting, an X user who frequently comments on China's social and political issues, tweeted, 'It's almost poetic justice, a 'Wolf Warrior' reduced to selling books while the regime's whispers suggest he's paid off the hook rather than locked up. This is China's way of dealing w/ its wayward wolves: not through the claws of justice but by shoving them into obscurity.' Kalpit A. Mankikar, a fellow in the Strategic Studies Program with the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, tweeted, 'Once seen as Stalin's heir, Soviet politician Georgy Malenkov fell from grace and was banished to Kazakhstan to manage a power plant. In #China, ex-foreign minister Qin Gang seems to have rehabilitated at a Party-run bookshop, says @washingtonpost.' The Washington Post report also quoted current and former U.S. officials who had dealt with Qin as saying he lacked the diplomatic skills of his experienced colleagues to break out of the 'Wolf Warrior' model. One example is that Qin appeared to threaten the U.S. with China 'erasing' Taiwan Strait's median line, in a heated exchange with U.S. officials amid former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August 2022. American columnist James Pinkerton tweeted a reader's online comment on the Washington Post report. The reader Paul Messina said, 'I believe that now that the Chinese economy is falling apart, Xi has realized that this 'Wolf Warrior' tactic has actually exacerbated the fall of Chinese industry. Besides aggravating the West, particularly the United States with this nonsense, it has led to multiple Western corporations leaving China, permanently closing their doors and factories in search of friendlier nations to do business. 'Vietnam and other nations have greatly benefited. Thus this idiot actually decreased the CCP's prestige in the world. I believe that this is why his new 'career' is librarian. Xi made a big mistake with his 'Wolf Warrior' attitude towards the world. I believe that he now realizes this fact.' Liu Jianchao, the head of the International Liaison Department of the CCP Central Committee, who is relatively moderate in terms of rhetoric and image, is considered a possible candidate to succeed Wang Yi as the next foreign minister. According to The New York Times, as China is already seeking to soften its image in the U.S. and Europe and improve relations with some of its neighbors, appointing Liu may mean China is abandoning its 'Wolf Warrior' diplomacy.

Google, Apple lose court fights against EU, owe billions in fines, taxes	LONDON — Google lost its last bid to overturn a European Union antitrust penalty, after the bloc's top court ruled against it Tuesday in a case that came with a whopping fine and helped jumpstart an era of intensifying scrutiny for Big Tech companies. The European Union's top court rejected Google's appeal against the $2.7 billion penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's top antitrust enforcer, for violating antitrust rules with its comparison shopping service. Also Tuesday, Apple lost its challenge against an order to repay $14.34 billion in back taxes to Ireland, after the European Court of Justice issued a separate decision siding with the commission in a case targeting unlawful state aid for global corporations. Both companies have now exhausted their appeals in the cases that date to the previous decade. Together, the court decisions are a victory for European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who is expected to step down next month after 10 years as the commission's top official overseeing competition. Experts said the rulings illustrate how watchdogs have been emboldened in the years since the cases were first opened. One of the takeaways from the Apple decision 'is the sense that, again, the EU authorities and courts are prepared to flex their [collective] muscles to bring Big Tech to heel where necessary,' Alex Haffner, a competition partner at law firm Fladgate, said by email. The shopping fine was one of three huge antitrust penalties for Google from the commission, which punished the Silicon Valley giant in 2017 for unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service over competitors. 'We are disappointed with the decision of the Court, which relates to a very specific set of facts,' Google said in a brief statement. The company said it made changes to comply with the commission's decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. It started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services. 'Our approach has worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services,' Google said. European consumer group BEUC hailed the court's decision, saying it shows how the bloc's competition law 'remains highly relevant' in digital markets. 'It is a good outcome for all European consumers at the end of the day,' Director General Agustín Reyna said in an interview. 'It means that many smaller companies or rivals will be able to go to different comparison shopping sites. They don't need to depend on Google to reach out to customers.' Google is still appealing its two other EU antitrust cases: a 2018 fine of $4.55 billion involving its Android operating system and a 2019 penalty of $1.64 billion over its AdSense advertising platform. Despite the amounts of money involved, the adverse rulings will leave a small financial dent in one of the world's richest and most profitable companies. The combined bill of $17 billion facing Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent company, represents 0.3% of their combined market value of $5.2 trillion. Those three cases foreshadowed expanded efforts by regulators worldwide to crack down on the tech industry. The EU has since opened more investigations into Big Tech companies and drew up a new law to prevent them from cornering online markets, known as the Digital Markets Act. Google is also now facing pressure over its lucrative digital advertising business from the EU and Britain, which are carrying out separate investigations, and the United States, where the Department of Justice is taking the company to federal court over its alleged dominance in ad tech. Apple failed in its last bid to avoid repaying its Irish taxes Tuesday after the Court of Justice upheld a lower court ruling against the company, in the dispute that dates back to 2016. The case drew outrage from Apple, with CEO Tim Cook calling it 'total political crap.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/google-apple-lose-court-fights-against-eu-owe-billions-in-fines-taxes-/7779133.html	2024-09-10T15:17:31-07:00	
US Assistant Secretary of State O'Brien: Georgia's leadership is 'in denial'	WASHINGTON — A controversial law on 'foreign influence transparency' is heading toward full implementation in Georgia, even though the country aspires to join the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization. September 2 was the deadline for Georgian nongovernmental organizations and media organizations receiving more than one-fifth of their funding from abroad to register as 'organizations serving the interests of a foreign power.' Only 1.6% of the country’s organizations chose to do so. Many organizations expect they will be forced to register and fined for allegedly serving foreign interests. Georgia’s so-called 'foreign agent' law has been labeled a 'Russian-style law' and heavily criticized by Georgia’s Western partners, who say it undermines the hope of most Georgians that their country will join European institutions. Georgia’s government, however, insists the law simply seeks to ensure 'transparency.' On October 26, Georgians will head to the polls to elect a new parliament, and the political opposition believes these elections will be a referendum on whether the country will continue to move toward integration with Europe. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs James O'Brien spoke with Voice of America’s Georgian Service about what the Biden administration will be most closely watching. VOA: The Georgian government is moving ahead with implementation of the Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence, which has triggered criticism and the imposition of travel restrictions against Georgian government officials by the U.S. and a pause in aid by both the U.S. and the EU. What message does the Biden administration have now for the Georgian leadership? Will the process of implementing the law affect whether the October parliamentary election will be seen as free and fair? U.S. Assistant Secretary of State James O'Brien: We want the Georgian people to be able to register their votes in a free and fair election. For that to happen, we need to see the whole process work well, all these organizations [being] able to work effectively over the next several months without fear of oppression or violence. This law, as we've said repeatedly, is flawed fundamentally. There are ways that European states protect their election systems. This law does not do that. Having a government agency essentially force a registration and have access to all the data in that organization is at odds with modern European practice. … It’s caused an enormous amount of damage to Georgia's prospects for joining the EU and NATO. The elections need to be free and fair. It's good that the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe will be able to have a mission to observe some parts [of the election], but it also depends on the community groups. All of that is one big system, and this law tries to kick one leg out from a three-legged stool. It doesn't work. And so, I'm worried that it means the elections will not be free and fair, and they certainly won't be seen as free and fair. Without that, Georgia can't make the next step forward. VOA: The U.S. and Georgia have been strategic partners for over three decades. The Biden administration has taken several steps, including visa restrictions, pausing aid and postponing joint military drills. What might the next steps be? What are the options on the table? O’Brien: We’ve already put in place restriction on travel to the U.S. that's affected dozens of people. We're not allowed to say who exactly. But it's a very significant step. We have suspended help, assistance to a range of the Georgian society. That's a shame, but it's necessary. And the EU’s said that the process of joining the EU is effectively suspended. We do not want to see a return to the kind of violence, harassment and oppression that we saw in the spring, where civil society groups, individuals were visited by often-thuggish groups with Russian accents, they were visited by members of the government. All of those things can't happen. VOA: Meanwhile, [ruling party] Georgian Dream leaders have promised to 'ban opposition parties' following the elections. How does this sound coming from the leadership of a country aspiring to EU and NATO membership, and what concerns does it raise about the ruling party’s intentions? O’Brien: It doesn't sound like a democracy. One party doesn't get to decide what other party gets to compete. It's for the citizens to decide what parties take their seats in parliament, according to fair rules that are understood in advance. So, I think that was a very revealing comment. And it suggests that this is not a government capable of bringing Georgia toward Europe. VOA: Russian intelligence services are accusing the U.S. of plotting 'regime change' in Georgia. Some Georgian Dream members also have accused U.S. organizations like the NDI or IRI [the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, both of which are American nongovernmental organizations funded by the U.S. government] of helping the opposition. What do you make of these accusations, and are you worried about possible Russian interference or malign influence in the Georgian elections? O’Brien: Well, anyone who believes the Russian security services, I think, is fooling themselves. The American organizations are very transparent. It's known who we work with, and we work to support the Georgian people so that they can organize themselves inside or outside government. That's the full goal. We don't pick winners and losers. We are for the Georgian people, most of whom, almost 90% of whom, want to move toward Europe, and it's this government with its very bad legal drafting — like it's just bad lawyering — that has caused this problem. And we would like them to fix it so that the Georgian people can organize themselves and could have a free and fair election. If the government succeeds in … denying access to resources by all these groups, the only ones left standing will be Russian sources of information. So, whatever the case has been till now, what the government is doing [now] makes it much easier for Russia to dominate Georgia's information space. VOA: After so many high-level engagements with the Georgian authorities, and Prime Minister [Irakli] Kobakhidze speaking about the need for 'resetting' the relationship, do you have any indication that they might be ready to change course? O’Brien: No. And they're in denial. They haven't noticed we’ve suspended $95 million in assistance. The EU is suspending a proportionate amount: They are saying you don't get to move toward Europe. And what Georgian Dream tries to tell its voters, and all Georgian citizens, is [that] everything is fine. It is not fine. Georgia wants to join the European Union. There are clear rules. The people responsible for those rules are saying you have made a mistake. You have written a bad law. They are on the verge of writing two new bad laws and those need to stop in order for the people of Georgia to get what they overwhelmingly want. We've said again and again to the Georgian officials: The transparency you say you want is readily available. All the American organizations are transparent. The European organizations are transparent. There are ways to achieve that. But they've chosen to do it in a way that lets the [Georgian] Ministry of Justice control your local neighborhood organization. And that's not democratic, and it's not part of Europe. We want them to turn back so that the Georgian people can be part of Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-assistant-secretary-of-state-o-brien-georgia-s-leadership-is-in-denial-/7779104.html	2024-09-10T14:47:15-07:00	
Dam overflow sparks new crisis in insurgency-hit Nigerian city	Maiduguri, Nigeria — Flood water from an overflowing dam has destroyed thousands of homes in Maiduguri, the capital city of Borno state in northeast Nigeria, and emergency officials fear the situation could get worse. Several aerial videos and photos shared by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) with AFP showed rows of houses submerged in murky water. An epicenter of more than a decade-long insurgency, Maiduguri serves as the hub for the responses to the humanitarian crisis in the northeast region. The United Nations refugee agency in Nigeria on its X account said it was the city's worst flooding in 30 years. 'It is an unprecedented incident,' NEMA spokesman Ezekiel Manzo told AFP on Tuesday. 'Some of the central parts of the city that have not witnessed flood in so many years are witnessing it today.' Thousands of homes have been submerged by the rapid rise of water after the rupture of the Alau Dam on the Ngadda River, 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Maiduguri. 'The last three days have over 150,000 individuals with over 23,000 households affected,' said NEMA zonal coordinator Surajo Garba. But with more locations being hit, 'we are sure the figure will be much over 200,000 individuals,' Garba forecast. 'The flood, which began over the weekend and worsened in the following days, was the direct result of excess water from the Alau Dam,' said Nigeria's Vice President Kashim Shettima, who hails from Maiduguri, as he visited the area. 'The collapse of the spillways unleashed a significant surge of water downstream, causing widespread flooding in the surrounding communities,' Shettima said. The flood also inundated the city's post office and main zoo, with authorities warning that deadly animals had been washed into communities. Manzo said forecasts did not prepare the emergency workers for the extent of the flooding, while also blaming the impact of climate change for the disaster. He told AFP there were deaths from the incident but declined to give a specific number because rescue workers continue rescue operations in the affected areas. With flooding still high in many parts of the city, authorities have opened three temporary shelters for the victims. 'Homes are submerged, schools shut down and businesses crippled as people evacuate with their belongings,' the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' Nigeria office said. Floods have killed at least 229 people and displaced around 380,000 more in parts of the country, according to NEMA, but mainly in the northern region. Some 110,000 hectares (280,000 acres) of farmland have also been affected, NEMA figures showed. Damage to farmland will worsen Nigeria's high rates of food insecurity, Save the Children warned last week. 'One in every six children across Nigeria faced hunger in June-August this year' – a 25% increase on the same period last year, the NGO said in a statement. Flooding, usually caused by abundant rains and poor infrastructure, has caused large-scale destruction in Africa's most populous country in the past. More than 360 people died and more than 2.1 million were displaced in 2012. In 2022, more than 500 people died and 1.4 million were displaced in the worst floods in a decade. Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu offered his 'condolences' to those affected in a statement, 'especially to the families that have lost their means of livelihood due to the disaster.' His office said earlier he is working with state authorities to 'address the immediate humanitarian needs of the affected people.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dam-overflow-sparks-new-crisis-in-insurgency-hit-nigerian-city/7778990.html	2024-09-10T14:16:41-07:00	
Abortion-rights measure will be on Missouri's November ballot, court rules	JEFFERSON CITY, Missouri — An amendment to restore abortion rights in Missouri will be on the ballot, the state's Supreme Court ruled Tuesday. The proposal to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution is expected to widely undo the state's 2022 near-total abortion ban if passed. Judges ruled hours before the Tuesday deadline for changes to be made to the November ballot. Supreme Court judges ordered Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft to put the measure back on the ballot. He had removed it Monday following a county circuit judge's ruling Friday. The order also directs Ashcroft, an abortion opponent, to 'take all steps necessary to ensure that it is on said ballot.' The court's full opinion on the case was not immediately released Tuesday. Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, the campaign backing the measure, lauded the decision. 'Missourians overwhelmingly support reproductive rights, including access to abortion, birth control, and miscarriage care,' campaign manager Rachel Sweet said in a statement. 'Now, they will have the chance to enshrine these protections in the Missouri Constitution on November 5.' Mary Catherine Martin, a lawyer for a group of Republican lawmakers and abortion opponents suing to remove the amendment, had told Supreme Court judges during rushed Tuesday arguments that the initiative petition 'misled voters' by not listing all the laws restricting abortion that it would effectively repeal. The amendment is part of a national push to have voters weigh in on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Missouri banned almost all abortions immediately after that Supreme Court ruling. Eight other states will consider constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights, including Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada and South Dakota. Most would guarantee a right to abortion until fetal viability and allow it later for the health of the pregnant woman, which is what the Missouri proposal would do. New York also has a ballot measure that proponents say would protect abortion rights, though there's a dispute about its impact. Voting on the polarizing issue could draw more people to the polls, potentially impacting results for the presidency in swing states, control of Congress and the outcomes for closely contested state offices. Missouri Democrats, for instance, hope to get a boost from abortion-rights supporters during the November election. Legal fights have sprung up across the country over whether to allow voters to decide these questions — and over the exact wording used on the ballots and explanatory material. In August, Arkansas' highest court upheld a decision to keep an abortion rights initiative off the state's November ballot, agreeing with election officials that the group behind the measure did not properly submit documentation regarding the signature gatherers it hired. Seven states have previously had abortion questions on their ballots since Roe was overturned, and voters have sided with abortion-rights supporters each time.	https://www.voanews.com/a/abortion-rights-measure-will-be-on-missouri-s-november-ballot-court-rules-/7779041.html	2024-09-10T14:13:19-07:00	
Jamaica to deploy 20 soldiers, 4 police to help fight gangs in Haiti	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness announced Tuesday that his country would send two dozen soldiers and police officers to Haiti this week to boost a United Nations-backed mission led by Kenya to fight violent gangs. The 20 soldiers and four police officers are scheduled to arrive Thursday and will join nearly 400 Kenyan police who arrived earlier this year and are working alongside Haitian police and military, said Vice Admiral Antonette Wemyss-Gorman, chief of defense staff for Jamaica's military. The Jamaicans will be responsible for providing command, planning and logistics support, Holness said at a news conference. Jamaica had pledged a total of 170 soldiers and 30 police officers, but Holness said it wasn't possible to deploy them all at once. 'It's not practical,' he said, adding that facilities to host those arriving and a command structure need to be in place before the full number pledged is deployed. 'We want a very successful operation.' The initial number of police and soldiers announced by Holness surprised many and comes at a time when the U.S. government has warned that the Kenyan-led mission lacks money and personnel as it considers a U.N. peacekeeping mission as one way to secure more resources. In recent days, the U.N. and Ecuador circulated a draft resolution obtained by The Associated Press asking the U.N. to start planning for a peacekeeping operation to replace the current mission. Such a proposal would have to be decided by the U.N. Security Council, which experts do not believe would approve it. On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said 'it's very strange' that there is apparently no money available to support the Kenyan-led mission. 'I think countries should assume responsibilities and should come and provide the necessary funding,' he said. Holness did not comment on the possibility of a U.N. peacekeeping mission but said the current mission 'can be a long and extended process.' He added that the mission is not the only or final solution to problems in Haiti, where gangs control 80% of the capital of Port-au-Prince. The violence has spread to other areas across the country, with more than 3,200 people killed from January to May, according to the U.N. The ongoing violence also has left more than half a million people homeless in recent years. 'Haiti is the example of what could happen if states and governments do not take the problem seriously and put in place the measures and resources necessary to bring the problem under control,' Holness said. Overall, the mission is expected to have a total of 2,500 personnel, with the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin and Chad also pledging to send police and soldiers, although it wasn't clear when that would happen. On Saturday, the Bahamas' foreign affairs minister, Fred Mitchell, told reporters that while the government hasn't wavered in its pledge, it's unclear when it will deploy troops to Haiti given that the mission's dynamics have changed. 'One of the things the Bahamas has to consider is the new position of the U.S.,' he said. The mission is expected to cost roughly $600 million a year, although the U.N. has received only $68 million out of $85 million pledged so far. The U.S. and Canada have provided most of the funds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jamaica-to-deploy-20-soldiers-4-police-to-help-fight-gangs-in-haiti/7778997.html	2024-09-10T13:16:22-07:00

Blinken, Lammy stress importance of Taiwan Strait status quo in US-UK talks	State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy addressed Indo-Pacific security and highlighted the need to maintain the status quo on the Taiwan Strait during their U.S.-U.K. Strategic Dialogue, underscoring its global significance. 'We also discussed joint efforts to ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and freedom of navigation and overflight of the South China Sea. For both of us, maintaining peace and stability, preserving the status quo is essential,' Blinken told reporters during a joint press conference with Lammy in London. 'It's essential not just to us; it’s, again, essential to countries all around the world,' Blinken added. U.S. officials have stressed the need to keep open high-level communication between Washington and Beijing to clear up misperceptions and prevent their competition from escalating into conflict. Earlier this week, the United States and China held theater-level commander talks for the first time in an effort to stabilize military relations. The video teleconference Monday, between Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and General Wu Yanan, commander of the People's Liberation Army's Southern Theater Command, was aimed at preventing misunderstandings, particularly in regional hotspots like the South China Sea. According to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Paparo emphasized the Chinese military’s responsibility to adhere to international laws and norms to ensure operational safety. 'Paparo also urged the PLA to reconsider its use of dangerous, coercive, and potentially escalatory tactics in the South China Sea and beyond.' In Beijing, China’s Ministry of National Defense issued a press release Tuesday stating the two commanders exchanged views on matters of mutual concern, but did not provide further details about the discussion. Washington has been seeking to establish new channels for regular military communication with Beijing after relations hit a historic low when the U.S. downed a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon last year. The theater-level commander talks differ from the broader discussions between U.S. and Chinese defense chiefs, which cover all strategic issues impacting both nations, Ryan Haas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA. The theater-level talks provide a platform for more focused discussions on operational issues, crisis management, and deconfliction at an operator-to-operator level, added Haas, a former senior official on the White House National Security Council from 2013 to 2017. The virtual meeting between Paparo and Wu followed a meeting last month in Beijing, where U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s top military adviser agreed to the talks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-lammy-stress-importance-of-taiwan-strait-status-quo-in-us-uk-talks/7778934.html	2024-09-10T12:27:55-07:00	
Political startups bleed support in India-administered Kashmir over suspected Delhi ties	Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir — New political parties formed after the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special autonomy five years ago appear to be bleeding support ahead of the first regional elections since then. Analysts see perceived ties to the central government in New Delhi as a factor. Typical of the trend is former lawmaker Noor Mohammad Sheikh, who recently resigned from the Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party, or JKAP, a political group he had joined a few years ago in Indian-administrated Kashmir. Established in 2020 by Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari, a businessman-turned-politician, and Ghulam Hassan Mir, a veteran politician from north Kashmir, JKAP aimed to build a bridge between the local population and New Delhi after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reduced the Himalayan region to a federally controlled territory in August 2019. Bukhari and Mir successfully recruited over 50 politicians, including Sheikh, from various pro-India parties, giving JKAP a promising start. The party was expected to reshape the political landscape of the region by challenging the dominance of the two main parties — the National Conference, or NC, and the People’s Democratic Party, or PDP. 'Bukhari took the initiative to engage with the government of India during a time of complete silence in the Kashmir Valley,' Sheikh told VOA. 'I chose to join the party because I believed I could represent my people when no one else was doing so.' JKAP, however, suffered an abrupt downfall after a disappointing performance during Indian general elections held earlier this year. With the announcement of the first assembly elections since Indian Kashmir became a union territory scheduled to begin September 18, JKAP began to unravel. Core members of the group started leaving one after another, causing the party to fragment. 'My workers did not support me, so I chose to leave the [JKAP] after three years,' Sheikh said. 'My supporters and I held a protest on August 5, and on that very day I decided to contest the election as an independent candidate.' Noor Ahmad Baba, a prominent Srinagar-based political analyst and professor, told VOA that the central government tried to reshape the politics in Kashmir from above by promoting new political groups in the region, but they couldn’t push aside traditional parties, especially the NC. 'It’s hard to achieve such goals in a country like India. Even a dictator wouldn’t be able to do it. Over time, people have become more politically aware and can analyze things and respond accordingly,' Baba said. 'The parliamentary elections indicated that building a new political party takes time and sacrifices and cannot be imposed from above.' Multiple parties that formed after the region lost its semiautonomous status have faced similar challenges. The Democratic Progressive Azad Party, established by former Chief Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad in September 2022, has lost over a dozen lawmakers, including co-founder Taj Mohiuddin. Azad, once a close aide to India’s opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, faced criticism from the locals who suspect that he, like lawmakers among other regional upstart parties, has a covert alliance with Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The suspicion was fueled by Modi’s praise for Azad following his exit from the Indian National Congress. Azad, however, dismisses these claims as attempts to undermine his new political role. Similarly, the much longer established Jammu Kashmir Peoples Conference, or JKPC, led by separatist-turned-mainstream politician Sajad Lone, is losing ground. Many attribute its decline to Lone’s alleged closeness to Modi. Many politicians who left these upstart parties are now running as independent candidates. They say that elections attract 'new combinations and shifting allegiances.' 'I left JKPC for my own survival,' Nizam Ud Din Bhat, a former lawmaker from north Kashmir’s Bandipora district, told VOA. 'My voters and workers wanted me to contest election from my home district as an independent candidate.' Muzamil Maqbool, another analyst and a political commentator, believes that public pressure has forced many individuals to run independently. 'People like the work done by some of these candidates but they do not like the political party they represented,' he said. 'However, we cannot ignore the fact that these independent candidates could join hands with any leading political party in the assembly elections by October this year,' he said. 'Horse trading in politics is not a new thing and in Kashmir; it is often the only way for politicians to secure their future and survive.' Professor Baba believes that those who switched parties during tough times and aligned with New Delhi may face difficulties. 'People now understand that such individuals are motivated by a desire to cling to power,' Baba said. 'I believe it might cost them in the upcoming elections.' JKAP co-founder Hassan Mir told VOA that emotional politics played by other parties has impacted people for decades. 'Every political party is referred to by various names, but if the vision and agenda are clear, it’s crucial to persuade people regardless of the labels attached,' he said. 'Some members departed because they sought power and realized we couldn’t provide it while others left due to unmet expectations regarding their mandates.'

US senator blocks promotion of top aide to Defense Secretary Austin	washington — Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville is blocking the quick promotion of the top military aide to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin over concerns that he and other senior staff did not immediately notify President Joe Biden when Austin was hospitalized with complications from cancer treatment earlier this year. Biden in July nominated Lieutenant General Ronald Clark to become commander of U.S. Army forces in the Pacific. But Clark has faced criticism from Republicans over his role as one of Austin's top aides when the defense secretary was in the hospital in January and did not tell Biden or other U.S. leaders. Republicans said the fact that Biden was kept in the dark about Austin not being in command for days could have meant confusion or delays in military action, even though decision-making authorities had been transferred to the deputy defense secretary. Tuberville's hold comes a year after he came under intense criticism from colleagues in both parties for holding up hundreds of military promotions over a Pentagon abortion policy. The Senate finally approved 425 military promotions and nominations in November after Tuberville relented. Republican colleagues said they agreed with Tuberville on the abortion policy but openly pressured him to drop the holds, voicing concern about military readiness and the toll it was taking on service members and their families who had nothing to do with the regulations. A spokeswoman for Tuberville, Hannah Eddins, said Tuesday that the senator has concerns about Clark's role during Austin's hospitalization, including that he did not inform Biden. She said that Tuberville is waiting on an a report from the Pentagon's inspector general that will review the matter. 'As a senior commissioned officer, Lieutenant General Clark's oath requires him to notify POTUS when the chain of command is compromised,' Eddins said, using an acronym for the president of the United States. Majority Democrats could still bring Clark's nomination up for a vote, but Tuberville's hold likely delays his confirmation because several days of floor time would be needed to confirm him. The nomination will expire with the end of the congressional session and the next president would have to renominate Clark or someone else to the post if he is not confirmed by early January. Pentagon spokesperson James Adams said that Tuberville's new hold, which was first reported by The Washington Post, 'undermines our military readiness.' 'Lt. Gen. Clark is highly qualified and was nominated for this critical position because of his experience and strategic expertise,' Adams said in a statement. 'We urge the Senate to confirm all of our qualified nominees.' Austin has come under bipartisan criticism for initially keeping Biden in the dark about his health issues and hospitalization. Austin was admitted to intensive care for complications from prostate cancer surgery on January 1, but the White House was not told until January 4. Austin's senior staff were notified on January 2. The defense secretary later said he takes full responsibility and had apologized to Biden. Still, Austin insisted that there were no gaps in control of the department or the nation's security because 'at all times, either I or the deputy secretary was in a position to conduct the duties of my office.' An earlier Pentagon review of the matter blamed privacy restrictions and staff hesitancy for the secrecy, and called for improved procedures, which have been made. The White House also laid out a new set of guidelines to ensure it will be informed any time a Cabinet head cannot carry out their job. The new guidelines include a half-dozen instructions for Cabinet agencies to follow when there is a 'delegation of authority,' or when secretaries temporarily transfer their authority to a deputy when unreachable due to medical issues, travel or other reasons.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lone-us-senator-blocks-quick-promotion-of-top-aide-to-defense-secretary-austin/7778883.html	2024-09-10T12:04:45-07:00	
Zimbabwe rolls out hefty fines for poor telecommunications services	Harare, Zimbabwe — Zimbabwe’s government has introduced hefty fines of up to $5,000 for poor service in the country's telecommunications industry. In a statement Tuesday, Zimbabwe’s ICT Minister Tatenda Mavetera said the government will levy fines of between $200 and $5,000 per infringement for telecommunications companies and internet providers who fail to give reliable service. Willard Shoko, an independent high-speed internet consultant, said the new fines could result in a solid telecom industry that can compete in the entire southern African region. 'The motive behind that is to improve internet for the end user. But I think they should also consider improving the infrastructure sharing and also collaboration to improve internet, not only for the region but also for Zimbabwe, because this is the foundation of the digital economy,' Shoko said. 'I think they should also think about how the internet can be improved and the partnership that can help improve the internet.' Fungai Mandiveyi, media and corporate affairs executive at Econet Wireless, Zimbabwe’s biggest telecommunications company, said the new regulations will be easier to comply with than those that existed before. 'The new provisions introduce a new model of penalties, unlike the blanket penalty that existed in the previous statutory instrument,' Mandiveyi said. 'The new penalties are now linked to specific quality of service breaches, that have also been clearly spelled out. There is now more clarity in what constitutes a service breach, and what penalty goes with a specific breach of the quality of service.' However, Christopher Musodza, an independent digital policy consultant, said the pressure to maintain internet service during Zimbabwe’s frequent power outages may present challenges for telecom companies. 'For the telecoms provider, it’s going to be tough,' he said. 'The economy is not performing as anyone would want. We have got issues to do with long hours of load shedding, so service providers have to power their base stations for long hours to ensure that they meet the key performance indicators. So, imagine running generators for most of the day to ensure that you avoid a fine. (I’m) not sure what will cost more; trying to keep up with these economic factors or just paying the fine.' Zimbabweans have long complained about poor and expensive telecommunication service. Shoko said that is the reason they are welcoming the government's decision this month to approve Starlink’s license to operate in Zimbabwe. The U.S.-based satellite company, owned by Elon Musk, has established a presence in several other African countries, including Botswana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Zambia. 'They can now easily get internet anywhere in Zimbabwe at an affordable price, thereby bridging the digital divide. That’s one major thing for the end user,' Shoko said of Starlink’s presence. 'For the local ISPs [internet service providers], there is massive opportunity that Zimbabwe can take advantage of — investment in ground infrastructure,' he added. 'Currently in Africa, Nigeria has only two ground stations that are servicing the whole of Africa. If the Zimbabwe government and local ISPs can work together with Starlink to provide ground stations in Zimbabwe, this will allow local ISPs to provide internet to Starlink, and provide better latencies in the region. So this will improve Starlink internet for local Zimbabweans, as well as the region.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-rolls-out-hefty-fines-for-poor-telecommunication-services/7778769.html	2024-09-10T10:25:07-07:00

Betrayed' rural Thais no longer guarantee votes for Shinawatra clan	Bangkok/Surin, Thailand — Rural voters may have permanently turned away from the Shinawatra family and its Pheu Thai party, former loyalists warn, after Thailand’s dominant political clan welcomed a fresh cohort of conservative one-time rivals into its coalition Cabinet. These include prominent royalists who have backed coups and deadly crackdowns on the Red Shirt protest movement, which emerged to protest a 2006 coup that deposed then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Tycoons and royalist generals have fought for two decades for control of the country’s politics and the economic spoils. In that time, political violence has claimed the lives of scores, if not hundreds, of people in clashes between rival factions. Red Shirts paid the highest price during a 2010 army crackdown on their rallies in Bangkok. Rivalry at the top has been set aside — for now — by a government led by Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the daughter of divisive billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra, who still wields vast influence over Thai politics despite having no formal role. Now, many Red Shirts say they feel abandoned by Thaksin, a figurehead they once adored. 'I used to feel sorry for Thaksin for all the things the establishment did to him and his family. But now that they’ve betrayed us, I’m heartsick,' said Napassorn Boonree, 61, a Red Shirt from Ubon Ratchathani, recalling the 2010 crackdown by security forces on demonstrators in Bangkok. 'People died for [the Shinawatra family], but they no longer care for us. Now we see their true colors. They’ve done everything all along only for their own gain.' Paetongtarn Shinawatra’s government has a new mission: to defeat the new reform movement which won the last polls in 2023 and has become the biggest threat to the political and economic interests of the establishment since Thaksin himself won his first election in 2001. The Move Forward Party was blocked from taking control of the government and subsequently dissolved by a court ruling. Its key executives were banned from politics. But it has been rebranded as the People’s Party and is determined to win the 2027 election. Too late for Pheu Thai? Thaksin’s daughter, Thailand’s youngest premier at age 38, is due to give her first policy briefing on September 12. She is expected to announce a timeframe for cash handouts of 10,00 baht ($295) to 50 million citizens alongside debt-reduction plans, hoping to renew faith in Pheu Thai among a poor, rural base who once voted unquestioningly for any Shinawatra candidate. But it may be too late. Red Shirts 'will express their disappointment at the ballot box,' predicted Thida Thavornseth on Thai TV, describing the 'merger' between Pheu Thai and its former enemies as the same as a business deal between tycoons. In any case, Paetongtarn’s government first must survive to contest the next polls. Coming into office after the shock court dismissal of predecessor Srettha Thavisin in an ethics probe last month, Paetongtarn will have to deal with powerful establishment enemies accumulated by her family over the years. 'Having Shinawatra as a last name is always a danger. ... The name is synonymous with political conflict in modern Thai history,' said Stithorn Thananithichot, director of the Office of Innovation for Democracy at King Prajadhipok's Institute. Thaksin was deposed in a 2006 coup, and the administration of his sister Yingluck was taken out by the army in 2014. Srettha last month joined a growing list of Shinawatra-backed premiers to be picked off by the conservative courts. 'We are seeing enemies becoming allies against a bigger threat — [the] People’s Party. The conservative elite has no other option than to use Thaksin’s service,' Stithorn told VOA. But Paetongtarn has 'to move fast,' he warned, to prove her government can win over an electorate burned by the seeming betrayal of their shifting alliances. A by-election on September 15 for a seat vacated by a banned Move Forward member may provide an early test of Pheu Thai’s popularity. Money problems Throughout villages of northeastern and northern Thailand, household debt is commonly sky high, and many working-age adults have migrated to cities or overseas for jobs that pay more than farm work. The COVID pandemic sank Thailand’s most vulnerable deeper into financial trouble. Previous Shinawatra governments gave generous farm subsidies, better education and access to basic healthcare and were rewarded with landslide poll victories in 2001, 2005 and 2011. Former Red Shirt Singthong Chaichuay says he is so tired of Thailand’s political turmoil that principles no longer matter. He just wants a better quality of life for the country’s poorest. 'Thai people are very forgiving, and if our country is really moving forward, then I don’t have a problem which side Pheu Thai joins, even if it is with former enemies,' the 61-year-old told VOA from his village in Surin, near the Cambodian border. 'Whoever can make our lives better is the answer for us now.' But there is a divergence with younger people. In the 2023 election, they voted in vast numbers for Move Forward, taking seats from Pheu Thai across what was once home ground for Shinawatra-linked lawmakers. 'During Thaksin times, it was the golden era for farmers. Everyone was driving new tractors, the price of rice was also high,' said Chatupat Sriwong, 31, who like many of her peers leaves her young child to be raised at home while working abroad. 'Fast forward to today … and we’re developing very little here. My only focus now is to make money and that means working overseas because there’s no way I can do that here.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/betrayed-rural-thais-no-longer-guarantee-votes-for-shinawatra-clan/7778707.html	2024-09-10T10:12:09-07:00	
Vietnamese immigrants and their children divided on US border policy	More than 1.2 million Vietnamese immigrants live in the United States, many of them having settled after the Vietnam war. More recently, a new wave of Vietnamese migration has sparked debate in the community about immigration and has become one of the main talking points this election season. VOA’s Elizabeth Lee has the details from Texas, the state with the second-largest Vietnamese immigrant population in the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnamese-immigrants-and-their-children-divided-on-us-border-policy-/7777563.html	2024-09-10T10:05:53-07:00	
African nations boost gold reserves amid economic uncertainty	Nairobi, Kenya — Central banks in Africa are turning to gold to protect themselves from economic and geopolitical instability and to diversify their financial portfolios. In September 2023, the price of gold per ounce was $1,900. A year later, it is selling for $2,500. According to the World Gold Council, an international trade association for the gold industry, demand for the metal is expected to increase in the next 10 months despite the soaring prices. Some experts, such as Carlos Lopes, a professor at the Nelson Mandela School of Public Governance in South Africa, attribute the African central banks’ gold rush to the need to protect their local currencies. 'In the last few years, because of inflation and all these movements for stimulation packages and the rest, the returns are extremely low,' Lopes said. 'On the other hand, gold is going up in terms of price because these big banks are also going after gold as a protection. So, it is a very good investment to go to gold.' It helps that African gold production has grown by 60% since 2010, according to the World Gold Council, higher than a global increase of 26%. In 2022, Zimbabwe launched a gold-backed currency to curb inflation and volatility in foreign exchange rates. Ghana and Uganda have been buying gold from artisanal miners to bolster their shrinking foreign currency reserves. Ghana, Africa's largest gold producer, plans to buy oil from other countries and pay them in gold to ease pressure on local currency and lower high fuel prices. Some economists say gold cannot solve the economic problems of some African countries. According to the World Gold Council, countries should hold onto gold for its long-term value, performance during crises and its role as an effective portfolio diversifier. Bright Oppong Afum, a senior lecturer at the University of Mines and Technology in Ghana, said some African countries want to use gold to reduce their reliance on the global financial system. 'If sanctions are laid on you, an African country, we know the devastating effects that it will have,' he said. 'The African countries are developing, or they are young, and they do not want to receive some harsh sanctions that will negatively or strongly impact the economics. And because of that, they are strategically reducing their dependencies on these external countries.' Afum said that although some Africans know and understand the value of gold, many trade away the metal to satisfy their daily needs. 'So, they just find a mere buyer who will ... exploit them,' he said. The African Continental Free Trade Area introduced the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System, enabling countries to trade in local currencies. Experts say some continental payment systems, if implemented, can ease the economic pressures some countries are grappling with. That, in turn, might make them less dependent on gold.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-nations-boost-gold-reserve-amid-economic-uncertainty/7778680.html	2024-09-10T09:55:54-07:00	
Russia, China kick off joint military exercises, challenging US-led coalition	Taipei, Taiwan — Russia says it launched massive naval and air drills Tuesday that span a huge swath of oceans and involve more than 400 naval vessels, at least 120 military aircraft and upwards of 90,000 troops. The large-scale military exercise, dubbed 'Ocean-2024,' includes forces from China and will run until September 16 with at least 15 countries invited to observe the maneuvers, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia pays 'special attention' to strengthening military cooperation with 'friendly states' and warned the United States not to try and outgun Moscow in Asia. 'Under the pretext of countering the allegedly existing Russian threat and containing the People's Republic of China, the United States and its satellites are increasing their military presence near Russia's western borders, in the Arctic, and in the Asia-Pacific region,' Putin said in a televised remark to Russian military officials on Tuesday. He said Washington and its allies are 'openly declaring their plans to deploy medium- and shorter-range missiles in the so-called forward zones.' Analysts say the joint naval and air drills are an effort by Russia and China to deepen military ties and counter increased security coordination between the United States and its allies in the Indo-Pacific region. 'Russia wants to demonstrate that they can engage in a full-scale war with Ukraine while deploying resources to the Indo-Pacific region and China wants to show that they can deepen its relationship with Russia and cause problems in the region, primarily in the South China Sea but also around Japan,' said Stephen Nagy, a regional security expert at the International Christian University in Japan. On Monday, the Chinese defense ministry said both countries would conduct joint naval and aerial exercises aimed at deepening bilateral strategic cooperation and strengthening their ability to respond to security threats in the waters and airspace near the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk. In addition to the joint exercise near Japan, the Chinese defense ministry said Chinese and Russian naval fleets will conduct their fifth joint patrol in the Pacific Ocean as part of the 'Ocean-2024' strategic exercise. 'Russia hopes to increase pressure on the United States on the Pacific front through the joint military exercise with China, which may force Washington to reduce its military deployment to Europe,' said Lin Ying-yu, a military expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan. On the other hand, he added that China hopes to divert Japan’s attention from waters near the Taiwan Strait through its closer military partnership with Russia. 'Japan will have to prioritize threats to their security so they won’t have more bandwidth to focus on the situation across the Taiwan Strait,' Lin told VOA in a phone interview. China and Russia’s increased military cooperation near Japan in recent years has prompted Tokyo to characterize their joint activities as a 'grave concern.' 'These repeated joint activities are clearly intended for demonstration of force against Japan and are a grave concern from the perspective of the national security of Japan,' the Japanese defense ministry wrote in its annual defense white paper, which was released in July. For now, Nagy said Japan is more concerned with how the military cooperation may evolve, adding that there are still limits to what the two can do together when they conduct exercises. 'Japan will be concerned about whether the coordination between China and Russia will be used to destabilize sea lines of communication, to prop up North Korea, or to move towards some kind of forced reunification with Taiwan,' he told VOA in a phone interview. 'The Russians and Chinese will sail beside each other, fly next to each other, or coordinate how their boats move around but they haven’t developed interoperability and inter-command.' Enhancing logistics, communication collaboration While there are limits to their cooperation, other analysts say Russia and China will still use joint military exercises to enhance their cooperation in logistics, such as exchanging parts, fuel, or services or sharing data or communication channels. 'The ability for the Chinese and Russian armies to better understand one another and better support each other in the field is an important capability to develop for both countries,' Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, told VOA by phone. In addition to that, Lin in Taipei said China could also enhance its forces’ combat capabilities through joint military exercises with Russia since the Russian forces have accumulated real combat experiences from Moscow’s war in Ukraine. 'Since Russia’s navies have dealt with drone or anti-ship missile attacks launched by Ukraine, the Chinese navy could learn about how to deal with similar attacks in a potential war across the Taiwan Strait from their Russian counterparts,' he told VOA. Pushing back against NATO China and Russia’s upcoming military exercise near Japan is part of their growing efforts to push back against the United States and NATO allies. Since July, Beijing and Moscow have held at least three joint military drills in different parts of the world, including the South China Sea, the skies off coastal Alaska, and the Gulf of Finland. 'These increased military drills all over the world are part of Beijing and Moscow’s efforts to counter the deepening defense coordination between the U.S. and its allies, both in Europe and in the Pacific,' Sari Arho Havren, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told VOA in a phone interview. Despite their attempt to challenge the U.S. and NATO through closer military cooperation, Nagy said China and Russia are unlikely to let their partnership escalate out of proportion. 'Russia and China will continue to reciprocate what the U.S. and its allies are doing, but not escalate since Beijing wants to maintain its narrative to the Global South that they are not a hegemonic power,' he told VOA. On Tuesday, Chinese authorities said the United States and China held theater-level commander talks for the first time when Admiral Sam Paparo, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, held a video telephone call with his counterpart Wu Yanan of the Southern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army. The Indo-Pacific Command focuses on enhancing security and stability in the Asia Pacific region and hotspots including the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-russia-exercises-aim-to-challenge-us-led-indo-pacific-coalition-analysts-say/7778700.html	2024-09-10T09:28:14-07:00	
US imposes sanctions on Iran over supply of ballistic missiles to Russia	London — Washington is imposing new sanctions on Iran over its supply of missiles to Russia for use in Moscow's illegal invasion of Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Tuesday. The U.S. State Department said the sanctions aimed to further constrain 'Iran's destabilizing activities' and target individuals and businesses based in Iran and Russia, including Iran's flagship airline, Iran Air, which the U.S. said was involved in the weapons transfer. Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder confirmed that Iran had transferred shipments of Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles to Russia, and that they could be employed against Ukraine 'within weeks.' Prior to the transfer, Russian military personnel were trained in Iran to use this system, he said. Ryder called Iran's transfer of the short-range missiles, which can hit targets up to 120 kilometers away, a 'concerning development' that deepens Russia's military arsenal. 'One has to assume that if Iran is providing Russia with these types of missiles, that it's very likely it would not be a one-time deal [and] that this would be a source of capability that Russia would seek to tap in the future,' he added. Speaking in London, Blinken said the growing cooperation between Russia and Iran 'threatens European security and demonstrates how Iran's destabilizing influence reaches far beyond the Middle East.' 'For its part, Russia is sharing technology that Iran seeks,' Blinken told reporters. 'This is a two-way street, including on nuclear issues, as well as some space information.' Blinken added that Russian President Vladimir Putin was now relying increasingly on help from Iran and North Korea to get weapons, a clear violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions, and was also getting aid from China. 'One of the reasons that Putin is able to continue this aggression is because of the provision of support from the People's Republic of China, the biggest supplier of machine tools, the biggest supplier of microelectronics, all of which are helping Russia sustain its defense industrial base.' Without specifically identifying ballistic missiles, Moscow confirmed Monday that Russia and Iran are cooperating in the 'most sensitive' areas. 'Iran is our important partner,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a phone call. 'We are developing our cooperation and dialogue in all possible areas, including the most sensitive ones.' When Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy visit Kyiv this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will likely push for the Western allies to allow Kyiv to use their long-range missiles on targets inside Russia, said analyst Garret Martin, co-director of the Transatlantic Policy Center at American University in Washington. 'Generally, the U.K. has been often more at the forefront, maybe more at the vanguard, of being more supportive of Ukraine,' he told VOA. 'So, it's a question here — especially if you're thinking about the debates over long-range strikes — are they able now to come up on a sort of similar position?' Speaking to Sky News on Tuesday ahead of the visit to Kyiv, Blinken said that U.S. President Joe Biden is 'not ruling out' allowing Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike targets inside Russia. Ukraine has had 'what it needed, when it needed it, to be effective in repelling the Russian aggression,' Blinken said. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due to visit Biden in Washington Friday, with Ukraine and the Middle East at the top of the agenda. 'Particularly for Ukraine and for the Middle East, the next few weeks and months are critically important,' Starmer told the BBC on Sunday. 'And therefore, it's important for me to speak to President Biden about our shared response, the response of our allies to the pressing, immediate issues, but also to the more strategic long-term issues.' Last week, Britain announced the suspension of some arms sales to Israel over concerns its attacks on Hamas targets in Gaza breach humanitarian law, which Israel denies. The U.S. is continuing to supply weapons and says it does not believe Israel is breaking international law.

Alleged killer of Ugandan Olympian dies from burns, hospital says	Eldoret, Kenya — The man accused of dousing in gasoline and setting afire Olympic runner Rebecca Cheptegei has died from burns sustained during the fatal attack on the Ugandan athlete, a hospital official said on Tuesday. Cheptegei, 33, who competed in the marathon at the Paris Olympics, suffered burns to more than 75% of her body in the Sept. 1 attack and died four days later. Her former boyfriend, Dickson Ndiema Marangach, died at 1530 GMT on Monday, said Philip Kirwa, chief executive officer of the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret in western Kenya where Marangach was being treated and where Cheptegei also died. 'He developed respiratory failure as a result of the severe airway burns and sepsis that led to his eventual death,' Kirwa said in a statement. Kirwa said Marangach had suffered over 41% burns following his assault on Cheptegei, which local media reported to have happened after she returned home from church with her children. Cheptegei, who finished 44th in Paris, is the third elite sportswoman to be killed in Kenya since October 2021. Her death has put the spotlight on domestic violence in the East African country, particularly within its running community. 'This guy is dead because he killed my daughter. He has died because of his actions,' Cheptegei's father, Joseph Cheptegei, told Reuters. Rights groups say female athletes in Kenya, where many international runners train in the high-altitude highlands, are at a high risk of exploitation and violence at the hands of men drawn to their prize money, which far exceeds local incomes. 'Justice really would have been for him to sit in jail and think about what he had done. This is not positive news whatsoever,' said Viola Cheptoo, co-founder of Tirop's Angels, a support group for survivors of domestic violence in Kenya's athletic community. 'The shock of Rebecca's death is still fresh,' Cheptoo told Reuters. Cheptoo co-founded Tirop's Angels in memory of Agnes Tirop, a rising star in Kenya's highly competitive athletics scene, who was found dead in her home in the town of Iten in October 2021, with multiple stab wounds to the neck. Ibrahim Rotich, Tirop's husband, was charged with her murder and has pleaded not guilty. The case is ongoing. Nearly 34% of Kenyan girls and women aged 15-49 years have suffered physical violence, according to government data from 2022, with married women at particular risk. The 2022 survey found that 41% of married women had faced violence. Globally, a woman is killed by someone in her own family every 11 minutes, according to a 2023 U.N. Women study. 'I don't wish bad things on anyone, but of course I would have loved for him to face the law as an example for others so that these attacks on women can stop,' Beatrice Ayikoru, secretary-general of the Uganda Olympic Committee, told Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/alleged-killer-of-ugandan-olympian-dies-from-burns-hospital-says/7778550.html	2024-09-10T07:51:56-07:00	
First doses of mpox vaccine from US arrive in DR Congo	KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo — Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo said that 50,000 doses of mpox vaccine from the United States arrived in the country on Tuesday, a week after the first batch arrived from the European Union. Adults in Equateur, South Kivu and Sankuru, the three most-affected provinces, will be vaccinated first, starting on October 2, said Cris Kacita Osako, coordinator of the DRC's Monkeypox Response Committee. Last week, the first batch of mpox vaccines arrived in the capital, Kinshasa, the center of the outbreak. The 100,000 doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine, manufactured by the Danish company Bavarian Nordic, were donated by the EU through HERA, the bloc's agency for health emergencies. Another 100,000 were delivered over the weekend. The 50,000 doses from the U.S. will be of the same JYNNEOS vaccine. The 250,000 doses are just a fraction of the 3 million doses authorities have said are needed to end the mpox outbreaks in the DRC, the epicenter of the global health emergency. EU countries pledged to donate more than 500,000 others, but the timeline for their delivery remained unclear. Since the start of 2024, there have been 5,549 confirmed mpox cases across the continent, with 643 associated deaths, representing a sharp escalation in infections and fatalities compared with previous years. The cases in the DRC constituted 91% of the total number. Most mpox infections in the DRC and Burundi, the second-most-affected country, are in children under age 15. Last week, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization launched a continentwide response plan to the outbreak of mpox, three weeks after the World Health Organization declared outbreaks in 12 African countries a global emergency. The DRC issued an emergency approval of the vaccine, which has already been used in Europe and the United States in adults. For the moment, the rollout will be reserved for adults, with priority groups being those who have been in close contact with infected people and sex workers, Africa CDC Director-General Dr. Jean Kaseya told reporters last week. The European Medicines Agency is examining additional data to be able to administer it to children ranging in age from 12 to 17, which could happen at the end of the month, HERA Director-General Laurent Muschel said. The next batch of mpox vaccines will come from Japan and could arrive as early as this weekend, Kacita Osako told the AP, without specifying how many doses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/first-doses-of-mpox-vaccine-from-us-arrive-in-dr-congo/7778489.html	2024-09-10T07:15:44-07:00

Google loses final EU court appeal against $2.7 billion fine in antitrust shopping case	London — Google lost its final legal challenge on Tuesday against a European Union penalty for giving its own shopping recommendations an illegal advantage over rivals in search results, ending a long-running antitrust case that came with a whopping fine. The European Union’s Court of Justice upheld a lower court’s decision, rejecting the company’s appeal against the $2.7 billion penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top antitrust enforcer. 'By today’s judgment, the Court of Justice dismisses the appeal and thus upholds the judgment of the General Court,' the court said in a press release summarizing its decision. The commission's punished the Silicon Valley giant in 2017 for unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service to the detriment of competitors. It was one of three multibillion-dollar fines that the commission imposed on Google in the previous decade as Brussels started ramping up its crackdown on the tech industry. 'We are disappointed with the decision of the Court, which relates to a very specific set of facts,' Google said in a brief statement. The company said it made changes in 2017 to comply with the commission’s decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. It started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services. 'Our approach has worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services,' Google said. At the same time, the company appealed the decision to the courts. But the EU General Court, the tribunal's lower section, rejected its challenge in 2021 and the Court of Justice’s adviser later recommended rejecting the appeal. European consumer group BEUC hailed the court's decision, saying it shows how the bloc's competition law 'remains highly relevant' in digital markets. 'Google harmed millions of European consumers by ensuring that rival comparison shopping services were virtually invisible,' director general Agustín Reyna said. 'Google’s illegal practices prevented consumers from accessing potentially cheaper prices and useful product information from rival comparison shopping services on all sorts of products, from clothes to washing machines.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/google-loses-final-eu-court-appeal-against-2-7-billion-fine-in-antitrust-shopping-case-/7778300.html	2024-09-10T04:31:49-07:00

Francis will be only the second pope to visit Singapore, one of the wealthiest nations	SINGAPORE — When Pope Francis arrives Wednesday in Asia's financial powerhouse Singapore for the last leg of a four-nation tour, he is expected to bring his message of unity and hope to one of the world's richest nations. The 11-day trip, which earlier took him to Indonesia,Papua New Guinea and East Timor, is the longest for the 87-year-old pontiff since becoming head of the Catholic Church in 2013. Francis will be the second pope to visit Singapore, after a five-hour stopover by the late John Paul II in 1986. Here's what to know about Pope Francis' three-day stay in Singapore: Why is Francis visiting Singapore? Singapore was originally part of Francis' travel plans to the region in 2020 but it was derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The island city-state at the tip of the Malay peninsula has a small population of just under 6 million people and lacks natural resources, but it is a heavyweight in regional and international affairs. Astute leadership, its strategic location and reputation as one of the most open and least corrupt economies had transformed Singapore into a bustling financial giant and maritime and aviation hubs in just 59 years after independence. Singapore is a strategic U.S. partner but also maintains close ties with China. Ethnic Chinese account for about three-quarters of its residents followed by minority Muslims and Indians. According to a 2020 Singapore population census, Buddhists make up about 31%. About a fifth of the population claimed no religious belief, while Christians account for almost 19% and Muslims about 15%. Singapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil, reflecting its multicultural identity and heritage. 'Singapore and the Holy See share a common interest in promoting interfaith dialogue and understanding. Pope Francis' state visit is also the first papal visit to Singapore in almost 40 years,' Singapore's Foreign Ministry said. In a city ranked as one of the most expensive to live in, Singapore's Cardinal William Goh said that key themes frequently emphasized by Francis such as human dignity, inclusiveness, interreligious dialogue, family values, the need to manage artificial intelligence responsibly and care for the environment were of particular relevance. 'As such, Pope Francis' visit is highly anticipated and warmly welcomed not only by the Catholic faithful, but also by the wider society.' Goh said in a written response to The Associated Press. 'After the apostolic visit is done, I pray that Singapore will be filled with hope — a profound, divine hope.' What's on the pope's itinerary? After flying in from Dili, East Timor, on Wednesday, Pope Francis will hold a private meeting with members of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). On Thursday, he will receive an official welcome at Parliament House and meet Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and President Tharman Shanmugaratnam. He will also meet government officials, civil society and the diplomatic corps at the National University of Singapore. The highlight will be a public Mass at the 55,000-seat National Stadium in the evening. Those attending include Catholics from neighboring Malaysia and Brunei. Francis will make a tour around the stadium pitch to greet the faithful in his Popemobile before delivering his homily. On the last day, Francis will visit elderly residents at the St. Theresa's Home. He will also hold an interreligious meeting with youths at the Catholic Junior College. How influential is the church in Singapore? The church marked 200 years in Singapore in 2021. The Archdiocese of Singapore was formed in 1972, seven years after Singapore's independence. Diplomatic relations with the Holy See were established in 1981. In Singapore's early years, Cardinal Goh said the church's work in education and health care were important contributors to national development. 'Many of the country's top leaders in both the public and private spheres were formed in Catholic schools; and many basic health care needs were provided by Church-run health care institutions,' he wrote on the Vatican News website. The church supports 395,000 Catholics in Singapore with its 29 parish churches, three devotional churches, 53 schools, 47 humanitarian organizations and two health care institutions. Goh said the church holds frequent dialogue with the government, which views it as an important contributor and shaper of Singapore's social fabric. Goh, Singapore's first cardinal installed by Francis in 2022, is a member of two Presidential Councils that advise the government on matters relating to racial and religious harmony and minority rights. 'As the final stop on this apostolic journey, Singapore stands as a testament to peaceful coexistence in a modern, multicultural, and multi-religious society,' Goh wrote in his reply to the AP. 'This reflects the spirit of unity and diversity that Pope Francis has emphasized throughout his pontification.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/francis-will-be-only-the-second-pope-to-visit-singapore-one-of-the-wealthiest-nations/7778210.html	2024-09-10T01:55:43-07:00	
Australia plans age limit to ban children from social media	SYDNEY — Australia will ban children from using social media with a minimum age limit as high as 16, the prime minister said Tuesday, vowing to get kids off their devices and 'onto the footy fields.' Federal legislation to keep children off social media will be introduced this year, Anthony Albanese said, describing the impact of the sites on young people as a 'scourge.' The minimum age for children to log into sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok has not been decided but is expected to be between 14 and 16 years, Albanese said. The prime minister said his own preference would be a block on users aged below 16. Age verification trials are being held over the coming months, the center-left leader said, though analysts said they doubted it was technically possible to enforce an online age limit. 'I want to see kids off their devices and onto the footy fields and the swimming pools and the tennis courts,' Albanese said. 'We want them to have real experiences with real people because we know that social media is causing social harm,' he told national broadcaster ABC. 'This is a scourge. We know that there is mental health consequences for what many of the young people have had to deal with,' he said. Australia's conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton said he would support an age limit. 'Every day of delay leaves young kids vulnerable to the harms of social media and the time for relying on tech companies to enforce age limits,' he said. 'Easy to circumvent' But it is not clear that the technology exists to reliably enforce such bans, said the University of Melbourne's associate professor in computing and information technology, Toby Murray. 'We already know that present age verification methods are unreliable, too easy to circumvent, or risk user privacy,' he said. Analysts warned that an age limit may not in any case help troubled children. It 'threatens to create serious harm by excluding young people from meaningful, healthy participation in the digital world,' said Daniel Angus, who leads the digital media research centre at Queensland University of Technology. 'There is logic in establishing boundaries that limit young people's access,' said Samantha Schulz, senior sociologist of education at the University of Adelaide. 'However, young people are not the problem and regulating youth misses the more urgent task of regulating irresponsible social media platforms. Social media is an unavoidable part of young people's lives.' The prime minister said parents expected a response to online bullying and harmful material present on social media. 'These social media companies think they're above everyone,' he told a radio interviewer. 'Well, they have a social responsibility and at the moment, they're not exercising it. And we're determined to make sure that they do,' he said. Australia has been at the forefront of global efforts to regulate social media platforms, with its online safety watchdog bumping heads notably with Elon Musk's X over the content it carries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-plans-age-limit-to-ban-children-from-social-media/7778205.html	2024-09-10T01:47:03-07:00	
Top US, Chinese military brass hold first call to stabilize ties	BEIJING — The United States and China held theater-level commander talks for the first time on Tuesday, Chinese authorities said, amid efforts to stabilize military ties and avoid misunderstandings, especially in regional hot spots such as the South China Sea. Washington seeks to open new channels of regular military communication with Beijing since ties sank to a historic low after the United States downed a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon last year. Admiral Sam Paparo, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, held a video telephone call with his counterpart Wu Yanan of the Southern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command's areas of responsibility include the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, two hot spots for regional tension that are also flashpoints in U.S.-China bilateral ties. Both sides had an 'in depth exchange of views on issues of common concern,' the Chinese defense ministry said in a readout. Paparo urged the PLA 'to reconsider its use of dangerous, coercive, and potentially escalatory tactics in the South China Sea and beyond,' the Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement that described the exchange as 'constructive and respectful.' He also stressed the importance of continued talks to clarify intent and reduce the risk of misperception or miscalculation. The call followed a meeting in Beijing last month between U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's leading military adviser, at which the talks were agreed. U.S. and Chinese troops were also taking part in large-scale military exercises led by the Brazilian Armed Forces this week in the Brazilian city of Formosa in the state of Goiás. American and Chinese troops had not trained side by side since 2016, when Beijing participated in the Rim of the Pacific Exercise, or Rimpac, led by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. Most two-way military engagements between the U.S. and China were suspended for almost two years after Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in August 2022. 'I certainly worry about an unintended conflict between our military forces, an accident, an accidental collision,' Nicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador to China, told the magazine Foreign Policy in an online interview. Later this week, the United States plans to send a senior Pentagon official to a major security forum in China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-us-chinese-military-brass-hold-first-call-to-stabilize-ties/7778191.html	2024-09-10T01:15:47-07:00	
Typhoon Yagi leaves 40 missing, 63 dead in Vietnam	HANOI, VIETNAM — Emergency workers raced to evacuate thousands of people from severe floods Tuesday after Typhoon Yagi swept through northern Vietnam, killing 63 people and leaving 40 missing. Yagi struck Saturday with winds in excess of 149 kilometers per hour, making it the most powerful typhoon to hit northern Vietnam in 30 years according to meteorologists. The storm downed bridges, tore roofs off buildings, damaged factories and triggered widespread flooding and landslides. The north of the country, densely populated and a major manufacturing hub for global tech firms including Samsung, is now battling historic flooding, meteorologists said. Authorities have issued flood and landslide warnings for 429 communes across 17 northern provinces. One-story homes in parts of Thai Nguyen and Yen Bai cities were almost completely submerged in the early hours of Tuesday, with residents waiting on the roofs for help. Rescue forces were trying to reach residential areas to retrieve older people and children. On social media, relatives of those stuck in floodwater posted desperate pleas for help and supplies. In Hanoi, communities along the swollen and fast-moving Red River, which flows through the capital, were also partially under water, with people forced to evacuate in boats. Downtown Hoan Kiem District was forced to relocate 460 people on Tuesday. Crops including bananas, guavas and corn, which are usually sold in nearby markets, were all flooded. 'Lost everything' Phan Thi Tuyet, 50, who lives close to the river, said she had never experienced such high water. 'I have lost everything, all gone,' she told AFP, clutching her two dogs. 'I had to come to higher ground to save our lives. We can not bring with us any of the furniture. Everything is under water now.' As well as the dead and missing, flooding and landslides have also injured at least 752 people, officials at the ministry of agriculture said Tuesday. Authorities stopped heavy vehicles crossing a major bridge over the Red River in central Hanoi Tuesday and suspended a train line across Long Bien bridge as the water level rose. The action followed the dramatic collapse of a bridge higher up the river in northern Phu Tho province Monday. Pictures showed half of the 375-meter Phong Chau bridge gone. Five people who were crossing the bridge at the time have been rescued, but eight others were still missing Tuesday, authorities said. Forecasters warned central Hanoi would be affected by flooding later Tuesday. Hanoi authorities said more than 25,000 trees in the city had been uprooted in the storm. Huge trunks blocked key roads in the city centre, creating large traffic jams. At least 24 people were killed as Yagi tore through southern China and the Philippines before hitting Vietnam. Typhoons in the region are forming closer to the coast, intensifying more rapidly, and staying over land longer due to climate change, according to a study published in July.	https://www.voanews.com/a/typhoon-yagi-leaves-40-missing-63-dead-in-vietnam/7778183.html	2024-09-10T00:39:43-07:00

North Korea's Kim vows to put his nuclear force ready for combat with US	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to redouble efforts to make his nuclear force fully ready for combat with the United States and its allies, state media reported Tuesday, after the country disclosed a new platform likely designed to fire more powerful intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the mainland U.S. Kim has repeatedly made similar pledges, but his latest threat comes as outside experts believe Kim will perform provocative weapons tests ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. In recent days, North Korea has also resumed launches of trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea. In a speech marking the 76th founding anniversary for his government on Monday, Kim said North Korea faces 'a grave threat' because of what he called 'the reckless expansion' of a U.S.-led regional military bloc that is now developing into a nuclear-based one. Kim said such a development is pushing North Korea to boost its military capability, according to the official Korean Central News Agency. Kim said North Korea will 'redouble its measures and efforts to make all the armed forces of the state including the nuclear force fully ready for combat,' KCNA said. North Korea has been protesting the July signing of a new U.S.-South Korean defense guideline meant to integrate U.S. nuclear weapons and South Korean conventional weapons to cope with growing North Korean nuclear threats. North Korea said the guideline revealed its adversaries' plots to invade the country. U.S. and South Korean officials have repeatedly said they don't intend to attack the country. Since 2022, North Korea has significantly accelerated its weapons testing activities in a bid to perfect its capabilities to launch strikes on the U.S. and South Korea. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding military drills that North Korea calls invasion rehearsals. Many analysts believe North Korea has some last remaining technological barriers to overcome to acquire long-range nuclear missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland, though it likely already possesses missiles that can hit key targets in South Korea and Japan. South Korean officials and experts say North Korea could conduct nuclear tests or ICBM test-launches before the U.S. election to increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the U.S. Observers say North Korea likely thinks a greater nuclear capability would help it win U.S. concessions like sanctions relief. North Korea as of Tuesday morning did not appear to have staged any major military demonstration to mark this year's anniversary. But the North's main Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Sunday published a photo of Kim inspecting what appeared to be a 12-axle missile launch vehicle, which would be the largest the country has shown so far, during a visit to a munitions plant. This sparked speculation that the North could be developing a new ICBM that is bigger than its current Hwasong-17 ICBM, which is launched on an 11-axle vehicle. When asked about the photo on Monday, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder refused to provide a specific assessment of North Korea's missile capabilities and reiterated that Washington was working closely with Seoul, Tokyo and other partners to preserve regional security and deter potential attacks. 'It's not unusual for North Korea to use media reports and imagery to try to telegraph, you know, to the world,' he said. North Korea flew hundreds of huge balloons carrying rubbish toward South Korea for five straight days through Sunday, extending a Cold War-style psychological warfare campaign that has further stoked animosities on the Korean Peninsula. The balloons largely contained waste papers and vinyl, and there has been no repots of major damage. North Korea began its balloon campaign in late May, calling it a response to South Korean civilians flying propaganda leaflets across the border via their own balloons. South Korea later restarted its anti-Pyongyang propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts along the rivals' tense land border. Observers say North Korea is extremely sensitive to South Korean leafleting activities and loudspeaker broadcasts as they could hamper its efforts to ban foreign news to its 26 million people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-vows-to-put-his-nuclear-force-ready-for-combat-with-us/7778103.html	2024-09-09T18:40:13-07:00

Poland thanks military dogs for their service, giving them army ranks	NOWY DWOR MAZOWIECKI, Poland — The new privates received their ranks amid military pomp in a town near Warsaw where a Napoleonic fortress attests to a long military history. The group was made up of a German shepherd, a Dutch shepherd and two Belgian Malinois. The dogs — Einar, Eliot, Enzo and Emi — were bestowed with their ranks Friday as part of a new Polish program aimed at honoring the service of dogs used to detect explosives, a job valued for its role in protecting human life. General Wiesław Kukuła, chief of the general staff of the Polish army, decided last year that dogs serving in the army would qualify for six military ranks ranging from private through corporal to sergeant. The change has been welcomed by their loyal human handlers. 'The rank is meant to honor the hard work of the dog in service,' said Lance Corporal Daniel Kęsicki, who recently completed a five-month training course with Eliot, a 2-year-old Belgian Malinois. 'To me it’s a symbolic recognition that the dog is serving the homeland.' The dogs honored Friday belong to the 2nd Mazovian Engineer Regiment, which in 2007 became the first unit of Poland’s armed forces to introduce dogs into service, according to spokesperson Captain Dominik Płaza. He said none have died in action. During the ceremony, each dog's handler was handed a badge with the animal's rank, which was attached to the dog's harness. The ceremony occurred during the commemoration of the regiment's 80th anniversary. The dogs were given their ranks for having completed basic training and having served for more than a year. The ranks are a largely symbolic recognition 'so that we, too, are aware that such a dog is a member of the armed forces,' Płaza said. 'It is not just a tool for detecting explosives, but it is a living being,' he said. The unit was recently deployed to Paris for the Summer Olympic Games and the Paralympics, where the regiment's soldiers and four of its 16 dogs reinforced French security efforts in scanning facilities for explosives. Everything passed off peacefully. Polish army dogs have carried out service elsewhere in international missions, including Iraq and Afghanistan as part of the NATO nation's support for U.S.-led efforts. Poland, a close ally and neighbor of Ukraine, earlier this summer also announced that it was sending 12 trained dogs to support the Ukrainian military in clearing mines. The soldiers who work with the dogs volunteer for the assignment, and it becomes a commitment that lasts for the rest of the dog's life. Soldiers who were with their dogs Friday explained that they select their dogs, train with them, live with them, and care for them even after their four-legged charges retire. Kęsicki described Eliot as an obedient companion who has become integrated into his family life. 'The dog can already do a lot after the beginning course alone, and we still have a few more years of service ahead of us,' he said. Płaza, the spokesperson, laughed when asked if a dog could ever outrank his handler — or if a soldier might have to salute a dog. 'Soldiers do not salute dogs,' Płaza said. 'The handler will always be of a higher rank than his dog. It is simply impossible for a service dog to have a higher rank than his handler.' Though the master-dog hierarchy is preserved, great love and appreciation are clearly shown to creatures in Poland, where pets are everywhere and some even lay their beloved companions to rest in special pet cemeteries. The Polish government has in recent years also ensured retirement benefits to dogs and horses working in the police, border guard and fire departments. On Friday, as the sun beat down on a hot square in the middle of town, Kukuła interrupted the ceremony and ordered the overheated dogs removed — even as human soldiers continued to stand there in their uniforms and boots. Staff Sergeant Michał Młynarczyk served in Afghanistan with a dog named Elvis starting in 2011. Together they checked vehicles arriving at the base of an international force for explosives. Elvis died in 2018. Now Młynarczyk is paired with Kobalt, a German shepherd who received his private rank in April. Private Kobalt goes home with him at night and plays with his children. While he loves the entire family, he never loses sight of who is the master. 'All of the work the dog does is done for me,' Młynarczyk said. 'It’s a bond, it’s a friendship.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-thanks-military-dogs-for-their-service-giving-them-army-ranks/7778065.html	2024-09-09T17:24:21-07:00	
Colombia is the deadliest country for environmentalists, rights group says	BOGOTA, Colombia — Colombia, host nation for this year's United Nations COP16 biodiversity conference, was the deadliest country for environmentalists and land rights defenders in 2023, with a record 79 killed according to U.K. advocacy group Global Witness. The number of murdered environmental activists was the highest Global Witness has ever recorded for a single country in any given year since it started monitoring such killings in 2012, it said in its annual report published on Monday. 'The figure is really chilling,' Laura Furones, senior adviser to Global Witness' land and environmental defenders campaign, said, adding that the report's findings were conservative and figures likely incomplete. Globally, 196 environmentalists and land activists were killed in 2023, Global Witness said, with Latin America overwhelmingly leading the way, accounting for 85% of the slayings. The findings on Colombia are a sharp contrast to promises from the government of President Gustavo Petro, who took office in 2022 and has pledged to end the country's 60-year conflict and pursue environmental justice for communities. Peace processes with various armed groups — which are sometimes implicated in environmentalists' killings — have faltered, and though deforestation fell to a 23-year low last year, the environment ministry has warned of an increase in 2024. Colombia was also the deadliest country for environmentalists in 2022, according to Global Witness, when at least 60 were killed. 'The figure is very embarrassing for us in the country,' said Astrid Torres, coordinator for Somos Defensores, a Colombian human rights group. Torres said the issue was not just the responsibility of the sitting government but also of state institutions, such as prosecutors and local authorities. A spokesperson for Colombia's government said it was working on a response. Last year a Reuters investigation found that murders of environmentalists in Colombia resulted in long-lasting negative effects on conservation and that some municipalities where activists were killed saw significant spikes in deforestation. At an event to launch the COP 16 agenda in Bogota in July, Colombia's vice president, Francia Marquez — a winner of the Goldman Environmental prize for activism in 2018 — said the conference would honor those killed. 'It fills my heart with emotion to see this dream that was held for so many years by environmental leaders, many who are not with us today, who were sadly murdered in our country,' she said. 'This global event is a tribute to those voices.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombia-is-the-deadliest-country-for-environmentalists-rights-group-says/7778061.html	2024-09-09T17:05:41-07:00	
Experts applaud US steps to disrupt Russian disinformation	washington — The U.S. Justice Department announced September 4 that two Russian nationals, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, had been charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act and conspiracy to commit money laundering in the Southern District of New York. 'The Justice Department has charged two employees of RT, a Russian state-controlled media outlet, in a $10 million scheme to create and distribute content to U.S. audiences with hidden Russian government messaging,' said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. 'The Justice Department will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to exploit our country’s free exchange of ideas in order to covertly further its own propaganda efforts, and our investigation into this matter remains ongoing.' That same day, the Justice Department announced the seizure of 32 internet domains used in the Russian government-directed 'Doppelganger' foreign malign influence campaign, which it said violated U.S. money-laundering and criminal trademark laws. Experts who study disinformation say disrupting the paid-influencer campaign is an important step in efforts to counter the Kremlin’s broader disinformation strategy of spreading propaganda that undermines support for Ukraine and stokes American political divisions. Disrupting the Doppelganger campaign 'Persistent efforts to impersonate authoritative news websites and promote their content at scale in a coordinated manner can have a tangible impact, casting propaganda narratives far and wide consistently,' wrote Roman Osadchuk and Eto Buziashvili, researchers at the Disinformation Research Lab of the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank. According to an FBI affidavit, Russia’s 'Doppelganger' campaign created domains impersonating legitimate media sites, produced fake social media profiles and deployed 'influencers' worldwide. According to the Atlantic Council researchers, the primary method used by those involved in 'Doppelganger' is to post, on X and other social media platforms, links to fake news sites in replies to posts by politicians, celebrities, influencers and others with large audiences. Osadchuk told VOA that while the FBI's measures are unlikely to stop Russian influence activities, they will make them more costly, noting those involved in the Russian influence campaign will be forced 'to rewrite scripts, change the operation's infrastructure, etc.' At the same time, according to Osadchuk, the U.S. government’s moves against those involved in the influence campaign, which were widely covered in the U.S. and international media, will educate a broader audience. 'Researchers of the Russian disinformation have known about the Doppelganger campaign for some time,' he said. 'Now, Americans and people in other countries have learned about it and maybe will become more aware that not all information they consume is coming from legitimate sources and hopefully will be more attentive to the domain names and other signs that might indicate that the page they are reading is not The Washington Post or Fox News but a fake created by Kremlin-linked entities.' Influencers will be more aware In a statement it released after indicting the two RT employees, the Justice Department said that 'over at least the past year, RT and its employees, including Kalashnikov and Afanasyeva, deployed nearly $10 million to covertly finance and direct a Tennessee-based online content creation company [U.S. Company-1],' and that 'U.S. Company-1' had 'published English-language videos on multiple social media channels, including TikTok, Instagram, X and YouTube.' While the Justice Department did not specifically identify 'U.S. Company-1,' it is thought to refer to Tenet Media, a Tennessee company co-founded by entrepreneur Lauren Chen, who recruited six popular U.S. influencers with a large following. YouTube subsequently took down Tenet Media’s channel on the platform, along with four other channels that YouTube said were operated by Chen. Bret Schafer, a disinformation researcher at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a political advocacy group set up under the auspices of the German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank, told VOA that by financing the U.S. content creation company, Russia was able to create an information channel with a large audience, and to use it for such messages as blaming the U.S. and Ukraine for the March terrorist attack at a Moscow concert hall. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack. Shutting down that Russian information channel sent a powerful message to influencers and content creators to do 'due diligence about people funding their work and to try to figure out who's behind these companies and their motives,' Schafer added. Ben Dubow, a disinformation researcher affiliated with the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington-based research group, believes that influencers contracted by Tenet Media are unlikely to lose their existing followers, but that they might have difficulty attracting new ones. 'Hopefully, people who might otherwise explore those influencers will recognize their names and understand them as untrustworthy now,' he told VOA. The Justice Department’s indictment quotes RT’s editor-in-chief, Margarita Simonian, as saying in an interview on Russian television that RT built 'an enormous network, an entire empire of covert projects,' to influence Western audiences. The FBI affidavit also revealed that one of the sanctioned Russian companies had a list of 2,800 people active on social media in the U.S. and 80 other countries, including 'television and radio hosts, politicians, bloggers, journalists, businessmen, professors, think-tank analysts, veterans, professors and comedians,' whom the company refers to as 'influencers.' Concrete steps and good timing Several experts commended the U.S. government for taking concrete steps. 'They are sanctioning individuals and disrupting the supply chain of influence available to these threat actors,' noted Olga Belogolova, director of the Emerging Technologies Initiative at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. 'Punitive measures absolutely have to be part of the package,' said Jakub Kalenský, a senior analyst at the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki. 'Otherwise, the aggressors have a free hand to continue their aggression unopposed. And in order to identify those who deserve to be punished, a proper investigation from the authorities is necessary.' Experts also said that the Justice Department's actions were taken early enough to prevent influence in the November U.S. elections and to signal to Russia and other foreign actors that the U.S. government is monitoring their actions and will respond aggressively. 'Of course, that was what the Obama administration was concerned about in 2016 and led to them not being as transparent as they probably should have been with the American public about what they knew about Russian interference,' Schafer said. In announcing their actions against the Russian disinformation campaign, U.S. government representatives did not mention which political party or candidate they thought that the Russians were trying to assist. 'I know that the U.S. government, including agencies and the Foreign Malign Influence Center at ODNI [Office of the Director of National Intelligence], have been doing a lot of thinking over the last few years about how to strategically communicate these actions without unintentionally amplifying the very campaigns they are trying to thwart or politicizing the topic. And I think they've actually done a good job of striking that balance, at least from what I've seen thus far,' Belogolova said. Ihor Solovey, who heads the Ukrainian government’s Center for Strategic Communication and Information Security, welcomed the U.S. government's actions but told VOA that more steps are needed to thwart Russian activities on social media. 'X, TikTok or even more so the Russian Telegram - they are unlikely to want to spend on the fight against bots, troll farms or planned disinformation,' he said, adding that only pressure by a state, or even a coalition of states, will be able to force these social media platforms to block intruders and malicious content.

Exiled Iran opposition group says Sweden offices firebombed	STOCKHOLM — An exiled Iranian opposition group said Monday that its offices in Stockholm were firebombed overnight, with police saying they had opened an investigation into arson. According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), the political wing of the People's Mujahedeen of Iran (MEK), the building had been hit 'with several Molotov cocktails' in what the group dubbed a 'terrorist attack.' 'Several windows of the building were shattered, and the outer wall caught fire,' the NCRI said in a statement. It said residents put out the fire and 'no one was injured.' Police said in a statement they had opened an investigation into arson, but police spokeswoman Anna Westberg told AFP she could not comment on details about how the fire was started. 'We are still gathering information, and a technical examination will be done during the day,' Westberg said, adding that no arrests had been made. In its statement, the NCRI accused agents of Iran's intelligence service of carrying out the attack. The MEK backed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the 1979 revolution that ousted the shah but swiftly went into opposition and was blamed for a series of deadly attacks that rocked Iran in the early 1980s. The MEK has been exiled from Iran since then. It is far from having universal support among the Iranian diaspora but is backed by several high-profile former U.S. and European officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exiled-iran-opposition-group-says-sweden-offices-firebombed-/7777691.html	2024-09-09T15:37:08-07:00	
Smoke from Brazil fires cloud major cities, neighboring countries	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil — Smoke from intense wildfires in the Amazon rainforest and other parts of Brazil was choking major cities like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro on Monday, and wafting into neighboring countries. Karla Longo, a researcher at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), said that satellite images showed that 60% of Latin America's largest country had been affected by smoke. 'If we consider the areas affected in neighboring countries and in the Atlantic Ocean, the area affected on Sunday was around 10 million km2 [3.8 million square miles],' she added. Authorities in Argentina and Uruguay reported smoke from Brazil's fires impacting parts of their countries on Monday. Sao Paulo, the biggest city in Latin America, on Monday topped the ranking of the world's most polluted major cities, according to the air quality monitoring company IQAir. The rate of fine particles in the air — a measure of air quality — reached 69 micrograms per cubic meter, almost 14 times higher than the limit recommended by the World Health Organization. Residents of seaside city Rio de Janeiro were grappling with fine particle rates at five times the recommended limit. Authorities blame human action for most of the recent fires in the country, which are often linked to agricultural activity. The situation has been aggravated by the country's worst drought in seven decades, which experts attribute to climate change. Satellite images from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed a thick cloud of gray smoke along the Andes Mountain range toward the south of the continent on Monday. This is due to the 'wind that channels the smoke towards the south,' meteorologist Estael Sias told AFP. According to data from INPE, the number of fires in the Amazon since the beginning of the year has almost doubled compared to the same period in 2023. Other regions of Brazil have been battling terrible wildfires in recent days. The vast Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park, known for its numerous dramatic waterfalls some 250 kilometers (155 miles) outside the capital Brasilia, has lost some 10,000 hectares of vegetation to flames in recent days. Sias said the situation is not expected to improve 'without regular rainfall,' which is not likely 'before October or November.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/smoke-from-brazil-fires-cloud-major-cities-neighboring-countries/7777681.html	2024-09-09T15:31:09-07:00	
China's Xi, Spain's Sanchez seek to ease EU-China trade disputes	beijing — Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday urged visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to play a 'constructive role' in improving strained ties between Bejing and the European Union. Sanchez for his part said he hoped the EU could avoid a trade war with China, even as Brussels weighs imposing tariffs on China-manufactured electric vehicles. In their meeting, Xi also talked up deepening commercial ties between China and Spain in sectors such as artificial intelligence, digital economy, new energy and other high-tech fields. The Chinese leader said Beijing wanted to work with Brussels to further develop a China-EU relationship where the two maintain their independence and autonomy but also succeed together and bring benefit to the world, a Chinese readout said. 'It is hoped Spain will continue to play a constructive role in this regard,' Xi added. Sanchez responded: 'Spain wants to work constructively so that relations between the two are closer, richer and more balanced.' Beijing in June said that frictions with the EU over its plans to impose tariffs of up to 36.3% on its electric vehicles (EVs) could trigger a trade conflict, days after China announced a retaliatory anti-dumping probe into European pork imports. China in August then raised the stakes by opening an investigation into the bloc's dairy subsidies. Prior to meeting Xi, Sanchez said at business events that Spain would work for a negotiated consensus to the EV dispute within the World Trade Organization and that a 'trade war would benefit no one,' a government source said. Spain in 2023 exported $1.5 billion worth of the pork products that China will investigate, Chinese customs data showed, dwarfing the outbound shipments from the Netherlands and Denmark, which rank second and third. Spain also sold just under $50 million worth of targeted dairy products to China last year. But in a promising sign for Spain's pork producers, a separate source with direct access to Xi's meeting with Sanchez said the two leaders had 'found harmony and understanding,' when asked about possible curbs on Spain's outbound pork shipments. 'The meeting went extremely well,' the source said, adding that both defended their positions while seeking agreements. Fair trade 'We want to build bridges together to defend a trade order that's fair,' Sanchez told China's second-ranking official, Premier Li Qiang, before meeting Xi. Spain had a trade deficit of 17.27 billion euros ($19.07 billion) in the first half of this year, according to government statistics. Sanchez will also want reassurance that China will not strike back at Brussels by raising its own tariffs on imported large-engined gasoline-powered vehicles, as state Chinese media have suggested it might. Spain could also be impacted by the Chinese EV tariffs. Last week SEAT-CUPRA's CEO said that an electric vehicle made in China and designed in Spain by CUPRA, which is owned by Germany's Volkswagen, would be 'wiped out' if the European Commission followed through with planned import tariffs on Chinese-made vehicles. Sanchez on Tuesday is expected to meet representatives of SAIC Motor, one of the Chinese automakers most affected by the EU tariffs, and sign a Memorandum of Understanding with greentech company Envision, which is building an EV battery plant in Spain. 'In this increasingly geopolitical and economic context, as you have pointed out, we must work together to resolve differences through negotiation,' Sanchez told Xi. In an advisory vote in July, Spain, France and Italy supported the European Commission's proposal to adopt additional duties on Chinese-made EVs on top of the bloc's standard 10% tariff. But Beijing has been urging the EU's member states to reject the curbs at a final vote on it in October. The tariffs would be implemented in addition to the EU's standard 10% import tariff unless a qualified majority of 15 EU members representing 65% of the EU population vote against them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-spain-s-sanchez-seek-to-ease-eu-china-trade-disputes-/7777680.html	2024-09-09T15:24:08-07:00	
IAEA chief hopes to hold talks with Iranian president by November	VIENNA — U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi hopes to hold talks with new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian by November on improving Iran's cooperation with his agency, he said Monday. Several long-standing issues are dogging relations between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency, including Tehran's barring of uranium-enrichment experts on the inspection team and its failure for years to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. 'He (Pezeshkian) agreed to meet with me at an appropriate juncture,' Grossi said in a statement to a quarterly meeting of his agency's 35-nation Board of Governors, referring to an exchange after Pezeshkian's election in July. 'I encourage Iran to facilitate such a meeting in the not-too-distant future so that we can establish a constructive dialog that leads swiftly to real results,' he said. With nuclear diplomacy largely stalled between the Iranian presidential election and the U.S. one on November 5, Grossi said he wanted to make real progress soon. Asked at a news conference if his reference to the 'not-too-distant future' meant before or after the U.S. election, Grossi said: 'No, hopefully before that.' IAEA board resolutions ordering Iran to cooperate urgently with the investigation into the uranium traces and calling on it to reverse its barring of inspectors have brought little change, and quarterly IAEA reports seen by Reuters on August 29 showed no progress. Iran responded to the latest resolution in June by announcing an expansion of its enrichment capacity, installing more centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium, at its Natanz and Fordow sites. At its Fordow site dug into a mountain where it is enriching to up to 60% purity, close to the 90% of weapons grade, it installed two of the eight new cascades, or clusters, of advanced IR-6 centrifuges within days of informing the IAEA of its plan. Two weeks later, it installed another two. By the end of the quarter, the latest IAEA reports showed Iran had completed installation of all eight new cascades but still not brought them online. At its larger underground site at Natanz, which is enriching to up to 5% purity, it had brought 15 new cascades of other advanced models online. 'What we see is that there is some work, but nothing that indicates a rush to a fast implementation of a big increase in terms of enrichment production,' Grossi said. Iran has stepped up nuclear work since 2019, after then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned an agreement reached under his predecessor Barack Obama under which Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Western diplomats say there are plans for talks on fresh restrictions should Democrat Kamala Harris win the election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-chief-hopes-to-hold-talks-with-iranian-president-by-november-/7777642.html	2024-09-09T14:58:51-07:00	
China announces joint naval, air drills with Russia	Beijing — China’s Defense Ministry on Monday announced joint naval and air drills with Russia starting this month, underscoring the closeness between their militaries as Russia presses its grinding invasion of Ukraine. The ministry said the 'Northern United-2024' exercises would take place in the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk farther north, but gave no details. It said the naval and air drills aimed to improve strategic cooperation between the two countries and 'strengthen their ability to jointly deal with security threats.' The notice also said the two navies would cruise together in the Pacific, the fifth time they have done so, and together take part in Russia’s 'Great Ocean-24' exercise. No details were given. China has refused to criticize Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now in its third year, and blamed the U.S. and NATO for provoking President Vladimir Putin. While China has not directly provided Russia with arms, it has become a crucial economic lifeline as a top customer for Russian oil and gas as well as a supplier of electronics and other items with both civilian and military uses. Russia and China, along with other U.S. critics such as Iran, have aligned their foreign policies to challenge and potentially overturn the Western-led liberal democratic order. With joint exercises, Russia has sought Chinese help in achieving its long-cherished aim of becoming a Pacific power, while Moscow has backed China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and elsewhere. That has increasingly included the 180-kilometer (110-mile) wide Taiwan Strait that divides mainland China from the self-governing island democracy that Beijing considers its own territory and threatens to invade. Based on that claim, the Taiwan Strait is Chinese. Though it is not opposed to navigation by others through one of the world's most heavily trafficked sea ways, China is 'firmly opposed to provocations by countries that jeopardize China’s sovereignty and security under the banner of freedom of navigation,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing on Friday. Mao was responding to a report that a pair of German navy ships were to pass through the strait this month for the first time in more than two decades. The U.S. and virtually every other country, along with Taiwan, considers the strait international waters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-announces-joint-naval-air-drills-with-russia/7777648.html	2024-09-09T14:57:52-07:00	
UN: Taliban’s morality laws targeting women deepen Afghanistan’s isolation	Islamabad, Pakistan — The United Nations rights chief expressed his 'abhorrence' Monday at the recent promulgation of 'so-called morality laws' in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan that silence women or order them to cover their faces and bodies in public. Volker Türk told a U.N. Human Rights Council session in Geneva that the new laws were implemented alongside bans on Afghan girls attending secondary school, prohibiting female students from accessing university education, and severely curtailing women's access to public life and employment opportunities. 'I shudder to think what is next for the women and girls of Afghanistan. This repressive control over half the population in the country is unparalleled in today’s world,' the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner stated. Türk denounced the morality laws as outrageous and amounting 'to systematic gender persecution.' He warned that the intensifying curbs on women are 'propelling Afghanistan further down a path of isolation, pain, and hardship.' It would also jeopardize the country’s future by 'massively stifling its development,' he added. Richard Bennett, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of Afghan human rights, also spoke and informed Monday’s session in Geneva that the Taliban had lately barred him from visiting the country to conduct assessments in line with his mandate. He added that the morality law 'marks a new phase in the ongoing repression of respect for human rights' since the Taliban regained control of the country three years ago. The 114-page, 35-article law enacted by the Taliban last month outlines various actions and specific conduct that the Taliban consider mandatory or prohibited for Afghan men and women in line with their strict interpretation of the Islamic law of Sharia. The restrictions prohibit Afghan women from traveling without a male guardian, require them to be silent in public, enforce mandatory covering of females from head to toe, including their faces, and forbid eye contact between women and unrelated men. The law empowers the Taliban’s contentious Ministry for Promoting Virtue and Preventing Vice to enforce it strictly. Ministry enforcers are ordered to discipline offenders, and penalties may include anything from a verbal warning to fines to imprisonment for offenses such as adultery, extramarital sex, lesbianism, taking pictures of living objects, and befriending non-Muslims. Taliban leaders did not comment on Monday’s U.N. assertions, but they have rejected previous international criticism of the morality laws. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesperson, recently stated that 'non-Muslims should educate themselves about Islamic laws and respect Islamic values' before rejecting or raising objections to them. 'We find it blasphemous to our Islamic Sharia when objections are raised without understanding it,' he said. No country has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan, citing human rights concerns, particularly the harsh treatment of women. 'Any normalization of engagement with the de facto authorities must be based on demonstrated, measurable, and independently verifiable improvements in human rights,' Bennett stressed in his speech Monday, urging the Islamist Taliban to reverse current policies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-taliban-s-morality-laws-targeting-women-deepen-afghanistan-s-isolation/7777637.html	2024-09-09T14:39:14-07:00	
US: Transfer of ballistic missiles from Iran to Russia would be 'dramatic escalation'	Washington — The transfer of ballistic missiles from Iran to Russia would signify a 'dramatic escalation' of Tehran's support for Moscow, and the United States is prepared to respond with 'significant consequences,' the State Department said Monday. U.S. media outlets reported last week that Washington believed Iran had transferred the weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine, and the European Union has said allies shared 'credible' intelligence that Tehran had done so. 'Any transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,' State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel told journalists. 'We have been clear ... that we're prepared to deliver significant consequences,' he said. Tehran has rejected the accusation that it transferred the missiles, but the Kremlin has not explicitly denied it. Faced with punishing Western sanctions, Moscow has turned to Iran and North Korea for weapons supplies to keep its war machine going in Ukraine. Ukraine says it has been attacked with Iranian-designed Shahed drones on an almost daily basis from Russia and has found fragments of North Korean missiles on its territory. The reported delivery of missiles to Russia comes as the Kremlin has once again stepped up its bombing campaign against Ukraine's key infrastructure ahead of winter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-transfer-of-ballistic-missiles-from-iran-to-russia-would-be-dramatic-escalation-/7777611.html	2024-09-09T14:13:09-07:00	
HRW calls for stronger Sudan arms embargo as UN weighs sanctions	Nairobi, Kenya — The United Nations Security Council is expected to vote Wednesday on whether to renew existing sanctions that prevent the transfer of military equipment to Sudan’s western Darfur region. The pending vote comes as Human Rights Watch calls on the council to expand an existing arms embargo, currently on the restive region, to the rest of the country. The western Darfur region has been the epicenter of Sudan’s current civil war, which pits the Sudanese armed forces, or SAF, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, and other militias against each other. U.N. agencies and rights groups say the parties involved have committed war crimes and other human rights violations during the conflict, which has lasted nearly 18 months. Ahead of Wednesday’s vote, Human Rights Watch is urging the council to consider imposing an arms ban on the entire country to stop the ongoing rights violations and the suffering of the people. The Sudanese government opposes expansion of the embargo. Human Rights Watch investigators found that some of the weapons being used in the conflict were acquired after the civil war broke out in April of last year. Jean-Baptiste Gallopin is a senior researcher in Human Rights Watch's crisis, conflict, and arms division. 'We based our research on an analysis of photos and videos posted on social media and primarily taken by the fighters themselves, showing them in possession and using equipment such as attack drones, drone jammers, anti-tank guided missiles, as well as truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers systems and mortar munitions,' said Gallopin. The rights group’s report shows some of the mortars fired were manufactured in China last year. Companies in Iran, Russia, Serbia, and the United Arab Emirates have also produced some of the weapons used, according to the organization. In 2004, a year after the start of another Darfur conflict between ethnic militias and government-backed militias known as the Janjaweed, the U.N. imposed the arms embargo on Darfur. The embargo originally applied to non-governmental entities and was later extended to all parties in the conflict, including the Sudanese government. Ahmed Hashi is a Horn of Africa political and security commentator. He said the regional and international community is doing little to end the conflict, and said that in fact, RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedi, is receiving strong foreign support. 'I think the United Arab Emirates and other proxy states are arming Mr. Hamedi. I think that the rebellion inside Sudan is foreign-led. I think that the people who caused the Janjaweed and caused international human rights, international crime are fighting in Sudan. I'm afraid that terrorism will rear its ugly head. It is the tragic human rights issue of the 21st century. And we are all, including me, ashamed as Africans that we have not done anything,' he said. The UAE has denied arming the RSF. Gallopin said imposing an arms ban in one region would not solve the conflict. He said a ban is needed nationwide. 'We believe that the existing embargo is not sufficient, that there needs to be a wholesale embargo on the sale of armed and military equipment to the whole of Sudan, because we documented, we and others documented very serious abuses carried out by the warring parties since last year, including widespread war crimes, crimes against humanity. We know we published a report on Darfur showing that ethnic cleansing was committed. And so we think it's urgent for the Security Council to broaden that arms embargo,' he said. The group also is calling on the Security Council to condemn governments that are violating the existing arms embargo on Darfur and take urgent measures to sanction individuals and entities that are also doing so.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hrw-calls-for-stronger-sudan-arms-embargo-as-un-weighs-sanctions/7777277.html	2024-09-09T12:59:29-07:00	
Kenya begins 3-day mourning over deaths of 21 children in school fire	Nairobi, Kenya — Kenya begins three days of national mourning Monday following the deaths of at least 21 students in a boarding school inferno in central Kenya. Distraught parents and relatives gathered to give samples for DNA testing Monday at the Naromoru hospital in Kenya, four days after the fire at Hillside Endarasha Academy, where some of the deceased were burned beyond recognition. The dormitory housed 156 students, the majority of whom escaped. However, officials say 17 children remain unaccounted for following the tragedy, which has devastated the school community. John Mwangi said he still does not know the whereabouts of his child, a student at the school. 'At least it’ll be a reprieve to 20 parents. I might be among them, I don’t know … that’s why we are here. We are hanging on hope,' he said. Some parents and relatives have been camping at the school to demand answers. Chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor said DNA testing will help families get closure. 'We’ll be undergoing a process of DNA collection from them at the hospital by the government chemist, then on Tuesday, we’ll start the autopsy,' Oduor said. 'During the autopsy, we’ll be documenting the cause of death and also taking samples for DNA which will later be reconciled so that at the end of the day, we’ll be able to unite the parents to their children.' The Red Cross and ministry of health have been offering support to those affected. 'We have the emergency disaster preparedness and response team,' said Deborah Barasa, Kenya's cabinet secretary for health. 'We have the counselors, or the mental health and psychosocial support. We have forensic teams on the ground and they are supporting in every way.' Officials have yet to determine the cause of the fire, with investigations ongoing. There have been a number of incidents of fires at Kenyan boarding schools in recent years, prompting national concerns about safety standards. A report released in 2020 by the country’s auditor general said many schools lack proper equipment to handle fires and many dormitories are not constructed in accordance with government regulations. Education cabinet secretary Julius Ogamba said a review of the rules is needed. 'Perhaps as a country it has reached that time when we need to relook at those rules and regulations, which are policies, and find out whether it is time for us to move them a step further and make them laws so that there are penalties that will attach to any person who violates them,' Ogamba said. Kenya’s deadliest school fire was in 2001 when at least 67 students died in a dormitory inferno at Kyanguli high school in the southeast of the country. As the country marks three days of mourning for another school fire, experts say the government needs to do more to ensure the safety of learners.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-begins-3-day-mourning-over-deaths-of-21-children-in-school-fire/7777284.html	2024-09-09T12:58:38-07:00

4 migrants dead, others missing after boat capsizes off Senegal	DAKAR, Senegal — A boat carrying migrants capsized off the coast of Senegal over the weekend, leaving at least four people dead and several others missing, local authorities said Monday. The artisanal fishing boat left the town of Mbour, nearly 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the capital, Dakar, heading to Europe on Sunday afternoon before capsizing a few miles off the coast, Amadou Diop, the district's prefect, told The Associated Press. Local fishermen rescued three people who were brought back to shore by naval authorities. Senegal’s navy is looking for those missing, Diop said, adding that the exact number of passengers remained unknown. In recent years, the number of migrants leaving West Africa through Senegal has surged with many fleeing conflicts, poverty and the lack of job opportunities. Most head to the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off the coast of West Africa, which is used as a stepping stone to continental Europe. Since the beginning of the year, more than 22,300 people have landed on the Canary Islands, 126% more than the same period last year, according to statistics released by Spain’s Interior Ministry. Last month, the Senegalese army said it had arrested 453 migrants and 'members of smuggling networks' as part of a 12-day operation patrolling the coastline. More than half of the arrested were Senegalese nationals, the army said. In July, a boat carrying 300 migrants, mostly from Gambia and Senegal, capsized off Mauritania. More than a dozen died and at least 150 others went missing. The Atlantic route from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. While there is no accurate death toll because of the lack of information on departures from West Africa, the Spanish migrant rights group Walking Borders estimates the victims are in the thousands this year alone. Migrant boats that get lost or run into problems often vanish in the Atlantic, with some drifting across the ocean for months until they are found in the Caribbean and Latin America carrying only human remains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrants-dead-others-missing-after-boat-capsizes-off-senegal/7777308.html	2024-09-09T11:22:47-07:00	
Flooding in Morocco, Algeria kills more than a dozen people	RABAT, Morocco — Torrential downpours hit North Africa's normally arid mountains and deserts over the weekend, causing flooding that killed more than a dozen people in Morocco and Algeria and destroyed homes and critical infrastructure. In Morocco, officials said the two days of storms surpassed historic averages, in some cases exceeding the annual average rainfall. The downpours affected some of the regions that experienced a deadly earthquake one year ago. Meteorologists had predicted that a rare deluge could strike North Africa’s Sahara Desert, where many areas receive less than an inch of rain a year. Officials in Morocco said 11 people were killed in rural areas where infrastructure has historically been lacking, and 24 homes collapsed. Nine people were missing. Drinking water and electrical infrastructure were damaged, along with major roads. Rachid El Khalfi, Morocco’s Interior Ministry spokesperson, said Sunday in a statement that the government was working to restore communication and access to flooded regions in the 'exceptional situation' and urged people to use caution. In neighboring Algeria, which held a presidential election over the weekend, authorities said at least five died in the country's desert provinces. Interior Minister Brahim Merad called the situation 'catastrophic' on state-owned television. Algeria’s state-run news service APS said the government had sent thousands of civil protection and military officers to help with emergency response efforts and rescue families stuck in their homes. The floods also damaged bridges and trains in the area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/flooding-in-morocco-algeria-kills-more-than-a-dozen-people/7777179.html	2024-09-09T09:25:26-07:00

Under Yoon, calls for South Korean nukes 'normalized'	Seoul, South Korea — Less than two years after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol pledged his country would not seek nuclear weapons, his newly appointed defense minister is openly envisioning scenarios in which South Korea might reconsider that stance. The comments by Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, who took office on Friday, are the latest evidence that the once-taboo idea of nuclear armament has gone mainstream in Seoul, amid growing concerns about North Korea's rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal and the long-term reliability of U.S. protection. As an academic and retired military officer, Kim has long argued that South Korea may need nuclear weapons in some form to counter North Korea. In recently unearthed footage from a 2020 seminar, Kim warned South Korea has 'no survival or future' without such a deterrent. During his confirmation process last week, Kim stood by those comments, saying 'all options' should remain open if the U.S. nuclear umbrella proves insufficient. It appears to be the first time a sitting South Korean defense minister has publicly entertained the possibility of acquiring nuclear weapons, and marks a sharp departure from his predecessor, who repeatedly and firmly rejected the proposal under any condition. Contacted by VOA, a South Korean defense ministry spokesperson maintained there has been 'no change in the principle or position' that Seoul relies on U.S. extended deterrence and the U.S.-South Korea alliance to address the North Korean nuclear threat. 'However, if we cannot guarantee the survival and security of the state, all means and methods are open,' the spokesperson added, emphasizing the need to work closely with the United States. A spokesperson for Yoon’s presidential office declined to comment for this story. Most observers doubt South Korea will pursue nuclear weapons any time soon due to the massive economic and national security risks it would entail. Not only would South Korea risk enraging China, but Seoul could upend its alliance with the United States and invite painful international sanctions, all while possibly encouraging others in the region to consider nuclear weapons of their own. Despite the risks, Yoon continues to drive the once unthinkable idea further into the mainstream, raising concerns that the proposal could become more acceptable — and eventually turn into reality. Nuke calls now routine Yoon himself suggested last January that South Korea could develop nuclear arms if the North Korean threat escalated – raising alarm in Washington, where non-proliferation has long been a priority. Three months later, Yoon and U.S. President Joe Biden signed what is known as the Washington Declaration, which bolstered U.S. defense assurances while reaffirming South Korea’s commitments under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Yoon’s appointment of Kim, however, appears to contradict the spirit of that agreement, said Lee Sang-sin, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification. What stands out most, Lee said, is the lack of public reaction to Kim’s remarks. Kim’s appointment has drawn little attention from South Korean media and been largely ignored by Western outlets — a possible indication that calls for South Korea’s nuclear armament have become routine. 'That’s what I have warned about,' said Lee. '[This conversation] has been normalized.' When contacted by VOA, the White House National Security Council declined to directly comment on Kim's statements, instead emphasizing South Korea’s pledge under the non-proliferation treaty as outlined in the Washington Declaration. 'We will continue to work with our ROK allies to strengthen our alliance and ensure we are well-positioned to deter nuclear threats,' an NSC spokesman added. Driving the conversation Polls have long suggested a majority of South Koreans support acquiring nuclear weapons, although such views were once confined to the political fringes. Under Yoon’s presidency, the debate has become so entrenched that even some state-backed research institutions are exploring the possibility of nuclear armament. A June report by the state-run Institute for National Security Strategy recommended that Seoul consider government reviews and public debates on various options, including the redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons, NATO-style nuclear sharing, and South Korea developing its own arsenal. Such calls are not only coming from Seoul. A growing number of former Trump officials have expressed an openness to the idea, with some even highlighting the geopolitical advantages of South Korea getting its own weapons – an idea that Trump himself once teased. The possibility of Trump’s return, along with his 'America First' stance, has fueled concerns in Seoul that U.S. protection may be less reliable long-term, further accelerating the nuclear debate. Some in South Korea appear eager to capitalize on the trend. In an opinion piece this month, Choi Kang, president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, an influential conservative research group, argued South Korean nuclear weapons should be presented as beneficial to the U.S.-South Korea alliance. 'If a South Korean nuclear arsenal aligned with U.S. security interests and came to be regarded as a ‘common asset’ of the alliance, then the United States might accept it or even support it,' Choi wrote. Reality check? But many analysts caution that such statements downplay the risks of nuclear armament. 'There really needs to be greater questioning of whether more nukes and more countries with nukes truly increases any country’s security situation and a serious examination of what Seoul stands to lose by choosing that path,' said Jenny Town, a North Korea specialist with the Washington-based Stimson Center. Others, like Mason Richey, who teaches international politics at Seoul’s Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, argue it is unlikely South Korea would pursue nuclear weapons barring profound U.S.-South Korea alliance problems and/or severe regional instability. 'That said, every elite policymaker who engages the South Korea nuclear debate makes it easier to continue down the slippery slope of thinking about nuclear weapons, studying how to develop them, assuring a latent capability, deciding to develop them, and then actually building them,' he added. White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/under-yoon-calls-for-south-korean-nukes-normalized/7777068.html	2024-09-09T08:14:25-07:00	
Mourners attend funeral for American activist witness says was shot dead by Israeli troops	NABLUS, West Bank — The Western-backed Palestinian Authority held a funeral procession Monday for a U.S.-Turkish dual national activist who a witness says was shot and killed by Israeli forces while demonstrating against settlements in the occupied West Bank. Dozens of mourners — including several leading PA officials — attended the procession. Security forces carried the body of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi which was draped in a Palestinian flag while a traditional black-and-white checkered scarf covered her face. The 26-year-old's body was then placed into the back of a Palestinian ambulance. Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Oncu Keceli said Turkey was working on repatriating Eygi's remains for burial in the Aegean coastal town of Didim as per her family's wishes, but 'because the land crossing from the Palestinian territories to Jordan was closed as of Sunday, the ministry was trying to have the body flown directly to Turkey.' U.S. officials did not respond to a request for comment. Jonathan Pollak, an Israeli peace activist who participated in Friday's protest, said Israeli forces shot her on Friday in the city of Nablus while posing no threat, adding that the killing happened during a period of calm after clashes between soldiers and Palestinian protesters. Pollak said he then saw two Israeli soldiers mount the roof of a nearby home, train a gun in the group's direction and fired, with one of the bullets striking Eygi in the head. The Israeli military said it was looking into reports that troops had killed a foreign national while firing at an 'instigator of violent activity' in the area of the protest. The West Bank has seen a surge of violence since the Israel-Hamas war began in October, with increasing Israeli raids, attacks by Palestinian militants on Israelis, and attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mourners-attend-funeral-for-american-activist-witness-say-was-shot-dead-by-israeli-troops-/7776965.html	2024-09-09T07:29:42-07:00	
Attempts to keep up exchanges between Taiwanese, Chinese face obstacles	Taipei, Taiwan — Efforts to maintain exchanges between Taiwanese and Chinese citizens face new challenges after Beijing last month sentenced a Taiwanese activist to nine years in jail, a move that analysts say will create a chilling effect within Taiwan’s civil society. On September 6, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) confirmed that a court in the eastern city of Wenzhou earlier had sentenced Taiwanese political activist Yang Chih-yuan to nine years in jail under secession charges. TAO said Yang, who was arrested in 2022 while teaching and participating in competitions for the board game Go, has long been involved in secessionist activities, playing a key role in organizations that advocate Taiwan’s independence. 'His acts are egregious and the court reached the decision according to law,' the office said in a statement. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, which oversees cross-strait exchanges, condemned the Chinese court’s ruling and asked Beijing to make public the verdict and the evidence that supports the charges. 'Beijing is trying to use Yang’s case to intimidate Taiwanese people and use the pretext of penalizing Taiwan independence as a way to exercise long-arm jurisdiction,' the MAC wrote in a statement released last week. Yang’s case marks the first time that China used secession charges against Taiwanese people. It comes after Beijing in June introduced 22 new guidelines to punish what they called 'die-hard Taiwan independence activists.' The maximum sentence could be the death penalty. Analysts say the sentencing of Yang represents Beijing’s attempt to take a 'more hardline stance' against Taiwanese who promote the island’s sovereignty. His case 'shows that Beijing means business when it comes to using legal instruments to crack down on what it regards as ‘separatism,’' said J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow at the Global Taiwan Institute. 'This will inevitably affect people-to-people and civil society exchanges [between Taiwan and China,]' Cole told VOA in a written statement. Indefinite delay of cross-strait academic exchanges, city-to-city forum Meanwhile, the scheduled visits by two academic delegations from China’s Xiamen University have reportedly been postponed as Taiwanese authorities review their paperwork. While some local media outlets said the postponement may be caused by 'obstacles' imposed by Taiwanese authorities, Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said the review of the Chinese delegations’ applications is based on existing procedures, adding that Taipei has no intention to prevent certain groups from visiting Taiwan. Despite clarification from Taiwanese officials, China’s state-run tabloid Global Times characterized the postponement as the Taiwanese government’s attempt to 'block' the Chinese delegations from visiting Taiwan. 'The Xiamen University delegations have completed the preparations in terms of formalities and materials, but related ‘security authorities’ in Taiwan have put ‘a technical hold’ in place while they carry out a review,' Zhang Wensheng, deputy dean of the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, told the Global Times in an interview. Some experts say the delay in the Chinese delegation’s trips to Taiwan shows the Taiwanese government may be reviewing how to facilitate cross-strait exchanges amid growing military and political pressure from Beijing. 'In light of Beijing’s heightened pressure against Taiwan, the Taiwanese government may be reviewing what might be a more reciprocal approach to manage cross-strait academic exchanges,' Wen-ti Sung, a Taipei-based political scientist for the Australian National University, told VOA by phone. In addition to the delay of cross-strait academic exchanges, the annual Shanghai-Taipei City Forum, which remains one of the few occasions for municipal officials from Taiwan and China to meet, has yet to announce a date for a potential 2024 gathering. When asked in August about the forum, Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an told Taiwanese media outlets that at a time when cross-strait tensions are high, it is more necessary for Taiwan and China to maintain communication. 'Such delays serve as a clear reminder that even lower-level engagement is difficult to sustain when one side rejects core aspects of the other’s existence,' Timothy Rich, a political scientist at Western Kentucky University, told VOA in a written response. Since Taiwan President Lai Ching-te took office in May, Beijing has increased military pressure against Taiwan. Against this backdrop, Cole in Taipei said the lack of engagement between Taipei and Beijing may increase the risks of miscalculation, which could lead to accidents and escalation. In his view, Beijing will likely maintain a two-pronged approach against Taiwan in the near future. They will uphold 'a suspension of official dialogue with the Taiwanese government led by the Democratic Progressive Party while keeping the door open to sub-state interaction with other elements of Taiwan’s society, with the aim of dividing both,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/attempts-to-keep-up-exchanges-between-taiwanese-chinese-face-obstacles/7776929.html	2024-09-09T06:31:54-07:00	
Rubble and grief: Morocco’s High Atlas marks one year since record earthquake	IMI N'TALA, Morocco — The rescue crews and bystanders are long gone but the remnants of homes still sit in piles off to the side of the jagged roads. A year after nearly 3,000 people died when a record earthquake shook communities throughout Morocco's High Atlas, it still looks like a bomb just went off in villages like Imi N'tala, where dozens of residents died after a chunk of mountainside cracked off and flattened the majority of buildings. Broken bricks, bent rods of rebar and pieces of kitchen floors remain but have been swept into neater piles alongside plastic tents where the displaced now live. Some await funds to reconstruct their homes. Others await approval of their blueprints. The region shaken by the earthquake is full of impoverished agricultural villages like Imi N’tala, accessible only via bumpy, unmaintained roads. Associated Press reporters revisited half a dozen of them last week ahead of the first anniversary. In some places, residents who say they're awaiting governmental action have begun reconstructing buildings on an ad hoc basis. Elsewhere, people tired of the stuffiness of plastic tents have moved back into their cracked homes or decamped to larger cities, abandoning their old lives. Streets have been neatly swept in towns like Amizmiz and Moulay Brahim, although cracked buildings and piles of rubble remain, much as they were in the days after the quake. The rhythms of normal life have somewhat resumed in some of the province’s larger towns, where rebuilding efforts on roads, homes, schools and businesses are underway and some residents have been provided metal container homes. But many of those displaced from the more than 55,000 homes destroyed by the temblor remain vulnerable to summer’s heat and winter’s cold, living in plastic tents, impatient to return. Mohamed Soumer, a 69-year-old retiree who lost his son in last year's earthquake, is angry because local authorities have forbidden him from rebuilding his home on the same steep mountainside due to safety concerns. He now spends his days with his wife in a plastic tent near his now-rubbled home and fears moving elsewhere and restarting his life in a larger, more expensive area. 'Residents want to stay here because they have land where they grow vegetables to make a living,' he said. 'If they go somewhere else and abandon this place, they will not be able to live there.' The government early on promised households monthly stipends in the aftermath of the earthquake and additional funds for seismically safe reconstruction. It said last week that both had been provided to the majority of eligible families and households. 'Specific solutions are being deployed on the ground for difficult cases,' Morocco's Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. But on the ground, its disbursal has been uneven, residents say, with many still waiting for funds or reconstruction to commence. Anger has mounted against local authorities in towns like Amizmiz and villages like Talat N'Yaqoub, where residents have protested against their living conditions. They have criticized the slow pace of reconstruction and demanded more investment in social services and infrastructure, which has long gone neglected in contrast with Morocco's urban centers and coastline. Officials have said rebuilding will cost 120 billion dirhams ($12 billion) and take about five years. The government has rebuilt some stretches of rural roads, health centers and schools but last week the commission tasked with reconstruction acknowledged the need to speed up some home rebuilding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubble-and-grief-morocco-s-high-atlas-marks-one-year-since-record-earthquake-/7775893.html	2024-09-09T05:38:18-07:00	
Bomb blast hits Pakistan polio team amid national immunization drive	Islamabad — Authorities in northwestern Pakistan said Monday that a roadside bomb explosion injured at least 10 people, including anti-polio vaccinators and police personnel escorting them. The bombing in the South Waziristan district near the border with Afghanistan targeted a convoy carrying polio workers and their guards on the opening day of a nationwide immunization campaign. Area security and hospital officials reported that three health workers and six security personnel were among the victims. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the violence in a region where security forces are fighting militants linked to the outlawed Pakistani Taliban. Last week, Pakistan reported its 17th wild poliovirus case of the year from Islamabad, saying it paralyzed a child and marked the first infection in 16 years in the national capital. Pakistani health officials said in the lead-up to Monday’s polio campaign that it is designed to vaccinate more than 33 million children under five in 115 districts nationwide. Muhammad Anwarul Haq, coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Center for Polio Eradication, stated that the immunization drive would primarily focus on districts where 'the virus has been detected and the risk of continued transmission and spread is really high.' Haq encouraged all parents and caregivers to ensure their children get vaccinated, lamenting that 'parents have not always welcomed and opened their doors to the vaccinators when they visit their homes.' Pakistan and Afghanistan, which reported nine paralytic polio cases so far in 2024, are the only two remaining polio-endemic countries globally. Polio immunization campaigns have long faced multiple challenges in both countries, such as security and vaccine boycotts, dealing setbacks to the goal of eradicating the virus from the world.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bomb-blast-hits-pakistan-polio-team-amid-national-immunization-drive-/7776763.html	2024-09-09T04:13:30-07:00	
South America's rivers hit record lows as Brazil drought impact spreads	ASUNCION — South America's Paraguay River, a key thoroughfare for grains, has hit a record low in Paraguay's capital Asuncion, with water levels depleted by a severe drought upriver in Brazil that has hindered navigation along waterways in the Amazon. The depth of the Paraguay River, measured versus a 'zero' index rather than the riverbed, has dropped below minus 0.82 meter, breaking the previous record low in October 2021, data from the national Meteorology and Hydrology Directorate shows. The body expects the river will keep falling with no rain forecast. The Parana River in Argentina is also near year lows around grains hub Rosario. Both the Paraguay and Parana rivers start in Brazil, eventually joining and flowing into the sea near Buenos Aires. They are important routes for soy, corn and other trade. 'In the northern section [of the Paraguay waterway], navigation is practically halted due to the extreme drop in water levels,' the Paraguayan oilseed and grain crushing chamber CAPPRO told Reuters in written comments. The chamber, whose grain-trader members handle some 60% of Paraguay's soybean exports, said the low river was hitting shipments, though the impact was capped as it was not peak trading season. 'Vessels have had to transport volumes below the average of their normal cargo capacity,' said CAPPRO. 'This has generated delays and made travel times longer.' The chamber's members include ADM, Bunge and Cargill. Expected rains not enough The Paraguay-Parana system is a waterway of more than 3,400 kilometers that runs through Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, as well as landlocked Paraguay and Bolivia. Paraguay is the world's No. 3 soybean exporter and roughly 80% of grains travel along waterways to seaports downriver. Argentina is the top exporter of processed soy, most of which goes down the Parana from around river port city Rosario. Paraguay's deputy director for the Meteorology and Hydrology Directorate, Jorge Sanchez, said the outlook for river levels in the coming months was not encouraging, even with the traditional October-November rainy season ahead. 'This would alleviate the level of the river, but it's not expected to be enough,' Sanchez said. Less rain than normal is expected in the second half of the year due to the La Nina weather phenomenon, which brings drier, cooler conditions in Paraguay and Argentina, though it usually heralds wetter weather farther north in Brazil. Sanchez said this year, however, La Nina was delayed and its effects would be seen only between October and November. 'There is a lot of variability due to climate change,' he added. In Brazil, where record wildfires have also occurred, the low water levels are leaving some communities in the Amazon isolated, as well as hitting soy and corn shipments in center-west states such as Mato Grosso, Brazil's number one grains growing area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-america-s-rivers-hit-record-lows-as-brazil-drought-impact-spreads-/7776746.html	2024-09-09T04:04:14-07:00	
El Salvador police director, accused embezzler killed in helicopter crash	SAN SALVADOR — The head of El Salvador's police forces and a man accused of a multi-million dollar embezzlement were killed when the military helicopter in which they were traveling crashed on Sunday night, the government said. Police director Mauricio Arriaza was escorting former cooperative manager Manuel Coto back to El Salvador. Coto, who was is accused of embezzling $35 million, had been arrested earlier on Sunday in Honduras after attempting to flee to the United States. He was subsequently handed over to Salvadoran police. According to the Salvadoran Armed Forces, the helicopter crashed in the Pasaquina district, in the southeast of the country near the border with Honduras. The total number of people in the helicopter when it crashed remains unknown. President Nayib Bukele said on X: 'What happened cannot remain a simple 'accident'. It must be investigated thoroughly and to the last consequences.' He praised Arriaza for his significant contribution to national security and his roles in various police operations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/el-salvador-police-director-accused-embezzler-killed-in-helicopter-crash-/7776737.html	2024-09-09T03:47:35-07:00

US Congress takes up a series of bills targeting China, from drones to drugs	WASHINGTON — How to curb and counter China's influence and power — through its biotech companies, drones and electric vehicles — will dominate the U.S. House's first week back from summer break, with lawmakers taking up a series of measures targeting Beijing. Washington views Beijing as its biggest geopolitical rival, and the legislation is touted as ensuring the U.S. prevails in the competition. Many of the bills scheduled for a vote this week appear to have both Republican and Democratic support, reflecting strong consensus that congressional actions are needed to counter China. The legislation 'will take meaningful steps to counter the military, economic and ideological threat of the Chinese Communist Party,' said Rep. John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and a Michigan Republican. 'There's a bipartisan goal to win this competition.' Advocacy groups worry about the impact, warning against rhetoric that hurts Asian Americans and could create 'an atmosphere of guilt by association or fuel divisiveness,' said Christine Chen, executive director of Asian & Pacific Islander American Vote. The Chinese Embassy in Washington called the legislation 'new McCarthyism' that hypes the tensions in an election year. If passed, the bills 'will cause serious interference to China-U.S. relations and mutually beneficial cooperation, and will inevitably damage the U.S.'s own interests, image and credibility,' spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a statement. Among the bills are efforts to reduce U.S. reliance on Chinese biotech companies, ban Chinese EVs and drones, restrict Chinese nationals from buying farmland, toughen export restrictions and revive a program to root out spying on U.S. intellectual property. If approved, the measures would still need to clear the Senate. Here's a look at the key legislation: Targeting Beijing-linked biotech A bill seeks to ban a group of five biotechnology companies with Chinese ties from working with anyone that receives federal money. The companies include those that work to help doctors detect genetic causes for cancer or do research and manufacturing for American drugmakers, considered a key step in developing new medications. America's biotech companies have said the bill would disrupt their partnerships with Chinese contractors, resulting in delays in clinical trials for new drugs and higher costs. Supporters say the legislation is necessary to protect U.S. health care data and reduce the country's reliance on China for its medical supply chain. 'American patients cannot be in a position where we rely on China for genomic testing or basic medical supplies,' said Rep. Brad Wenstrup, an Ohio Republican who sponsored the bill. He called it 'the first step' in protecting Americans' genetic data. BGI, one of the Chinese companies named in the bill, called it 'a false flag targeting companies under the premise of national security.' The company, which offers genetic sequencing for research purposes in the U.S., said it follows the law and has no access to Americans' personal data. Banning Chinese drones Another bill would dub drones made by the Chinese company DJI, which dominates the global drone market, 'an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security' and cut its products from U.S. communications networks over data security concerns. The bill would protect Americans' data and critical infrastructure, said Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, who introduced it. 'Congress must use every tool at our disposal to stop' China's 'monopolistic control over the drone market,' she said. DJI argues that users have to 'opt in' to share data such as flight logs, photos and videos with the company. If users don't do so, the company said it won't have data to share with any government when compelled. It also has rejected allegations that it is a Chinese military company and has aided the persecution of members of ethnic Muslim minorities. Adam Bry, co-founder and CEO of major U.S. drone maker Skydio, told a congressional committee in June about losing business to China, where 'the Chinese government has tried to control the drone industry, pouring resources into national champions and taking aim at competitors in the U.S. and the West, tilting the playing field in China's favor.' Protecting intellectual property A challenge is likely against an attempt to revive a Trump-era program described as a way to stop Chinese efforts to steal intellectual property and spy on industry and research. The bill would direct the Justice Department to curb spying by Beijing on U.S. intellectual property and academic institutions and go after people engaged in theft of trade secrets, hacking and economic espionage. The Trump-era program, called the China Initiative, ended in 2022 after multiple unsuccessful prosecutions of researchers and concerns that it had prompted racial and ethnic profiling. Critics also say it chilled cooperation between the U.S. and China in science and technology meant to benefit the greater good. 'Our colleagues in the Republican Party sought to reinstate this failed program because they wanted to look like they were solving problems. But in reality, they were only stoking fear and hatred,' several Democratic lawmakers said in a statement in March, when they fought off another effort to restart the program. Restricting farm sales Another bill, which says it will protect U.S. farmland from foreign adversaries, has raised concerns about discrimination. It would add the agriculture secretary to the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, which reviews the national security implications of foreign transactions. The bill also flags as 'reportable' land sales involving citizens from China, North Korea, Russia and Iran. 'Food security is national security, and for too long, the federal government has allowed the Chinese Communist Party to put our security at risk by turning a blind eye to their steadily increasing purchases of American farmland,' said Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington state, who introduced the bill. The National Agricultural Law Center estimates 24 states ban or limit foreigners without residency and foreign businesses or governments from owning private farmland. The interest emerged after a Chinese billionaire bought more than 130,000 acres near a U.S. Air Force base in Texas and another Chinese company sought to build a corn plant near an Air Force base in North Dakota.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congress-takes-up-a-series-of-bills-targeting-china-from-drones-to-drugs/7776621.html	2024-09-08T21:49:26-07:00	
Republicans fault Biden administration in new report about Afghanistan withdrawal	WASHINGTON — Republicans on a U.S. House of Representatives committee issued a report Sunday criticizing the Biden administration for the chaotic August 2021 U.S. military and diplomatic withdrawal from Afghanistan after a nearly 20-year war. The report faulted President Joe Biden for failing to 'mitigate the likely consequences of the decision' to withdraw, while ignoring warnings that Taliban fighters were seizing key cities in Afghanistan faster than U.S. officials expected. In the last days of the withdrawal, a suicide bombing attack by an Islamic State terrorist killed 13 U.S. soldiers and about 170 Afghan civilians at the Kabul airport. Many Afghans clinging to the underbellies of departing aircraft leaving Afghanistan fell to their deaths. Former President Donald Trump initiated the withdrawal process in February 2020 by signing an agreement with the Taliban, a pact that Biden honored as he looked to end America’s longest war. The fateful withdrawal also played a role in Biden’s political fortunes. Until that time, Americans in national surveys approved of Biden’s performance during the first seven months of his presidency. But his approval rating dipped into negative territory after the chaotic troop withdrawal and the deaths of the 13 soldiers and has never again advanced into a favorable standing. The report from Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee followed a three-year investigation and includes accusations that the Biden administration did not have adequate plans or security in place to safely carry out the withdrawal. Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said the Biden administration 'had the information and opportunity to take necessary steps to plan for the inevitable collapse of the Afghan government, so we could safely evacuate U.S. personnel, American citizens, green card holders, and our brave Afghan allies.' Previous investigations have faulted multiple U.S. administrations, including a 2023 report by the U.S. government watchdog for the U.S. in Afghanistan which cited both Trump’s and Biden’s determination to go forward with the withdrawal despite the Taliban breaking key commitments the militants made in the 2020 agreement. Congressman Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the committee, said in a letter to colleagues that Republicans 'cherry-picked witness testimony to exclude anything unhelpful to a predetermined, partisan narrative about the Afghanistan withdrawal.' In a lengthy statement, the U.S. State Department said, 'There are valid and important criticisms of the two-decade-long war in Afghanistan and how it concluded.' But the country’s top diplomatic agency said it 'has remained focused on evolving and growing from this moment, learning important lessons and making sustainable changes to crisis operations.' The State Department said the U.S. government successfully evacuated 120,000 Americans, Afghans, and third-country nationals from Afghanistan in the final two weeks of August 2021 and has resettled 165,000 Afghans across the U.S. The State Department said it 'stands ready to work alongside' lawmakers who have a 'serious interest' in finding legislative and administrative solutions to avoid the chaos of the withdrawal from the Afghan war zone. But the State Department said it would 'not stand by silently' as the agency and 'its workforce are used to further partisan agendas.' Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/house-republicans-release-partisan-report-blaming-biden-for-chaotic-end-to-us-war-in-afghanistan/7776571.html	2024-09-08T18:13:49-07:00	
Germany’s Scholz calls for faster progress ending Russia's war on Ukraine	FRANKFURT, Germany — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agree that Russia should be included in a future peace conference aimed at ending Russia's war against Ukraine. He called for stepped up efforts to solve the conflict. A previous peace conference June 15-16 in Switzerland ended with 78 countries expressing support for Ukraine’s 'territorial integrity' but otherwise left the path forward unclear. Russia did not participate. 'I believe that now is the moment when we must discuss how we get out of this war situation faster than the current impression is,' Scholz said in an interview with Germany's ZDF public television aired Sunday. 'There will certainly be a further peace conference, and the president and I agree that it must be one with Russia present,' Scholz said. Scholz is facing more political discontent at home over his government's support including money and weapons for Ukraine after populist parties that oppose arming Ukraine did well in state elections Sept. 1 at the expense of parties in his three-party governing coalition. Some members of his Social Democratic Party have also called for more emphasis on diplomacy toward Russia. Zelenskyy has presented a 10-point peace formula that calls for the expulsion of all Russian forces from Ukrainian territory and accountability for war crimes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-s-scholz-calls-for-faster-progress-ending-russia-s-war-on-ukraine-/7776563.html	2024-09-08T17:43:15-07:00	
China’s Xi, Russia's Putin send greetings to North Korea's Kim Jong Un, KCNA says	Seoul, South Korea — Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin sent greetings to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on the occasion of North Korea's founding anniversary, state media KCNA said on Monday. 'I am sure that the comprehensive strategic partnership between Russia and the DPRK will be strengthened in a planned way thanks to our joint efforts,' Putin said, according to KCNA. DPRK is short for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name. Xi called for deeper strategic communication and cooperation with North Korea in his message, KCNA said. Last year, Kim marked the country's founding day on Sept. 9 with a parade of paramilitary groups and diplomatic exchanges in which he vowed to deepen ties with China and Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-russia-s-putin-send-greetings-to-north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-kcna-says/7776548.html	2024-09-08T17:13:04-07:00	
K-pop takes socialist Cuba by storm	Havana, Cuba — Socialist Cuba, the birthplace of salsa and other rhythms that have conquered the world, is now surrendering to the invasion of South Korean pop music. Thirteen thousand kilometers of distance separate the Asian nation and the communist-run island, as well as a different language and cultural traditions. However, all of these barriers would seem to vanish in a split second thanks to K-pop's infectious beat and elaborate choreography. Korean popular music, or K-pop, has spread far and wide from its Asian roots as boy bands like BTS and NCT and their female counterpart Blackpink rival Taylor Swift for downloads and album sales globally. But it was slow to catch on in Cuba, where salsa is king and internet speeds were glacial until recently. On Saturday, far from Seoul, dozens of teenagers clad in plaid, prep school skirts, baggy bomber pants and heavy black eyeliner busted their best moves as images of the genre's idols were projected on a large screen of a Havana dance club. 'K-pop has opened a new world to me,' said 24-year-old Fransico Piedra, who when not working with his father as a blacksmith dreams up meticulous dance steps. Known by his artistic name Ken he one day aspires to be a professional K-pop choreographer. 'It's a place where I can be myself, and share with friends the joy of laughter, song and dance.' Many of the teenagers hope to follow in the footsteps of two Cuban groups — Limitless and LTX — that before the pandemic traveled to South Korea to partake in the K-POP World Festival, an annual talent competition. K-pop — a catch all for musical styles ranging from R&B to rock — first penetrated the island when Cubans fell in love with South Korean soap operas about a decade ago. As internet speeds improved, and government controls eased, more young Cubans got online and started streaming videos like teenagers everywhere. While Cuban kids may be mesmerized by K-pop, an older generation of leaders have had frostier ties to South Korea. The two countries only restored diplomatic relations that were severed following the 1959 Cuban revolution this year and have yet to exchange ambassadors. Meanwhile, Cuba remains a staunch ally of North Korea, which views K-pop as a dangerous form of propaganda from a capitalist enemy with whom is has been locked in a military standoff since the 1950s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/k-pop-takes-socialist-cuba-by-storm/7776232.html	2024-09-08T16:54:56-07:00	
Russian troops take Ukrainian town in advance on Pokrovsk	Moscow — Russia said on Sunday its forces had taken full control of a town in eastern Ukraine as Moscow's forces advance on the strategically important city of Pokrovsk and seek to pierce the Ukrainian defensive front lines. Russian forces, which control about a fifth of Ukraine since invading in February 2022, are advancing in eastern Ukraine in an attempt to take the whole of the Donbas, which is about half the size of the U.S. state of Ohio. Russia's defense ministry said its forces had taken the town of Novohrodivka, which lies 12 kilometers from Pokrovsk, an important rail and road hub for Ukrainian forces in the area. The town had a population of 14,000 before the war. Yuri Podolyaka, an influential Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger, published maps showing Russian forces attacking beyond Novohrodivka in at least two places less than 7 kilometers from Pokrovsk. The General Staff of the Ukrainian military, in a report issued on Sunday evening, gave details of fighting throughout the Pokrovsk sector, including Novohrodivka. It said 29 attempted Russian advances had been repelled, with seven skirmishes continuing. 'Our troops are taking measures to maintain designated positions,' it said. But an interview with a Ukrainian officer broadcast last week by U.S.-funded Radio Liberty said Ukrainian forces had abandoned Novohrodivka on grounds that the positions there were not favorable for defending it. Popular Ukrainian war blog DeepState said Russian forces had captured the village of Nevelske, to the southeast. Reuters was unable to immediately verify battlefield reports from either side due to restrictions on reporting in the war. President Vladimir Putin said last week that a Ukrainian incursion into the Russian region of Kursk had failed to slow Russia's own advance in eastern Ukraine and had weakened Kyiv's defenses along the front line in a boost to Moscow. Ukraine's top military commander said on Thursday that Kyiv's incursion into the Kursk region was working. Russian forces, he said, had made no progress in their advance on Pokrovsk for the previous six days. He said that one of the objectives of the Kursk incursion was to divert Russian forces from other areas, primarily Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Russia had diverted large numbers to Kursk but was also strengthening the Pokrovsk front, he added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said the Kursk operation was also to prevent Russian forces from crossing the border in the opposite direction. Russia currently controls about 80% of the Donbas. Given the speed of recent Russian advances in the east, some Russian war bloggers have raised concern about the army overreaching itself. Putin ordered tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine more than two and a half years ago in what he calls a special military operation. Ukraine and its Western backers have vowed to defeat Russian forces and expel all Russian troops.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-troops-take-ukrainian-town-in-advance-on-pokrovsk/7776225.html	2024-09-08T16:14:32-07:00

India isolates 'suspected mpox case'	New Delhi — India reported Sunday that it had put a 'suspected mpox case' into isolation, assuring that the world's most populous nation had 'robust measures' in place, the health ministry said in a statement. There have been no confirmed cases of mpox in India, a country of 1.4 billion people. 'A young male patient, who recently traveled from a country currently experiencing mpox transmission, has been identified as a suspect case of mpox,' the health ministry said in a statement. 'The patient has been isolated in a designated hospital and is currently stable,' it said, adding the samples 'are being tested to confirm the presence of mpox.' It gave no further details of where he may have contracted the disease. 'There is no cause of any undue concern,' the statement added. 'The country is fully prepared to deal with such (an) isolated travel related case and has robust measures in place to manage and mitigate any potential risk.' Mpox's resurgence and the detection in the Democratic Republic of Congo of a new strain, dubbed Clade 1b, prompted the World Health Organization to declare its highest international alert level on August 14. Mpox has also been detected in Asia and Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-isolates-suspected-mpox-case/7776214.html	2024-09-08T15:12:31-07:00	
Massive opposition rally in Pakistan calls for release of jailed ex-PM Khan	Islamabad — Thousands of supporters of Pakistan's imprisoned former prime minister, Imran Khan, rallied on the outskirts of Islamabad Sunday to denounce his 'illegal' incarceration and demand his immediate release. Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party organized the public gathering, one of the largest in the Pakistani capital's history. The strong turnout came despite the police blocking the officially designated route for rally participants with shipping containers in an apparent bid to restrict convoys from other cities from reaching the venue. The administration also deployed riot police to prevent possible unrest. Social media videos and images showed PTI workers and leaders from elsewhere in Pakistan marching toward Islamabad. PTI activists were seen successfully removing containers to clear the way at several entry points. Police briefly clashed with and fired tear gas shells on PTI workers en route to the rally. Authorities later reported injuries to several police personnel due to stone pelting allegedly from Khan supporters, charges party leaders rejected. 'We will continue our efforts until Khan is freed from prison,' Hammad Azhar, a central PTI leader, told the rally. Critics observed that Sunday’s rally demonstrated once again that the 71-year-old former cricket star-turned-prime minister remains Pakistan’s most popular politician despite facing a series of state-backed criminal prosecutions and lawsuits. 'Strong turnout for PTI rally despite the state's tactics to limit numbers through roadblocks and containers, and despite the risk of violent crackdowns and arrests,' Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at Washington’s Wilson Center, said on X. 'Its size and popularity ensure its mobilization capabilities remain intact despite relentless attempts to curb it,' Kugelman wrote. Khan completed 400 days in prison on Sunday. The charges against him range from corruption to sedition to stoking violent anti-army protests. He rejects all the allegations as politically motivated and asserts that the powerful Pakistani military is behind them to block his return to power. Subsequently, appeals courts have overturned or suspended all his convictions for lack of evidence, but authorities quickly launched new charges to prevent him from leaving prison. The United Nations in July declared Khan’s detention arbitrary, saying there was no legal basis for keeping him in prison. Mushahid Hussain, who recently retired from Pakistan’s Senate, the upper house of parliament, criticized Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government for 'barricading Islamabad' through containers and coercion and for creating an 'atmosphere of fear & force' in its attempt to block Sunday’s political rally. Hussain warned through a post on X that such efforts would impede political stability and economic recovery. '’Common Sense’ can be quite Uncommon!' he wrote. Sunday’s rally by the PTI in Islamabad was its first since parliamentary elections on February 8. Khan’s convictions at the time barred him from running, but his party candidates emerged winners of most seats in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, but not enough to form the government. The PTI alleged the vote was massively rigged to prevent its candidates from sweeping the polls. This allowed military-backed rival political parties to form a coalition administration with Sharif as prime minister. Hundreds of PTI workers and leaders, including women, have been jailed or under trial on charges defense attorneys reject as baseless and part of the state crackdown on the party. Khan served as Pakistan’s prime minister from 2018 until April 2022, when he was ousted through an opposition parliamentary no-confidence vote he alleges was planned by the military. Successive Pakistani governments and military officials have denied the allegations. Last month, his party announced that Khan had formally applied to run for chancellor of the University of Oxford in Britain from his prison cell. The election university website states that the new chancellor will be elected through an unprecedented online ballot process beginning on October 28. Khan, an Oxford graduate, served as the chancellor of University of Bradford from 2005 to 2014.	https://www.voanews.com/a/massive-opposition-rally-in-pakistan-calls-for-release-of-jailed-ex-pm-khan/7776212.html	2024-09-08T14:56:28-07:00	
China plans to allow wholly foreign-owned hospitals in some areas	Beijing — China said Sunday it would allow the establishment of wholly foreign-owned hospitals in nine areas of the country including the capital, as Beijing tries to attract more foreign investment to boost its flagging economy. In a document on the official website of China's commerce ministry, it said the new policy was a pilot project designed to implement a pledge the ruling Communist Party's Central Committee led by President Xi Jinping made at its July plenum meeting held roughly every five years. 'In order to ... introduce foreign investment to promote the high-quality development of China's medical-related fields, and better meet the medical and health needs of the people, it is planned to carry out pilot work of expanding opening-up in the medical field,' according to the document. The project will allow the establishment of such hospitals in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hainan — all relatively wealthy cities or provinces in eastern or southern China. The new policy excludes hospitals practicing traditional Chinese medicine and 'mergers and acquisitions of public hospitals,' the document read, adding that the specific conditions, requirements and procedures for setting up such foreign-owned hospitals would be detailed soon. The policy also allows companies with foreign investors to engage in the development and application of gene and human stem cell technologies for treatment and diagnosis in the pilot free-trade zones of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hainan. This includes registration, marketing and production of products that can be bought nationwide, according to the document. The removal of restrictions on foreign investment in these fields comes as the world's second-largest economy faces growing headwinds with flagging foreign business sentiment, one of the issues threatening growth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-plans-to-allow-wholly-foreign-owned-hospitals-in-some-areas/7776190.html	2024-09-08T13:53:24-07:00	
Thousands protest Mexican judicial reform	Mexico City — Thousands of Mexicans, mainly court employees and law students, protested in the capital Sunday against a controversial judicial reform that would see judges elected by popular vote. They gathered in Mexico City as the Senate prepared to debate the initiative pushed by outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and approved by the lower house, called the Chamber of Deputies, in which the ruling party holds sway. The proposed reform, which would see the election of judges of the Supreme Court and other tribunals as well as magistrates, has sparked diplomatic tensions with the United States, prompted protests by opponents, and upset financial markets. 'The judiciary will not fall,' changed protesters who marched on the Senate, expected to vote on the proposal Wednesday. Striking judicial workers have asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the matter, a request that Lopez Obrador has said had no legal basis. The United States, Mexico's main trading partner, has warned that the reforms would threaten a relationship that relies on investor confidence in the Mexican legal framework. Lopez Obrador, who will be replaced by his ally Claudia Sheinbaum on October 1, argues that the change was warranted because courts serve the interests of the political and economic elite.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-protest-mexican-judicial-reform/7776191.html	2024-09-08T13:52:13-07:00	
Iran's president to visit Iraq on first foreign trip	Tehran, Iran — Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian will visit neighboring Iraq on Wednesday, state media reported Sunday, in what will be his first trip abroad since he took office in July. Pezeshkian will head a high-ranking Iranians delegation to Baghdad to meet senior Iraqi officials. The visit comes at the invitation of Iraq's premier, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, the official IRNA news agency quoted Iran's ambassador to Baghdad Mohammad Kazem Al-Sadegh as saying. The two countries will sign memoranda of understanding on cooperation and security, Sadegh said, without elaborating. He said the agreements were to have been signed during a planned visit to Iraq by Iran's late president, Ebrahim Raisi. But Raisi was killed in May along with the then-foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, when their helicopter crashed on a fog-shrouded mountainside in northern Iran. Since taking office, Pezeshkian has vowed to 'prioritize' strengthening ties with the Islamic republic's neighbors. Relations between Iran and Iraq, both Shiite-majority countries, have grown closer over the past two decades. Tehran is one of Iraq's leading trade partners and wields considerable political influence in Baghdad, where its Iraqi allies dominate parliament and the current government. In March 2023 the two countries signed a security agreement covering their common border, months after Tehran struck Kurdish opposition groups in Iraq's north. They have since agreed to disarm Iranian Kurdish rebel groups and remove them from border areas. Tehran accuses the groups of importing arms from Iraq and of fomenting 2022 protests that erupted after the death in custody of Iranian-Kurd woman Mahsa Amini. In January, Iran launched a deadly strike in northern Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, saying it had targeted a site used by 'spies of the Zionist regime (Mossad),' an apparent reference to Israel. On Saturday, an exiled Iranian Kurdish group said one of its activists, Behzad Khosrawi, had been arrested in Iraq's northern city of Sulaimaniyah and handed over to 'Iranian intelligence.' Local Asayesh security forces said Khosrawi was arrested 'because he did not have residency' in the Kurdish region, and denied he had any connection to 'political activism.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-president-to-visit-iraq-on-first-foreign-trip/7776182.html	2024-09-08T13:42:21-07:00

At least 48 killed in Nigerian fuel truck explosion	MAIDUGURI — At least 48 people were killed Sunday in a fuel tanker truck explosion following a collision with another vehicle in Niger state in north-central Nigeria, the state's disaster management agency said. The State Emergency Management Agency in north-central Niger state said the fuel truck collided with a truck carrying travelers and cattle. Several other vehicles were also caught up in the accident, it said. Local media reported that two of the other vehicles — a crane truck and a pickup van —were involved in the accident and caught in the fire. The emergency management agency's spokesperson Hussaini Ibrahim put the death toll at 48 and officials were still trying to clear the scene of the incident. Nigeria's state-owned firm NNPC Ltd last week hiked the price of gasoline by at least 39%, the second major increase in more than a year but shortages have continued, forcing motorists to queue for hours in the country's major cities and towns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-48-killed-in-nigerian-fuel-truck-explosion-/7776114.html	2024-09-08T11:02:43-07:00

President Abdelmadjid Tebboune elected to serve second term leading gas-rich Algeria	ALGIERS — President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has been named the winner of Algeria's presidential election, granting him another term leading the gas-rich North African nation five years after pro-democracy protests led to the ouster of his predecessor. In a result that surprised few observers internationally or in Algeria, the country's independent election authority on Sunday announced that Tebboune had won 94% of the vote, far outpacing his challengers Islamist Abdelali Hassani Cherif, who won 3% and socialist Youcef Aouchiche, who won 2.1%. Election officials reported less than six million of the country's 24 million voters had turned out to vote on Saturday, perpetuating the low voter turnout rates that marred Tebboune's first term and raised questions about his popular support. Algeria is Africa's largest country by area and, with almost 45 million people, it's the continent's second most populous after South Africa to hold presidential elections in 2024 — a year in which more than 50 elections are being held worldwide, encompassing more than half the world's population. Throughout the campaign, activists and international organizations, including Amnesty International, railed against the campaign season's repressive atmosphere and the harassment and prosecutions of those involved in opposition parties, media organizations and civil society groups. Some denounced this election as a rubber stamp exercise that can only entrench the status quo. But Tebboune and his two challengers each urged political participation and specifically made overtures to the Algerian youth, who make up a majority of the population and disproportionately suffer from poverty and unemployment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/president-abdelmadjid-tebboune-elected-to-serve-second-term-leading-gas-rich-algeria-/7776077.html	2024-09-08T10:13:59-07:00	
For many leaving China, it's Japan — not the US — that's the bigger draw	TOKYO — One by one, the students, lawyers and others filed into a classroom in a central Tokyo university for a lecture by a Chinese journalist on Taiwan and democracy — taboo topics that can't be discussed publicly back home in China. 'Taiwan's modern-day democracy took struggle and bloodshed, there's no question about that,' said Jia Jia, a columnist and guest lecturer at the University of Tokyo who was briefly detained in China eight years ago on suspicion of penning a call for China's top leader to resign. He is one of tens of thousands of intellectuals, investors and other Chinese who have relocated to Japan in recent years, part of a larger exodus of people from China. Their backgrounds vary widely, and they're leaving for all sorts of reasons. Some are very poor, others are very rich. Some leave for economic reasons, as opportunities dry up with the end of China's boom. Some flee for personal reasons, as even limited freedoms are eroded. Chinese migrants are flowing to all corners of the world, from workers seeking to start businesses of their own in Mexico to burned-out students heading to Thailand. Those choosing Japan tend to be well-off or highly educated, drawn to the country's ease of living, rich culture and immigration policies that favor highly skilled professionals, with less of the sharp anti-immigrant backlash sometimes seen in Western countries. Jia initially intended to move to the U.S., not Japan. But after experiencing the coronavirus outbreak in China, he was anxious to leave and his American visa application was stuck in processing. So he chose Japan instead. 'In the United States, illegal immigration is particularly controversial. When I went to Japan, I was a little surprised. I found that their immigration policy is actually more relaxed than I thought,' Jia told The Associated Press. 'I found that Japan is better than the U.S.' It's tough to enter the U.S. these days. Tens of thousands of Chinese were arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border over the past year, and Chinese students have been grilled at customs as trade frictions fan suspicions of possible industrial espionage. Some U.S. states passed legislation that restricts Chinese citizens from owning property. 'The U.S. is shutting out those Chinese that are friendliest to them, that most share its values,' said Li Jinxing, a Christian human rights lawyer who moved to Japan in 2022. Li sees parallels to about a century ago, when Chinese intellectuals such as Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of modern China, moved to Japan to study how the country modernized so quickly. 'On one hand, we hope to find inspiration and direction in history,' Li said of himself and like-minded Chinese in Japan. 'On the other hand, we also want to observe what a democratic country with rule of law is like. We're studying Japan. How does its economy work, its government work?' Over the past decade, Tokyo has softened its once-rigid stance against immigration, driven by low birthrates and an aging population. Foreigners now make up about 2% of its population of 125 million. That's expected to jump to 12% by 2070, according to the Tokyo-based National Institute of Population and Social Security Research. Chinese are the most numerous newcomers, at 822,000 last year among more than 3 million foreigners living in Japan, according to government data. That's up from 762,000 a year ago and 649,000 a decade ago. In 2022, the lockdowns under China's 'zero COVID' policies led many of the country's youth or most affluent citizens to hit the exits. There's even a buzzword for that: 'runxue,' using the English word 'run' to evoke 'running away' to places seen as safer and more prosperous. For intellectuals like Li and Jia, Japan offers greater freedoms than under Chinese leader Xi Jinping's increasingly repressive rule. But for others, such as wealthy investors and business people, Japan offers something else: property protections. A report by investment migration firm Henley & Partners says nearly 14,000 millionaires left China last year, the most of any country in the world, with Japan a popular destination. A major driver is worries about the security of their wealth in China or Hong Kong, said Q. Edward Wang, a professor of Asian studies at Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey. 'Protection of private property, which is the cornerstone of a capitalist society, that piece is missing in China,' Wang said. The weakening yen makes buying property and other local assets in Japan a bargain. And while the Japanese economy has stagnated, China's once-sizzling economy is also in a rut, with the property sector in crisis and stock prices stuck at the level they were in the late 2000s. 'If you are just going to Japan to preserve your money,' Wang said, 'then definitely you will enjoy your time in Japan.' Dot.com entrepreneurs are among those leaving China after Communist Party crackdowns on the technology industry, including billionaire Jack Ma, a founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, who took a professorship at Tokyo College, part of the prestigious University of Tokyo. So many wealthy Chinese have bought apartments in Tokyo's luxury high-rises that some areas have been dubbed 'Chinatowns,' or 'Digital Chinatowns' — a nod to the many owners' work in high-tech industries. 'Life in Japan is good,' said Guo Yu, an engineer who retired early after working at ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. Guo doesn't concern himself with politics. He's keen on Japan's powdery snow in the winter and is a 'superfan' of its beautiful hot springs. He owns homes in Tokyo, as well as near a ski resort and a hot spring. He owns several cars, including a Porsche, a Mercedes, a Tesla and a Toyota. Guo keeps busy with a new social media startup in Tokyo and a travel agency specializing in 'onsen,' Japan's hot springs. Most of his employees are Chinese, he said. Like Guo, many Chinese moving to Japan are wealthy and educated. That's for good reason: Japan remains unwelcoming to refugees and many other types of foreigners. The government has been strategic about who it allows to stay, generally focusing on people to fill labor shortages for factories, construction and elder care. 'It is crucial that Japan becomes an attractive country for foreign talent so they will choose to work here,' Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said earlier this year, announcing efforts to relax Japan's stringent immigration restrictions. That kind of opportunity is exactly what Chinese ballet dancer Du Hai said he has found. Leading a class of a dozen Japanese students in a suburban Tokyo studio one recent weekend, Du demonstrated positions and spins to the women dressed in leotards and toe shoes. Du was drawn to Japan's huge ballet scene, filled with professional troupes and talented dancers, he said, but worried about warnings he got about unfriendly Japanese. That turned out to be false, he said with a laugh. Now, Du is considering getting Japanese citizenship. 'Of course, I enjoy living in Japan very much now,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/for-many-leaving-china-it-s-japan-not-the-us-that-s-the-bigger-draw/7772102.html	2024-09-08T09:52:10-07:00

Venezuela opposition leader Gonzalez lands in Spain seeking asylum	CARACAS/MADRID — Venezuelan opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez flew into Spain on Sunday to seek asylum, Madrid said, hours after quitting his country amid a political and diplomatic crisis over July's disputed election. Gonzalez — who has challenged President Nicolas Maduro's declaration of victory — arrived at the Torrejon de Ardoz military base with his wife, Spain's foreign ministry said in a statement. The exit of the 75-year-old — seen by the U.S., the EU and other powers in the region as the winner of the vote — came a week after Venezuelan authorities issued an arrest warrant for him, accusing him of conspiracy and other crimes. 'Today is a sad day for democracy in Venezuela,' European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement. 'In a democracy, no political leader should be forced to seek asylum in another country.' Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said on Instagram authorities had given Gonzalez safe passage in a bid to restore 'political peace.' He left Venezuela after 'voluntarily seeking refuge in the Spanish embassy in Caracas several days ago,' she wrote. Spain's foreign ministry said there had been no talks between the Spanish and the Venezuelan governments on Gonzalez's exit. Venezuela's opposition say the July 28 election resulted in a resounding victory for Gonzalez, and published vote tallies online that they say show he won. Maduro has dismissed all such assertions and says there was a right-wing plot to sabotage his government. Gonzalez's move to Spain marked another jolting shift in the fortunes of the former diplomat who came out of retirement and took over the candidacy in March, initially as a placeholder after opposition leader Maria Corina Machado and then another replacement could not stand. Machado confirmed on X that Gonzalez was now in Spain, adding he had fled to protect his 'freedom, his integrity and his life.' 'The increasing threats, summons, arrest warrants and even the attempts at blackmail and coercion to which he has been subjected show that the regime has no scruples or limits in its obsession to silence him and try to break him,' she wrote. Gonzalez would continue to fight for the opposition from Spain, while she would continue to do so within Venezuela, Machado said, and vowed that on 10 January 2025, he would be sworn in as the country's president. Carmen Beatriz, a political communication and public opinion analyst at the University of Navarra told Reuters Gonzalez's role was important, but Machado is the leader of the process. 'He can become an articulator of international initiatives and interlocutor from the outside,' she said. Spain's foreign ministry said Gonzalez's asylum process would now start - 'the resolution of which will be favorable in view of Spain's commitment to the political rights and physical integrity of all Venezuelan men and women, especially political leaders.' Gonzalez had sought refuge in the Dutch and then the Spanish embassy in Venezuela after the election, Dutch and Venezuelan officials said. Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said in a letter to his parliament on Sunday that Gonzalez had urgently requested refuge in the Dutch embassy the day after the election. 'At the beginning of September, Edmundo Gonzalez indicated that he ... wanted to leave and continue his fight from Spain,' Veldkamp added. Spanish officials, including former Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, linked to diplomatic relations in the South American country in the past, were involved in a week of negotiations with Venezuelan authorities for Gonzalez to leave the country, a source with knowledge of the talks told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Opposition to keep protesting That Maduro allowed Gonzalez's departure despite the arrest warrant he was facing may soften some harsh recent international criticism of him. Machado, though, remains subject of an investigation and has largely been sequestered at an unknown location since the vote, emerging only occasionally to lead rallies. Gonzalez's departure came less than 24 hours after security forces surrounded Argentina's former embassy in Caracas, now being protected by Brazil, where six opposition staffers have been sheltering since warrants were issued for them in March. Attorney General Tarek Saab, who met with Gonzalez's lawyer this week and who has been one of the opposition's most strident accusers, is set to hold a press conference later on Sunday. The opposition is pressing for more street protests and international pressure for its victory to be recognized, but so far those tactics have borne no fruit, with military leaders lining up behind Maduro, and no stepped-up sanctions or other international action since the vote amid waning attendance at anti-government rallies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-revokes-brazil-s-authorization-to-represent-argentine-interests-in-the-country-/7775494.html	2024-09-08T09:10:22-07:00

NATO member Romania says Russian drone violated its airspace	Kyiv, Ukraine — A Russian drone violated Romania's airspace during nighttime attacks on neighboring Ukraine, the NATO member reported Sunday, urging Moscow to stop what it described as an escalation. The incident occurred as Russia carried out attacks on 'civilian targets and port infrastructure' across the Danube River in Ukraine, Romania's Ministry of National Defense said. Romania deployed F-16 warplanes to monitor its airspace, and NATO allies were kept informed, the ministry said. Romanian emergency authorities also issued text alerts to residents of two eastern regions. Preliminary data indicates there may be an 'impact zone' in an uninhabited area near the Romanian village of Periprava, the ministry said. It added that an investigation is underway. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Romania has confirmed drone fragments on its territory on several occasions and as recently as July this year. The Romanian Defense Ministry strongly condemned the Russian attacks on Ukraine, calling them 'unjustified and in serious contradiction with the norms of international law.' Mircea Geoana, NATO's outgoing deputy secretary-general and Romania's former top diplomat, said the military alliance also condemned Russia’s violation of Romanian airspace. 'While we have no information indicating an intentional attack by Russia against Allies, these acts are irresponsible and potentially dangerous,' he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Civilians reported killed in Ukraine In Ukraine, two civilians died and four more suffered wounds in a nighttime Russian airstrike on the northern city of Sumy, the regional military administration reported. Two children were among those wounded, the administration said. In the Kharkiv region in the east, overnight shelling killed two elderly women, according to local Governor Oleh Syniehubov. During the night, Ukrainian air defenses shot down one of four cruise missiles and 15 of 23 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Russia, Ukraine's air force reported. It added that none of the cruise missiles had hit targets. Later Sunday, three women were killed after Russian forces shelled a village in the eastern Donetsk region, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on the Telegram messaging app. Elsewhere in the province, rescue teams pulled the bodies of two men from the rubble of a hotel that was destroyed Saturday evening in a Russian airstrike, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service. That same day, the death toll rose to 58 from the massive Russian missile strike that blasted a military academy Tuesday and a nearby hospital in the eastern city of Poltava, regional Governor Filip Pronin reported. More than 320 others were wounded. Since it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, the Russian military has repeatedly used missiles to smash civilian targets, sometimes killing scores of people in a single attack. Poltava is about 350 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, on the main highway and rail route between Kyiv and Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, which is close to the Russian border. The attack happened as Ukrainian forces sought to carve out their holdings in Russia’s Kursk border region after a surprise incursion that began Aug. 6, as the Russian army hacks its way deeper into eastern Ukraine. Russian forces continued their monthslong grinding push toward the city of Pokrovsk, and ramped up attacks near the town of Kurakhove farther south, Ukraine's General Staff reported. Russia's Defense Ministry said Sunday its troops had taken Novohrodivka, a small town some 19 kilometers (11 miles) southeast of Pokrovsk. An update published Saturday evening by DeepState, a Ukrainian battlefield analysis site, said Russian forces had 'advanced' in Novohrodivka and captured Nevelske, a village in the southeast of the Pokrovsk district. Pokrovsk, which had a prewar population of about 60,000, is one of Ukraine’s main defensive strongholds and a key logistics hub in the Donetsk region. Its capture would compromise Ukraine’s defense and supply routes and would bring Russia closer to its stated aim of capturing the entire Donetsk region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-member-romania-says-russian-drone-violated-its-airspace/7775995.html	2024-09-08T08:12:07-07:00	
UN official says Sudan's war has killed at least 20,000 people	Cairo — More than 16 months of war in Sudan has killed more than 20,000 people, a senior United Nations official said Sunday, a grim figure amid a devastating conflict that has wrecked the northeastern African country. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, gave the tally at a news conference in Sudan’s Red Sea city of Port Sudan, which serves as the seat of the internationally recognized, military-backed government. He said the death toll could be much higher. 'Sudan is suffering through a perfect storm of crisis,' Tedros said as he wrapped up his two-day visit to Sudan. 'The scale of the emergency is shocking, as is the insufficient action being taken to curtail the conflict.' Sudan was plunged into chaos in April last year when simmering tensions between the military and a powerful paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, exploded into open warfare across the country. The conflict has turned the capital, Khartoum, and other urban areas into battlefields, wrecking civilian infrastructure and an already battered health care system. Without the basics, many hospitals and medical facilities have closed their doors. The conflict has created the world’s largest displacement crisis. More than 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes since fighting began, according to the International Organization for Migration. They include over 2.3 million who have fled to neighboring countries as refugees. The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the U.N. and international rights groups. On Friday, U.N.-backed human rights investigators urged the creation of an 'independent and impartial force' to protect civilians, blaming both sides for war crimes including murder, mutilation and torture. Devastating seasonal floods in recent weeks have compounded the misery. Dozens of people have been killed and critical infrastructure has been washed away in 12 of Sudan’s 18 provinces, according to local authorities. A cholera outbreak is the latest calamity for the country. The disease has killed at least 165 and sickened about 4,200 others in recent weeks, the health ministry said in its latest update Friday. 'We are calling on the world to wake up and help Sudan out of the nightmare it’s living through,' Tedros said, adding that an immediate cease-fire is urgently required. 'The best medicine is peace,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-rejects-un-call-for-impartial-force-to-protect-civilians-/7775918.html	2024-09-08T05:50:57-07:00	
Sudan rejects UN call for 'impartial force' to protect civilians	Port Sudan, Sudan — Sudan has rejected a call by U.N. experts for the deployment of an 'independent and impartial force' to protect millions of civilians driven from their homes by more than a year of war. The conflict since April last year, pitting the army against paramilitary forces, has killed tens of thousands of people and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The independent U.N. experts said Friday their fact-finding mission had uncovered 'harrowing' violations by both sides, 'which may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. They called for 'an independent and impartial force with a mandate to safeguard civilians' to be deployed 'without delay.' The Sudanese foreign ministry, which is loyal to the army under General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said in a statement late Saturday that 'the Sudanese government rejects in their entirety the recommendations of the U.N. mission.' It called the U.N. Human Rights Council, which created the fact-finding mission last year, 'a political and illegal body', and the panel's recommendations 'a flagrant violation of their mandate.' The U.N. experts said eight million civilians have been displaced and another two million people have fled to neighboring countries. More than 25 million people upwards of half the country's population — face acute food shortages. World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on a visit to Sudan on Sunday, said: 'The scale of the emergency is shocking, as is the insufficient action being taken to curtail the conflict and respond to the suffering it is causing.' In Port Sudan, where government offices and the United Nations have relocated to due to the intense fighting in the capital Khartoum, Tedros called on the 'world to wake up and help Sudan out of the nightmare it is living through'. The Sudanese foreign ministry statement accused the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by Burhan's former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, of 'systematically targeting civilians and civilian institutions'. 'The protection of civilians remains an absolute priority for the Sudanese government,' it said. The statement added that the U.N. Human Rights Council's role should be 'to support the national process, rather than seek to impose a different exterior mechanism'. It also rejected the experts' call for an arms embargo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-rejects-un-call-for-impartial-force-to-protect-civilians/7776853.html	2024-09-08T05:50:21-07:00	
Family keeps up Beirut dessert tradition	Beirut — At a shop nestled in a busy, crowded Beirut district, Hasan El-Makary is weighing out containers of warm, fragrant mufataka, a traditional sweet in the Lebanese capital that is rarely found in stores. 'I've been in this shop for 50 years, but we started specializing in mufataka 30 years ago,' Makary said from the humble shop with its aging decor and low ceiling. A kind of rice pudding made with turmeric, tahini sesame paste, sugar and pine nuts, mufataka is traditional in Beirut but less known even outside the city. Makary, 73, said he used to sell other sweets but as demand grew for mufataka, he abandoned the rest and now he and his cousin – who is also his business partner – just make the yellow pudding. 'At the beginning you add turmeric, that's the main thing, then tahini, sugar and rice ... we cook it slowly on fire,' he said. The rice must be soaked overnight, and Makary said he comes to the shop at 5:00 a.m. to make the dish, which takes around four hours and requires regular stirring. He said his father started making mufataka despite initially believing people would not pay money for a dish that is normally prepared at home. Plastic containers of the pudding, which is eaten with a spoon, dotted trays and tables across the shop, waiting for customers who peered through a window to place their order from the busy street outside. Customer Iman Chehab, 55, was picking up mufataka for her mother, who used to make it herself. 'She is elderly now and she can't stir ... it takes a lot of work,' said Chehab, who works in human resources management. The dish is 'something traditional for us who are from Beirut,' she told AFP. Places like Makary's shop 'are the old face of Beirut that we love and always want to remember,' she added. 'Heritage' A few bustling neighborhoods away, Samir Makari, 35, is carrying on the family tradition. At a gleaming shop also selling Arabic sweets like baklava, Makari attends to a huge copper pot of mufataka behind the counter, stirring it with a long, wooden-handled implement. He weighs out and mixes the sugar, tahini paste and pine nuts in a second pot, later combining it all. Mufataka used to be made just once a year on the last Wednesday in April, with families gathering by the sea at Beirut's public beach, father and son said. The occasion was 'Job's Wednesday,' a reference to the biblical figure also mentioned in the Koran and who is renowned for his patience, the younger Makari said, noting the virtue is also required for making mufataka. On the wall of his shop, which he runs with his brother, were photos of his father and his grandfather at work. He said he sometimes makes mufataka twice a day depending on demand, with some customers taking it outside Beirut to introduce it to those who do not know the dish. At the original store, the elder Makary said he was happy his children had kept up the tradition. Mufataka is part of 'my heritage,' he said, and the family has 'taken it from generation to generation.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/family-keeps-up-beirut-dessert-tradition/7771087.html	2024-09-08T03:32:08-07:00	
Pakistan hasn't learned lessons from 2022 deadly floods, experts say	ISLAMABAD — Millions of people in Pakistan continue to live along the path of floodwaters, showing neither people nor the government have learned lessons from the 2022 devastating floods that killed 1,737 people, experts said Thursday, as an aid group said half of the 300 victims killed by rains since July are children. Heavy rainfall is drenching those areas that were badly hit by the deluges two years ago. The charity Save the Children said in a statement that floods and heavy rains have killed more than 150 children in Pakistan since the start of the monsoon season, making up more than half of all deaths in rain-affected areas. The group said that 200 children have also been injured in Pakistan because of rains, which have also displaced thousands of people. Save the Children also said that people affected by floods were living in a relief camp in Sanghar, a district in the southern Sindh province, which was massively hit by floods two years ago. 'The rains and floods have destroyed 80% of cotton crops in Sanghar, the primary source of income for farmers, and killed hundreds of livestock,' the charity said, and added that it's supporting the affected people with help from a local partner. Khuram Gondal, the country director for Save the Children in Pakistan, said that children were always the most affected in a disaster. 'We need to ensure that the immediate impacts of the floods and heavy rains do not become long-term problems. In Sindh province alone, more than 72,000 children have seen their education disrupted,' he said. Another charity, U.K.-based Islamic Relief, also said weeks of torrential rains in Pakistan have again triggered displacement and suffering among communities that were already devastated by the 2022 floods and are still in the process of rebuilding their lives and livelihoods. Asif Sherazi, the group's country director, said his organization is reaching out to flood-affected people. There was no immediate response from the country’s ministry of climate change and national disaster management authority. Pakistan has yet to undertake major reconstruction work because the government didn't receive most of the funds out of the $9 billion that were pledged by the international community at last year's donors' conference in Geneva. 'We learned no lessons from that 2022 floods. Millions of people have built mud-brick homes on the paths of rivers, which usually remain dry,' said Mohsin Leghari, who served as irrigation minister years ago. Leghari said that less rain is predicted for Pakistan for monsoon season compared with 2022, when climate-induced floods caused $30 billion in damage to the country's economy. 'But the floodwater has inundated several villages in my own Dera Ghazi Khan district in the Punjab province,' Leghari said. 'Floods have affected farmers, and my own land has once again come under the floodwater.' Wasim Ehsan, an architect, said Pakistan was still not prepared to handle any 2022-like situation mainly because people ignore construction laws while building homes and even hotels in urban and rural areas. He said the floods in 2022 caused damage in the northwest because people had built homes and hotels after slightly diverting a river. 'This is reason that a hotel was destroyed by the Swat River in 2022,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-hasn-t-learned-lessons-from-2022-deadly-floods-experts-say/7772534.html	2024-09-08T03:27:02-07:00	
Shooting attack at the West Bank-Jordan border crossing kills 3 Israelis	ALLENBY CROSSING, West Bank — Three Israelis were shot and killed Sunday at the border crossing between the West Bank and Jordan, Israeli officials said, in what appeared to be an attack linked to the 11-month-old war in Gaza. The military said the gunman approached the Allenby Bridge Crossing from the Jordanian side in a truck and opened fire at Israeli security forces, who killed the assailant in a shootout. It said the three people killed were Israeli civilians. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said they were all men in their 50s. Jordan is investigating the shooting, its state-run Petra News Agency reported. The Western-allied Arab country made peace with Israel in 1994, but is deeply critical of its policies toward the Palestinians. Jordan has a large Palestinian population and has seen mass protests against Israel over the war in Gaza. The Allenby crossing over the Jordan River, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, is mainly used by Israelis, Palestinians and international tourists. Authorities in Israel and Jordan said the crossing was closed until further notice, and Israel later announced the closure of both of its land crossings with Jordan, near Beit Shean in the north and Eilat in the south. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attack and linked it to Israel's larger conflict with Iran and allied militant groups, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Israeli-occupied West Bank has seen a surge of violence since Hamas' October 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. Israel has launched near-daily military arrest raids into dense Palestinian residential areas, and there has also been a rise in settler violence and Palestinian attacks on Israelis. In Gaza, meanwhile, an Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed five people, including two women, two children and a senior official in the Civil Defense — first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government. The Civil Defense said the strike targeted the home of its deputy director for north Gaza, Mohammed Morsi, in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The army says it tries to avoid harming civilians and only targets militants. Gaza's Health Ministry says over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began. It does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their October 7 attack into southern Israel. They abducted another 250 and are still holding around 100 of them after releasing most of the rest in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire last November. Around a third of the remaining hostages inside Gaza are believed to be dead. The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent months trying to broker a cease-fire and the return of the hostages, but the negotiations have repeatedly bogged down. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem — territories the Palestinians want for a future state — in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintained control over its airspace, coastline and most of its land crossings. Along with Egypt, it imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shooting-attack-at-the-west-bank-jordan-border-crossing-kills-3-israelis/7775829.html	2024-09-08T01:45:02-07:00	
Typhoon Yagi kills 14 in Vietnam as officials warn of heavy rain that can cause flooding	HANOI, Vietnam — At least 14 people have died and 176 others injured in Vietnam after Typhoon Yagi slammed the country's north, state media said Sunday, as officials warned of heavy downpours despite its waning power. Described by Vietnamese officials as one of the most powerful typhoons to hit the region over the last decade, Yagi left more than 3 million people without electricity in northern Vietnam. It also damaged vital agricultural land, nearly 116,192 hectares where rice and fruits are mostly grown. Hundreds of flights were canceled after four airports were closed. The typhoon made landfall in Vietnam's northern coastal provinces of Quang Ninh and Haiphong with wind speeds of up to 149 kilometers per hour on Saturday afternoon. It raged for roughly 15 hours before gradually weakening into a tropical depression early Sunday morning. Vietnam's meteorological department predicted heavy rain in northern and central provinces and warned of floods in low-lying areas, flash floods in streams and landslides on steep slopes. Municipal workers along with army and police forces were busy in the capital, Hanoi, clearing uprooted trees, fallen billboards, toppled electricity poles and rooftops that were swept away, while assessing damaged buildings. Yagi was still a storm when it blew out of the northwestern Philippines into the South China Sea on Wednesday, leaving at least 20 people dead and 26 others missing mostly in landslides and widespread flooding in the acrchipelago nation. It then made its way to China, killing three people and injuring nearly a hundred others, before landing in Vietnam. Storms like Typhoon Yagi were 'getting stronger due to climate change, primarily because warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel the storms, leading to increased wind speeds and heavier rainfall,' said Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore.	https://www.voanews.com/a/typhoon-yagi-weakens-after-killing-dozens-in-vietnam-china-philippines/7775815.html	2024-09-07T23:53:26-07:00

Brazil's X ban provokes Bolsonaro supporters to rally for 'freedom'	SAO PAULO — Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro began flooding Sao Paulo's main boulevard for an Independence Day rally Saturday, buoyed by the government's blocking of tech billionaire Elon Musk's X platform, a ban they say is proof of their political persecution. A few thousand demonstrators, clad in the yellow-and-green colors of Brazil's flag, poured onto Avednia Paulista. References to the ban on X and images of Musk abounded. 'Thank you for defending our freedom,' read one banner praising the tech entrepreneur. Saturday's march is a test of Bolsonaro's capacity to mobilize turnout ahead of the October municipal elections, even though Brazil's electoral court has barred him from running for office until 2030. It's also something of a referendum on X, whose suspension has raised eyebrows even among some of Bolsonaro's opponents all the while stoking the flames of Brazil's deep-seated political polarization. 'A country without liberty can't celebrate anything this day,' Bolsonaro wrote on his Instagram account September 4, urging Brazilians to stay away from official Independence Day parades and instead join him in Sao Paulo. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered X's nationwide ban on Aug. 30 after months of feuding with Musk over the limits of free speech. The powerful judge has spearheaded efforts to ban far-right users from spreading misinformation on social media, and he ramped up his clampdown after die-hard Bolsonaro supporters ransacked Congress and the presidential palace on January 8, 2023, to overturn Bolsonaro's defeat in the presidential election. The ban is red meat to Bolsonaro's allies, who have accused the judiciary and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government of colluding to silence their movement. 'Elon Musk has been a warrior for freedom of speech,' staunch Bolsonaro ally and lawmaker Bia Kicis said in an interview. 'The right is being oppressed, massacred, because the left doesn't want the right to exist.' 'Our liberties are in danger; we need to make our voices heard. De Moraes is a tyrant, he should be impeached, and people on the streets is the only thing that will convince politicians to do it,' said retiree Amaro Santos as he walked down the thoroughfare Saturday, Musk, a self-proclaimed 'free speech absolutist,' has also urged Brazilians to turn out in droves for the rally, resharing someone else's post claiming that X's ban had awakened people 'to the fact that freedom isn't free and needs to be fought for.' He's also created an X account, named for the controversial jurist, to publish sealed court orders directing X to shut down accounts deemed unlawful. But De Moraes' decision to ban X was far from arbitrary, having been upheld by fellow Supreme Court justices. And while expression, online and elsewhere, is more easily censored under Brazil's laws than it is in the U.S., Musk has emerged as both a cause celebre and a mouthpiece for unrestricted free speech. Since 2019, X has shut down 226 accounts of far-right activities accused of undermining Brazil's democracy, including those of lawmakers affiliated with Bolsonaro's party, according to court records. But when it refused to act on some accounts, de Moraes warned last month that its legal representative could be arrested, prompting X to disband its local office. The U.S.-based company refused to name a new representative — as required to receive court notices — and de Moraes ordered its nationwide suspension until it did so. A Supreme Court panel unanimously upheld de Moraes' decision to block X days later, undermining Musk's efforts to cast him as an authoritarian bent on censoring political speech. The more controversial component of his ruling was the levy of a whopping $9,000 daily fine for regular Brazilians using virtual private networks (VPNs) to access X. 'Some of these measures that have been adopted by the Supreme Court appear to be quite onerous and abusive,' said Andrei Roman, CEO of Brazil-based pollster Atlas Intel. In the lead-up to Saturday's protest, some right-wing politicians defied de Moraes' ban and brazenly used a VPN to publish posts on X, calling for people to partake in the protests. The march in Sao Paulo is organized in parallel to official events to celebrate Brazil's anniversary of independence from Portugal. Commemorations have been fraught with tension in recent years, as Bolsonaro used them while in office to rally supporters and show political strength. Three years ago, he threatened to plunge the country into a constitutional crisis when he declared he would no longer abide de Moraes' rulings. He has since toned down the attacks — a reflection of his own delicate legal situation. Bolsonaro has been indicted twice since his term ended in 2022, most recently for alleged money laundering in connection with undeclared diamonds from Saudi Arabia. De Moraes is overseeing an investigation into the Jan. 8 riot, including whether Bolsonaro had a role in inciting it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-s-x-ban-provokes-bolsonaro-supporters-to-rally-for-freedom-/7775518.html	2024-09-07T16:59:51-07:00	
Proposed UN peacekeeping plan could replace Kenya-led police mission in Haiti	UNITED NATIONS — The United States and Ecuador circulated a draft resolution Friday asking the United Nations to begin planning for a U.N. peacekeeping operation to replace the Kenya-led mission now in the Caribbean nation helping police to quell gang violence. The proposed Security Council resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, says U.N. peacekeepers are needed 'in order to sustain the gains' made by the U.N.-backed multinational mission which has seen almost 400 Kenyan police deploy since June to help the Haitian National Police. The circulation of the short resolution to all 15 council members follows U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Haiti on Thursday where he reaffirmed the U.S. government's commitment to the multinational mission and pushed for long-awaited general elections. America's top diplomat also said a U.N. peacekeeping force was an option to address a funding crisis for the Kenya-led mission, which depends on voluntary contributions. The U.S. and Canada have provided the bulk of funds so far. Peacekeeping operations, by contrast, are funded from a special U.N. budget. The United Nations has been involved in Haiti on and off since 1990. A 2004 rebellion had the country on the brink of collapse, leading to deployment of a U.N. force. It helped stabilize the impoverished nation after successful elections and a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed as many as 300,000 people and ended in October 2017. But U.N. peacekeepers left under a cloud, with troops from Nepal widely blamed for introducing cholera that has killed about 10,000 people in Haiti since 2010 and other troops implicated in sexual abuse, including rape and the targeting of hungry children. Since 2017, the U.N. has had a series of small missions in Haiti. The latest, political mission, BINUH, has a mandate to advance a Haitian-led political process toward elections, the rule of law and human rights. Many Haitians have rejected the proposal of another peacekeeping operation, given the introduction of cholera and sexual abuse cases that occurred when U.N. troops were last in Haiti. Some Haitians also see U.N. peacekeepers as an occupying force. Haiti asked for an international force to combat gangs in 2022, and U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres appealed for months for a country to lead the force before the Kenyans came forward and pledged 1,000 police. They are expected to be joined by police from the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin, Chad and Jamaica, bringing the multinational force to 2,500 personnel. They would be deployed in phases that would cost roughly $600 million a year. Currently, the U.N. has $85 million in pledges for the mission, out of which $68 million has been received. The gangs have grown in power since the July 7, 2021, assassination of President Jovenel Moïse and are now estimated to control up to 80% of the capital. The surge in killings, rapes and kidnappings has led to a violent uprising by civilian vigilante groups. In February, gangs launched coordinated attacks on police stations and the main international airport, which remained closed for nearly three months. They also stormed Haiti's two largest prisons, releasing more than 4,000 inmates. The violence subsided somewhat before the first contingent of Kenyan police arrived in late June, with Blinken noting that economic activity has restarted in some areas of Port-au-Prince, and that joint operations have led to successes including regaining control of Haiti's biggest public hospital. However, gangs continue to attack communities surrounding Port-au-Prince. The draft resolution would determine that 'the situation in Haiti continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security and to stability in the region.' Extending gratitude to Kenya, it would extend the mandate of the Multinational Security Support mission until Oct. 2, 2025, while the U.N. plans a transition to a peacekeeping operation. Security Council experts held their first meeting on the text of the resolution Friday afternoon and negotiations are expected to continue, a council diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because discussions were private. No date has been set for a vote. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric reiterated Friday that any new peacekeeping force requires approval from the Security Council. U.N. member nations must then volunteer troops and needed equipment, and the force then needs to be deployed — all of which takes time, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/proposed-un-peacekeeping-plan-could-replace-kenya-led-police-mission-in-haiti/7775525.html	2024-09-07T16:47:08-07:00	
Iran's secret service plots to kill Jews in Europe, says France	paris — A Paris court in May detained and charged a couple on accusations that they were involved in Iranian plots to kill Jews in Germany and France, police sources told Agence France-Presse. Authorities charged Abdelkrim S., 34, and his partner Sabrina B., 33, on May 4 with conspiring with a criminal terrorist organization and placed them in pretrial detention. The case, known as 'Marco Polo' and revealed Thursday by French news website Mediapart, signals a revival in Iranian state-sponsored terrorism in Europe, according to a report by France's General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) seen by AFP. 'Since 2015, the Iranian (secret) services have resumed a targeted killing policy,' the French security agency wrote, adding that 'the threat has worsened again in the context of the Israel-Hamas war.' The alleged objective for Iranian intelligence was to target civilians and sow fear in Europe among the country's political opposition as well as among Jews and Israelis. Iran is accused of recruiting criminals, including drug lords, to conduct such operations. Abdelkrim S. was previously sentenced to 10 years in prison in a killing in Marseille and released on probation in July 2023. He is accused of being the main France-based operative for an Iran-sponsored terrorist cell that planned acts of violence in France and Germany. A former fellow inmate is believed to have connected the suspect with the cell's coordinator, a major drug trafficker from the Lyon area who likely visited Iran in May, according to the DGSI. The group intended to attack a Paris-based former employee at an Israeli security firm and three of his colleagues residing in the Paris suburbs. Three Israeli-German citizens in Munich and Berlin were also among the targets. Investigators believe that Abdelkrim S., despite his probation, made multiple trips to Germany for scouting purposes, including travels to Berlin with his wife. He denied the accusations and said he simply had purchases to make. French authorities are also crediting the cell with plots to set fire to four Israeli-owned companies in the south of France between late December 2023 and early January 2024, said a police source. Abdelkrim S. rejected the claims, saying he had acted as a go-between on Telegram for the mastermind and other individuals involved in a planned insurance scam, the source added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-secret-service-plots-to-kill-jews-in-europe-says-france/7775516.html	2024-09-07T16:28:17-07:00	
Israeli strike kills three Lebanese medics, Hezbollah retaliates	cairo — Three Lebanese paramedics were killed and two others wounded, one critically, in an Israeli attack while they were extinguishing fires in the southern town of Faroun, Lebanon's health ministry said on Saturday. 'Israeli forces targeted a team from the Lebanese Civil Defense as they responded to fires sparked by recent Israeli airstrikes,' a ministry statement said, specifying that the strike hit a fire truck. The Israeli military said: 'Earlier today, the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) struck and eliminated terrorists from the Amal terrorist organization that operated within a Hezbollah military structure in the area of Froun in southern Lebanon.' Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack as a violation of international law and announced an emergency meeting on Monday with Western ambassadors and international organizations to address the ongoing hostilities. 'To date, because of Israel's aggression, 25 paramedics from various ambulance teams have been killed, along with two health workers, and 94 paramedics and health workers have been injured,' the health ministry statement added. The health ministry also condemned the attack as a 'blatant strike' on an official Lebanese state apparatus, marking the second such attack on an emergency team in less than 12 hours. Hezbollah issued a statement, saying it launched a 'squadron of missiles' in response to the Faroun attack, targeting an Israeli military headquarters, causing casualties. Around 140 civilians have been killed by Israeli bombardment of Lebanon since October 8, when hostilities broke out between the Israeli military and Hezbollah in parallel with the war in Gaza. The intensity of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel has ratcheted up steadily, displacing tens of thousands of people on either side of the Lebanese Israeli frontier. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, between October 8, 2023, and August 26, at least 133 civilians have been killed. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health, the total number of casualties stands at 2,412, including 564 fatalities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strike-kills-three-lebanese-medics-hezbollah-retaliates-/7775513.html	2024-09-07T16:04:39-07:00	
Fierce border clashes erupt between Pakistan and Afghanistan	Islamabad — Border security forces of Pakistan and Afghanistan were engaged in intense clashes Saturday, reportedly resulting in several casualties on both sides. The war zone is located between the southeastern Afghan border province of Khost and the adjoining Pakistani district of Kurram, as reported by security officials and residents on both sides. The conflict reportedly broke out when Taliban forces attempted to construct a security outpost on the Afghan side, prompting Pakistani troops to open fire to force the other side to stop the activity. Pakistani officials maintain neither side can construct new posts unilaterally under mutual agreements regarding the nearly 2,600-kilometer border between the two countries. Multiple sources reported that ongoing heavy clashes had injured at least five Pakistani soldiers, including an officer, and more than four Afghan border guards. Pakistan and Afghanistan authorities have not commented immediately on the fighting. This is the second time in as many days that the two countries have clashed over the construction of the disputed Afghan border outpost. The military tensions come amid Pakistan's persistent allegations that militants linked to the outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, have taken shelter on Afghan soil and are being facilitated by the country's Taliban leaders in orchestrating cross-border terrorist attacks. 'We have, on numerous occasions, presented evidence of the activities of these terror groups, which have hideouts and sanctuaries inside Afghanistan,' Mumtaz Baloch, the Pakistani foreign ministry spokesperson, reiterated Thursday. 'We urge the government of Afghanistan to take action against these terror groups and to ensure that these terror groups do not stage terror attacks against Pakistan,' she told a weekly news conference in Islamabad. Taliban authorities deny foreign militant groups, including TTP, are present in Afghanistan, saying no one is being allowed to threaten neighboring countries from their territory. However, recent United Nations assessments disputed the Taliban claims and backed Pakistan's concerns that TTP operatives had intensified cross-border violence with the help of the de facto Afghan government in Kabul, which no country has officially recognized. Since the Taliban regained power three years ago, bilateral ties have been strained due to increasing TTP attacks inside Pakistan and occasional border skirmishes, significantly undermining trade and transit ties between Pakistan and landlocked Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fierce-border-clashes-erupt-between-pakistan-and-afghanistan/7775511.html	2024-09-07T15:56:01-07:00

Ukraine voices concern at reports of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia	KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukraine's foreign ministry said Saturday it was deeply concerned by reports about a possible impending transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia. In a statement emailed to reporters, the ministry said the deepening military cooperation between Tehran and Moscow was a threat to Ukraine, Europe and the Middle East, and called on the international community to increase pressure on Iran and Russia. CNN and The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Iran had transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Russia, citing unidentified sources. Reuters reported in August that Russia was expecting the imminent delivery of hundreds of Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles from Iran and that dozens of Russian military personnel were being trained in Iran on the satellite-guided weapons for eventual use in the war in Ukraine. On Friday, the United States, a key ally of Ukraine, also voiced concern about the potential transfer of missiles. 'Any transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,' White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said. Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York said Friday that Tehran's position on the Ukraine conflict was unchanged. 'Iran considers the provision of military assistance to the parties engaged in the conflict — which leads to increased human casualties, destruction of infrastructure, and a distancing from cease-fire negotiations — to be inhumane,' it said. 'Thus, not only does Iran abstain from engaging in such actions itself, but it also calls upon other countries to cease the supply of weapons to the sides involved in the conflict.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-voices-concern-at-reports-of-iranian-ballistic-missiles-to-russia/7775391.html	2024-09-07T10:18:34-07:00	
Chrysler-parent Stellantis recalls 1.46 million vehicles worldwide	WASHINGTON — Chrysler parent Stellantis said Saturday it is recalling 1.46 million vehicles worldwide due to a software malfunction in the anti-lock brake system that can increase the risk of a crash. The recall includes nearly 1.23 million Ram 1500 trucks from the 2019 and 2021-2024 model years in the United States, as well as about 159,000 vehicles in Canada, 13,000 in Mexico and 61,000 outside North America. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said a software malfunction might result in the anti-lock brake system control module disabling the electronic stability control system. The issue means the vehicles do not comply with a federal motor vehicle safety standard on electric stability control systems. Stellantis said if the issue occurs, the ABS, ESC, adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning indicator lights will be illuminated at vehicle start up, indicating the systems are not working.

Chinese activist risks deportation after Denmark rejects asylum bid	STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN — Chinese dissident Liu Dongling is at risk of deportation back to China after Denmark rejected her asylum application in June, a situation some rights advocates say reflects challenges Chinese dissidents face when seeking refuge abroad, especially in Europe. Liu has been leading the 'Ban the Great Firewall' online campaign against China’s internet censorship regime since August 2023, when founder Qiao Xinxin was deported back to China from Laos and detained on subversion charges. Danish immigration authorities informed Liu in June they rejected her asylum application following a two-year review and would repatriate her back to China in seven days. Fearing similar charges if deported to China, Liu fled to Sweden with her teenage son the next day. 'I’ve been in Sweden for more than two months, and I still can’t work here since I don’t have a proper legal status,' she told VOA in an interview in Stockholm. Lui cannot apply for asylum in Sweden due to the Dublin Regulation, an agreement between European Union countries that establishes that a single country is responsible for examining an applicant's request for asylum. Contacted by VOA, the Danish Immigration Service and Danish Return Agency said they could not comment on individual cases, citing confidentiality required by law. Human rights advocates contacted by VOA said that based on Qiao’s detention, Liu will likely face imprisonment if the Danish authorities deport her. 'Apart from leading the online free speech campaign, Liu has also been collecting information about human rights violations for the China Human Rights Accountability Database, so she would definitely be given prison sentences if she were sent back to China,' Lin Shengliang, a Chinese activist based in the Netherlands and the founder of the human rights database, told VOA by phone. Seeking asylum in Denmark Liu has been an activist since 2014, when she helped forced eviction victims seek compensation through legal channels. She said she started being followed and her son started being banned by teachers from participating in activities he enjoyed. 'My son began to refuse to go to school so I decided to move to Thailand and let him go to school there,' Liu told VOA. In June 2019, she began documenting human rights violations for the Chinese news website Boxun, which covers activism and human rights violations in China. But soon, Chinese prosecutors in China’s Henan province started repeatedly contacting her, increasing her concern over her safety. She nevertheless returned to China twice in 2019 to renew her Thai visa. At the time, she wasn’t arrested or detained by local authorities. In June 2022, fearing deportation back to China considering the Thai detention and repatriation of Chinese dissidents, Liu applied for a Danish tourist visa and flew there with her son, applying for asylum when they arrived. As Danish authorities began to review her asylum application in March 2023, she also became involved with the online free speech campaign. She tried to spread information about how to bypass China’s internet censorship through virtual private networks to Chinese people while informing Chinese people working in the cybersecurity sector that they might be assisting the Chinese government with violating Chinese people’s basic human rights. Two months after she joined the campaign, movement co-founder Qiao Xinxin went missing in Laos. In August 2023, his family confirmed he had been detained in a Chinese prison under subversion charges. Despite Qiao’s and her extensive history of activism, Liu said Danish authorities repeatedly questioned whether she was at risk of arrest if she returned to China, citing her successful returns to China in 2019 as proof that she could freely leave the country. 'The Refugee Appeals Board finds that the applicant left China legally for Thailand in 2018 and later, she traveled back and forth between China and Thailand legally twice without experiencing issues,' the Danish Refugee Appeals Board wrote in an official case document seen by VOA. The Danish immigration authorities ultimately determined that Liu had not provided 'credible evidence' to prove that she had faced persecution in China and that if she returned to China, she would be persecuted by Chinese authorities. Some analysts say while Liu has a long track record of criticizing the Chinese government and engaging in human rights issues, some missing pieces of evidence made it difficult for her to prove the authenticity of her claims to the Danish authorities. However, several human rights organizations, including Madrid-based Safeguard Defenders, are trying to push the Danish immigration authorities to reassess her case. 'We have prepared all the paperwork to support the reassessment of her case,' said Peter Dahlin, the director of Safeguard Defenders. He told VOA that Denmark’s rejection of Liu’s asylum application shows the need for Chinese dissidents to be well-prepared before applying for asylum in a foreign country. 'If Chinese dissidents are going to seek asylum abroad, they need to prepare all necessary paperwork and evidence to back up their claims,' he said in a phone interview. Dahlin said if the Danish authorities decided to follow through on deporting Liu to China, human rights organizations will consider filing an interim measure requesting the European Court of Human Rights to weigh in on the decision. 'I don't think Denmark wants the embarrassment of having been told by the European Court of Human Rights to stop their action,' he told VOA. While human rights organizations are pushing Danish authorities to reassess Liu’s initial asylum application, she and her son may need to wait months before the Danish government finishes reassessment of her case. 'They will live in Sweden with no legal rights, and that’s not an easy situation to be in especially when Sweden and Denmark are hardening their stance on asylum and immigration,' Dahlin said. Since it remains unclear whether Danish authorities would reassess her case, Liu said she is still haunted by her possible deportation back to China. 'I have no clue what my next step is, and the only thing I could do now is to lay low and wait to see if Danish authorities reassess my asylum application,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-activist-risks-deportation-after-denmark-rejects-asylum-bid/7775272.html	2024-09-07T07:33:00-07:00	
Kyrgyzstan follows regional trend, takes Taliban off terrorist list	washington — Shunned by the West for over three years, Afghanistan's Taliban scored a diplomatic victory of sorts this week when the small Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan quietly removed the group from its list of banned terrorist organizations. The move underscores warming ties between the Taliban, in power since August 2021, and the countries of Central Asia. While the United States has led an international campaign to deny the Taliban government legitimacy, over a dozen regional countries, led by China and Russia, have embraced the self-styled 'Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.' 'It fits with the broader trend of governments in the region and internationally warming up to the idea of having to work with the Taliban,' said Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism and a research fellow at the Soufan Center. 'Generally, there is a recognition that the Taliban is not going anywhere, so you have to work with whoever is ruling Afghanistan for economic and security reasons.' Taliban reaction The government of Kyrgyzstan, once considered a close U.S. ally in the region, did not publicize its decision to delist the Taliban, but the Taliban's Foreign Ministry quickly seized on it as the latest breakthrough in its regional diplomacy. 'Aligning with actions of other countries, the step taken by Kyrgyzstan signifies a growing political recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan on both regional and international levels, and removes a barrier to strengthening bilateral relations between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan & other countries,' it said Thursday in a statement. The Taliban, which first ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 before waging a 20-year insurgency, has appeared on various international terrorist lists over the years. While the U.S. has not officially labeled them a 'foreign terrorist organization,' it considers members 'specially designated global terrorists.' Kyrgyzstan is the second Central Asian country to delist the Taliban in recent months. In December, Kazakhstan took the group off its own terrorist list as part of its growing economic engagement with the Taliban. In May, Russia said it, too, was considering such a move as it decides whether to recognize the Taliban's government. Although no country has extended official recognition to the Taliban, more than a dozen, including all six of Afghanistan's neighbors, have allowed Taliban diplomats to take charge of Afghan embassies or consulates. Among them, three have accepted accredited Taliban envoys: China in January, followed by Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates last month. In pursuing ties with the Taliban, Central Asian countries are taking their cues from Russia and China, both of which have deepened their engagement with Afghanistan's de facto government in recent years. 'They're pursuing practical policies, and they're also given a kind of umbrella by two of the major great powers — Russia and China — who are working with the Taliban quite closely,' Webber said. A 'necessary evil' In a report on the Taliban's regional diplomacy, analysts at the International Crisis Group noted how various countries pursue disparate agendas. Afghanistan neighbors such as Iran, Pakistan and Uzbekistan view dealing with the Taliban as a 'necessary evil if they are to address core concerns,' the analysts wrote. Those concerns include extremist threats as well as trade. For Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, a planned project designed to carry surplus power to Afghanistan and Pakistan is a priority. Regional powers China, India and Russia use engagement to contain 'any spillover' from Afghanistan, the analysts said. Russia regards the Taliban as a bulwark against the Islamic State's local branch. And while China has signed lucrative investment deals with Afghanistan, it, too, is motivated by fear of terrorism. Countries farther afield, such as the UAE and Qatar, aim 'to challenge the Taliban's Islamic exceptionalism but [are] also spurred by the need to balance their own regional rivalries,' they wrote. Strategic interests vs. human rights Significantly, none of the countries that have established diplomatic ties with the Taliban were classified as 'free' by Freedom House, the freedom and democracy advocacy group. All but two are labeled 'not free,' according to a VOA review. Only Pakistan and Turkey are designated as 'partly free.' This suggests that the Taliban can ward off international isolation if enough countries prioritize strategic interests over human rights and democracy, according to experts. While human rights haven't always been a U.S. foreign policy priority, the Biden administration, along with its Western allies, have made Taliban recognition contingent on respect for human rights, women's rights and an inclusive government. 'Given the issues related to the treatment of women and other human rights issues, it's more difficult for liberal democratic governments to recognize and work with the Taliban than it is for less democratic governments or nondemocratic governments, where they can be more practical in terms of pursuing their national interests solely and then working with the Taliban on this basis,' Webber said. The implications for Afghanistan's future and U.S. diplomacy are immense. Increased political and economic engagement could embolden the Taliban to keep their harsh policies, such as their ban on girls' education after sixth grade, experts say. It could also force Washington to reassess its dual policy of engaging and isolating the Taliban. Since the Taliban takeover, U.S. and European diplomats have held ongoing talks with Taliban officials in Qatar, where they maintain their Afghanistan embassy operations. Biden administration officials have also reportedly weighed working with the Taliban to combat the Afghan-based Islamic State Khorasan terror group, even while refusing to establish diplomatic ties. 'There is going to be pressure as more governments recognize that this kind of resistance to working more closely with the Taliban doesn't hold up,' Webber said. 'But it will be hard to do so publicly and officially, given the humanitarian violations and problems that we see with the Taliban government.' The Biden administration defends its Afghanistan policy. Asked about the Taliban's growing diplomatic footprint, a State Department spokesperson noted that no country has said that it recognizes the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan. 'The Taliban seek recognition as Afghanistan's government,' the spokesperson said in a statement to VOA. 'The United States and the international community have been clear with the Taliban that our ability to take meaningful steps toward normalization will be based on the Taliban's own actions.' These include respecting the rights of women and minorities, fulfilling anti-terror obligations and starting a political process for inclusive governance, the spokesperson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kyrgyzstan-follows-regional-trend-takes-taliban-off-terrorist-list/7775060.html	2024-09-07T03:53:02-07:00	
China stops short of African debt relief at triennial summit	NAIROBI, KENYA/BEIJING — China stopped short of providing the debt relief sought by many African countries this week, but pledged $50.7 billion over three years in credit lines and investments. The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, or FOCAC, launched in 2000 took on an enhanced role after the 2013 inception of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to recreate the ancient Silk Road for the world's second-largest economy and biggest bilateral lender to Africa. 'China is moving back on to the front foot in terms of overseas deployment of capital in the emerging markets,' said Tellimer's Hasnain Malik, while adding it was not yet at pre-COVID levels. China has also sought to use FOCAC to counter growing competition in Africa from the United States, the European Union, Japan and others. In Beijing, diplomats and delegates from around the world mingled in the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square as leaders from more than 50 African countries and Chinese officials led by Xi gathered for a group photo. The new financial pledge is more than what Beijing promised at the last FOCAC, in 2021, but below the $60 billion of 2015 and 2018, which marked the peak of lending to Africa under the Belt and Road Initiative. During those peak years, Beijing bankrolled the construction of roads, railways and bridges. But a drying up of funds since 2019 has left Africa with stalled construction projects. The new funds will go toward 30 infrastructure projects to improve trade links, China said, without giving details. The 54-nation continent of more than 1 billion people has an annual infrastructure funding deficit estimated at $100 billion and needs transport links to make a new giant pan-African trade bloc a reality. Beijing has in recent years cut funding for such projects as it shifted focus to 'small and beautiful' projects, mainly due to its own domestic economic pressures and an increase in debt risks among African countries. Asked how the new commitments fit into China's current cautious overseas lending strategy, a foreign ministry spokesperson said there was no contradiction. 'The cooperation between China and African countries, including the specific implementation of projects, is discussed and determined by both sides,' Mao Ning, a foreign ministry spokesperson, told a news conference on Friday. China also said it will launch 30 clean-energy projects in Africa, offer cooperation on nuclear technology and tackle a power deficit that has delayed industrialization efforts. 'The outcomes of the FOCAC summit signal an impetus for green projects and especially for renewable energy installations,' said Goolam Ballim, head of research at South Africa's Standard Bank. China has become a global leader in wind and solar energy, Ballim said, controlling significant supply chains and reducing production costs. Others were skeptical. 'The issue is not so much about the size of the investments, it's been about the lack of transparency around the terms of the debt,' said Trang Nguyen, global head of emerging markets credit strategy at French bank BNP Paribas. Success was less clear-cut for countries owing a large share of their debt to China, which made no express offer of assistance to those struggling with repayments. Beijing instead urged other creditors 'to participate in the handling and restructuring of African countries' debts under the principle of joint actions and fair burden-sharing.' African leaders hoping to bask in large deals for their countries had to settle for less splashy announcements. Ethiopia and Mauritius announced new currency swap lines with China's central bank. Kenya said it made progress on talks to reopen the lending taps for key projects such as its modern railway to link the region. Still, there was optimism from some, as they welcomed China's increased commitments to Africa's security, humanitarian challenges and other nonfinancial affairs. 'After nearly 70 years of hard work, China-Africa relations are at their best in history,' Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu said on her X account.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-stops-short-of-african-debt-relief-at-triennial-summit/7775175.html	2024-09-07T03:41:02-07:00	
DR Congo leaders want more from Beijing than mineral sales	Kinshasa, DRC — Officials from the Democratic Republic of Congo will be heading home from the two-day Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing with limited success in their bid to expand economic relations beyond the mineral exports that have dominated trade, analysts say. 'The Chinese will continue to want to consolidate their position in Congo, including on minerals,' says Jean-Pierre Okenda, a Congolese consultant on mining issues. Although the DRC has a trade surplus with China, while most African countries have large deficits, almost all of it is from minerals China is buying to feed its manufacturers that are hungry for raw materials. The central African nation is the world’s largest producer of copper and cobalt, a metal used in electronics and a key material for batteries used in electric vehicles. The DRC has about 70% of the planet’s cobalt reserves. Expanding trade, investment? China’s customs authority shows trade flows to the DRC dropped 13% last year to $18.75 billion compared with 2022, the vast majority of it due to China's decreased imports from the DRC, which dropped by nearly 14% to $14.27 billion. While the drop was largely due to fluctuating prices, it underscored how deeply the DRC, one of the poorest countries in the world, relies on China. China is by far its largest single trading partner, representing nearly half of its merchandise exports and more than a quarter of its imports, according to 2022 data from the World Trade Organization. Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi was the first African leader to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of the conference. According to a statement from his office, Tshisekedi made it clear he wants to see bilateral trade expanded to other sectors 'such as agriculture, renewable energy and especially industrialization through the local processing of the DRC's mineral wealth.' China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said ahead of the forum that Xi declared his nation is ready to 'deepen cooperation in agriculture, mineral products processing, vocational training and other fields.' Many in the Congolese leadership were hoping to come away from the conference with large pledges of Chinese investment in the country. Julien Paluku, the DRC’s trade minister, on Thursday published a plea for Kinshasa to be given a large chunk of the $50 billion that Xi promised at the conference to invest in Africa over the next three years. 'We focused our arguments on DRC's pivotal role in the Belt and Road Initiative, highlighting its strategic location as a connectivity point from North to South and East to West across the African continent,' he wrote on X. Business climate Christian-Geraud Neema, a Congolese researcher on China-Africa relations and the Francophone Africa Editor of the China Global South Project, says complaints about the investment climate in the DRC are an issue. 'There is a sort of reluctance to increase projects,' he says, referring to Chinese investments in Congo. 'China will make promises, but not very committed promises.' The DRC is one of the most corrupt countries in the world, ranking 162 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s corruption perceptions index. Chinese businesses have also come under increasing pressure under Tshisekedi’s administration, with the government working to renegotiate long-standing deals with Chinese mining firms. In January, the Congolese government concluded talks on renegotiating a deal with the Chinese consortium running Sicomines, a copper-cobalt mine in Congo’s southeast. That renegotiation saw the investors behind the consortium agree to spend a massive $7 billion on developing infrastructure, such as badly needed roads and bridges, in the DRC. Another Chinese company, CMOC, which runs the largest copper-cobalt mine in the world, situated in the DRC, agreed to pay $2 billion to the Congolese state last year after a commercial dispute. Although many analysts believe those mining deals are still favorable to China, the uncertain business environment and the costs associated with rampant corruption have caused unease, say analysts. 'The operating conditions in Congo, everyone knows what they’re like,' says Okenda, explaining that Chinese firms were among the few willing to brave Congo’s tough business environment. Defense cooperation Defense is another area where some in the Congolese administration had been hoping for more cooperation in light of the country’s struggle to end the brutal conflict in eastern DRC. Tshisekedi’s office said that he discussed security concerns with Xi and that he 'praised China's influence on the lifting of the [U.N.] arms embargo on the DRC while it is unjustly attacked by Rwanda and M23 terrorists.' The M23, a Rwandan-backed rebel group, has captured swathes of territory in the region since launching a rebellion in late 2021 and displaced more than 1 million people from their homes. The DRC’s army, which critics say is weak and plagued with corruption, has struggled to fight back, losing battles and territory. But the DRC army did purchase nine high-tech Chinese CH-4 Rainbow attack drones, which it has used effectively in battle despite some being shot down. Jean-Pierre Bemba, who was the DRC’s defense minister before moving to the transport portfolio in April, said in Beijing this week that he hoped China and the DRC could go beyond their traditional areas of cooperation and work more closely on defense. Analysts are skeptical the defense relationship will go much further. Okenda, the mining consultant, said that 'China’s interest isn’t in defense,' and that Beijing's overriding concern was natural resources. Neema, the researcher, said that the prospect of a minerals-for-arms deal with Chinese firms had been a vague idea for years, but that Congolese leaders had never pursued it for fear of angering the United States, another important diplomatic partner. He said closer defense cooperation remained unlikely, unless the situation in the eastern DRC deteriorates further. 'Expediting military factors could push the Congolese government to make a deal,' he said. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in their statement on Xi’s meeting with Tshisekedi, indicated he made no reference to defense cooperation and gave only a boiler plate comment about working together for peace.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7775160.html	2024-09-07T01:57:18-07:00	
Typhoon Yagi kills at least 4 in Vietnam, 3 in China	HANOI, Vietnam — Vietnamese authorities say Typhoon Yagi has killed at least four people and injured 78 others after making landfall Saturday afternoon in the north of the country. The typhoon, described by Vietnamese meteorological officials as 'one of the most powerful typhoons in the region over the past decade,' made its way to the Southeast Asian country after it left three people dead and nearly a hundred others injured in the Chinese province of Hainan. Earlier, the government issued several alerts, and those vulnerable to floods or landslides were evacuated. Four airports were shuttered, including in the capital, Hanoi, and the city of Haiphong. Yagi landed at Vietnam's coastal provinces of Quang Ninh and Haiphong with wind speeds of up to 149 kilometers per hour (92 miles per hour), state media reported. Before landing, strong winds felled a tree, killing a woman in Hanoi, local media said Saturday. Quang Ninh is home to the UNESCO World Heritage site Ha Long Bay, known for its many towering limestone islands. Hundreds of cruises were canceled at the popular site before the typhoon landed, according to local media. Haiphong is an industrial hub, home to large factories, including electric vehicle maker VinFast and Apple supplier Pegatron. The typhoon also triggered power outages in large parts of Quang Ninh and Thai Binh provinces. Earlier, the government issued several alerts, and those vulnerable to floods or landslides were evacuated. Authorities pruned trees in Hanoi to make them less susceptible to falling, but wind and rain knocked over several along with billboards in northern cities. Local media reported that many moored boats were swept out to sea. China Yagi struck the Chinese city of Wenchang in Hainan province on Friday afternoon with wind speeds of up to about 245 kph (152 mph) near its center. Authorities said that the typhoon left three people dead and injured at least 95 others and that it affected over 1.2 million people as of noon Saturday, according to the local Global Times newspaper. Some 420,000 Hainan residents were relocated before the typhoon's landfall. Another half-a-million people in Guangdong province were evacuated before Yagi made a second landfall in the province's Xuwen County on Friday night. Meanwhile, the meteorological observatory of the city of Haikou downgraded its typhoon signal from red to orange on Saturday, as it moved further away. Before leaving Hong Kong, Yagi forced more than 270 people to seek refuge at temporary government shelters on Friday, and over 100 flights in the city were canceled due to the typhoon. Heavy rain and strong winds felled dozens of trees, and trading on the stock market, bank services and schools were halted. Philippines Yagi was still a storm when it blew out of the northwestern Philippines into the South China Sea on Wednesday, leaving at least 20 people dead and 26 others missing, mostly in landslides, and widespread flooding. More than 2.3 million people in northern and central provinces were affected. More than 82,200 people were displaced from their homes in Philippine provinces, and classes, work, inter-island ferry services and domestic flights were disrupted for days, including in the densely populated capital region, metropolitan Manila. Warm water in oceans power storms, and as they become warmer because of climate change, intense typhoons are becoming more common, especially in Southeast Asia, a U.N. climate change report warned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/super-typhoon-yagi-head-to-vietnam-2-reported-dead-in-china-s-hainan/7775139.html	2024-09-06T23:47:21-07:00	
US, UK spy chiefs urge support for Ukraine in joint essay	LONDON — The heads of the American and British foreign intelligence agencies said in a joint essay published Saturday that ongoing support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia is essential. They pledged to enhance cooperation between their agencies and address other global challenges. CIA Director William Burns and Richard Moore, head of Britain's MI6 secret intelligence service, wrote the opinion piece in the Financial Times newspaper. This marks the first time the leaders of the two agencies have co-written an essay. The spy chiefs highlighted that their partnership is a cornerstone of the 'special relationship' between the U.S. and Britain. They noted that their agencies have collaborated for 75 years and are united in opposing Russia's aggression against Ukraine. 'Staying the course in Ukraine is more vital than ever,' they wrote. Russian President Vladimir Putin, they said, 'will not succeed in extinguishing Ukraine's sovereignty and independence.' They committed to continuing support for Ukrainian intelligence. Russian forces are making slow progress in eastern Ukraine, while Ukrainian troops continue their activities in Russia's Kursk region. Kyiv has been seeking additional air defense support from the U.S. and its allies. The spy chiefs also addressed Russian intelligence operations, accusing them of sabotage and disinformation across Europe. Russia has denied those allegations. Burns and Moore said their agencies have reorganized to confront a growing challenge from China, which they described as the principal intelligence and geopolitical concern of the 21st century. They also emphasized their efforts to use intelligence to promote restraint and de-escalation in the Middle East, including working toward a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Burns is leading U.S. negotiations to resolve the conflict and address humanitarian issues. On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged military allies to provide more weaponry to strengthen Ukraine's defense as Russia continues its invasion. Speaking at Germany's Ramstein Airbase during the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting, Zelenskyy stressed the need for improved air defense systems and permission to use U.S.-supplied long-range weapons to target locations in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory. Zelenskyy highlighted the urgent need for additional air defense systems due to recent drone and missile attacks. He noted that while some support has been provided, several promised systems have not yet arrived. U.S. policy currently restricts Ukraine from using U.S. weapons to strike deep within Russia. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby confirmed that the policy remains unchanged but noted that discussions with Ukrainian officials are ongoing. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking at the UDCG meeting, reiterated support for Ukraine's immediate needs, including air defense and armor. He also emphasized the importance of Ukraine boosting its own defense production for long-term security. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, in a related development, called for continued military support for Ukraine, echoing Zelenskyy's appeal. He stressed that a strong Ukraine is crucial for ending the war and urged all allies to maintain their support during this critical period. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-us-spy-chiefs-call-for-staying-the-course-on-ukraine/7775130.html	2024-09-06T23:36:13-07:00

Cockpit audio indicates deicing system was failing before plane crashed in Brazil	sao paulo, brazil — The pilots of a Brazilian passenger plane that crashed last month, killing all 62 people aboard, reported failure in the system to remove ice from the plane, according to a preliminary report made public Friday by Brazilian authorities. Investigators were careful to avoid saying this was the cause of the accident, stressing there was more work to be done. Still, their report lent further credence to aviation experts' main hypothesis: that the lift loss had been caused by ice formation on the plane's wings and failure of its deicing system. Weather reports from the day of the accident predicted ice formation in the region where the plane went down. Audio from the cockpit's voice recorder included comments from pilots indicating ice was accumulating and the deicing system was failing, Paulo Froes, an investigator in the air force's center for the investigation and prevention of air accidents, told reporters in Brasilia. 'There are still many doubts. This accident shouldn't have happened, not in the conditions in which the plane was flying and was being operated. It had protection equipment,' Carlos Henrique Baldin, head of the center's investigation division, told reporters. Operated by the airline Voepass, the flight departed August 9 from the city of Cascavel, in Parana state, bound for Sao Paulo's Guarulhos international airport. It crashed into the backyard of a home in a gated community in the city of Vinhedo, about 80 kilometers northwest of Sao Paulo. Footage of the ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop plunging while in a flat spin horrified people across Brazil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cockpit-audio-indicates-deicing-system-was-failing-before-plane-crashed-in-brazil/7774776.html	2024-09-06T16:56:36-07:00	
Man charged with plotting shooting at NYC Jewish center on Hamas attack anniversary	new york — A Pakistani man was arrested in Canada this week for plotting a mass shooting at a Jewish center in Brooklyn on the one-year anniversary of the October 7 attack by Hamas that sparked the latest conflict in the Middle East, federal authorities announced Friday. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Muhammad Shahzeb Khan had attempted to travel from Canada, where he lives, to New York City with the 'stated goal of slaughtering, in the name of ISIS, as many Jewish people as possible.' The 20-year-old, who is also known as Shahzeb Jadoon, was apprehended on September 4 and charged with attempting to provide material support and resources to the terror group, which stands for the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham. 'As I said to Canada's minister of public safety yesterday, we are deeply grateful to our Canadian partners for their critical law enforcement actions in this matter,' Garland said in a statement. 'Jewish communities — like all communities in this country — should not have to fear that they will be targeted by a hate-fueled terrorist attack.' It was unclear if Khan has a lawyer. There was no listing for the case in the online federal court system. Edward Kim, a spokesperson for the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office, which is handling the case, declined to respond to follow-up questions, including where Khan was being held and when he would be brought to the U.S. to face the charges. He deferred to Canadian authorities, who didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment. U.S. authorities said Khan began sharing ISIS propaganda videos and expressing his support for the terror group in social media posts and communications with others on an encrypted messaging app last November. In conversations with two undercover law enforcement officers, he confirmed that he and another ISIS supporter based in the U.S. had been planning to carry out attacks against Jewish centers in America and needed to obtain AR-style assault rifles, ammunition and other materials, according to the Justice Department. Khan also provided details about how he would cross the border from Canada into the U.S. and that he was considering conducting the attacks on either the October 7 anniversary or on October 11, which is the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, authorities said. Then on August 20, he told the undercover officers that he had settled on targeting New York City because of its sizable Jewish population and sent a photograph of the specific area inside a Jewish center where he planned to carry out the attack, according to the Justice Department. Using three separate vehicles, Khan began traveling to the U.S. but was stopped around Ormstown, a town in the Canadian province of Quebec that is about 12 miles (19 kilometers) from the U.S. border, federal authorities said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-man-charged-in-alleged-new-york-city-plot-linked-to-islamic-state/7774703.html	2024-09-06T15:08:19-07:00	
US adversaries step up efforts to influence results of next election	washington — Russia, Iran and China are ramping up efforts to impact the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and down-ballot races, targeting American voters with an expanding array of sophisticated influence operations. The latest assessment from U.S. intelligence agencies, shared Friday, warns that Russia remains the preeminent threat, with Russian influence campaigns seeking to boost the chances of Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump over Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris. Russian actors, led by networks created by the Kremlin-backed media outlet RT, 'are supporting Moscow's efforts to influence voter preferences in favor of the former president and diminish the prospects of the vice president,' a senior intelligence official told reporters, briefing on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information. 'RT has built and used networks of U.S. and other Western personalities to create and disseminate Russia-friendly narratives while trying to mask the content in authentic Americans' free speech,' the official said. And RT, the official added, is just part of a growing Kremlin-directed campaign that is looking to impact not just the race for the White House, but smaller elections across the United States, with an added emphasis on swing states. 'Russia's influence apparatus is very large and it's worth highlighting that they have other entities that are active,' the official said. 'Russia is working up and down ballot races, as well as spreading divisive issues.' Tracking the Russian influence efforts has become more difficult, with U.S. officials saying that there is a greater degree of sophistication and an increased emphasis on amplifying American voices with pro-Russian views rather than seeding social media with narratives crafted in the Kremlin. 'It's not just about Russian bots and trolls and fake social media persona, although that's part of it,' White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told VOA Friday. 'We're not taking anything for granted,' he added. 'There's no question that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has every intent to try to sow discord here in the United States, to try to pump disinformation and Russian propaganda through to the American people, through what he believes were our credible sources, be they online or on television and we have to take that seriously.' The intelligence officials declined to share additional specifics about Russia's network of influence operations. But indictments Wednesday from the U.S. Justice Department have shed some light on the scope of the Kremlin's recent operations. In one case, the U.S. charged two employees of RT with using fake personas and shell companies to funnel almost $10 million to Tenet Media, a Tennessee-based company producing videos and podcasts for a stable of conservative political influencers. The aim, prosecutors said, was to produce and disseminate content promoting what Moscow viewed as pro-Russian policies. In a separate action, the U.S. seized 32 internet domains linked to an operation directed by a key aide to Putin. The aim, U.S. officials said, was to mimic legitimate U.S. news sites to spread Russian-created propaganda. RT publicly ridiculed the allegations while some of the influencers working with Tenet posted statements on the X social media platform saying they were unaware of the company's links to Moscow. As for the latest U.S. intelligence allegations, the Russian Embassy in Washington has yet to respond to VOA's request for comments, though it has described previous accusations as 'Russophobic.' Requests for comment to the Trump and Harris campaigns have also, so far, gone unanswered. But earlier U.S. intelligence assertions of Russian support for Trump have raised the ire of the Trump campaign, which has pointed to public statements by Russia's Putin supporting Trump's opponents. 'When President Trump was in the Oval Office, Russia and all of America's adversaries were deterred, because they feared how the United States would respond,' national press secretary for the Trump campaign, Karoline Leavitt, told VOA in an email this past July. U.S. intelligence officials, however, said it would be a mistake to put any faith in Putin's words, including public comments Thursday expressing support for Harris. The U.S. intelligence community 'does not take Putin's public statements as representative of Russia's covert intentions,' the senior official said. 'There are many examples over the past several years where Putin's public statements do not align with Russian actions. For example, his comments that he would not invade Ukraine.' Experts say Iran, China trying to influence results U.S. intelligence agencies Friday emphasized Russia is not alone in its effort to shape the outcome of the U.S. elections in November, warning both Tehran and Beijing are sharpening their influence campaigns with just about 60 days until America voters go to the polls. 'Iran is making a greater effort than in the past to influence this year's elections, even as its tactics and approaches are similar to prior cycles,' the intelligence official said, describing a 'multi-pronged approach to stoke internal divisions and undermine voter confidence in the U.S. democratic system. U.S. intelligence agencies previously assessed that Iran has focused part of its efforts on denigrating the Trump campaign, seeing his election as likely to worsen tensions between Tehran and Washington. U.S. officials last month also blamed Iran for a hack-and-leak operation targeting the Trump campaign, though they said that Iran-linked actors have also sought to infiltrate the Harris campaign. As for China, U.S. intelligence officials said it appears Beijing is still content to stay out of the U.S. presidential race, seeing little difference between Trump and Harris. But there are indications China is accelerating its efforts to impact other political races. U.S. intelligence 'is aware of PRC [People's Republic of China] attempts to influence U.S. down-ballot races by focusing on candidates it views as particularly threatening to core PRC security interests,' the official said. 'PRC online influence actors have also continued small scale efforts on social media to engage U.S. audiences on divisive political issues, including protests about the Israel-Gaza conflict and promote negative stories about both political parties,' the official added. 'Malicious speculations against China' The Chinese Embassy in Washington, Friday, rejected the U.S. intelligence assessment. 'China has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election, and we hope that the U.S. side will not make an issue of China in the election,' spokesperson Liu Pengyu told VOA in an email. Liu added that accusations Beijing is using social media to sway U.S. public opinion 'are full of malicious speculations against China, which China firmly opposes.' While U.S. intelligence officials have identified Russia, Iran and China, as the most prominent purveyors of disinformation, they are not alone. Officials have said countries like Cuba are also engaging in influence operations, though at a much smaller scale. And other countries are edging closer to crossing that line. 'We are seeing a number of countries considering activities that, at a minimum, test the boundaries of election influence,' according to the U.S. assessment. 'Such activities include lobbying political figures to try to curry favor with them in the event they are elected to office.'

Sergio Mendes, Grammy-winning Brazilian music legend, dies at 83	RIO DE JANEIRO — Sergio Mendes, the celebrated Brazilian musician whose 1966 hit 'Mas Que Nada' made him a global superstar and helped launch a long, Grammy-winning career, has died after months battling the effects of long COVID. He was 83. The death Thursday of the Brazilian pianist, songwriter and arranger was confirmed in a statement by his family. 'His wife and musical partner for the past 54 years, Gracinha Leporace Mendes, was by his side, as were his loving children,' the statement said Friday. 'Mendes last performed in November 2023 to sold out and wildly enthusiastic houses in Paris, London and Barcelona.' Mendes was born in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro's sister city, and studied classical music at a conservatory before joining jazz groups. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he began playing Bossa Nova as the genre was heating up in Rio's nightclub scene with Antonio Carlos Jobim, Joao Gilberto and others. In 1962, they traveled to New York for a Bossa Nova festival at Carnegie Hall. During the trip, Cannonball Adderley invited Mendes to collaborate on the album 'Cannonball Adderley and The Bossa Rio Sextet,' leading to his first American record, 'The Swinger from Rio,' after signing with Atlantic Records. Two years later, Mendes moved to California and formed Brazil '64, which evolved into Brazil '66 after he added two female vocalists. The group's debut album, produced by Herb Alpert, featured 'Mas Que Nada.' Sung entirely in Portuguese, 'Mas Que Nada' was a mid-tempo Samba number originally released in 1963 by composer Jorge Ben Sor and updated three years later by Mendes, who had been playing the song in clubs and gave it a jazzier, more hard-hitting feel. 'I put a band together called Brasil '66,' he told The Guardian in 2019. 'I'd always had instrumental groups, but when I added the two female singers — Lani Hall and Bibi Vogel — it made a different kind of sound. We recorded the song in Los Angeles, with me, the drums, bass and guitar all performing live.' Mendes' version was a worldwide hit that helped perpetuate the Brazilian music boom of the 1960s. In 2006, a modern version of the song topped U.S. charts, as performed by the Black Eyed Peas. It was included in his album 'Timeless,' produced by will.i.am and also featuring Stevie Wonder, Justin Timberlake and John Legend, among others. 'Sergio Mendes was my brother from another country,' trumpet player Alpert wrote on Facebook, along with a photo from decades ago, sitting next to Mendes at the piano. 'He was a true friend and extremely gifted musician who brought Brazilian music in all its iterations to the entire world with elegance.' Mendes' other hits were an eclectic blend ranging from covers of the Beatles' 'The Fool on the Hill' and 'With a Little Help from My Friends,' to his own Brazilian chant, 'Magalenha.' Mendes also composed the soundtrack for the film 'Pele,' featuring saxophonist Gerry Mulligan, and even produced an album recorded by the great Brazilian soccer player. Mendes won the 1992 Grammy Award for Best World Music Album for 'Brasileiro' and two Latin Grammy Awards. He also received an Oscar nomination in 2012 for Best Original Song for 'Real in Rio,' from the animated film 'Rio.' 'Brazilian soul was there,' pianist, singer, and songwriter Marcos Valle told GloboNews about Mendes' music. Valle also noted that it was Mendes who helped open doors for other Brazilian artists of his generation, including himself, to reach foreign audiences.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sergio-mendes-grammy-winning-brazilian-music-legend-dies-at-83/7774658.html	2024-09-06T14:15:13-07:00	
US to continue to enforce sanctions after aircraft linked to Venezuela’s Maduro seized, Blinken says	Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday that the United States will continue enforcing sanctions against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro following the seizure and investigation of two aircraft linked to him earlier this week in the Dominican Republic. On Friday, Blinken held discussions with Dominican President Luis Abinader during his first official visit to Santo Domingo as the top U.S. diplomat. Blinken underscored the U.S. commitment to continued collaboration with the Dominican Republic to promote inclusive economic growth, strengthen democratic institutions, uphold human rights, and improve governance and security. On Monday, U.S. authorities seized a plane used by Maduro, the equivalent to the U.S. Air Force One. The aircraft, undergoing maintenance in the Dominican Republic, was seized for being illegally purchased through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States, violating U.S. export control and sanctions laws. After the controversial reelection of Maduro on July 28, Venezuela suspended commercial flights to and from the Dominican Republic. A second plane linked to Maduro is under investigation in the Dominican Republic. This aircraft is similar to the one seized on Monday and is listed among the sanctioned assets by the U.S. Treasury as belonging to Maduro. 'With regard to the plane seizures, we've been very clear. We'll implement our sanctions, and if we find violations of them, we will act. That's what we did, and that's what we'll continue to do,' Blinken told reporters during a joint press conference with Abinader at the National Palace. The Dominican Republic will host the 2025 Summit of the Americas, where Western Hemisphere leaders will address shared challenges and policy issues facing the region. On August 16, Abinader was sworn in for a second four-year term, vowing to enhance security by increasing police training over the next four years. His administration has also implemented policies barring migrants from neighboring Haiti. The U.S. has urged the Dominican Republic to establish a path toward normalization with Haiti, as border tensions continue to escalate. Blinken said he and Abinader are committed to support the Haitians to build security and 'make sure the people are treated humanely.' Abinader told reporters his country will continue moving forward and normalizing the relationship with Haiti, such as opening air flights, but the security and safety of citizens of the Dominican Republic is still the priority. The U.S. and the Dominican Republic signed a historic Open Skies agreement on August 2. Once in effect, the agreement will expand opportunities for airlines, travel companies and people-to-people exchanges. More than 4 million U.S. citizens visit the Dominican Republic each year. The Dominican Republic is a crucial partner for the U.S. in hemispheric affairs, due to its position as the second-largest economy in the Caribbean, after Cuba, and the third-largest country by population, behind Cuba and Haiti. The U.S. is its primary trading partner. Additionally, the Dominican Republic is home to Pueblo Viejo, one of the world’s largest gold mines, and serves as a major global supplier of ferronickel, used for making stainless steel. The Dominican Republic and the United States, along with five Central American countries, are parties to the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement, known as CAFTA-DR. This agreement enhances economic opportunities by eliminating tariffs, opening markets, reducing barriers to services and promoting transparency. The U.S. Agency for International Development is investing more than $9.5 million to strengthen the Dominican Republic’s existing justice system and to reduce crime and violence. Blinken also announced on Friday 'the first phase of a supply chain investment through USAID, an initial $3 million that will help the Dominican government improve its workforce training, build industrial parks, attract high-tech industries here to the Dominican Republic.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-continue-to-enforce-sanctions-after-aircraft-linked-to-venezuela-s-maduro-seized-blinken-says/7774618.html	2024-09-06T13:40:08-07:00	
Death of persecuted journalist brings attention to Turkmenistan’s media repression	Washington — The death of a former journalist who experienced beatings and inhumane treatment in prison shows the harassment that media workers and their families endure in Turkmenistan, analysts said. Khudayberdy Allashov was 35 years old when he died in August, after what watchdogs said was eight years of persecution and physical assault by Turkmen authorities. No cause of death was listed on his death certificate. 'The beatings and torture that Allashov was subjected to and the impossibility of providing him with rehabilitation and medical care led to the death of a brave and honest man,' Farid Tuhbatullin, the head of the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights, told VOA via email. Known as one of the most closed-off countries, Turkmenistan has little space for independent reporting. Nearly all media outlets are state-owned, and ministries monitor content, according to watchdogs. Journalists such as Allashov who try to report independently — and their families — are subject to arrest and harassment, according to Reporters Without Borders, or RSF. Azatlyk, which is run by VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Turkmen Service, provides a rare source of news. When Allashov was initially detained in 2016, he had been working for Azatlyk for about three months. That reporting was critical of the government, focusing on social problems such as food shortages, salary delays and forced labor, according to an Amnesty International report published at the time of Allashov’s first arrest. 'All of this is forbidden to be mentioned in the local media,' Tuhbatullin told VOA in an email. 'The very word ‘problem’ is taboo.' He, too, had been arrested and exiled from Turkmenistan. Allashov, his mother and his wife were all arrested under charges of possessing chewing tobacco, a commonly used substance in Turkmenistan. There are no other known criminal charges of possessing chewing tobacco; the maximum punishment is typically a fine, Farruh Yusupov, director of Azatlyk, told VOA. In captivity, Allashov was tortured with electric shock. The severity of the torture during Allashov’s 74-day arrest caused him to declare he would no longer work as a journalist. But even after his release and quitting the profession, authorities continually detained and harassed him up until his death, journalists and experts who spoke with VOA said. He faced violent interrogations in 2019, 2020 and 2023. 'Authorities never left him or his family alone,' Yusupov told VOA. 'They told him they would not relent until they chased him to his grave. They were true to their promise.' The Turkmenistan Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA’s email requesting comment. Despite having ceased his reporting, Allashov was denied any medical treatment due to his status as a target of the authorities, according to RSF. He leaves a wife and two children. RSF condemned the targeted harassment of independent journalists. 'Allashov should never have lived through this nightmare,' Jeanne Cavelier of RSF said in a statement. 'Under the Turkmen dictatorship, the lives of journalists and former journalists — and the lives of their families — continue to be at risk because of their work.' Turkmenistan ranks 175 out of 180 countries on the RSF World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media environment. 'This is a country where the authorities can do anything to any citizen who expresses any form of dissent,' Gulnoza Said, a program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, told VOA. Yusupov told VOA that while there are no 'concrete numbers' available for how many journalists have been attacked by authorities, there are many well-documented instances. In 2006, reporter Ogulsapar Muradova died in prison after being denied legal representation. The United Nations recognized the Turkmen government as the responsible party in her death. In 2013, authorities detained journalist Rovshen Yazmuhamedov without cause, according to RSF. Most recently, in 2023, journalist Soltan Achilova was beaten by police officers and banned from leaving the country. Only a small number of independent journalists still operate in the country, and those who do all work under pseudonyms, said Tuhbatullin of the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights. Turkmen authorities also harass the families of journalists. Allashov’s wife and mother were arrested with him in 2016, and his mother was detained for three months and beaten. She was taken in for questioning again in 2019, when she was beaten and passed away two days later from heart failure, according to Yusupov. Authorities also harassed the mother of journalist Yazmuhamedov, banning her from leaving the country to see her other children. 'This is one of the tools authoritarian governments use to silence independent reporting,' Said told VOA. The Committee to Protect Journalists has reached out to Turkmen authorities after every government attack on a journalist. The government has never responded, Said told VOA. Yusupov told VOA that government repression 'makes the work of journalists like Allashov even more important.' 'It’s important to tell the truth in the face of an oppressive regime and provide independent reporting to society,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-of-persecuted-journalist-brings-attention-to-turkmenistan-s-media-repression/7774539.html	2024-09-06T13:02:21-07:00	
At UN, growing calls for reversal of latest Taliban edict against women	New York — A dozen U.N. Security Council ambassadors strongly condemned on Friday the Afghan Taliban’s recent 'morality law' which further erodes the rights of women and girls in that country and called for its reversal. 'On top of the existing edicts, this new directive confirms and extends wide-ranging and far-reaching restrictions on personal conduct and provides inspectors with broad powers of enforcement, thus deepening the already unacceptable restrictions on the enjoyment by all Afghans of human rights and fundamental freedoms,' said Japan’s U.N. ambassador, Yamazaki Kazuyuki. 'Day by day, Afghan women and girls lose their opportunities and hope for their future,' he added. 'This is unacceptable.' Envoys from Ecuador, France, Guyana, Malta, Mozambique, Republic of Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States joined him as he read the statement before reporters. The only Security Council members not to lend their support to the statement were Algeria, China and Russia. On August 21, the Taliban announced the ratification of a detailed 'Law on the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice,' which includes among its restrictions a prohibition on Afghan women using their voices in public and orders them to completely cover their bodies and faces outdoors. Women are also forbidden from interacting with non-Muslims, using public transport alone, and looking at men who are not their husband or blood relative. The Taliban government, which is officially not recognized by any country, has dismissed U.N.-led foreign criticism of the law as offensive. Zabihullah Mujahid, the chief Taliban spokesperson, asserted this week that 'non-Muslims should first educate themselves about Islamic laws and respect Islamic values' before expressing concerns or rejecting the law. 'We find it blasphemous to our Islamic Sharia when objections are raised without understanding it,' he said. The United States, European Union, United Nations and others have condemned the edict, the latest in a series that have eroded the rights of Afghan women and girls. 'Today, we once again urge the Taliban to swiftly reverse all the policies and practices that restrict the enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights and fundamental freedoms,' Ambassador Kazuyuki said. 'The Taliban need to listen and respond to the voices of Afghan women and girls by respecting their rights to education and for women to work, as well as the freedoms of expression and movement. It is a prerequisite for a stable, peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan.' The Japanese envoy noted that the 15-nation Security Council has repeatedly discussed the worsening human rights situation in Afghanistan since the Taliban took over in August 2021 and have 'raised a united voice on multiple occasions.' Last year, the council unanimously adopted Resolution 2681 which calls for the full, equal, meaningful and safe participation of women and girls in Afghanistan. The 12 Security Council members also called on those countries with influence over the Taliban to promote the 'urgent reversal' of the policy, which violates Afghanistan’s obligations under international human rights treaties to which it is a signatory. They also urged the Taliban to allow the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan to visit the country. The Taliban have publicly said they will not allow Richard Bennett entry. The U.N.’s agency for gender equality and women’s empowerment, U.N. Women, warned in a statement on August 28 that the new law is 'effectively erasing women from public life and granting broad enforcement powers to the morality police.' U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo warned last month that the law would only impede Afghanistan’s return to the international fold. The Security Council plans to next discuss Afghanistan in a meeting on September 18.

Venezuela says detained US sailor entered 'without any type of document'	Caracas, Venezuela — A U.S. Navy sailor held in Venezuela since late last month was arrested for entering 'without any type of document,' the South American country's attorney general said Thursday. An American official on Wednesday announced the sailor had been detained at a time of soaring tensions between Washington and Caracas in the aftermath of disputed elections in Venezuela, with the opposition party claiming it can prove were stolen. In his first comments on the matter, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab said the sailor 'entered without any type of document, without any means of subsistence for what he came to do in the country.' He said the sailor held dual U.S. and Mexican nationalities. For its part, the Pentagon said the sailor had been in Venezuela on 'personal travel.' 'This wasn't something that was authorized,' Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters. 'The U.S. Navy is looking into this. We're working with the State Department,' she said, adding that: 'Of course, we'd like to see the sailor returned home.' Venezuela was rocked by protests after President Nicolas Maduro was declared the winner of a disputed July 28 election, with 25 civilians and two soldiers killed and more than 2,400 people arrested. The opposition claims it won by a landslide, and the United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries have refused to recognize Maduro's claimed victory without seeing detailed voting results. On Monday, Washington seized Maduro's plane in the Dominican Republic and flew it to Florida, a move the Venezuelan leader condemned as 'piracy' but which Washington said was necessary due to sanctions violations. The following day, Washington denounced an arrest warrant issued for opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia and warned of further action against Maduro. The U.S. State Department has warned Americans against traveling to Venezuela for reasons including crime, unrest and wrongful detention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-says-detained-us-sailor-entered-without-any-type-of-document-/7773758.html	2024-09-06T02:19:02-07:00	
Indian opposition parties name LGBTQ+ activists to key posts	NEW DELHI — India's main opposition Congress party this week set up a new internal group to promote LGBTQ+ rights while another party has named a person from the community as its spokesperson, in the first such political recognition after many setbacks. The country's top court in 2018 decriminalized homosexuality but greatly disappointed the LGBTQ+ community last year when it declined to legalize same-sex marriage and left it to parliament to decide. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has also said the legislature is the right platform to rule on the contentious issue, and this week invited the public to share views on how best to ensure that policies for the community are inclusive and effective. Same-sex relations are mostly a taboo in the largely conservative country of 1.42 billion people, and the government told the Supreme Court last year that such marriages were not 'comparable with the Indian family unit concept of a husband, a wife and children'. Congress, whose political clout has risen after doing much better than expected in the April-June general election, this week named LGBTQ+ activist Mario da Penha as the head of its new unit for the community under its All India Professionals’ Congress division. This follows Congress's poll promise to bring in a law to legalize civil unions between same-sex couples. Da Penha said on X it was the 'only representative framework for queer people within any recognised national political party in India'. Anish Gawande, who last month became the first person from the community to become the spokesperson for a big party, the opposition Nationalist Congress Party - Sharadchandra Pawar, said da Penha's appointment was 'a major moment for queer inclusion in Indian politics.' Gawande earlier said on social media of the Nationalist Congress appointment: 'If you'd told me 10 years ago that it would be possible to be out and in Indian politics, I would have scoffed in disbelief.' The federal government says it has taken a host of measures for the community, which includes enabling same-sex couples to access government food programs as families, open joint bank accounts and choose each other as nominees, and seek medical and other care without discrimination. The Department of Social Justice and Empowerment said in a statement on Sunday it had invited inputs from the public to ensure that policies and initiatives for the community are inclusive and effective. It did not mention any law to recognize marriages between same-sex couples. A spokesperson for the ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-opposition-parties-name-lgbtq-activists-to-key-posts/7773745.html	2024-09-06T01:45:18-07:00	
In Haiti, Blinken announces $45 million in new aid, calls for renewed security mission mandate	Port-au-Prince, Haiti — During a trip to Haiti on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $45 million in new humanitarian aid for the Caribbean nation, which has been wracked by violence for years. He also called for the renewal of the United Nations mandate for the Multinational Security Support, or MSS, mission to combat the armed gangs that dominate much of the capital. 'At this critical moment, you do need more funding. We do need more personnel to sustain and carry out the objectives of this mission,' Blinken told a news conference on a rare visit to Port-au-Prince. The top U.S. diplomat said he plans to convene a ministerial meeting at the coming U.N. General Assembly to encourage greater international contributions to address Haiti's security, economic, and humanitarian needs. The MSS mandate is set to expire at the beginning of October. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is reportedly exploring the possibility of changing the mission into a traditional U.N. peacekeeping operation, a move that would ease funding, provide more equipment and enable use of military forces rather than only police officers. Blinken said that while the MSS mission itself needs to be renewed, it also needs to ensure that it is 'reliable' and 'sustainable.' 'A peacekeeping operation would be one such option. I think there are others,' he told reporters on Thursday. Blinken's visit to Port-au-Prince underscores U.S. support for Haiti as the country grapples with gang violence. On Thursday, Blinken met with Edgard Leblanc Fils from Haiti's Transitional Presidential Council. 'Both concurred on the critical need to make timely advancements on election preparations,' State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. Apart from Fils, Blinken also held talks with Prime Minister Garry Conille, MSS head Godfrey Otunge and Normil Rameau, head of the Haitian National Police. The United States and Canada are the top funders of the MSS in Haiti. The first-year estimated cost for the mission is $589 million. The U.S. has already provided $309 million — $200 million toward the MSS mission base and $109 million in financial support. Gang-related violence and drug trafficking have fueled political instability and insecurity in Haiti, leading to unbearable conditions for Haitians. At least 80% of Port-au-Prince is no longer under Haitian authorities’ control, with violence spreading to other parts of the country. In the past year, displacement in Haiti has tripled as gang violence grips the Caribbean nation. The U.N. says at least 578,000 people have been displaced because of violence, including murders, kidnappings and rapes. The situation is further exacerbated by widespread hunger, with nearly half the 11.7 million population facing acute food insecurity. After Haiti, Blinken arrived in Santo Domingo later Thursday. His visit follows the start of Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader's second term in mid-August.

Sanctions complicate Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project	Islamabad — Pakistan Federal Minister for Petroleum Musadik Malik said Wednesday that international sanctions have caused complications for the Iran-Pakistan cross-border natural gas pipeline project. Media outlets reported that Iran had warned Pakistan to complete its part of the project or face an $18 billion penalty — news that sparked a debate days later in Pakistan's lower house, the National Assembly. Responding to a question by a lawmaker on the floor of the house regarding Iran's final notice, Malik said, 'This is a deeply complicated matter and involves international sanctions.' Malik did not provide more details about sanctions, but said the government is available to discuss the complications. He rejected the penalty figure of $18 billion, saying, 'I do not know where it has come from.' In response to a query regarding reports of Iran's notice, Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said last week that Pakistan had taken note of the development. 'Pakistan and Iran have robust channels of communications including this matter. We have always said that we would like to resolve all issues [with Iran] through friendly consultations,' she said during a briefing. Petroleum Minister Malik, during an informal conversation on the gas pipeline project with local journalists in March, confirmed that Pakistan would present its case to the U.S. and seek an exemption from sanctions. 'We cannot bear American sanctions. We will present our stance to the U.S. We want to complete this project but without any sanctions,' Malik told journalists. However, Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Baloch, also in March, said that the project is progressing 'in conformity with our commitment to the Iran-Pakistan pipeline.' She emphasized that Pakistan perceives no grounds for objections from external parties as the construction activities are confined within Pakistani territory. During a briefing Tuesday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that helping Pakistan address its energy shortage was a priority for the United States. He added, however, that 'we will continue to enforce our sanctions against Iran. We also advise anyone considering a business deal with Iran to be aware of its possible ramifications.' Pakistan experts say Pakistan failed to meet its commitment to build its part of the pipeline for several reasons, including a volatile security situation in Balochistan, where the pipeline is supposed to pass. Gas pipelines are not safe in restive Balochistan and Baloch insurgents frequently target gas pipelines in the resource-rich southwestern province bordering Iran. 'In my opinion, however, Pakistan’s real worry is U.S. sanctions,' said Naveed Hussain, an editor of the Pakistan English daily newspaper The Express Tribune. 'It has declared force majeure, but Iran says Pakistan had signed the agreement while being fully cognizant of [the] U.S. sanctions risk, especially when India had withdrawn from the project for the same reason.' Khaleeq Kiani, who writes about the economy for the Pakistan English daily newspaper Dawn, told VOA, 'The U.S. stance is clear, and recently it imposed sanctions on companies providing equipment to Pakistan missile programs, that was a clear indication to Pakistan to not proceed with the pipeline project.' In April, the U.S. imposed sanctions on four entities — one based in Belarus, and the other three in China — for supplying missile‐applicable items to Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, including its long-range missile program. Despite that precedent, Pakistan's foreign minister, Mohammad Ishaq Dar, said at a May press briefing that Pakistan would not succumb to international pressure on the pipeline project. 'We will not let anyone use their veto,' Dar said, without naming the United States. Dar's remarks came weeks after Donald Lu, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian Affairs, told a U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing that importing gas from Iran would expose Pakistan to U.S. sanctions. Pakistan is facing gas shortages and relies on subsidized gas, putting pressure on the national exchequer, Petroleum Minister Malik said on the house floor Wednesday. Originally envisaged as the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline, the project was reduced to a bilateral agreement after India pulled out in 2008. Tehran and Islamabad signed a 25-year contract in 2009 to export gas from Iran through a 2,400-kilometer gas pipeline to be built jointly by both countries. While Iran has completed its pipeline section, Pakistan keeps dragging its feet on the project. In 2019, the two countries revised their contract, and Islamabad committed to building its portion of the pipeline by 2024.

Excessive rain, changing patterns, dozens of deaths mark Pakistan monsoon	ISLAMABAD — As monsoon season nears its end in Pakistan, higher than average rainfall and rain-related accidents leave behind a trail of deaths, nearly half of them children. Monsoon season runs from July to September in Pakistan. Since the beginning of July, the country has counted at least 337 rain-related deaths, according to the National Disaster Management Authority. One-hundred-seventy children are among the dead. Thousands also have been displaced as floodwaters inundated villages. Pakistan’s meteorological department recorded rains 60% higher than average in the first two months of the monsoon season. August saw 137% more rain than the month’s average after slightly below average rainfall in July. Weather officials expect mostly normal rainfall in September. The data shows that rainfall patterns in Pakistan are changing. 'The shift that we are seeing is that monsoon used to go to the upper areas, that trend is lessening a bit,' Sahibzad Khan, director general of PMD, told VOA. 'Now it’s shifting more to the south.' Rain that was twice as heavy as normal battered Pakistan’s two southern provinces, Sindh and Balochistan, over the last two months, while the northern, mountainous regions saw average-to-below-average rain, according to the national weather agency. Just in Sindh, 72,000 children saw their education disrupted by the severe weather, Save the Children said in a statement Wednesday. Despite heavy rains, flooding, and displacement in parts of the country, experts say Pakistan escaped extensive damage this monsoon season, partly because of lessons learned from the devastating floods in 2022. 'We are working more on anticipatory approaches. Looking at past patterns, we are predicting the scale and velocity of upcoming floods,' said Shafqat Munir Ahmad, deputy executive director of the Resilience Development Program and Policy Outreach at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute in Islamabad. In 2022, historic rains submerged nearly a third of the country at one time, affecting 33 million Pakistanis and causing nearly $30 billion in damage. Since then, Pakistan incorporated technology to plan scenarios and issue early severe weather warnings to communities, said Ahmad, adding that improved coordination and response time also reduced damage. This year, Pakistan also used lightning detectors that China provided last year. 'China has collaborated with us. With their help, we have 26 lightning detector stations that tell us about the type and severity of lightning and thunder,' said weather chief Khan. Pakistan still lacks sufficient long-term planning, however, to tackle the impact of climate change, experts say. The Germany-based Global Climate Risk Index ranks Pakistan the 8th most vulnerable country. A web app created at the University of Maryland that predicts what a city’s weather will be like in 60 years shows summers and winters in several Pakistani cities will be much warmer than they are at present. While projects to mitigate climate change may attract funding, Ahmad said efforts to help vulnerable communities adapt to changing climate lack necessary financial support in Pakistan. Several communities across the South Asian nation are still awaiting funds to rebuild homes devastated by the 2022 weather calamity. Just last July, the Asian Development Bank approved a $400 million loan to fund the reconstruction of homes and infrastructure in Sindh. At a donor conference in January 2023, donors pledged more than $9 billion to help Pakistan build back after the 2022 floods. Still, the country has barely tapped the funds that were largely designated as project loans. As authorities and charitable organizations rush to provide food, water and shelter to communities displaced by this year’s rains and floods, Save the Children urged increased support to prevent the current impact of the floods from becoming long-term problems. 'Governments must tackle the underlying causes of these climate driven disasters, including channeling funding and support to children and their families in Pakistan to adapt, recover and rebuild their lives,' the statement said, quoting country director Khuram Gondal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/excessive-rain-changing-patterns-dozens-of-deaths-mark-pakistan-monsoon/7772643.html	2024-09-05T08:33:00-07:00
