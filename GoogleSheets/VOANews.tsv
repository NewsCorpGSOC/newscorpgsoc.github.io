Senate review of Supreme Court ethics finds more luxury trips	WASHINGTON — A nearly two-year investigation by Democratic senators of Supreme Court ethics details more luxury travel by Justice Clarence Thomas and urges Congress to establish a way to enforce a new code of conduct. Any movement on the issue appears unlikely as Republicans prepare to take control of the Senate in January, underscoring the hurdles in imposing restrictions on a separate branch of government even as public confidence in the court has fallen to record lows. The 93-page report released Saturday by the Democratic majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee found additional travel taken in 2021 by Thomas but not reported on his annual financial disclosure form: a private jet flight to New York's Adirondacks in July and jet and yacht trip to New York City sponsored by billionaire Harlan Crow in October, one of more than two dozen times detailed in the report that Thomas took luxury travel and gifts from wealthy benefactors. The court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023, but it leaves compliance to each of the nine justices. 'The highest court in the land can't have the lowest ethical standards,' the committee chairman, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, said in a statement. He has long called for an enforceable code of ethics. Republicans protested the subpoenas authorized for Crow and others as part of the investigation. No Republicans signed on to the final report, and no formal report from them was expected. Attorney Mark Paoletta, a longtime friend of Thomas who has been tapped for the incoming Trump administration, said the report was aimed at conservatives whose rulings Democrats disagreed with. 'This entire investigation was never about 'ethics' but about trying to undermine the Supreme Court,' Paoletta said in a statement posted on X. The court did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Thomas has said he was not required to disclose the trips that he and his wife, Ginni, took with Crow because the big donor is a close friend of the family and disclosure of that type of travel was not previously required. The new ethics code does explicitly require it, and Thomas has since reported some earlier travel. Crow has maintained that he has never spoken with his friend about pending matters before the court. The report traces back to Justice Antonin Scalia, saying he 'established the practice' of accepting undisclosed gifts and hundreds of trips over his decades on the bench. The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and retired Justice Stephen Breyer also took subsided trips but disclosed them on their annual forms, it said. The investigation found that Thomas has accepted gifts and travel from wealthy benefactors worth more than $4.75 million by some estimates since his 1991 confirmation and failed to disclose much of it. 'The number, value, and extravagance of the gifts accepted by Justice Thomas have no comparison in modern American history,' according to the report. It also detailed a 2008 luxury trip to Alaska taken by Justice Samuel Alito. He has said he was exempted from disclosing the trip under previous ethical rules. Alito also declined calls to withdraw from cases involving Donald Trump or the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol after flags associated with the riot were seen flying at two of Alito's homes. Alito said the flags were raised by his wife. Thomas has ignored calls to step aside from cases involving Trump, too. Ginni Thomas supported Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election that the Republican lost to Democrat Joe Biden. The report also pointed to scrutiny of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who, aided by her staff, has advanced sales of her books through college visits over the past decade. Justices have also heard cases involving their book publishers or involving companies in which justices owned stock. Biden has been the most prominent Democrat calling for a binding code of conduct. Justice Elena Kagan has publicly backed adopting an enforcement mechanism, though some ethics experts have said it could be legally tricky. Justice Neil Gorsuch recently cited the code when he recused himself from an environmental case. He had been facing calls to step aside because the outcome could stand to benefit a Colorado billionaire whom Gorsuch represented before becoming a judge. The report also calls for changes in the Judicial Conference, the federal courts' oversight body led by Chief Justice John Roberts, and further investigation by Congress.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-review-of-supreme-court-ethics-finds-more-luxury-trips-/7909809.html	2024-12-21T13:01:50-08:00	
Children among at least 13 killed in stampedes at charity events in Nigeria	ABUJA, NIGERIA — At least 13 people, including four children, were killed in two separate stampedes in Nigeria as large crowds gathered to collect food and clothing items distributed at annual Christmas events, the police said Saturday. The two accidents came days after another such stampede in Africa's most populous country, amid a growing trend by local organizations, churches and individuals to organize charity events ahead of Christmas, as the country struggles with the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. Ten people were killed in the first stampede in the early hours at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Maitama, an upmarket part of the capital, Abuja, police spokesman Josephine Adeh said in a statement, adding that more than 1,000 people have been evacuated from the church. There was a crowd surge at one of the church gates, as dozens tried to enter the premises around 4 a.m. local time, hours before the gift items were to be shared, witnesses said. Some in the crowd had been waiting since the previous night. 'The way they were rushing to enter, some people were falling and some of them were old,' Loveth Inyang, a witness, said. Inyang said he managed to rescue one baby as his mother struggled in the surge. Crush starts before event begins Three people died in a similar crush later in the southeastern Anambra state's Okija town at a charity event organized by a philanthropist, the state police said. 'The event had not even started when the rush began,' police spokesman Tochukwu Ikenga said. There could be more deaths recorded as officers investigate the incident, he said. Viral footage that appeared to be from the Abuja scene showed lifeless bodies lying on the ground as people shouted for help. Some of the injured have been treated and discharged while others continue to receive medical care, police said. The church canceled the charity event with bags of rice and clothing items still arranged within the premises. The church held a marriage ceremony after the crowd was evacuated, but the agony and sadness remained palpable even as families and friends gathered for wedding pictures. Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu expressed his sympathy for the victims' families and asked states and relevant authorities to enforce strict crowd control measures. Disasters lead to change The recent stampedes in Nigeria have raised questions about safety measures in such events. Several children were killed on Wednesday when a local foundation organized a well-attended fair to distribute gift items and food to kids in southwestern Oyo state. After the latest disaster, the police in Abuja announced that permission must be obtained before such charity events are organized. The current economic hardship under President Tinubu, who promised 'renewed hope' when he was sworn into office in May 2023, is blamed on surging inflation, which is at a 28-year high, and the government's economic policies that have pushed the local currency to a record low against the dollar. Frustration over the cost-of-living crisis has led to mass protests in recent months. In August, at least 20 people were shot to death and hundreds of others were arrested at protests demanding better opportunities and jobs for young people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/children-among-at-least-13-killed-in-stampedes-at-nigeria-christmas-charity-events-/7909801.html	2024-12-21T12:20:05-08:00

37 people die in crash between bus, truck in Brazil	SAO PAULO — A crash between a passenger bus and a truck early Saturday killed 37 people on a highway in Minas Gerais, a state in southeastern Brazil, officials said. The Minas Gerais fire department, which responded to the scene, said 13 others were taken to hospitals near the city of Teofilo Otoni. The bus had reportedly departed from Sao Paulo and was carrying 45 passengers. Authorities said Saturday afternoon that all victims had been removed from the site and an investigation would determine the cause of the accident. Witnesses told rescue teams that the bus blew a tire, causing the driver to lose control and collide with the truck. Others said that a granite block hit the bus, the fire department added. A car with three passengers also collided with the bus, but all three survived. Governor Romeu Zema wrote on social media platform X that he ordered 'full mobilization' of the Minas Gerais government to assist the victims. 'We are working to ensure that families of the victims are supported to face this tragedy in the most humane way possible, especially as it comes just before Christmas,' Zema said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/people-die-in-crash-between-bus-truck-in-brazil/7909774.html	2024-12-21T10:48:49-08:00	
Trump wants US to dominate AI as industry weighs benefits, risks	Generative artificial intelligence companies are racing to build on the popularity of programs like ChatGPT, but AI regulation has not kept pace with the technology.

Lack of shelter, food increases Gazans’ misery as winter sets in	GENEVA — As temperatures drop and seasonal rains flood fragile settlements in the Gaza Strip this winter, aid agencies fear many Palestinians will die while others become critically ill and some permanently disabled. 'It is very cold. It has been raining overnight. … We are anticipating very heavy rain here today, and this is while 1.9 million people are displaced,' Louise Wateridge, senior emergency officer for UNRWA — the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees — told journalists in Geneva Friday from the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. Nuseirat, one of Gaza’s eight historical refugee camps established in 1948, came under Israeli fire last week, killing more than 30 Palestinians and injuring dozens of others. 'Palestinians do not have access to adequate shelter; 69% of buildings have been damaged or destroyed across the Gaza Strip,' Wateridge said. Although many people will lack shelter capable of protecting them from the winter cold and rain, she said, 'we have had to prioritize food over shelter entering the Gaza Strip.' Wateridge explained that essential relief supplies have been sitting in trucks 'outside the Gaza Strip waiting to enter for the past six months.' The UNRWA official also observed that the widespread damage and destruction of buildings throughout Gaza has left Palestinian families unprotected from Israel’s relentless airstrikes. 'We are hearing from doctors that children are getting injuries from shrapnel from strikes over a kilometer away from where the strikes hit, because there is nothing but tents and fabrics to protect them from any bombs and any bullets,' she said. Wateridge said that some of the most wrenching scenes she has witnessed 'are seeing toddlers in hospitals missing limbs after strikes … and seeing children searching through piles of trash for scraps of food or materials for shelter.' Rosalia Bollen, UNICEF’s communication specialist in Gaza, who has spent the past three months in the Palestinian enclave, warns that hunger, malnutrition and dire living conditions are putting the lives of children at risk. Speaking on a video link from Amman, Jordan, on Friday, Bollen said that more than 96% of women and children in Gaza cannot meet their basic nutritional needs. 'Most are surviving on rations of flour, pasta, lentils, can food at best … a diet that is slowly compromising their health,' she said, noting that healthier food is not available in Gaza because only 65 truckloads of aid daily were entering Gaza, compared with 500 trucks that entered daily before the war. 'Virtually all children under 2 in Gaza consume from two food groups at best. This is very, very dangerous because young children who grow rapidly need access to nutritious food … otherwise, they are at risk of wasting or stunting. 'The consequences of that are lifelong. Children do not recover from that later on,' she said, emphasizing the suffering is physical and psychological. 'Children are sick, tired and traumatized.' She said conditions for children are particularly bad in northern Gaza, which has been under 'a near total siege for 75 days now.' 'Gaza must be one of the most heartbreaking places for us humanitarians to work in, because every small effort we make to save a child’s life is undone by devastation,' she said. 'For over 14 months, children have been at the sharp edge of this nightmare, with more than 14,500 children reportedly killed and thousands more injured.' The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, UNICEF, UNRWA and other U.N. agencies carried out an assessment Thursday at four sites hosting some 1,600 families who had arrived from North Gaza since the Israeli siege began nearly 11 weeks ago. 'Families are packed into tents or damaged buildings with no electricity,' OCHA said. 'People sheltering at these sites lack the most basic items, including shoes, clothing, mattresses, blankets and kitchen supplies. They also reported a shortage of medicines, with diseases spreading rapidly due to the cold.' UNICEF’s Bollen noted that the onset of winter in Gaza has inflicted additional pain and suffering upon children badly in need of aid that could alleviate their misery. 'Children are cold. They are wet. They are barefoot. I see many children who still wear summer clothes, and with cooking gas gone, there also are lots of children I see scavenging through piles of garbage looking for plastic they can burn. Diseases are meanwhile ravaging their little bodies, while hospitals are destitute and constantly attacked,' she said. 'As many of us head into the celebrations of Christmas and New Year surrounded by so much, let us take a moment to think of these children who have so little and yet continue to lose more day by day. 'Every day without action steals another day from Gaza’s children. ... Gaza’s children cannot wait,' Bollen said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lack-of-shelter-food-increases-gazans-misery-as-winter-sets-in/7909663.html	2024-12-21T08:06:57-08:00	
France adds first nuclear reactor in 25 years to grid	PARIS — France connected the Flamanville 3 nuclear reactor to its grid on Saturday morning, state-run operator EDF said, in the first addition to the country's nuclear power network in 25 years. The reactor, which began operating in September ahead of the grid connection, is going online 12 years later than originally planned and at a cost of about $13 billion — four times the original budget. 'EDF teams have achieved the first connection of the Flamanville EPR to the national grid at 11:48 a.m. The reactor is now generating electricity,' EDF said in a statement. The Flamanville 3 European Pressurized Reactor is France's largest at 1.6 gigawatts and one of the world's biggest, along with China's 1.75 GW Taishan reactor, which is based on a similar design, and Finland's Olkiluoto. It is the first to be connected to the grid since COVAX 2 in 1999 but is being brought into service at a time of sluggish consumption, with France exporting a record amount of electricity this year. EDF is planning to build six new reactors to fulfill a 2022 pledge made by President Emmanuel Macron as part of the country's energy transition plans, although questions remain around the funding and timeline of the new projects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-adds-first-nuclear-reactor-in-25-years-to-grid/7909633.html	2024-12-21T07:33:40-08:00	
Syria's new rulers name foreign minister in push for international relations	Syria's new rulers have appointed a foreign minister, the official Syrian news agency, or SANA, said on Saturday, as they seek to build international relations two weeks after Bashar al-Assad was ousted. The ruling General Command named Asaad Hassan al-Shibani as foreign minister, SANA said. A source in the new administration told Reuters that this step 'comes in response to the aspirations of the Syrian people to establish international relations that bring peace and stability.' No details were immediately available about Shibani. Syria's de facto ruler, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has actively engaged with foreign delegations since assuming power, including hosting the U.N.'s Syria envoy and senior U.S. diplomats. Sharaa has signaled a willingness to engage diplomatically with international envoys, saying his primary focus is on reconstruction and achieving economic development. He has said he is not interested in engaging in any new conflicts. The United States, other Western powers and many Syrians were glad to see rebel groups led by Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, topple Assad, but it is not clear whether the Islamist group will impose strict Islamic rule or show flexibility and move toward democracy. HTS was part of al-Qaida until Sharaa broke ties with it in 2016. Syrian rebels seized control of Damascus on Dec. 8, forcing Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war and ending his family's decadeslong rule. Forces under the command of Sharaa — better known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani — installed a three-month caretaker government that had been ruling a rebel enclave in Syria's northwestern province of Idlib. Washington designated Sharaa a terrorist in 2013, saying al-Qaida in Iraq had tasked him with overthrowing Assad's rule and establishing Islamic sharia law in Syria. U.S. officials said Friday that Washington would remove a $10 million bounty on his head. The war killed hundreds of thousands of people, caused one of the biggest refugee crises of modern times and left cities bombed to rubble and the economy hollowed out by global sanctions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-new-rulers-name-foreign-minister-in-push-for-international-relations/7909532.html	2024-12-21T04:56:27-08:00	
Pakistan dismisses US official's warning over missile program	KARACHI, PAKISTAN — Pakistan's Foreign Ministry on Saturday dismissed as unfounded and 'devoid of rationality' assertions by a senior U.S. official that its missile program could eventually pose a threat to the United States. Earlier this week, Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer said Pakistan's development of long-range ballistic missiles made it an 'emerging threat.' Finer's comments, which came a day after Washington announced a new round of sanctions related to the ballistic missile program, underscored the deterioration in once-close ties between Washington and Islamabad since the 2021 U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Addressing Finer's remarks, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said the perception of an alleged threat was 'unfortunate.' 'These allegations are unfounded, devoid of rationality and sense of history,' the ministry said in a statement. The ministry said that its strategic capabilities were solely for defending its sovereignty and maintaining regional stability, and that they should not be perceived as a threat to any other country. It also highlighted Pakistan's long history of cooperation with the U.S., particularly in counterterrorism efforts, and reiterated its commitment to engaging constructively on all issues, including regional security and stability. Relations between the United States and Pakistan have seen significant ups and downs. The countries collaborated during the Cold War and in the fight against al-Qaida after 9/11. Ties have been strained, however, due to coups in the South Asian country by Pakistan's military, support for the Taliban's 1996-2001 rule in Afghanistan, and over the nuclear weapons program.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-dismisses-us-official-s-warning-over-missile-program/7909526.html	2024-12-21T04:39:17-08:00	
Pakistan Taliban claim raid that killed 16 soldiers	ISLAMABAD — The Pakistani Taliban claimed a brazen overnight raid on an army outpost near the border with Afghanistan on Saturday, which intelligence officials said killed 16 soldiers and critically wounded five more. The siege started after midnight and lasted about two hours as around 30 militants pummeled the mountainous outpost from three sides, one senior intelligence official told AFP on condition of anonymity. 'Sixteen soldiers were martyred and five were critically injured in the assault,' he said. 'The militants set fire to the wireless communication equipment, documents and other items present at the checkpoint.' A second intelligence official also anonymously confirmed the toll of dead and wounded in the attack in the Makeen area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 40 kilometers from the Afghan border. Pakistan's domestic chapter of the Taliban claimed the attack in a statement, saying it was staged 'in retaliation for the martyrdom of our senior commanders.' The group claimed to have seized a hoard of military gear including machine guns and a night vision device. Pakistan's military has not yet issued a statement on the incident. Pakistan has been battling a resurgence of militant violence in its western border regions since the Taliban's 2021 return to power in Afghanistan. Last year saw casualties hit a six-year high, with more than 1,500 civilians, security forces and militants killed, according to the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies. Saturday's attack was 'the most dangerous assault in this region this year' according to the first intelligence official. Islamabad accuses Kabul's rulers of failing to root out militants staging attacks on Pakistan from over the border. The Pakistani Taliban -- known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP -- share a common ideology with their Afghan counterparts who surged back to power three years ago. Kabul's new rulers have pledged to evict foreign militant groups from Afghan soil. But a U.N. Security Council report in July estimated up to 6,500 TTP fighters are based there -- and said 'the Taliban do not conceive of TTP as a terrorist group.' The report said the Afghan Taliban show 'ad hoc support to, and tolerance of, TTP operations, including the supplying of weapons and permission for training.' The spike in attacks has soured Islamabad-Kabul relations. Security was cited as one reason for Pakistan's campaign last year to evict hundreds of thousands of undocumented Afghan migrants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-taliban-claim-raid-that-killed-16-soldiers/7909469.html	2024-12-21T02:02:20-08:00	
Germans mourn attack on Christmas market with no answers about why	MAGDEBURG, GERMANY — Germans on Saturday mourned a violent attack and their shaken sense of security after a Saudi doctor intentionally drove a black BMW into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers, killing at least two people, including a small child, and injuring at least 60 others. Authorities arrested a 50-year-old man at the site of the attack Friday evening and took him into custody for questioning. He has lived in Germany for nearly two decades, practicing medicine, officials said. Several German media outlets identified the man as Taleb A., withholding his last name in line with privacy laws, and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. There were still no answers Saturday as to what caused him to drive into a crowd in the eastern German city of Magdeburg. Describing himself as a former Muslim, he shared dozens of tweets and retweets daily focusing on anti-Islam themes, criticizing the religion and congratulating Muslims who left the faith. He also accused German authorities of failing to do enough to combat what he said was the 'Islamism of Europe.' Some described him as an activist who helped Saudi women flee their homeland. He has also voiced support for the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Recently, he seemed focused on his theory that German authorities have been targeting Saudi asylum seekers. Prominent German terrorism expert Peter Neumann said he had yet to come across a suspect in an act of mass violence with that profile. 'After 25 years in this 'business' you think nothing could surprise you anymore. But a 50-year-old Saudi ex-Muslim who lives in East Germany, loves the AfD and wants to punish Germany for its tolerance towards Islamists — that really wasn't on my radar,' Neumann, the director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence at King's College London, wrote on X. The violence shocked Germany and the city, bringing its mayor to the verge of tears and marring a festive event that's part of a centuries-old German tradition. It prompted several other German towns to cancel their weekend Christmas markets as a precaution and out of solidarity with Magdeburg's loss. Berlin, where a truck attack on a Christmas market in 2016 killed 12 people, kept its markets open but has increased its police presence at them. Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Interior Minister Nancy Faeser were due to travel to Magdeburg on Saturday, and a memorial service is to take place in the city cathedral in the evening. 'My thoughts are with the victims and their relatives,' Scholz wrote on X. 'We stand beside them and beside the people of Magdeburg.' Magdeburg is a city of about 240,000 people, west of Berlin, that serves as Saxony-Anhalt's capital. Friday's attack came eight years after an Islamic extremist drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring many others. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy. Verified bystander footage distributed by the German news agency dpa showed the suspect's arrest at a tram stop in the middle of the road. A nearby police officer pointing a handgun at the man shouted at him as he lay prone, his head arched up slightly. Other officers swarmed around the suspect and took him into custody. The two people confirmed dead were an adult and a toddler, but officials said additional deaths couldn't be ruled out because 15 people had been seriously injured. 'As things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know there is no further danger to the city,' Saxony-Anhalt's governor, Reiner Haseloff, told reporters. 'Every human life that has fallen victim to this attack is a terrible tragedy and one human life too many.' Authorities identified the suspect as a 50-year-old Saudi doctor who moved to Germany in 2006 and who had been practicing medicine in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers south of Magdeburg. Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry condemned the attack on X but did not mention the suspect's connection to the kingdom. Christmas markets are a German holiday tradition cherished since the Middle Ages, now successfully exported to much of the Western world. Hours after Friday's tragedy, the wail of sirens clashed with the market's festive ornaments, stars and leafy garlands. Magdeburg resident Dorin Steffen told dpa that she was at a concert in a nearby church when she heard the sirens. The cacophony was so loud 'you had to assume that something terrible had happened,' she said, calling it 'a dark day' for the city. The attack reverberated far beyond Magdeburg, with Haseloff calling it a catastrophe for the city, state and country. He said flags would be lowered to half-staff in Saxony-Anhalt and that the federal government planned to do the same. 'It is really one of the worst things one can imagine, particularly in connection with what a Christmas market should bring,' the governor said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germans-mourn-attack-on-christmas-market-with-no-answers-about-why/7909461.html	2024-12-21T01:04:34-08:00	
Pakistan military court jails 25 over 2023 attacks	KARACHI, PAKISTAN — Twenty-five civilians were sentenced by a Pakistani military court to periods of two to 10 years of 'rigorous imprisonment' in connection with attacks on military facilities in 2023, the armed forces' media wing said on Saturday. The ruling underscores concerns among supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan that military courts are going to play a bigger role in cases involving the 72-year-old, who is facing multiple charges including allegedly inciting attacks against the armed forces. Thousands of Khan supporters stormed military installations and torched a general's house on May 9, 2023, to protest against the former premier's arrest by paramilitary soldiers. At least eight people were killed in the violence. The military's Inter-Services Public Relations office said the sentences handed down on Saturday were an 'important milestone in dispensation of justice to the nation.' 'It is also a stark reminder to all those who are exploited by the vested interests and fall prey to their political propaganda and intoxicating lies, to never take law in own hands,' it added in a statement. Others charged over the violence were being tried in antiterrorism courts, but justice would only be fully served 'once the mastermind and planners ... are punished as per the Constitution and laws of the land,' the military said. The ruling comes days after Khan was indicted by an antiterrorism court on charges of inciting attacks against the military. An army general who served under him as his spy chief, Faiz Hamid, is facing a military investigation on the same charges. Pakistan's Supreme Court last week allowed military courts to announce verdicts in concluded trials of nearly 85 supporters of Khan on charges of attacking army installations, however it made such verdicts conditional on the outcome of appeals against the jurisdiction of military courts over civilians. The court last year provisionally allowed military courts to try civilians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7909459.html	2024-12-21T00:44:50-08:00	
Missile fired from Yemen hits Israel, wounding 16	TEL AVIV, ISRAEL — A projectile fired from Yemen struck Israel's commercial hub of Tel Aviv early Saturday, wounding 16 people, the military and emergency service providers said, the second such attack within days. Israel's military said it had failed to intercept the projectile, which struck a district of Tel Aviv municipality, forcing many residents to leave their homes. Yemen's Houthi rebels later claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it used a ballistic missile and was directed at 'a military target of the Israeli enemy.' The Iranian-backed Houthis have repeatedly launched missile attacks against Israel in solidarity with Palestinians since the war in Gaza began more than a year ago, most of which have been intercepted. In return, Israel has struck multiple targets in Yemen, including ports and energy facilities in areas controlled by the Houthis. 'Following the sirens that sounded a short while ago in central Israel, one projectile launched from Yemen was identified and unsuccessful interception attempts were made,' the Israeli military said on its Telegram channel. Magen David Adom, Israel's emergency medical service, said 16 people were lightly injured. 'I was at home and heard a loud explosion. I immediately went to the scene and saw significant blast damage to nearby buildings,' medic Yosef Kourdi was quoted as saying in a statement released by MDA. 'MDA teams provided medical care to 16 individuals who were mildly injured by glass shards from shattered windows in nearby buildings due to the impact of the strike,' the statement said. Ido Barnea, an IT manager whose apartment was damaged, told AFP a missile alert had sounded just before 4 a.m. 'Then there was a big ball of fire in the sky,' he said. 'I didn't even manage to get up and get dressed to go out.' 'Very lucky' An AFP photographer reported that many residents in the vicinity of the strike had to leave their homes, carrying only the essentials. AFP photographs showed debris from the bedroom of a house in the area hit by the projectile, as police swiftly cordoned off the neighborhood. Noa Mosseri, whose apartment was also damaged, told AFP she too heard the missile alert. 'We were very lucky because we didn't have time to get to a safe place. Within seconds there was a boom. We managed to get out and so we were not hurt,' she said. The Houthi rebels say they are acting in support of Palestinians and pledged in their statement on Saturday to continue operations 'until the aggression stops and the siege on the Gaza Strip is lifted.' The strike came just two days after the rebels fired a missile at Israel that damaged a school. Israel said that missile had been intercepted and the school was hit by its falling debris. Israel later struck several Houthi sites in Yemen, including in Sanaa -- the first such strike in the rebel-held capital. 'The Israeli enemy targeted ports in Hodeida and power stations in Sanaa, and the Israeli aggression resulted in the martyrdom of nine civilian martyrs,' rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said in a lengthy speech broadcast by the rebels' Al-Masira TV. Soon after retaliating for Thursday's attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the rebels of severe repercussions. 'After Hamas, Hezbollah, and the [Bashar al-]Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis are almost the last remaining arm of Iran's axis of evil,' he said in a statement. 'The Houthis are learning and will learn the hard way, that those who strike Israel will pay a very heavy price for it.' On Dec. 9, a drone claimed by the Houthis exploded on the top floor of a residential building in the central Israel city of Yavne, causing no casualties. And in July, a Houthi drone attack in Tel Aviv killed an Israeli civilian, prompting retaliatory strikes on the port of Hodeidah. The Houthis have also regularly targeted shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, leading to retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets by U.S. and sometimes British forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/missile-fired-from-yemen-hits-israel-wounding-16/7909457.html	2024-12-21T00:33:09-08:00

VOA Kurdish: Torture and repression in Iraqi and Syrian prisons	Abu Ghraib, Saydnaya and other prisons in Iraq and Syria are symbols of the brutal regimes of the Baathist parties that ruled both countries. Under the dictatorial rule of the Tikrit family in Iraq and the Assad family in Syria, prisons became places of torture and extermination, where detainees were often subjected to horrific abuse regardless of their guilt. Former prisoners such as Aras Taleb Rashid, who was arrested for opposing Saddam Hussein, recall the similar methods of torture used in Iraqi and Syrian prisons.

Trump adds EU to list of trade partners he threatens with tariffs	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump on Friday added the 27 countries that make up the European Union to the list of trade partners he's threatening with tariffs — unless the group takes steps to import more U.S. goods. 'I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas,' Trump posted shortly after 1 a.m. on social media. 'Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!' In 2023, the United States' trade imbalance with the EU on goods was $209 billion, according to the Census Bureau. There were $576 billion in imports from Europe and $367 billion in exports from the United States. Trump's transition team did not respond to questions seeking greater clarity on the message, which for all its bluntness was unclear on next steps. When Trump threatened Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs in November, the leaders of both countries spoke with him to try to resolve any tensions. But the European Union lacks a single figure who can make the purchase commitments of natural gas and oil on behalf of its 27 member states that Trump is seeking. EU Commission spokesperson Olof Gill said in reaction to Trump's post that 'we are ready to discuss with President-elect Trump how we can further strengthen an already strong relationship, including by discussing our common interests in the energy sector.' Gill noted that the EU is already 'committed to phasing out energy imports from Russia and diversifying our sources of supply. We're not going to go into any details about what that might entail in the future, given that the new administration isn't even in place yet.' Scott Lincicome, a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it was difficult to parse what Trump was trying to say relative to European trade, given that natural gas exports to the continent are already up after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 'What we really need to chalk all of this up to is Trump laying the groundwork for future negotiations,' Lincicome said. 'This is for better or worse a lot of what we're going to see for the next four years.' While there is a $209 billion trade imbalance, a more complicated relationship lies beneath those numbers. A company such as German automaker BMW can import parts needed to assemble vehicles at its factory in South Carolina, such that the trade totals also reflect the flow of goods within European companies that employ U.S. workers. More than half of the liquified natural gas imported by the EU and the United Kingdom in 2023 came from the United States, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The volume of LNG going to the EU and UK has tripled since 2021. On Tuesday, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm issued a statement based on a new study saying that unfettered exports of LNG could increase prices domestically and increase carbon emissions. Trump ran for president on the idea that increased oil and natural gas production would reduce costs for U.S. voters who were left frustrated by a 2022 inflationary spike that still lingers. Trump's demands on Europe to buy more oil and natural gas were not especially new. He also made them during his initial term as president and in 2018 reached a deal with Jean-Claude Juncker, then-president of the European Commission, to sell more LNG to Europe. The problem with that agreement, as noted by the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, is that the U.S. 'cannot force companies to send products to a specific region or country' and the EU cannot force its members to buy American fossil fuels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-adds-eu-to-list-of-trade-partners-he-threatens-with-tariffs-/7909390.html	2024-12-21T00:12:02-08:00	
Amid pope's big Holy Year, overtourism aggravates housing crisis	When Pope Francis left the Vatican earlier this month for his traditional Christmastime outing downtown, he acknowledged what many Romans have been complaining about for months: That his big plans for a Holy Year had turned their city into a giant construction pit, with traffic-clogging roadworks tearing up major thoroughfares, scaffolding covering prized monuments and short-term rentals gobbling up apartment blocks. Francis urged Romans to pray for their mayor — 'He has a lot to do' — but to nevertheless welcome the upcoming Jubilee as a time of spiritual repair and renewal. 'These worksites are fine, but beware: Don't forget the worksites of the soul!' Francis said. When he formally opens the Holy Year next week, Francis will launch a dizzying 12-month calendar of events that include special Jubilee Masses for the faithful from all walks of life: artists, adolescents, migrants, teachers and prisoners. And while the Jubilee's official start means the worst of the construction headache is ending, the arrival of a projected 32 million pilgrims in 2025 is set to only increase congestion in the Eternal City and intensify a housing crunch that has been driving residents away. Like many European art capitals, Rome has been suffering from overtourism as the Italian travel sector rebounds from COVID-19: Last year, a record high number of people visited Italy, 133.6 million, with foreign tourists pushing Italy over the EU average in growth of the travel sector, national statistics bureau ISTAT reported. Rome, with its innumerable artistic treasures, the Vatican and Italy's busiest airport, was the top city in terms of nights booked in registered lodging, ISTAT said. And yet for all its grande bellezze, Rome is hardly a modern European metropolis. It has notoriously inadequate public transportation and garbage collection. For the past two post-pandemic summers, taxis have been so hard to come by that the city of Rome authorized 1,000 new cab licenses for 2025. Rome's growing housing crisis — rents have risen about 10% this year — has gotten so bad that vigilantes have taken to going out at night with wire cutters to snip off the keyboxes on short-term apartment rentals that are blamed in part for driving up rents and driving out residents. 'The market is out of control and has definitely gotten worse with touristification, with the additional load of the Jubilee,' said Roberto Viviani, a university researcher whose landlord recently refused to renew his lease in favor of turning the apartment over to an agency to run as a holiday rental. 'The surprise was that he gave the Jubilee as the justification.' All of which has set the stage for a Jubilee opening Dec. 24 that is being received as something of a mixed bag. For the Vatican, the Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of the faithful making pilgrimages to Rome every 25 years to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul and receiving indulgences for the forgiveness of their sins in the process. For the city of Rome, it's a chance to take advantage of some 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in public funds to carry out long-delayed projects to lift the city out of years of decay and neglect and bring it up to modern, European standards. But for Romans who have seen the short-term rental market take over neighborhoods like Pigneto, on the eastern flank of the capital, it's just another pressure point in a long-running battle to keep the flavor of their neighborhoods with affordable rents for ordinary Romans. 'The Jubilee has significantly worsened this phenomenon that we have seen, above all in the last months,' said Alberto Campailla, director of the association Nonna Roma, which has been slapping stickers 'Your BnB, our eviction' on Pigneto keyboxes to protest the growth of tourist rentals. Rome's relationship with Jubilees dates to 1300, when Pope Boniface VIII inaugurated the first Holy Year in what historians say marked the definitive designation of Rome as the center of Christianity. Even then, the number of pilgrims was so significant that Dante referred to them in his Inferno. Massive public works projects have long accompanied Holy Years, including the creation of the Sistine Chapel (commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV for the Jubilee of 1475) and the big Vatican garage (for the 2000 Jubilee under St. John Paul II). Some works have been controversial, such as the construction of Via della Concilliazione, the broad boulevard leading to St. Peter's Square. An entire neighborhood was razed to make it for the 1950 Jubilee. The main public works project for the 2025 Jubilee is actually an extension of that boulevard: A pedestrian piazza along the Tiber linking Via della Conciliazione to the nearby Castel St. Angelo, with the major road that had separated them diverted to an underground tunnel. The project, at 79.5 million euros ($82.5 million) the most ambitious of the 2025 Jubilee works, ran into a predictable glitch over the summer when archaeological ruins were discovered during the dredging of the tunnel. The artifacts were transferred to the castle museum and the digging resumed, with the grand opening scheduled for Monday, the eve of the Jubilee's start. Mayor Roberto Gualtieri has pointed to another feature of the 2025 projects that previous Jubilees have largely ignored, an emphasis on parks and 'green' initiatives, in keeping with Francis' focus on environmental sustainability. But Francis himself has acknowledged the paradox of the Jubilee on the lives of everyday Romans. He wrote to Rome-area priests and religious orders earlier this year to ask them to 'make a courageous gesture of love' by offering up any unused housing or apartments in their increasingly empty convents and monasteries to Romans threatened with eviction. 'I want all diocesan realities that own real estate to offer their contribution to stem the housing emergency with signs of charity and solidarity to generate hope in the thousands of people in the city of Rome who are in a condition of precarious housing,' Francis wrote. Gualtieri has gone farther, demanding alongside other mayors that the national government pass the necessary norms to let them regulate the proliferation of short-term rentals, which have been blamed for reducing the available long-term rental stock and driving up prices. 'This for us is an emergency because we need to prevent entire blocks of the center from emptying out and turning into B&Bs, because the presence of residents in the center is fundamental,' Gualtieri said. Just this week, Gualtieri joined nine other European mayors in urging the European Commission do more to address the overall urban housing crisis in many cities, where homelessness and rising rents are driving out students and workers and threatening the cities' abilities to attract and retain talent. But the Vatican's point-man for the Jubilee, Monsignor Rino Fisichella, defended the Holy Year as part of Rome's fabric and denied the influx of pilgrims was anything but a net gain for the city. 'As long as it has existed, Rome has always been called a 'common home,' a city that has always been open to everyone,' Fisichella said on the sidelines of a Jubilee promotional event. 'To think that Rome might reduce the presence of pilgrims or tourists would in my opinion inflict a wound that doesn't belong to it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/amid-pope-s-big-holy-year-overtourism-aggravates-housing-crisis/7909382.html	2024-12-21T00:00:31-08:00	
Rising butter prices give European consumers and bakers a bad taste	PARIS — Pastry chef Arnaud Delmontel rolls out dough for croissants and pains au chocolat that later emerge golden and fragrant from the oven in his Paris patisserie. The price for the butter so essential to the pastries has shot up in recent months, by 25% since September alone, Delmontel says. But he is refusing to follow some competitors who have started making their croissants with margarine. 'It's a distortion of what a croissant is,' Delmontel said. 'A croissant is made with butter.' One of life's little pleasures — butter spread onto warm bread or imbuing cakes and seared meats with its flavor — has gotten more expensive across Europe in the last year. After a stretch of post-pandemic inflation that the war in Ukraine worsened, the booming cost of butter is another blow for consumers with holiday treats to bake. Across the 27-member European Union, the price of butter rose 19% on average from October 2023 to October 2024, including by 49% in Slovakia, and 40% in Germany and the Czech Republic, according to figures provided to The Associated Press by the EU's executive arm. Reports from individual countries indicate the cost has continued to go up in the months since. In Germany, a 250-gram block of butter now generally costs between 2.40 and 4 euros ($2.49-$4.15), depending on the brand and quality. The increase is the result of a global shortage of milk caused by declining production, including in the United States and New Zealand, one of the world's largest butter exporters, according to economist Mariusz Dziwulski, a food and agricultural market analyst at PKO Bank Polski in Warsaw. European butter typically has a higher fat content than the butter sold in the United States. It also is sold by weight in standard sizes, so food producers can't hide price hikes by reducing package sizes, something known as 'shrinkflation.' A butter shortage in France in the 19th century led to the invention of margarine, but the French remain some of the continent's heaviest consumers of butter, using the ingredient with abandon in baked goods and sauces. Butter is so important in Poland that the government keeps a stockpile of it in the country's strategic reserves, as it does national gas and COVID-19 vaccines. The government announced Tuesday that it was releasing some 1,000 tons of frozen butter to stabilize prices. The price of butter rose 11.4% between early November and early December in Poland, and 49.2% over the past year to nearly 37 Polish zlotys, or $9 per kilo for the week ending Dec. 8, according to the National Support Center for Agriculture, a government agency. 'Every month butter gets more expensive,' Danuta Osinska, 77, said while shopping recently at a discount grocery chain in Warsaw. She and her husband love butter — on bread, in scrambled eggs, in creamy desserts. But they also struggle to pay for medications on their meager pensions. So the couple is eating less butter and more margarine, even though they find the taste of the substitute spread inferior. 'There is no comparison,' Osinska said. 'Things are getting harder and harder.' The cost of butter in Poland has become a political issue. With a presidential election scheduled next year, opponents of centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk are trying to blame him and his Civic Platform party. The party's presidential candidate is seeking to blame the national bank's governor, who hails from an opposing political camp, for the inflation. Some consumers decide where to shop based on the price of butter, which has led to price wars between grocery chains that in some cases kept prices artificially low in the past to the detriment of dairy farmers, according to Agnieszka Maliszewska, the director of the Polish Chamber of Milk. Maliszewska thinks domestic, EU-specific and global issues explain butter inflation. She argues that the primary cause is a shortage of milk fat due to dairy farmers shutting down their enterprises across Europe because of slim profit markets and hard work. She and others also cite higher energy costs from Russia's war in Ukraine as impacting milk production. There is some debate about the potential effect of climate change. Maliszewska doesn't see a link. Economist Dziwulski, however, thinks droughts may be a factor in reducing production. Falling milk prices last year also discouraged investments and pushed dairy producers in the EU to make more cheese, which offered better profitability, he said. An outbreak of bluetongue disease, an insect-borne viral disease that is harmless to humans but can be fatal for sheep, cows and goats, may also play a role, Dziwulski said. The U.S. saw a butter price spike in 2022, when the average price jumped 33% to about $9 per kilo over the course of the year, according to government data. Dairy farmers struggled with feed costs and hot temperatures. U.S. butter prices fell in 2023 before rising again this year, hitting a peak of about $10 per kilo in September. Higher grocery prices in general weighed on U.S. voters during the presidential election in November. Southern European countries, which rely far more heavily on olive oil, are less affected by the butter inflation — or they just don't consider it as important since they consume so much less. Since last year the cost of butter shot up 44% on average in Italy, according to dairy market analysis firm CLAL. Italy is Europe's seventh-largest butter producer, but olive oil is the preferred fat, even for some desserts. The price of butter therefore is not causing the same alarm there as it is in butter-addicted parts of Europe. Delmontel, the Paris pastry chef, said the rising costs put business owners like him under pressure. Along with refusing to switch out butter for margarine, he has not reduced the size of his croissants. But some other French bakers are making smaller pastries to control costs, he said. 'Or else you squeeze it out of your profit margin,' Delmontel said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rising-butter-prices-give-european-consumers-and-bakers-a-bad-taste/7909369.html	2024-12-20T23:59:35-08:00	
Pennsylvania's Bethlehem, founded by Moravians on Christmas eve, keeps its traditions alive	BETHLEHEM, PENNSYLVANIA — On Christmas Eve in 1741, Moravian settlers named this Pennsylvania city after the biblical birthplace of Jesus. Nearly 300 years later, Moravians continue celebrating their Christmas season traditions in Bethlehem. They include the 'putz,' a Nativity scene that tells the story of Christ's birth with miniature wooden figurines, the making of thousands of beeswax candles by hand as a symbol of the light that Jesus brought to the world and a 'lovefeast,' a song service where worshippers share a simple meal of sweet buns and coffee in their pews. 'Like all Moravian traditions, the importance of it is that it brings people together,' said the Rev. Janel Rice, senior pastor of Central Moravian Church — Bethlehem's first congregation and the oldest Moravian church in North America. 'Building community, emphasizing that, over doctrine or dogma, is really the Moravian practice and tradition at our core,' she said. Moravians relate to the story of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Rice said, because their ancestors began as a refugee church fleeing religious persecution. The Nativity is also a poignant reminder today, when the number of people fleeing their homes because of war, violence and persecution continues to rise worldwide. 'It's so crucial because this story is not just Jesus's story of 2,000 years ago. It's today's story. And we need to make sure that we're living the word that we were told when it comes to these refugees,' said church member Sarah Wascura. 'That word is to give them refuge and to take care of them and to love them as ourselves.' A town founded on Christmas Eve The Moravian Church is one of the world's oldest Protestant denominations. Its name comes from the historical provinces of Bohemia and Moravia in what is now the Czech Republic. Their beliefs of practice over dogma began with a religious reformer, John Hus, who led a protest movement against some of the practices of Roman Catholic hierarchy. Hus believed congregants in his church should listen to Mass and read the Bible in their native Czech instead of Latin. He was accused of heresy and burned at the stake in 1415. His ideas were carried on by his supporters, who broke with Rome and founded the Moravian Church, or Unitas Fratrum (Unity of Brethren) in 1457 — decades before Martin Luther's Protestant Reformation. Moravians facing persecution eventually fled to Herrnhut, Germany, and established the original Renewed Moravian Church settlement, according to accounts of church history. Moravian missionaries later settled in Pennsylvania. On Christmas Eve in 1741, their leader, Count Nicolas Ludwig von Zinzendorf, who was visiting them, led them to a stable, where they sang the hymn Jesus Call Thou Me. Its lyrics say: 'Not Jerusalem — lowly Bethlehem 'twas that gave us Christ to save us.' Thus inspired, Zinzendorf named the settlement Bethlehem. Beloved tradition retells the story of the birth of Jesus Bethlehem's first settlers brought with them hand-carved figures to retell the story of Christ's birth. The tradition is known as the putz, from the German word 'putzen,' meaning to clean or decorate. 'It relates back to the creches of the Middle Ages,' Rice said. 'But it's not just a creche, which would be just the one Nativity scene.' Instead, it uses figures to tell different parts of the Gospel in miniature, including Mary's annunciation and the visit of the three wise men to the infant Jesus. In Victorian days, Rice said, Bethlehem's residents would 'go putzing' — visiting each other's homes between Christmas Eve and New Year's Day to look at Nativity scenes. In 1937, the local chamber of commerce launched a campaign promoting Bethlehem as 'Christmas City USA.' As part of that promotion, they took the tradition of the putz to the historic Hotel Bethlehem on Main Street. Thousands turned up. 'The story goes that the hotel got so crowded that they couldn't really accommodate the number of people that were coming to see it, and they asked Central Moravian Church to host it.' For every Christmas since then, the community putz has been put together by the church's congregants and displayed at the nearby Christian education building. 'It's more than Christmas for four weeks a year,' said Wascura, who went to the putz on her first date with Bob Wascura, her husband of 33 years. 'The nature of the faith heritage of the city is something that is never forgotten.' On a recent day, she led families visiting the community putz to their seats. After recounting a brief history of the Moravian Church and the Pennsylvania city, she drew a curtain to display the dozens of wooden figures — angels, shepherds, kings carrying gifts — in a tiny landscape decorated with pebbles, wood and moss. Children and parents listened to the recorded voice of Janel Rice, who narrated the biblical story about the other Bethlehem. 'We might wonder why setting up a putz and telling the story of Jesus' birth is so important to the Moravians, and now to the city of Bethlehem,' Rice says in the recording. 'One reason has to do with the naming of the city itself.' The church choir, after some singing, gave way to the powerful sound of the renowned Moravian Trombone Choir, known for playing its brassy tunes from the belfry of Central Moravian Church. When the lights turned on, children approached the stage to look up close at the figurines and point at surprises near the manger, including miniature zebras, lions and giraffes. 'We feel really lucky to live so close to Bethlehem with all of the history here and specifically the history pertaining to Christmas,' said visitor Kelly Ann Ryan. 'It's just something that we can't miss every holiday season as it rolls around.' She came to Bethlehem from a nearby town with her husband, Daniel, and their 5- and 8-year-old sons to see the community putz, in what she said has become a family tradition. 'Telling the Christmas story this way is a great way for kids to connect with it.' Lighting candles on Christmas Eve, joining Santa for a sleigh ride Christmas — from the Christian celebration to the secular commercial holiday — is omnipresent in Bethlehem. On a recent day, Santa Claus checked on a red sleigh (drawn by horses instead of reindeer) outside Central Moravian before he led families who hopped on for a tour of Bethlehem and its Moravian church settlements, which were recently designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Others strolled to nearby holiday-themed wooden huts or along Main Street with its stores decorated with Christmas globes and Moravian stars. Some stopped outside an Italian restaurant to greet Santa and Mrs. Claus, who welcomed diners and posed for photos. Across town, vendors sold ornaments at Christkindlmarkt, in the shadow of rusting blast furnaces of Bethlehem Steel illuminated in red and green. That company once supplied steel for construction of the Empire State Building, the Golden Gate Bridge and other landmarks. At Central Moravian, the choir sang hymns while sacristans handed out buns and mugs of coffee to families who enjoyed the sustenance in their pews at the 'lovefeast.' After Rice delivered a final blessing, Linda Thudium walked up the stairs and opened a large closet, where the congregation keeps thousands of handmade candles wrapped in red ribbons that they light during Christmas services. 'To me, this is Christmas — looking at these candles,' said Thudium. She recalled attending Christmas Eve services with lit candles since she was 5, a tradition she continued with her children and grandchildren. 'To me, this is just magical. I remember my parents doing this, my grandparents,' she said. 'It's just a wonderful warm feeling of being connected with this church.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pennsylvania-s-bethlehem-founded-by-moravians-on-christmas-eve-keeps-its-traditions-alive-/7908077.html	2024-12-20T23:58:53-08:00	
Younger Asian Americans navigate something new to their generation: Taking up space	NEW YORK — Client after client comes through the 12 Pell barbershop in Manhattan's Chinatown. They come for the cuts, and for the cool. On 12 Pell's lively social media accounts, the young, predominantly Asian American barbers don't hesitate to offer advice to teens and men of all ages and ethnicities with humor, quips, and confidence. Karho Leung, 34, a son of Chinatown and a 12 Pell co-founder, wanted to start a business that reflected him and his desire for 'building the world that I want to live in … not asking for permission.' About as American as it gets, right? The hunger to find your own way, make your voice heard? A look at social media and pop culture shows Leung and plenty of other Asian Americans of his and younger generations doing just that. But that American reality hasn't always belonged to everyone, including previous generations of Asian Americans. That American notion of having the freedom to stake out your own space? Sometimes, oftentimes, that has meant less space for others. Earlier generations of Asian Americans, some of whom have been here for well over a century and others whose roots trace to recent decades, have lived in Americas where their immigrant-origin communities were smaller and regarded as foreign, and where there was little mainstream familiarity with the countries they traced their ancestries to. And there was no Internet or social media culture that encouraged people to define their own lives. Instead, there were stereotypes that persist to this day — of otherness, of broken-English speaking and passiveness, at times sneaky or suspicious, or nerds and geeks. But even as those stereotypes still do harm, they don't have the same power in a time when many Americans eat from a global plate; where yoga studios and henna tattoos, temples and cultural festivals are everywhere, and the size, variety and geography of Asian American communities have increased dramatically in recent decades even as they remain a small part of the overall whole. Those stereotypes don't touch Leung the same way they impacted generations before him. 'It's funny because even though I watched this type of stereotype and portrayal happen growing up, it never really resonated or hit me that that was what I was up against,' he says. Jeff Yang, 56, a writer who has spent decades chronicling Asian American communities and culture, laughs when asked if the cultural space that Leung inhabits and makes his own sounds like the world of Yang's childhood. 'I grew up in a world where I felt like everything about me was projected on me by other people,' Yang says. 'The stories that were being told were all told by non-Asians about what I could do, who I could be, what I could look like.' It's not as if that world doesn't still exist. Simran Anand, 27, was still part of just one of three South Asian families in Reading, Pennsylvania, in the 2000s. She can relate, she says, to the sense earlier generations had of feeling culturally isolated in her day-to-day life when she stepped out of the family home. But she had something they lacked — large-scale South Asian communities in nearby places to visit and interact with. For her, it's both-and, not either-or, a sensibility she takes to her jewelry company, BySimran, which drew inspiration from South Asian designs but also adapted to fit her sensibilities as a young American woman. 'I am American, but I'm also South Asian,' she says. 'And I don't have to be one or the other.' Demetri Manabat, 23, agrees. Born and raised in Las Vegas to a Filipino father and Mexican mother, the spoken word artist says 'it sounds like a different world' to hear about his parents' experiences growing up. His parents didn't teach him or his brothers Tagalog, one of the languages of the Philippines, or Spanish because 'they grew up in a time where that was kind of frowned upon to be speaking a different language. And so they were under the assumption that that kind of perception would continue throughout my years, which it didn't,' Manabat says. Alex Paik remembers what it was like. The 43-year-old Korean American artist grew up in a predominantly white suburb outside of Philadelphia. 'When I was growing up, it was like I either was not Korean enough or too Korean,' he says. Today, he's intrigued watching his 11-year-old daughter. 'She loves to read, and there's so many stories now that are written by Asian American women that center Asian and Asian American girls as protagonists,' he says. 'I don't know how it would affect your sense of self, but it must affect it somehow, so I'm really curious to see how she grows up … It's just normal for her.' Factors that have made a difference in the lives of Asian Americans over time include the baseline demographic reality that there are more, and bigger, communities across the country largely due to the 1965 reform of immigration laws. Globalization has played a hand as well, introducing cultures to each other as the world has gotten smaller. And of course, the internet and technology. Paik thinks some of what he's seeing now is also the natural outpouring that comes from a connection to the country that looks different to those born here than it does for those who have immigrated here. 'When you start with the assumption that you belong in a space, I feel like that changes how you approach things,' he says. 'Whether or not that space actually wants you is kind of beside the point. There's an attitude you carry, like, yeah, of course this is my house, this is my country. I grew up here.' And 'I grew up here' — is the operative engine as new generations of Asian Americans rise and claim their own space — even if the assumptions they make about what's possible for them could be a bit unsettling for other generations. 'Previous generations, of course, they're going to have that kind of like 'what is going on' moment,' Manabat says. 'I do think that is the goal, to kind of have that moment of 'This is insane,' but it's everything that you kind of hoped would happen.' In short: building the world they want to live in. And not asking for permission.	https://www.voanews.com/a/younger-asian-americans-navigate-something-new-to-their-generation-taking-up-space-/7906680.html	2024-12-20T23:57:33-08:00	
Myanmar ethnic rebels say they’ve captured junta western command	BANGKOK — A Myanmar ethnic rebel group has captured a military regional command in Rakhine state, it said, in what would be a major blow to the junta. The Arakan Army had 'completely captured' the western regional command at Ann on Friday after weeks of fighting, the group said in a statement on its Telegram channel. Ann would be the second regional military command to fall to ethnic rebels in five months and a huge blow to the military. Myanmar's military has 14 regional commands across the country with many of them currently fighting established ethnic rebel groups or newer 'People's Defense Forces' that have sprung up to battle the military's 2021 coup. Fighting has rocked Rakhine state since the AA attacked security forces in November last year, ending a ceasefire that had largely held since the putsch. AA fighters have seized swathes of territory in the state that is home to China- and India-backed port projects and all but cut off state capital Sittwe. The AA posted photos of a man whom it said was the Ann deputy regional commander, in the custody of its fighters. AFP was unable to confirm that information and has contacted the AA's spokesperson for comment. AFP was unable to reach people on the ground around Ann where internet and phone services are patchy. In decades of on-off fighting since independence from Britain in 1948 the military had never lost a regional military command until last August, when the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army captured the northeastern command in Lashio in Shan state. Myanmar's borderlands are home to myriad ethnic armed groups who have battled the military since independence for autonomy and control of lucrative resources. Last month the U.N. warned Rakhine state was heading towards famine, as ongoing clashes squeeze commerce and agricultural production. 'Rakhine's economy has stopped functioning,' the report from the U.N. Development Program said, projecting 'famine conditions by mid-2025' if current levels of food insecurity were left unaddressed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-ethnic-rebels-say-they-ve-captured-junta-western-command-/7909438.html	2024-12-20T23:19:29-08:00	
Indonesians mark 2 decades since the tsunami that killed 230,000	BANDA ACEH, INDONESIA — Two decades after a catastrophic tsunami destroyed her village, Tria Asnani still cries when she recalls how she lost her mother while trying to escape the giant waves. Asnani, now a schoolteacher, was 17 at the time. Her father, who was a fisherman, never returned home from sea. She doesn't know how she survived. 'I cannot swim. I could only rely on dhikr (Islamic prayer).' On Dec. 26, 2004, a powerful 9.1 magnitude earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that killed around 230,000 people across a dozen countries, reaching as far as East Africa. But Indonesia's Aceh province, located closest to the earthquake's epicenter and with 18 of 23 districts and cities located in the coastal line in the Northern side of Sumatra, bore the brunt of the disaster with more than half of the total death toll reported. The worst-hit areas were in Aceh Besar and Banda Aceh, according to the Aceh Disaster Management Agency. Asnani's Lampuuk village lies in a fishermen's community in Aceh Besar, known for its white sandy beaches and turquoise waters. However, on that day, it was among the hardest hit, with waves more than 30 meters high which changed the coastline in Aceh and led to land subsidence after the earthquake. Buildings by the coast were flattened to the ground except for Rahmatullah Mosque, 500 meters from the shore, and about a kilometer from Asnani's house. The photo of the place of worship, left pretty much unscathed, later became iconic. After the disastrous event, thousands, including Asnani, had to relocate to start afresh. She moved with her uncle to another region in Aceh to continue her studies. After she got married, she returned in 2007 to her parents' house which was rebuilt with assistance from the Turkish government and lived there for 10 years. Many international donors and organizations poured in money to help rebuild the affected areas that lost schools, hospitals and basic infrastructure, made stronger than before the tsunami hit. Tsunami and Disaster Mitigation Research Center at Syiah Kuala University in Aceh recorded more than 1,400 wrecked schools and about 150,000 students had their education process disrupted by the destructive waves in a report published in 2019. Three 'escape buildings' were also constructed in a relatively safer area to accommodate thousands of people if an earthquake and tsunami strike. Across the province, memories of the tsunami can be felt almost everywhere. The Aceh Tsunami Museum in Banda Aceh houses photos of the aftermath and vehicle debris, serving as a constant reminder of what was lost that day. Local authorities have also turned a former floating diesel-powered power plant barge that washed about 6 kilometers inland by the tsunami into another memorial place. Both places have become the most popular tourist destinations in the area. But development never stops and 20 years after the tsunami the Aceh coast is brimming with residential housing, cafes and restaurants, as well as tourism support facilities, while the hills in some areas from which people are currently being mined for sand and stone. Fazli, the head of Preparedness in Aceh Disaster Management Agency, said that the government initially stipulated that there should be no activity up to 1 kilometer from the coast. Over time, many displaced fishermen returned to their original coastal homes, drawn by their livelihoods and ties to the sea, despite having received housing elsewhere. He also said the agency has 'provided the Acehnese people with information ' to deal with a potential tsunami. 'People already know what to do,' said Fazli, who, like other Indonesians, uses a single name. Siti Ikramatoun, a sociologist in Banda Aceh, said that despite years of recovery and rebuilding, the people of Aceh must stay vigilant. 'If people experienced (the tsunami), they may have an instinct to anticipate it. But those who do not have the experience, they won't get what to do,' Ikramatoun said. Various communities in Aceh commemorate the tsunami yearly along with the government and local authorities. In Banda Aceh, art communities in early December spread disaster awareness through theatrical or musical performances that can be easier for people to follow and target all groups, including those born after the tsunami. Muslina, 43, a civil servant, took her youngest son to the Aceh Tsunami Museum to watch one of the shows. She lost relatives and loved ones 20 years ago and she wants to make sure she always remembers them. 'Earlier my son asked me if there might be another tsunami when he grows up,' she said. 'I told him I do not know. Only God knows, but if there is a strong earthquake and the seawater recedes, we run, run, run to find higher ground.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesians-mark-2-decades-since-the-tsunami-that-killed-230-000/7909411.html	2024-12-20T20:51:59-08:00	
Thousands rally at US Embassy in Cuba against trade embargo	HAVANA — Thousands of Cubans joined a protest Friday in front of the U.S. Embassy in Havana that was led by President Miguel Diaz-Canel and ex-leader Raul Castro against Washington's long-standing trade blockade. 'We are marching now to tell the U.S. government to let the Cuban people live in peace. Down with interference!' Diaz-Canel told a crowd that had gathered a month before Republican Donald Trump returns to the White House. Communist Cuba is enduring a worsening economic crisis that the government blames on U.S. sanctions that have been in place since 1962 and were tightened during Trump's first term. 'If we didn't have the blockade, we would not be facing difficulty like this,' said 85-year-old retiree Faustino Miranda. The Caribbean nation faces a lack of food and medicine, frequent blackouts and a wave of emigration. Rogelio Savigne, 55, head of transport at a state-owned company, told AFP: 'We need them to open the doors for us to be able to trade with all countries.' Authorities said that 700,000 people marched in the capital on Friday. AFP was not able to independently verify that number. Former president Castro, 93, stood at the head of the march along with Diaz-Canel, who earlier Friday had blamed the U.S. embargo for making this year 'one of the most difficult' for Cuba. On Tuesday, the country's deputy foreign minister reiterated its willingness to enter into a dialogue with Trump, who will take office on Jan. 20. During his first term, Trump halted an easing of relations between Washington and Havana that began in 2014. He implemented 243 measures that reinforced the embargo, including the reincorporation of the island into the U.S. blacklist of 'countries that sponsor terrorism,' alongside Iran and North Korea. Current U.S. President Joe Biden has kept Cuba on that list but resumed discussions with Havana on counterterrorism and combating illegal migration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-rally-at-us-embassy-in-cuba-against-trade-embargo/7909398.html	2024-12-20T19:46:32-08:00	
Ukraine strike kills 6 in Russia's Kursk region	Ukraine attacked a town in Russia's Kursk region Friday, killing six people, including a child, a senior local official said. Ten others were hospitalized in the town of Rylsk after the attack with U.S.-supplied HIMARS rockets, Kursk acting Governor Alexander Khinshtein said. The attack, Ukrainian officials said, followed an earlier Russian missile attack on Kyiv. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said an early Friday morning Russian ballistic missile attack on the capital killed at least one person, wounded 13 and damaged six foreign embassies and a university in the city's center. On its Telegram social media account, Ukraine's air force said it intercepted five Iskander short-range ballistic missiles fired at the city, but falling missile debris caused damage and sparked fires in three districts. City officials reported damage to multiple residential buildings, medical facilities and schools. Air force officials urged citizens to immediately respond to reports of ballistic attack threats because they provide very little time to find shelter. At a briefing in Kyiv on Friday, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Georgiy Tykhyi said the missile attack did significant damage to a building that houses the embassies of Albania, Argentina, the Palestinians, North Macedonia, Portugal and Montenegro. He shared pictures of the damage to the buildings. No injuries were reported in those attacks. The Kyiv National Linguistics University said on its Instagram account that its building also had been hit, and it shared a picture of an area near an entrance where two large windows had been blown out. Russia has said it launched the attack in retaliation for Kyiv's firing U.S.-made weapons into Russia. Russia's attacks on Kyiv came one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin's year-end press conference. Putin has been talking about negotiations to end the war 'for quite some time, but the bombing has continued,' said Charles Kupchan, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. President-elect Donald Trump has talked about the possibility of talks with the Russian and Ukrainian presidents to end the war. He has said he could broker a deal to end the war in 24 hours. Kupchan said Trump is 'naive' to think he could get the two countries to come to an agreement so swiftly. Trump 'cannot afford a deal that effectively subjugates Ukraine and leaves it a ward of Russia,' Kupchan said. Ukraine must be defensible, he said, and 'not left in a geopolitical limbo that invites Russia to simply pick up the war where it left off six months from now ... or a year later.' Meanwhile, Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's deputy prime minister and minister of justice, reported Friday that Russia had launched a cyberattack on state registers, resulting in a shutdown. Stefanishyna made the initial report from her Facebook page, where she said it was clear the attack was orchestrated by Russia to 'sow panic among citizens of Ukraine and abroad.' She held a briefing later Friday in Kyiv along with Ukraine's acting head of the Cybersecurity Department of the security service, Volodymyr Karastelov. She told reporters that while it appeared no data were lost or stolen, the ministry suspended the activities of all state registers to avoid further deployment of threats. The affected registries include civil acts such as marriages, wills, births and car registrations, and Stefanishyna said they were working to restore them. The Cybersecurity Department said its main line of investigation was that a hacker group affiliated with Russian military intelligence was behind the attack. Russia has yet to comment on the attack. VOA's Kim Lewis contributed to this report. Some information came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-strike-kills-6-in-russia-s-kursk-region/7909381.html	2024-12-20T18:50:53-08:00	
Canada's Trudeau reshuffles Cabinet as resignation calls mount	Toronto, ontario — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's chances of staying in power have become more tenuous since the opposition party that backed his government for years announced it would vote no confidence in the government when Parliament resumed. An embattled Trudeau reshuffled his Cabinet on Friday, but whether he will step aside in the coming days or weeks remained an open question. Trudeau did not address his future or take questions after he left the meeting with his new Cabinet. But he said his government was preparing for Donald Trump and his threat to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products. 'In exactly one month the new president will be inaugurated, and we are preparing Canada to face that,' Trudeau said in his first remarks to reporters since his finance minister quit. But Trudeau is facing rising discontent over his leadership, and the abrupt departure of his finance minister on Monday could be something he can’t recover from. 'The prime minister has simply asked for some time to reflect on his own future,' said David McGuinty, the new public safety minister. Rachel Bendayan, the official languages minister, said Trudeau 'told us he had a difficult choice to make.' The political upheaval comes at a difficult moment for Canada. Trump keeps calling Trudeau the governor of the 51st state and has threatened to impose sweeping tariffs if Canada does not stem what he calls a flow of migrants and drugs into the United States — even though far fewer of each cross into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened. 'We have in the next 60 days an existential threat for the Canadian economy, for people that could lose their jobs. The unemployment rate could double. We need to focus on that,' said Marc Miller, the immigration minister and a close friend of Trudeau's. 'I think he’s the best to lead us in a very difficult situation. We can’t be in a position where the government has no ability to fight back.' Parliament is now shut for the holidays until late next month, but the leftist New Democratic Party said Friday that it would trigger a vote of no confidence in Trudeau after lawmakers reconvene on January 27. Because Trudeau’s Liberals do not hold an outright majority in Parliament, they have for years depended on the support of the NDP to pass legislation and stay in power. But that support has vanished — NDP leader Jagmeet Singh has called on Trudeau to resign — and he made clear Friday the NDP would vote to bring down the government. The Liberals could delay Parliament’s return. Trudeau could decide not to run in next year’s election and allow for a party leadership race. Liberal Rob Oliphant became the latest lawmaker to call for the prime minister to step aside, saying there should be a 'robust, open leadership contest.' Trudeau, who has led the country for nearly a decade, has become widely unpopular in recent years over a range of issues, including the high cost of living and rising inflation. There is no mechanism for Trudeau’s party to force him out in the short term. He could say he will step aside when a new party leader is chosen, or his Liberal Party could be forced from power by a no-confidence vote in Parliament that would trigger an election, which would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said Canada needs an immediate election and requires a prime minister who can face Trump from a position of strength.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-s-trudeau-reshuffles-cabinet-as-resignation-calls-mount/7909386.html	2024-12-20T18:43:36-08:00	
Foreign worker visa program faces uncertainty under second Trump term	WASHINGTON — Foreign workers seeking U.S. jobs enjoyed near-guaranteed visa success in fiscal year 2024, with immigration authorities approving more than 97% of H1-B visa applications, as reported by the National Foundation for American Policy. The was the second-highest approval rate in more than a decade. But the exceptionally high success rate could soon end if President-elect Donald Trump's team revives his first administration's restrictive immigration policies, according to immigration lawyers. That in turn could significantly affect U.S. businesses and other institutions that rely on highly skilled foreign workers, especially those from India, they warn. 'I think it's going to get harder, and it's going to be more complicated to approve things,' said Sharvari Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) and a former lawyer for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Companies exploit program, say critics Created in 1990, the H-1B program lets U.S. employers hire foreign talent in specialized fields such as technology, engineering and health care, with 85,000 visas issued by lottery. Indian workers received more than 70% of the slots in recent years, followed by Chinese nationals. The program has long been the subject of controversy. Proponents point to its role allowing the U.S. to attract top foreign talent and fill critical jobs. A 2016 study by the National Foundation for American Policy found that nearly one-quarter of America's billion-dollar startups had a founder who first came to the U.S. as an international student. But critics view the program as a weapon against American workers. Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) pointed to Disney's controversial move a decade ago to lay off hundreds of U.S. staff members, forcing them to train foreign replacements as a condition of their severance. Though Disney denied any wrongdoing and beat subsequent lawsuits, the case became a rallying cry among anti-immigrant groups. FAIR says U.S. companies exploit the system to hire cheaper foreign labor, driving down U.S. wages. 'There are plenty of tech workers available here in the United States, and that should be the first resort for these companies to go out there and hire people who are American citizens,' Mehlman, FAIR's media director, said in an interview with VOA. Mehlman said the program has strayed from its roots as a temporary foreign worker program, with foreign nationals using it as a backdoor to American citizenship. 'This should be a program that says you're going to come here for a specified amount of time, the duration of your visa, and then you're going to return home,' Mehlman said. The criticism is shared by many congressional Republicans as well as Trump, who in 2016 campaigned to end what he called 'a cheap labor program.' That did not happen, but the first Trump administration moved swiftly against the program after Trump issued his Buy American, Hire American executive order within months of taking office. Immigration officials followed up with stricter degree and wage requirements for foreign workers. Most of those rules were eventually blocked by courts. But immigration officers found other ways to squeeze the program. They approved some visa requests for one year instead of three, rejected automatic extensions and ramped up worksite inspections. Visa applicants were hit with mounting demands for evidence to process their petitions, according to immigration lawyers. The crackdown hit hard. New visa denials soared to 24% in 2018 and dropped to 21% in 2019 before easing to 13% in 2020. That marked a sharp departure from the Obama era, when fewer than 1 in 10 petitions were denied. 'What we did see that kind of worked effectively under the Trump administration was a gutting of the system,' said Dalal-Dheini, who worked as a special counsel at the USCIS during the first Trump administration. Trump's plan for visas uncertain While changing rules and regulations are cumbersome and time-consuming, immigration lawyers warn about a likely return to the tactics the first Trump administration used to limit the number of visas issued to foreign workers. Kathleen Campbell Walker, head of immigration practice at the Dickinson Wright law firm, said she is particularly concerned that increased scrutiny by federal anti-fraud agents could slow things down and potentially create 'more difficulty in getting your H-1B visa status approved.' 'That worries me,' Walker, a former national president of AILA, said in an interview with VOA. The incoming administration's plans for the visa program remain uncertain. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a VOA request for comment, but a campaign spokesperson said in a statement to The Washington Post earlier this year that Trump 'will restore all of his prior [immigration] policies' immediately upon returning to the White House. While Trump's new administration is expected to focus on cracking down on undocumented immigrants, immigration lawyers say the new administration could target legal as well as illegal immigration, pointing to the appointment of immigration hardliners such as Stephen Miller, Trump's incoming White House deputy chief of staff. Yet signals are mixed. Trump has floated the idea of giving green cards to foreign graduates of American colleges and universities. And key Trump ally Elon Musk is a staunch supporter of the H-1B program, with Tesla hiring 742 new foreign workers in fiscal year 2024, ranking 16th among U.S. companies with the most H-1B visa approvals. While it's unclear what influence, if any, Musk will have on Trump's immigration policies, Walker said she's 'hoping he may be in there to try to help tweak things that are from a positive perspective for the H-1B category.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/foreign-worker-visa-program-faces-uncertainty-under-second-trump-term/7909372.html	2024-12-20T18:21:42-08:00

Senate approves 235th judge of Biden's term, beating Trump's tally	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden secured the 235th judicial confirmation of his presidency Friday, an accomplishment that exceeds his predecessor's total by one after Democrats put extra emphasis on the federal courts following Donald Trump's far-reaching first term, when he filled three seats on the Supreme Court. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, teed up votes on two California district judges, and they were likely to be the last judicial confirmations this year before Congress adjourns and makes way for a new, Republican-led Senate. The confirmation of Serena Raquel Murillo to be a district judge for the Central District of California broke Trump's mark. Come next year, Republicans will look to boost Trump's already considerable influence on the makeup of the federal judiciary in his second term. Biden and Senate Democrats placed particular focus on adding women, minorities and public defenders to the judicial ranks. About two-thirds of Biden's appointees are women and a solid majority of appointees are people of color. The most notable appointee was Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first African American woman to serve on the nation's highest court. 'Prior to our effort, the number of women on the federal bench was really diminished. It was overwhelmingly white males,' said Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 'We consciously moved forward to bring more women to the bench, and believe me, we had a great talent pool to work with. So I think it'll enhance the image of the court and its work product to bring these new judges on.' Biden also placed an emphasis on bringing more civil rights lawyers, public defenders and labor rights lawyers to expand the professional backgrounds of the federal judiciary. More than 45 appointees are public defenders, and more than two dozen served as civil rights lawyers. While Biden did get more district judges confirmed than Trump, he had fewer higher-tier circuit court appointments than Trump — 45 compared with 54 for Trump. And he got one Supreme Court appointment compared with three for Trump. Republicans, much to Democrats' frustration, filled Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat on the court the week before the 2020 presidential election. Ginsburg had died in September. Democrats also faced the challenge of confirming nominees during two years of a 50-50 Senate. Rarely a week went by in the current Congress when Schumer did not tee up votes on judicial confirmations as liberal groups urged Democrats to show the same kind of urgency on judges that Republicans exhibited under Trump. Some Senate Republicans were harshly critical of Biden's choices. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said talk of diversity did not extend to the views of the nominees. 'One of the consequences of the age of Trump is that it drove Democrats insane, and it drove them to the extreme left, so they put people on the bench who were selected because they were extreme partisans,' Cruz said. Liberal-leaning advocacy groups said they are delighted with the number of judges Democrats secured, but even more so with the quality of the nominees. They said diversity in personal and professional backgrounds improves judicial decision-making, helps build public trust and inspires people from all walks of life to pursue legal careers. 'For our federal judiciary to actually deliver equal justice for all, it really has to be for all, and that is one reason why we certainly applaud this administration for prioritizing both professional but also demographic diversity,' said Lena Zwarensteyn, senior director of the fair courts program at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and the next chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Democrats showed newfound resolve on judicial confirmations. 'They learned a lesson from the first Trump administration,' Grassley said. 'Paying attention to the number of judges you get and the type of judges you put on the court is worth it.' Part of the urgency from Democrats came as they watched the nation's highest court overturn abortion protections, eliminate affirmative action in higher education and weaken the federal government's ability to protect the environment, public health and workplace safety through regulations. The cases showed that the balance of power in Washington extends to the judicial branch. Trump will inherit nearly three dozen judicial vacancies, but that number is expected to rise because of Republican-appointed judges who held off on retirement in hopes that a Republican would return to office and pick their replacements.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-approves-235th-judge-of-biden-s-term-beating-trump-s-tally-/7909364.html	2024-12-20T17:24:59-08:00	
El Salvador violated woman's rights in high-risk pregnancy case, court rules	SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA / SAN SALVADOR, EL SALVADOR — El Salvador violated a woman's rights after denying her an abortion in 2013 despite doctors' calls to terminate her high-risk pregnancy, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) said Friday. The case of the woman, a domestic worker known as Beatriz, became a symbol of El Salvador's blanket ban on abortion, which punishes with prison time those who undergo the procedure, perform it or assist with it. The court's decision found the Salvadoran state 'internationally responsible for failing to fulfill its duty of due diligence in ensuring the rights to access effective judicial remedies, personal integrity, health and privacy' for Beatriz. Doctors diagnosed Beatriz, then 22 and suffering from lupus and other ailments, with her second high-risk pregnancy in February 2013 and said the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. They recommended an abortion but would not perform the procedure given El Salvador's severe prohibition. Beatriz appealed to the Supreme Court, which rejected her request. In June 2013, she underwent a cesarean section, and her daughter died hours later. Beatriz died in 2017 from complications due to a motorcycle accident that occurred en route to a medical appointment. The IACHR said there was not a proven causal link between Beatriz's death in 2017 and the medical care during her second pregnancy in 2013, so it did not rule on state responsibility for her death. In its ruling, the IACHR ordered El Salvador to implement measures such as creating guidelines and protocols for medical and judicial personnel to ensure legal clarity and proper care in similar cases. 'The lack of legal certainty regarding the handling of Beatriz's case led to the bureaucratization and judicialization of the necessary medical care, resulting in multiple consequences,' the IACHR's statement said. The El Salvador president's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. At a press conference on Friday, Beatriz's mother, known publicly only as Delmy, celebrated the ruling alongside Beatriz's brother and women's rights activists. 'I know it has not been easy, but the state has the duty and the right to respond to the measures that the court has imposed, and for me, it is a great triumph,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/el-salvador-violated-woman-s-rights-in-high-risk-pregnancy-case-court-rules/7909351.html	2024-12-20T17:07:45-08:00

Lithuania faces tough balancing act over ties with China	taipei, taiwan — The pledge by Lithuania’s new government to reset diplomatic relations with China after Beijing downgraded bilateral ties with the country in 2021 is facing challenges even before it has begun. Analysts say Lithuania’s recent decision to expel three of China’s diplomats and the damage done to two data cables in the Baltic Sea – as well as questions about the role a Chinese cargo ship may have played – are complicating that effort. China downgraded ties with Lithuania after the previous government agreed to open a representative office for Taiwan in the capital, Vilnius, in 2021 that used the English word 'Taiwanese' in its name. Beijing bristles at any moves that give democratically governed Taiwan added international recognition. Most of Taiwan’s overseas representative offices have Taipei in their name. Balancing act Tomas Janeliunas, an international relations professor at Vilnius University, says Lithuania’s new government will have to play a balancing act when it comes to relations with China because each change in the geopolitical landscape can have an impact. 'When a new tension point breaks out, Lithuania will have no choice but to skip this balancing policy and return to the more aggressive diplomacy toward China,' he told VOA in a phone interview this week. Following its parliamentary elections in October, Lithuania’s new prime minister, Gintautas Paluckas, vowed to restore full diplomatic relations with China without 'humiliating' Lithuania and 'falling to our knees and begging for anything.' In an interview with the Baltic News Service on Nov. 1, Paluckas said that it is certainly an aspiration to have normal relations with China. Relations with China 'will not be very rosy,' with the two sides arguing about economic and protectionist measures, but the European Union 'is trying to maintain diplomatic relations,' he said. 'We are a sovereign country, we have no dependency on China, and nobody is trying to create one, but diplomatic relations are valuable. And one truly needs to have them,' he said. Zhao Junjie, a senior research fellow at the Institute of European Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times that Paluckas’ comments show the new Lithuania government is 'turning to more rational, pragmatic and sustainable ways' to handle relations with China. New government’s differing views Despite the new prime minister’s stated intention to resume diplomatic exchanges with Beijing, there are also differing views on how Lithuania should handle relations with China within the new government. The Lithuanian government’s latest four-year plan, which the country's Parliament approved Dec. 12, calls China 'a growing challenge' to the Baltic state’s foreign and security policies. The plan also pledges to develop economic and cultural ties with Taiwan, which China views as an inseparable part of its territory. In an interview with Baltic News Service on Dec. 3, Lithuania’s new foreign minister, Kestutis Budrys, said China bears the responsibility of initiating steps to restore diplomatic relations with Lithuania. 'It was not Lithuania that decided to downgrade the level of diplomatic representation and initiated the change of its form altogether,' Budrys said, adding that all sides across Lithuania’s political spectrum support the restoration of diplomatic ties with China if the Baltic state’s national security is ensured. Meanwhile, Lithuania’s minister of economy and innovation, Lukas Savickas, said in an interview on December 12 that the previous government’s position on China had been 'out of line' and that Lithuanian businesses have interests in the Chinese market. Experts say since the new government has explicitly presented China as a foreign policy and security challenge to Lithuania, Vilnius is unlikely to fundamentally change its policies toward China. While 'the previous government, which pursued the so-called values-based foreign policy, only vaguely mentioned China in its program, the new [government’s] program sets the boundaries in this regard much clearer,' said Raigirdas Boruta, an associate expert at Vilnius University’s Eastern Europe Studies Center. Since the new government has pledged to keep developing economic and cultural ties with Taiwan, Boruta told VOA that Lithuania is unlikely to make fundamental changes to its relationship with China under the center-left-led administration. Aggressive actor Other recent events have also added new sources of tension to the bilateral relationship. In late November, a Chinese bulk carrier carrying Russian fertilizers, Yi Peng 3, was suspected of severing two data cables in the Baltic Sea, prompting investigators from several European countries, including Sweden, Lithuania and Finland, to surround the ship and seek to conduct a thorough investigation. Additionally, Lithuania announced the expulsion of three Chinese diplomats after declaring them 'personae non gratae' on November 29. The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry said the Chinese diplomats violated the Vienna Convention and Lithuanian legislation but did not provide further details about the expulsion. Beijing condemned Lithuania’s expulsion of the Chinese diplomats, describing the move as 'provocative.' 'China reserves the right to take countermeasures against Lithuania,' the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement released on December 2. Janeliunas said these events have hardened the Lithuanian public’s impression of China as an aggressive actor in the Baltic region, making it difficult for the new government to reduce tension between the two countries. If the government 'talks about softening Lithuania’s attitude toward China, it could trigger some harsh reactions from society or some media outlets, as they question why the ruling Social Democrats are considering such a move,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lithuania-faces-tough-balancing-act-over-ties-with-china/7909134.html	2024-12-20T16:10:06-08:00	
Stopgap bill passes House to fund federal government	WASHINGTON — After two failed attempts to pass a bill to fund the U.S. government, the U.S. House passed a stopgap bill to fund the federal government through March. The vote was 366 to 34, with one member voting present. All of the 34 votes against the bill were cast by Republicans. House Republicans reached an agreement among themselves on a new proposal earlier Friday. After a lengthy meeting with Republican lawmakers, House Speaker Mike Johnson said they had agreed on a new proposal to fund the government. 'There is a unanimous agreement in the room that we need to move forward,' Johnson told reporters. 'But I expect that we will be proceeding forward. We will not have a government shutdown.' The last-ditch effort to avoid a government shutdown comes after Republicans in Congress failed on Thursday to pass a spending bill that was backed by President-elect Donald Trump. That bill would have raised the debt ceiling, which Trump had demanded at the last minute. Dozens of Republicans voted against Thursday’s bill, and only two Democrats supported it. Both chambers of Congress – the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-controlled Senate – must approve the measure in order to pass the bill and avoid a shutdown. President Joe Biden said Friday that he supports the bill and would sign it. The new plan is the same bill as the one that failed on Thursday, except without the debt ceiling suspension, according to media reports. That means it will include a clean short-term extension of government funding, billions of dollars in disaster relief and billions more in aid to farmers. Problems began for Johnson this week when he abandoned a bipartisan funding deal he had reached with Democrats after Trump and billionaire Elon Musk lambasted the plan. Without a funding extension, government funding technically runs out at midnight Friday night. But most of the impact of the shutdown wouldn’t begin to take effect until Monday. The White House on Friday echoed calls from Democratic lawmakers in urging Republicans to avoid a government shutdown. In the event of a shutdown, many government workers will be furloughed, but those who provide essential services will continue to report to their jobs. But none of those federal workers would be paid until Congress passes a new spending bill. Active-duty members of the military and federal law enforcement are among those who would continue to work but would not be paid until Congress approved a new spending plan. The threat of a shutdown comes right before Christmas. While about 59,000 of the Transportation Security Administration’s 62,000 workers are deemed essential and would continue to work without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said a shutdown would likely still cause delays at airports. The longest U.S. government shutdown in history lasted 34 days from December 2018 until January 2019, when then-President Trump refused to sign any appropriations bill that did not include several billion dollars for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. The ploy hurt his approval ratings. Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stopgap-bill-passes-house-to-fund-federal-government-/7909305.html	2024-12-20T16:02:31-08:00	
US charges Russian Israeli dual national tied to Lockbit ransomware group	washington — The United States has charged a Russian Israeli dual citizen over alleged involvement with the Lockbit ransomware group, the Justice Department said Friday. Rostislav Panev, 51, was arrested in Israel in August and is awaiting extradition to the United States, the department said. Panev was a developer at Lockbit from its inception in 2019 until at least February 2024, during which time the group grew into 'what was, at times, the most active and destructive ransomware group in the world,' the department said. 'The Justice Department's work going after the world's most dangerous ransomware schemes includes not only dismantling networks but also finding and bringing to justice the individuals responsible for building and running them,' Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. Lockbit and its malware were linked to attacks on more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries around the world, according to the department, including small businesses and large multinationals, hospitals, schools, critical infrastructure, government and law enforcement agencies. Lockbit was discovered in 2020 when its eponymous malicious software was found on Russian-language cybercrime forums. It operated a ransomware-as-a-service operation, in which a core group of developers and administrators worked with affiliates who carried out attacks. Extortion proceeds were split among the parties involved. Lockbit and its affiliates extorted at least $500 million in payments from victims, according to the Justice Department, as well as causing significant costs from lost revenue and incident response and recovery. The arrest followed two guilty pleas in July from a pair of Russian members of the Lockbit gang — Ruslan Astamirov and Mikhail Vasiliev — and the seizure in February of numerous Lockbit websites by Britain's National Crime Agency, the FBI and other international law enforcement agencies. Lockbit reappeared online not long after the seizure, defiantly saying: 'I cannot be stopped.' But law enforcement officials and experts say the bust helped damage the gang's standing in the cybercriminal underworld. Government actions 'have proven incredibly effective at dismantling and discrediting' Lockbit as a brand and bringing the group's volume of attacks down precipitously, said Jeremy Kennelly, a cybersecurity analyst with Google owner Alphabet. Affiliates and others working with the group may have shifted to collaborating with other gangs, Kennelly said, but the crackdown has been 'critical to ensuring that ransomware and extortion are seen as crimes for which there are consequences.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-charges-russian-israeli-dual-national-tied-to-lockbit-ransomware-group/7909115.html	2024-12-20T15:39:13-08:00	
Young Rohingya hope for peace in Myanmar, even as challenges persist	washington — In Myanmar's conflict-stricken northern Rakhine State, the country’s Rohingya community is facing yet another harrowing chapter. Targeted by a military junta accused of genocide, they are now enduring the forced recruitment of their young men to fight against the Arakan Army, a large ethnic armed group that has been fighting the Myanmar government for control of the region since long before the current crisis. The forced recruitment pits the Rohingya against their ethnic Rakhine neighbors, leading to further tension between the two groups. The Arakan Army declared last week that it had 'fully captured Maungdaw Township,' a region primarily inhabited by Rohingya people on Myanmar's western border with Bangladesh. In its statement, the ethnic armed group noted that it is 'pursuing members of the military junta and their allied Islamist extremist armed forces, who fled the camp without surrendering,' presumably referring to Rohingya soldiers forced to join the fight against the insurgency. According to a September report from Human Rights Watch, the Myanmar military has abducted and forcibly recruited more than 1,000 Rohingya Muslim men and boys from across Rakhine State since February 2024. Amid this escalating crisis, Zar Ni Soe, a prominent young Rohingya human rights activist, has traveled to Washington to meet with members of the U.S. government, including State Department and congressional representatives. During his trip, he spoke to VOA about his experiences and unwavering hope for peace amid the conflict. 'The Rohingya are under siege,' he said in an interview in a VOA studio. 'We are not allowed to move freely. The junta visits the IDP [internally displaced persons] camps once a month, not to provide aid but to intimidate civilians. Our lives are constantly overshadowed by fear.' The military’s use of conscription laws to arm the Rohingya against the Arakan Army has exacerbated an already dire situation. 'Young Rohingya are being forcibly recruited,' Zar Ni Soe said. 'The military threatens our people, giving them no right to refuse. This systematic oppression leaves us feeling hopeless and deeply anguished.' Myanmar’s junta has consistently denied accusations of forced conscription, framing its recruitment efforts as voluntary and aimed at maintaining national security. Rebel groups such as the Arakan Army also have been accused of using forced recruits. The Arakan Army denies that it does. Zar Ni Soe believes the root of the problem lies with Myanmar’s military dictatorship. 'The solution begins with ending the junta’s rule,' he asserted. 'As long as the military holds power, they will continue to exploit and oppress ethnic groups like the Rohingya.' ICC arrest warrant The young Rohingya activist expressed optimism about the International Criminal Court's move to seek an arrest warrant against Myanmar's military leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. Myanmar’s military rulers have rejected the arrest warrant, noting that the country is not a member of the ICC and calling the move interference in the country’s sovereignty. Zar Ni Soe has a different view. 'We, the Rohingya community, welcome this,' he said. 'This is a victory not only for us but for all of Myanmar, where the dictatorship continues to commit widespread human rights violations.' Since 2017, the United Nations has documented widespread abuses against the ethnic Rohingya under the pretext of 'territorial cleansing.' The International Court of Justice began addressing these alleged crimes in 2019 when Gambia filed a genocide case against Myanmar. 'The Rohingya’s plight gained global attention in 2017, and now the ICC’s action brings it to the forefront of international justice,' he said. While Myanmar is not an ICC member, Bangladesh is, allowing the ICC to investigate crimes partly committed on Bangladeshi soil. In October, ICC prosecutor Karim Khan requested the arrest warrant for Min Aung Hlaing on charges of deportation and persecution of the Rohingya. Arakan Army Established in 2009 by Rakhine youth leaders, the Arakan Army represents the Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group and seeks autonomy in Rakhine State, aiming to 'restore the sovereignty of the Arakan people.' As part of the Three Brotherhood Alliance – alongside the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Ta’Ang National Liberation Army – the AA has grown into a formidable force with an estimated 45,000 troops. In October 2023, the AA achieved significant gains against the military junta during the '1027' operation. This included the capture of the large military compound BGP5, built on the site of Myo Thu Gyi, a Rohingya village destroyed in 2017. The victory gave the AA control over the entire border between Rakhine State and Bangladesh for the first time since the 2021 coup. Junta attacks on AA positions have led to civilian casualties, particularly in Rohingya villages, further escalating violence. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk has condemned abuses by both the military and the AA, citing forced recruitment, extrajudicial killings and indiscriminate attacks that violate international law. Over four months, AA offensives displaced tens of thousands, including many Rohingya. On August 5, dozens of Rohingya were killed near the Naf River, underscoring their plight as they remain trapped between escalating violence and closed borders, with no safe refuge. Safe zone advocacy Zar Ni Soe recently met with State Department officials and congressional representatives to highlight urgent Rohingya issues. 'First, we called for immediate sanctions on the military council to stop airstrikes against the Rohingya and other ethnic groups,' he told VOA. 'Second, we proposed a humanitarian corridor along the Rakhine-Bangladesh border to deliver lifesaving aid.' He also urged the creation of a safe zone for the Rohingya. 'The Rohingya are among the world’s most oppressed. Without action, their situation will worsen. We asked the U.S. and Bangladesh to consider a safe zone, especially as China supports the Myanmar military in U.N. resolutions. If the U.N. fails to act, international cooperation is essential.' Spring Revolution Zar Ni Soe says he sees the nationwide resistance to the military junta – Myanmar's Spring Revolution – that followed the February 2021 coup as a globally transformative movement. 'It’s an example for the world,' he said, comparing it to East Timor’s successful struggle, where people’s determination and strong leadership prevailed. 'For the first time, the military junta, initially 500,000 strong, faces equal opposition,' Zar Ni Soe said, adding he remains confident in the revolution’s ultimate victory. Regarding the Rohingya’s hope to return to northern Rakhine State, he acknowledged difficulties, including reports of some Rohingya collaborating with the junta against the Arakan Army. He emphasized the broader goal of peaceful coexistence: 'Our main desire is harmony among all ethnic groups.' Many Rohingya refugees who fled to Bangladesh in 2017 wish to return peacefully but face barriers because of a lack of mutual willingness to resolve conflicts. Zar Ni Soe stressed that peace requires willingness from all sides. 'If the Rohingya want to return but the other side resists, the conflict will remain unresolved. With mutual cooperation, Rakhine can be rebuilt, and lasting peace achieved,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/young-rohingya-hope-for-peace-in-myanmar-even-as-challenges-persist-/7909091.html	2024-12-20T15:34:04-08:00

1 dead, 50 injured after car crashes into German Christmas market, official says	BERLIN — A car plowed into a busy outdoor Christmas market in the eastern German city of Magdeburg on Friday, leaving at least one person dead and injuring at least 50 others in what authorities suspect was an attack. The driver of the car was arrested, German news agency dpa reported, citing unidentified government officials in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The suspect was not known to German authorities as an Islamic extremist, dpa reported, citing unidentified security officials. He is believed to be about 50 years old and to have come from Saudi Arabia. More than 50 people were injured when the car drove into the market, dpa reported. Regional government spokesperson Matthias Schuppe and city spokesperson Michael Reif said they suspected it was a deliberate act. 'The pictures are terrible,' Reif said. 'My information is that a car drove into the Christmas market visitors, but I can't yet say from what direction and how far.' Magdeburg's University Hospital said it was taking care of 10 to 20 patients but was preparing for more, the German Press Agency known as dpa reported. The sounds of sirens from first responders clashed with the market's holiday decorations, including ornaments, stars and leafy garland festooning the vendors' booths. Debris could be seen on the ground in footage of a cordoned-off part of the market. 'A terrible event' The car drove into the market at around 7 p.m., when it was busy with holiday shoppers getting an early start to the weekend. 'This is a terrible event, particularly now in the days before Christmas,' Saxony-Anhalt governor Reiner Haseloff said. Haseloff told dpa that he was on his way to Magdeburg but couldn't immediately give any information on victims or what was behind the incident. Chancellor OIaf Scholz posted on X: 'My thoughts are with the victims and their relatives. We stand beside them and beside the people of Magdeburg.' Magdeburg, which is west of Berlin, is the state capital of Saxony-Anhalt and has about 240,000 residents. Attack strikes holiday tradition The suspected attack came eight years after an attack on a Christmas market in Berlin. On December 19, 2016, an Islamic extremist plowed through a crowded market with a truck, killing 13 people and injuring dozens more. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy. Christmas markets are a huge part of German culture as an annual holiday tradition cherished since the Middle Ages and successfully exported to much of the Western world. In Berlin alone, more than 100 markets opened late last month and brought the smells of mulled wine, roasted almonds and bratwurst to the capital. Other markets abound across the country. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said late last month that there were no concrete indications of a danger to Christmas markets this year, but that it was wise to be vigilant.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-50-injured-after-car-crashes-into-german-christmas-market-official-says-/7909030.html	2024-12-20T14:23:29-08:00	
US flu season is under way, as cases surge in some areas and vaccinations lag	NEW YORK — The U.S. flu season is under way, with cases surging across much of the country, health officials said Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted sharp increases in several measures, including lab tests and emergency room visits. 'It's been increasing at a pretty steady pace now for the past several weeks. So yeah, we are certainly in flu season now,' said the CDC's Alicia Budd. Thirteen states reported high or very high levels of flu-like illness last week, about double from the week before. One is Tennessee, where a sickness spike is hitting the Nashville area, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University. 'Flu has been increasing, but just this last week has exploded,' Schaffner said. He noted that in a local clinic that serves as an indicator of illness trends, as many as a quarter of the patients have flu symptoms. Louisiana is another early hot spot. 'Just this week is really that turning point where people are out because of the flu,' said Dr. Catherine O’Neal, an infectious diseases doctor at the largest private hospital in the state, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge. 'You hear parents saying, ‘I can’t come to work because of the flu’ and ‘Where can I get a flu test?’' There are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flu-like symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly. The most recent CDC data show COVID-19 hospitalizations have been declining since summer. COVID-19 activity is moderate nationally, but high in the Midwest, according to CDC wastewater data. RSV hospitalizations started rising before flu did and now show signs of possibly leveling off, but they remain a little more common than admissions for flu. Overall, RSV activity is low nationally, but high in the South, the wastewater data show. The CDC called the start of flu season based on several indicators, including lab results for patients in hospitals and doctor's offices, and the percentage of emergency department visits that had a discharge diagnosis of flu. No flu strain seems to be dominant, and it's too early in the season to know how good a match the flu vaccine will be, Budd said. Last winter's flu season was considered 'moderate' overall, but it was long — 21 weeks — and the CDC estimated there were 28,000 flu-related deaths. It was unusually dangerous for children, with 205 pediatric deaths reported. That was the highest number ever reported for a conventional flu season. The long season was likely a factor, Budd said. Another factor was a lack of flu vaccinations. Among the children who died who were old enough for flu vaccinations — and for whom their vaccination status was known — 80% were not fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Vaccination rates for children are even lower this year. As of Dec. 7, about 41% of adults had received a flu vaccination, similar to the rate at the same point last year. The percentage is the same for kids, but for them that’s a drop from a year ago, when 44% were vaccinated against the flu, according to CDC data. Vaccination rates are lower still against COVID-19, with about 21% of adults and 11% of children up to date. Flu experts suggest everyone get vaccinated, especially as people prepare to attend holiday gatherings where respiratory viruses can spread widely. 'All those gatherings that are so heartwarming and fun and joyous are also an opportunity for this virus to spread person to person,' Schaffner said. 'It's not too late to get vaccinated.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-flu-season-is-under-way-as-cases-surge-in-some-areas-and-vaccinations-lag/7909044.html	2024-12-20T13:56:22-08:00	
Thailand calls regional talks on war-torn Myanmar frank but short on agreement	BANGKOK — Thailand says regional talks it hosted Friday on a stalled peace plan for Myanmar were 'frank' but reached no consensus on a path forward. Members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, gathered in Bangkok to discuss the Five-Point Consensus the bloc agreed to in April 2021, two months after Myanmar’s military seized power from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. That coup sparked a civil war that has killed thousands and displaced more than 3 million people. In addition to an immediate cessation of violence and negotiations among 'all parties' to the conflict, the plan calls for the appointment of a special envoy to meet with all sides and assistance from ASEAN’s humanitarian aid agency. Myanmar’s junta did grant a meeting last year between Suu Kyi — who has been held in custody since the coup — and Thailand’s then-foreign minister. Some aid has also trickled in via Thailand under ASEAN’s watch. But the bloc has not appointed a permanent special envoy, and there have been no meaningful negotiations between the junta and its foes as fighting shows no signs of letting up. Friday’s talks followed a meeting in Bangkok on Thursday among Myanmar and its immediate neighbors on cross-border concerns, including crime. After Friday’s meeting, Thai Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Nikorndej Balankura told the press that the talks between the foreign ministers of Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore were 'cordial and very frank.' The bloc’s other members sent delegates but not ministers, he added. Bolbongse Vangphaen, director-general of Thailand’s Department of ASEAN Affairs, said the delegates agreed that the peace plan from 2021 would continue to anchor their efforts. 'The foreign ministers reaffirmed that the … Five-Point Consensus remains the main reference for ASEAN’s efforts in addressing the situation in Myanmar,' he said, adding that 'all recognize that there is a need to step up efforts' to see it through. 'We are aware that there are obstacles to making progress.' As for any broad agreement on how to tackle those obstacles, however, Bolbongse said 'nothing specific' came out of Friday’s talks, and that they would continue at another meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers next month. 'The meeting today was a chance for the foreign ministers and representatives to just sound out ideas and seek various approaches to see … how we could perhaps converge on some common terms to push forward,' he said. 'There’s no clear approach as yet.' David Mathieson, an independent Myanmar analyst, told VOA that Thailand was trying to create momentum on regional efforts after 'another lost year of empty diplomacy.' He called meetings among Myanmar’s immediate neighbors 'crucial' now that the junta has lost control of most borders. Those meetings, he added, are potentially more useful than ASEAN, which generally acts only when all members are in agreement. Like many of the bloc’s critics, he called the Five-Point Consensus 'effectively dead' from the start. 'It’s fundamentally flawed, depending on engaging the [State Administration Council, or SAC], who don’t want to respond,' he said, using the junta’s formal title. 'That’s where all these efforts will fail, ascribing the SAC with reason they don’t possess.' Surachanee Sriyai of Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak institute agreed that the plan 'has never been a viable path' out of the crisis for Myanmar, but at least gives the bloc the semblance of taking collective action while sticking to its norms of acting by consensus and staying out of each other’s affairs. Following Thursday’s meeting, Thailand said junta officials told the group it was open to 'inclusive political dialogue.' Junta officials, however, have labeled many of their opponents 'terrorists' and banned dozens of political parties, including Suu Kyi’s ousted National League for Democracy. Mathieson said any efforts to help Myanmar out of its crisis need to include both the junta and all opponents. That means not only the National Unity Government comprising ousted lawmakers, but all the revolutionary groups now aligned against the junta. Whether together or on their own, Surachanee said, ASEAN members should cultivate relationships with those opposition groups as they continue to gain ground on the junta, which, by some estimates, now controls less than half the country. 'Plenty of [situational reports] have pointed at the SAC losing ground and the ability to govern,' she said. 'In this way, countries, especially Thailand, should look to other alternative counterparts to work with.' Following Friday’s meeting, Bolbongse said other ASEAN members were free to 'engage with whichever groups that they may have influence on' and that those efforts could 'complement each other.' But by focusing their attention on dialogue with the junta, critics say the bloc and most of its members are legitimizing a regime that many if not most in Myanmar consider illegitimate. Asked to respond to the critique, Bolbongse said Thailand was simply engaging in state-to-state dialogue. 'Whether the SAC is seen as legitimate or not, Myanmar as a whole is still a member of ASEAN, so we are engaging with Myanmar,' he said. 'That’s all, thank you.' The junta claims its military is waging a legitimate campaign of proportionate force. But numerous well-documented accounts of violence describe indiscriminate air and artillery attacks, with many destroying churches, schools and clinics.

Erdogan says Turkey expects allies to pull support from Kurds in post-Assad Syria	ANKARA, TURKEY — Turkey expects foreign countries will withdraw support for Kurdish fighters in Syria following the toppling of Bashar al-Assad, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, as Ankara seeks to isolate Kurds who have long fought alongside U.S. troops. Germany's foreign minister later said Kurdish forces should disarm and integrate into Syria's national security structure, and Washington's top diplomat for the Middle East said the U.S. was working on a 'managed transition' for the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, in northern Syria. Speaking to reporters on the flight home from a summit in Egypt on Thursday, Erdogan said there was no longer any reason for outsiders to back Kurdish YPG fighters. His office released his comments Friday. The Kurdish YPG has been the main force in the alliance, but Turkey considers the group an extension of the PKK, which has long fought the Turkish state and is banned as a terrorist group by Ankara, Washington and the EU. In his remarks, Erdogan compared the U.S.-backed YPG to Islamic State, and he said neither group had any future in Syria. 'In the upcoming period, we do not believe that any power will continue to collaborate with terrorist organizations. The heads of terrorist organizations such as Islamic State and PKK/YPG will be crushed in the shortest possible time.' German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said after talks with her Turkish counterpart in Ankara that the security of Kurds was essential for a free Syria, but that Turkey's security concerns must also be addressed to ensure stability. 'The Kurdish groups must be disarmed and integrated into the national security structure,' she said. Barbara Leaf, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, told reporters after visiting Damascus on Friday that Washington was working with Ankara and the SDF to find 'a managed transition in terms of SDF's role in that part of the country.' 'The conditions which led Kurds in northeast Syria to organize themselves and to defend themselves as they did were one set of conditions, and things have really changed in a very dramatic fashion,' Leaf said. The United States said this week that it has 2,000 troops on the ground in Syria working alongside the YPG-led alliance known as the Syrian Democratic Forces. The SDF played a major role on the ground defeating Islamic State militants in 2014-17 with U.S. air support and still guards Islamist fighters in prison camps. Ankara, alongside Syrian allies, has mounted several cross-border offensives against the YPG-led SDF in northern Syria, while repeatedly demanding that its NATO ally Washington halt support for the fighters. Hostilities have escalated since Assad was toppled less than two weeks ago, with Turkey and Syrian groups it backs seizing the city of Manbij from the SDF on Dec. 9, prompting the United States to broker a fragile ceasefire. Erdogan told reporters that Turkey wanted to see a new Syria in which all ethnic and religious groups can live in harmony. To achieve this, 'Islamic State, the PKK and its versions which threaten the survival of Syria need to be eradicated,' he said. 'The PKK terrorist organization and its extensions in particular have reached the end of their lifespan,' Erdogan added. On Thursday, SDF commander Mazloum Abdi told Reuters that Kurdish fighters from outside Syria who had joined the group's ranks would leave if a truce were agreed with Turkey, long one of Ankara's major demands. In his remarks, Abdi acknowledged for the first time that Kurdish fighters from other countries - including PKK members - had been assisting the SDF, but he said they would no longer be needed under a truce. A Turkish Defense Ministry official said there was no talk of a ceasefire between Turkey and the SDF, adding that Ankara would continue taking counterterrorism measures until 'the PKK/YPG lays down its arms and its foreign fighters leave Syria.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/erdogan-says-turkey-expects-allies-to-pull-support-from-kurds-in-post-assad-syria/7909013.html	2024-12-20T13:19:46-08:00	
East Africa remembers victims of deadly Indian Ocean tsunami	nairobi, kenya — Mwalola wa Mwalola, a longtime fisherman in the Indian Ocean on the Kenyan coast, vividly remembers the events of the deadly tsunami of 20 years ago. Mwalola said the fisherfolk's experience and knowledge of the ocean saved his life after they sensed danger and decided to keep off the ocean on the fateful day. 'My place of work was hit, but I was not affected because I heeded the warning,' he said. 'We avoided losses because we warned our colleagues of the impending danger and asked everyone to keep off the ocean that day.' On December 26, 2004, a powerful earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra generated a devastating tsunami that was observed worldwide and caused tremendous devastation and deaths throughout the Indian Ocean region, including in East Africa. Out of the 228,000 people killed, more than 300 were from the East African countries of Somalia, Tanzania and Kenya, according to the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The disaster raised awareness about the threat tsunamis pose to coastal communities around the world and the need for improved tsunami detection, forecasting, warning and preparedness. Observers say more remains to be done in the East African countries that were affected. Shamim Wasii Nyanda, an environmental activist at the Tanzania Ocean Climate Innovation Hub in Dar es Salaam, said, 'There’s an increase of vulnerability due to climate change but also ... limited adaptation funding. Most of the coastal cities lack sufficient financial resources to implement these climate adaptation measures, particularly in urban, under-resourced communities. They do not have that kind of technology or resources for them to be able to work on these problems that we are experiencing,' especially tsunamis. Nyanda said increasing urbanization is compounding the risk. 'Coastal cities like Dar es Salaam itself have continued to expand, with informal settlements encroaching on vulnerable areas where facilities like disasterproof housing and infrastructure are not available.' People then build housing in areas where they shouldn't, 'so, when these disasters come, like the tsunami, they are not prepared. They do not have the technology. They do not have the infrastructure … and what happens? They are just swept away.' As countries observe the 20th anniversary of the 2004 tsunami, experts say preparedness, prevention and mitigation measures are key in preventing such disasters in the future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/east-africa-remembers-victims-of-deadly-indian-ocean-tsunami-/7908999.html	2024-12-20T13:03:47-08:00	
Teen stabs 7-year-old girl to death at school in Croatia	A 7-year-old girl was stabbed to death Friday at an elementary school in Croatia by a knife-wielding teenager who also wounded three other children and a teacher, officials said. Video footage Friday showed children running away from the school as a medical helicopter was landing. The attacker is a former student of the Precko Elementary School in Zagreb where the attack took place, according to Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic. The teen had a history of mental health issues and after Friday's incident 'shut himself in a nearby health center where he tried to injure himself with the knife,' according to Bozinovic. Police were able to prevent him from committing suicide. Last year, the teen also tried to kill himself, the minister said. 'Five persons have been hospitalized, and their lives are not in danger,' Croatian Health Minister Irena Hrstic said, including the attacker in the count. Leaders declare day of mourning School attacks are rare in Croatia. 'There are no words to describe the grief over the horrible and unthinkable tragedy that shocked us all today,' said President Zoran Milanovic. 'We are horrified,' said Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic. Following the assault at the school, Croatian officials declared Saturday as a day of mourning. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/teen-stabs-croatian-7-year-old-to-death-at-school/7908973.html	2024-12-20T13:02:13-08:00	
Hostage envoy: Syria’s vast secret prison network complicates efforts to find Austin Tice	WASHINGTON — A network of secret prisons run by the former Syrian government is more extensive than the U.S. had realized, and is complicating efforts to find American journalist Austin Tice, the U.S. hostage envoy said Friday. The U.S. government initially estimated Syria had around 10 to 20 secret prisons, but there may be 40 or more, the chief envoy for hostage negotiations Roger Carstens told reporters Friday, following a brief trip to the Syrian capital, Damascus. 'I’ve been rather amazed at the amount of secret prisons that Assad seems to have amassed,' Carstens said, referring to former President Bashar al-Assad. 'They’re in little clusters at times. Sometimes they’re in the far reaches of Damascus.' The scale of the prison network has made it harder to locate Tice, according to Carstens. A Texas native and former U.S. Marine, Tice has been held in Syria since 2012, when he was detained at a checkpoint in Damascus. Aside from a brief video after his capture, little has been heard or seen of him. Over the past 12 years, the U.S. government has pinpointed about six prisons where Tice was believed to have likely been, Carstens said. But new information means as many as three more facilities have been added to the list. Limited resources makes checking them a difficult endeavor, Carstens said. In the absence of sufficient U.S. government personnel on the ground, non-governmental organizations, journalists and Syria's transitional government have been searching for Tice. 'In a perfect world, we’ll find Austin and bring him home, and we’ll stop the search,' Carstens said. 'We’re not going to stop until we find the information we need to conclude what has happened to Austin, where he is, to return him home to his family.' One of the nonprofits involved in the search, Hostage Aid Worldwide, has a team on the ground in Syria. The group’s president, Nizar Zakka, told VOA one barrier is not having enough people to help with the searches. 'It’s ridiculous,' Zakka said. 'I need a team.' In the aftermath of the Assad government’s collapse this month, thousands of prisoners have been released from facilities run by the government. That has raised hopes among the Tice family that Austin will be among them. 'I feel like we’re standing in line, and we’re not the only ones that are still standing in line,' Tice’s mother Debra told reporters Monday. 'We just need to get all those prisons opened, get all those families reunited, including us.' Tice is an award-winning freelance journalist and photographer who worked for outlets including The Washington Post, CBS and McClatchy. He is the longest-held American journalist abroad. Shortly before the Assad government fell, the Tice family revealed that it had received information from a source vetted by the U.S. government that confirmed Austin was alive and held in the Damascus area. Last week, Debra Tice wrote to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asking Israel to pause strikes in a part of Syria where her son may be held. Debra Tice told the Israeli leader her family had 'credible information' that her son may be held in a prison in the mountains outside Damascus underneath a military museum. Asked whether the U.S. government had received any new information that would reinforce the belief that Tice was still alive, Carstens said, 'The information that we have right now doesn't confirm either one way or the other.' Earlier this month, U.S. President Joe Biden said he believed Tice was still alive and that the United States was committed to securing his release. The president did not elaborate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hostage-envoy-syria-s-vast-secret-prison-network-complicates-efforts-to-find-austin-tice/7908975.html	2024-12-20T13:00:58-08:00	
UN official calls for end to siege of El Fasher in Sudan's North Darfur	GENEVA — United Nations human rights chief Volker Türk is calling for an end to the siege of El Fasher in Sudan's North Darfur state, which has resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths and injuries, and the widespread destruction of homes and infrastructure. 'The continuing siege of El Fasher and the relentless fighting are devastating lives everyday on a massive scale,' Türk said in a statement Friday to coincide with the release of a report describing the devastating impact of the seven-month-long siege of El Fasher in Sudan by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. 'This alarming situation cannot continue. The Rapid Support Forces must end the horrible siege. And I urge all parties to the conflict to stop attacks on civilians and civilian objects … and to comply with their obligations and commitments under international law,' he said. Since the siege of El Fasher, the capital of Sudan's North Darfur state, began in May, the report finds at least 782 civilians have been killed and more than 1,143 injured. Fighting displaces millions The RSF and Sudan National Forces have been battling for control of the country since April 2023. Since the RSF and Sudanese warlords made a power grab, plunging the country into chaos, more than 11.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes. About 8.5 million are displaced inside Sudan. Another 3 million have fled as refugees to neighboring countries. Additionally, the United Nations reports more than half of Sudan's population or 26.5 million are suffering from acute hunger, with thousands on the brink of famine. Authors of the report say the findings indicate a persistent disregard of international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict, 'as evidenced by the indiscriminate use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated urban areas and direct attacks against civilians and civilian objects, including attacks on health facilities.' Seif Magango, a spokesperson for human rights chief Türk, told journalists in Geneva on Friday that the RSF, Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF, and their allies 'have turned the city into a battleground' from which there is no escape. 'There has been regular and intense shelling by the RSF of densely populated residential areas, recurrent airstrikes by the SAF, and artillery shelling by both the SAF and its Allied Joint Forces. 'Residential neighborhoods, markets, hospitals and camps hosting internally displaced people have been struck,' Magango said. Survivors who fled El Fasher have testified that intense artillery shelling by the RSF on densely populated residential areas and recurrent airstrikes by the SAF and Joint Forces 'in most cases were conducted without warning despite the presence of thousands of civilians.' The U.N. human rights report accuses the warring parties of the indiscriminate use of explosive weapons in populated areas. It says the Zamzam Camp, which hosts hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people, and where famine has been declared, has been shelled repeatedly. It says the Abu Shouk IDP camp, northwest of El Fasher, housing more than 100,000 internally displaced people from African tribes, has been subjected to recurrent artillery shelling by the RSF, 'amounting to direct attacks on civilians and civilian objects.' Between May 9 and November 28, the U.N. human rights office has documented 13 attacks on health facilities, most attributed to and 'deliberately targeted' by the RSF. For example, it notes the Al-Saudi Maternity Hospital, in western El Fasher, 'has been repeatedly shelled since the start of the hostilities.' 'This is the last remaining public hospital in the city with the capacity to perform surgery and provide sexual and reproductive health services, including necessary medical care for survivors of sexual violence,' it says, noting that 'this is particularly tragic as there has been a surge in cases of sexual violence since the siege began.' Monitors track sexual violence reports Human rights monitors have documented numerous reports of sexual violence against women and girls during the siege and as they fled El Fasher after May 2024. The report quotes a reliable source who says the 20 to 40 victims of sexual violence reaching service providers each month 'is considered to be significantly underreported due to stigma and artillery shelling that restricted movement.' 'Attacks on civilians and civilian objects may amount to war crimes,' Magango said. 'This alarming situation cannot be allowed to continue. All parties to the conflict must refrain from attacks on civilians and civilian objects and respect international law.' The report's authors express concern about a buildup of SAF-allied Joint Forces in the densely populated Zamzam camp. This, coupled with the increased mobilization of fighters along tribal lines across Darfur, they say, 'indicates preparations for further hostilities may be under way.' 'Any large-scale attack on Zamzam camp and El Fasher city will catapult civilian suffering to catastrophic levels, deepening the already dire humanitarian situation, including famine conditions,' warned High Commissioner Türk in Friday's statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-official-calls-for-end-to-siege-of-el-fasher-in-sudan-s-north-darfur-/7908880.html	2024-12-20T12:15:35-08:00	
Taiwan lawmakers brawl over bills that would 'damage democracy'	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwanese lawmakers tackled and doused each other with water on Friday as President Lai Ching-te's party tried to block the passage of bills they say could harm the self-ruled island's 'democratic system.' Scores of lawmakers from Lai's Democratic Progressive Party, or DPP, occupied the podium of the parliament's main chamber since Thursday night and barricaded themselves inside — piling up chairs to block entrances. The DPP parliamentarians were attempting to stop three legal amendments proposed by the opposition bloc that would make it more difficult for voters to oust elected officials who they see as unfit. 'Parliamentary dictatorship,' some DPP lawmakers shouted to criticize the opposition Kuomintang, or KMT, party and its ally Taiwan People's Party, or TPP, for trying to pass the bills with their majority. 'If the KMT forcefully passes the amendments ... Taiwan's democratic self-checking and self-repairing mechanism will be gone, and it will also cause significant and irreversible damage to Taiwan's civil society and democratic system,' the ruling party said in a statement. 'At a time when Taiwan's democracy is being violated and damaged, we must stand up and take action,' it said. Among the disputed bills was a planned revision to the Public Officials Election and Recall Act pressed ahead by the KMT and TPP to raise the threshold for removing elected officials. The Beijing-friendly KMT said it would prevent the power of recalls from 'being abused,' but some DPP lawmakers said they fear the move would revoke voters' rights to remove unfit officials. Han Kuo-yu, the current parliament speaker from the KMT, was ousted in 2020 as mayor of southern Kaohsiung city following a failed presidential bid. Outside the parliament on Friday, thousands of people gathered to protest the bills, shouting 'return the evil amendments' and 'defend Taiwan.' 'I am here to protest the opposition parties for trying to confiscate the people's rights to recall,' graduate student David Chen told AFP. Earlier this year, reform bills expanding parliament's powers pushed by the opposition sparked brawls among lawmakers and massive street demonstrations. Proponents of the expansion say it is needed to curb corruption, but critics fear the laws could weaken Taiwan's democracy against the influence of China, which claims the island as part of its territory. In October, Taiwan's Constitutional Court struck out the most controversial sections of the law, delivering a partial victory to the DPP.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-lawmakers-brawl-over-bills-that-would-damage-democracy-/7908822.html	2024-12-20T11:26:49-08:00

Elon Musk considers funding Nigel Farage's populist party in UK	LONDON — It’s a photo that sent a tremor through British politics: Elon Musk flanked by British politician Nigel Farage and a wealthy backer, in front of a gilt-framed painting of a young Donald Trump. Taken this week at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, the image suggested that Musk, a key player in the incoming U.S. administration, could soon turn his disruptive attention to the U.K. Farage, Trump’s highest-profile British champion, confirmed talks are under way about Musk making a hefty donation to Farage's party, Reform U.K. The Times of London reported it could be as much as $100 million, which would be far and away the largest political donation in U.K. history. The reports have sparked calls for Britain’s rules on political donations to be tightened — quickly. 'We did discuss money,' Farage told broadcaster GB News after the meeting with Musk. 'That’s a negotiation we will go back and have again. He is not against giving us money. He hasn’t fully decided whether he will.' Britain has strict limits on how much political parties can spend on elections, but they can accept unlimited donations, as long as the donors are U.K. voters or companies registered in Britain. Musk’s social network X has a British arm, Twitter U.K. Ltd., with a registered address in London. Critics say that’s a loophole that allows foreign influence in U.K. politics. The voting watchdog, the Electoral Commission, is calling for changes, including limiting the amount a company can donate to how much it earns in Britain. 'It’s crucial that U.K. voters have trust in the financing of our political system,' the commission's chief executive, Vijay Rangarajan, told The Guardian. 'The system needs strengthening, and we have been calling for changes to the law since 2013, to protect the electoral system from foreign interference.' Britain’s center-left Labour Party pledged during the summer election campaign to tighten the rules on political donations, although legislation is not scheduled in the coming year. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson Dave Pares said Wednesday that work is already under way to 'reinforce existing safeguards' against 'impermissible proxy donations.' The Labour government and the right-of-center opposition Conservatives are trying to figure out how to deal with Musk, who has taken a keen interest in the U.K. — and seemingly formed a strong dislike for Starmer. Musk often posts on X about the U.K., retweeting criticism of Starmer and the hashtag TwoTierKeir — shorthand for an unsubstantiated claim that Britain has 'two-tier policing,' with far-right protesters treated more harshly than pro-Palestinian or Black Lives Matter demonstrators. Musk has compared British attempts to weed out online misinformation to the Soviet Union, and during summer anti-immigrant violence across the U.K. tweeted that 'civil war is inevitable.' Farage has echoed some of those themes in his own social media output and his party’s anti-'woke' agenda, which includes pledges to slash immigration, scrap green-energy targets and leave the European Convention on Human Rights. Founded in 2021, Reform U.K. is the latest in a string of small hard-right parties led by Farage that have had limited electoral success but an outsized influence on British politics. Farage’s opposition to the European Union helped push the country toward voting in 2016 to leave the bloc, a seismic political and economic break with the U.K.’s nearest neighbors. Reform U.K. won just five of the 650 seats in the House of Commons in July’s election, but it came second in dozens more and secured 14% of the vote. Now it is pushing for fast growth, trying to professionalize its previously ramshackle organization and holding gatherings around the U.K. to recruit new members. Farage, a strong communicator who has embraced TikTok and other platforms, aims to emulate Trump’s success in using the power of personality and social media to reach the 'bro vote' — young men who are traditionally less likely to turn out at election time. Farage told GB News that Musk has 'already given me considerable help – understanding the process from start to finish, reaching disaffected communities who frankly feel there’s no point voting for anybody.' The electoral power of social media was on show recently in Romania, where far-right candidate Calin Georgescu came from nowhere to win the first round of the presidential election in November, aided in part by a flood of TikTok videos promoting his campaign. Amid allegations that Russia had organized the social media campaign to back Georgescu, Romania’s Constitutional Court canceled the presidential election runoff two days before it was due to take place. With Britain’s Conservative Party trying to recover from its worst election result since 1832, Farage dreams of making Reform the main opposition — or even the government — after the next election, due by 2029. That’s a long shot, but Rob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester, said a big donation from Musk could have 'disruptive potential in all sorts of ways.' He said Musk’s money would give Reform 'the opportunity to try and build up a serious campaign organization, which is something that they have generally lacked.' 'It’s certainly adding a new joker to the pack of cards in British politics,' Ford said. 'We’ve had no shortage of surprising developments here in the past few years. And maybe this is the next one.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/elon-musk-considers-funding-nigel-farage-s-populist-party-in-uk/7908618.html	2024-12-20T09:06:51-08:00	
US hostage envoy arrives in Syria as part of search for Austin Tice	WASHINGTON — A group of U.S. diplomats were in Syria to hold talks Friday with the country’s new leaders and seek information about the whereabouts of detained American journalist Austin Tice, following the fall of President Bashar al-Assad’s government. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf, former special envoy for Syria Daniel Rubinstein, and the Biden administration’s chief envoy for hostage negotiations, Roger Carstens, are scheduled to hold talks with Syria’s interim leaders, the State Department said early Friday. 'They hope to uncover information about the fate of Austin Tice, Majd Kamalmaz, and other American citizens who disappeared under the Assad regime,' a State Department spokesperson said. A Texas native and former U.S. Marine turned journalist, Tice has been held in Syria since 2012, when he was detained at a checkpoint in Damascus. Aside from a brief video after his capture, little has been heard or seen of him since. The longest-held American journalist abroad, Tice freelanced for outlets including The Washington Post, CBS and McClatchy. Kamalmaz, a Syrian-American psychologist who was treating refugees from the war-torn country, was stopped at a government checkpoint in 2017. He had traveled to Syria to check on an elderly relative. In May 2024, the U.S. learned Kamalmaz had died in custody. In a statement released in June, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, 'The Syrian government must answer for what happened to Majd.' His family in July filed a lawsuit against the Syrian government for wrongful death and false imprisonment. The fall of the Assad government this month has fostered cautious optimism among Tice’s family that he will be among the thousands of prisoners being released. 'What we’re hoping is that as people that are coming into Damascus are opening the prisons, that, by the power of God, they’ll open the one that Austin’s in,' Tice’s mother Debra told VOA last week. Tice’s family said this month that it has received credible information from a source vetted by the U.S. government that confirms Tice is alive and indicates he may be detained in the Damascus area. The U.S. government has said it believes that Tice is still alive and that locating his whereabouts is a priority. Syria’s transitional government has said the search for Tice is ongoing. The trip Friday is the first time American diplomats have formally visited Syria in more than a decade. The U.S. closed its embassy in Damascus in 2012. 'They will be engaging directly with the Syrian people, including members of civil society, activists, members of different communities, and other Syrian voices about their vision for the future of their country and how the United States can help support them,' the State Department spokesperson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-hostage-envoy-arrives-in-syria-as-part-of-search-for-austin-tice/7908566.html	2024-12-20T08:23:22-08:00

Israeli settlers accused of setting fire to and vandalizing West Bank mosque	Palestinian residents in Israel’s occupied West Bank city of Marda reported Friday that Israeli settlers set fire to and vandalized a mosque, writing slurs and threatening slogans in spray paint on its walls. In security video taken from the scene, a masked and hooded person can be seen spray-painting the walls of the mosque. At least two others join the person, one of them carrying what appears to be a large jug or container as they head into the building. Among the messages sprayed on the wall were 'Death to Arabs,' and 'the righteous will rejoice because he sees revenge,' a quote from the Hebrew Bible's book of Psalms. In a video statement Friday, Marda village council chief Nasfat al-Khufash called it a systematic terror attack. 'A number of settlers set fire and attempted an attack on a wider scale on the mosque,' he said. 'These attacks are continuous and systematic by settler groups.' Israeli police and the Israeli security agency Shin Bet security services said in a joint statement: 'We see this incident as extremely serious and will act resolutely to bring the perpetrators to justice for rigorous trial.' Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported, in a statement posted to the social media platform X, Israeli Air Force fighter jets — under the direction of Israeli intelligence and the Israeli Navy — struck Houthi militant targets overnight on the western coast of Yemen as well as deeper in the country. The statement said it hit fuel and oil tanks, two power plants and eight tugboats. The IDF said hitting the targets 'severely harms the military operations of the Houthi forces.' The IDF said the Iranian-backed Houthi militants have 'carried out repeated attacks on the State of Israel, in which unmanned aerial vehicles and surface-to-surface missiles were launched toward the country's territory.' Also Friday, Sweden announced it was ending funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees — known as UNRWA. Sweden’s international aid chief, Benjamin Dousa, made the announcement on Swedish television, saying the decision came following Israeli lawmakers passing a ban on the agency from working in Gaza. Israel has long claimed UNRWA was a front for terrorists. Sweden said it plans to increase its aid to Gaza in the next year but will do so through other aid agencies. In a statement Friday, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini called the decision 'disappointing' and said it comes at the worst time for Palestine refugees. The agency chief said it will double the suffering the people of Gaza have 'endured over the past 14 months since the horrendous Hamas attack on 7 October and the ongoing war.' Lazzerini said he hopes Sweden reconsiders its decision. The war in Gaza was triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Gaza health officials say Israel’s counteroffensive has killed at least 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, while Israel says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas combatants. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, Britain, the European Union and others.

Interview: Biden administration pushes for Sudan ceasefire in remaining weeks	UNITED NATIONS — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $200 million in new humanitarian funding for the Sudanese people at a high-level Sudan meeting he chaired Thursday at the U.N. Security Council, bringing total U.S. support to Sudan to more than $2.3 billion since fighting began among rival generals in April 2023. U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan Tom Perriello spoke to VOA U.N. Correspondent Margaret Besheer on the sidelines of the council meeting. He said the outgoing administration of U.S. President Joe Biden wants to consolidate humanitarian progress and move toward a ceasefire, even a temporary one, in its remaining weeks. Once allies in Sudan's transitional government after a 2021 coup, Sudanese Armed Forces General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Rapid Support Forces General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo have become bitter rivals for power. Fighting erupted between their forces in the capital, Khartoum, last year. It has since spread across Sudan, causing widespread atrocities and killing, and one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises. The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. VOA: U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan Tom Perriello, thank you for talking to VOA today. You have one month to go for the Biden administration. What do you realistically think you can achieve in the remaining weeks on Sudan? U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan Tom Perriello: Well, one of the things that Secretary Blinken made clear today at the United Nations is that we're going to use every second we've got, and we've got some momentum. We're in the fifth straight month of breaking the largest humanitarian embargo in the world, but we have so much more to do. We've seen four times more food and medicine moving into Sudan than we saw just a few months ago, and each one of those is food and medicine reaching a mother or a child that's been malnourished for months in places like Zamzam camp or Kadugli in South Kordofan. We're getting the convoys moving, including the first convoy into parts of southern Khartoum since the war began almost two years ago. So, we have got a lock in those humanitarian gains that are saving lives. But ultimately, we've got to move towards a ceasefire, even a temporary ceasefire, from the parties, to give some relief to the horrific conditions that millions of Sudanese people are facing. VOA: And how do you hope to move toward that temporary ceasefire? Might you convene another meeting of the ALPS [Aligned for Advancing Lifesaving and Peace in Sudan] before January 20th? Perriello: I just came yesterday from Mauritania, where we were meeting with the African Union, the United Nations, the Arab League and others, about how we can move towards expanding both local and national ceasefire efforts. It was a big statement for Secretary Blinken to sit at the council today in the U.N. And you heard from the Algerians and the other African leaders this idea that we've got to give more urgency to this ceasefire. ... This famine and this war was a war of choice by men who were willing to let the Sudanese people suffer, and those same men can help bring it to an end if we can get the regional actors in Africa and in the Gulf to align on an effort to put a pause in the fighting and restore the civilian transition. VOA: Would you say the two generals are the biggest obstacle to peace? Is this just about their egos? Or does it go deeper? Perriello: Well, certainly it was a big part of what started this war. But really, you have to go back a few steps and remember it was Generals Hemeti [Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo] and [Abdel Fattah] al-Burhan joining forces to overthrow the civilian transition that had inspired the world in 2019. And there are many forces behind both of them that want to prevent the people of Sudan from having the power over their future. And we continue to see that with extremist groups and others who want to profit from this war, whether it's groups like the National Congress party of the former Bashir era, that know the people wouldn't support them having power, and they're using this war to come back to power. We see some of the tribal leaders who should be some of the strongest voices for peace, instead of figuring out how to profit off of the famine and off of the war, we see countries that have engaged and are willing to continue to see that suffering of the Sudanese people. But we've also seen neighboring countries show the welcomeness ... to accept millions of refugees. We've seen efforts in the region to work with us on these local ceasefire efforts, including some of these humanitarian corridors. So, it's important that we not use the level of the crisis as an excuse to do nothing, because when we've engaged, we've been able to make a difference. And I think that's what Secretary Blinken was trying to remind the council today. VOA: What will it take to get the two generals to the negotiating table? Perriello: Well, first of all, I think we'll continue to try to push them to the table, but what we showed with the ALPS efforts in Switzerland on humanitarian access is you don't need a table anymore. We have telephones. We have proximity talks. What we need is the political will, and we appreciate that countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt and others are continuing to try to support these peace efforts. We think the African Union has a role to play. And the American people, in the same way we've seen Americans show just so much compassion in crisis after crisis around the world, we need folks to see these young people with the Mutual Aid Sudan and elsewhere that are risking their lives to get food and medicine into their communities. They need that support and attention from us. It's also something, quite frankly, that has really strong bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, including from a recent letter this week from both Republican and Democratic senators trying to draw more attention to the crisis in Sudan. So, it needs all of us to pay more attention, but most of all, it needs the people with guns and the people supplying guns to all sides in Sudan, to put those down and become partners in peace. VOA: You mentioned, and Secretary Blinken mentioned in the council, that there's a lot of external interference in the war in Sudan. There's credible evidence the UAE has been fueling the violence and supplying the RSF with arms. Why has the Biden administration been reluctant to really exert significant public pressure on the UAE? Perriello: Well, you saw some powerful testimony today at the Security Council about this issue, about foreign interference and the role certain countries are playing to fuel this conflict. The Biden administration has really led the way on putting pressure on all of the external actors to stop fueling this war and inviting them to be partners in peace, both ending the famine and trying to end this war. [U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.] Linda Thomas-Greenfield helped push for an extension of the Darfur arms embargo — and also the first sanctions for violating that arms embargo in over 15 years. We are going to continue with our sanctions and with our diplomacy to raise the costs of those that are fueling this conflict, but also to continue to invite in those who want to be partners for not just peace for the Sudanese people, but how we rebuild Sudan and how we restore that civilian transition. Secretary Blinken announced today an additional $30 million with Congress to support civil society, particularly women and youth, who have continued to inspire us in Sudan, to help rebuild that political dialogue and that path — the only real path forward — which is a unified civilian front into peace and democracy. VOA: There are reports that the State Department is considering a genocide declaration. Why the reluctance to use the 'genocide' word? Perriello: Far from reluctance, the State Department's really been leading the way. I mean, as someone who was in Darfur more than 20 years ago when the genocide was happening. When I was out of government a year ago, I was proud that the State Department led the way on declaring the acts of ethnic cleansing that we heard about from the Sultan of the Masalit today. Called out the crimes against humanity. We'll continue to look at where the facts lead in terms of other designations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/interview-biden-administration-pushes-for-sudan-ceasefire-in-remaining-weeks-/7908494.html	2024-12-20T07:21:21-08:00	
Mozambique begins building shelter for victims of Cyclone Chido	MAPUTO, MOZAMBIQUE — Mozambique began constructing homes for victims of Cyclone Chido this week after the storm swept through three of the country's northern regions Sunday, killing at least 70 people and injuring 600 others as it left behind a trail of destruction. On a visit to affected areas, Trade and Industry Minister Silvino Moreno said that the government is working to provide aid to storm victims and that international partners are pitching in to help. Addressing the media after a stop in the province of Nampula, one of the regions affected by the cyclone, Moreno said the priority is constructing shelter with resilient materials. He said the goal is to avoid the destruction of homes built with poor material. Almost all of the houses in affected areas were constructed with mud and reeds that never stood a chance against the powerful cyclone. Moreno said the people need better construction training. Before hitting Mozambique, Cyclone Chido caused significant devastation in Mayotte, a set of French islands. This resulted in fatalities, infrastructure damage and increased risks for vulnerable communities, including asylum-seekers and refugees, according to humanitarian agencies. In southern Malawi, the storm brought strong winds and rains, leading to the destruction of houses and infrastructure in several areas. Mozambique’s meteorology agency said the country should expect more storms during the next three months of the rainy season and called for better preparation. According to UNICEF, at least 174,000 people have been affected overall, but the numbers may increase as assessments continue. In addition to homes damaged, at least several thousand classrooms were destroyed and 20 health facilities hit. UNICEF’s field office head in Mozambique’s Zambezia province, Michael Chimedza, told VOA that his organization has requisitioned items so it can immediately respond to 50,000 people. He said the agency has provided funds for response training at the local level. Besides Nampula, the cyclone tore through Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, leaving more than 25,000 families without electricity and damaging key infrastructure, including health units, roads and water supply sources. In a region already fighting a cholera outbreak, the latest devastation creates an ominous likelihood that the outbreak will further worsen, aid agencies said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-begins-building-shelter-for-victims-of-cyclone-chido/7908468.html	2024-12-20T07:07:43-08:00	
Africa's changing political scenes, laws spark disputes with mining firms	Nairobi — Africa's mining sector is witnessing a surge in legal disputes in the Sahel and Central Africa, as mining companies face increasing scrutiny in the countries in which they operate. The disputes stem from tax and customs audits, and a lack of expertise in managing finance, arbitration, and change in legislations in some countries. In a statement Wednesday, officials with the Barrick Gold Corporation said its operating entities in Mali submitted a request for arbitration to the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID, to address the disagreement with the Mali government regarding the Loulo-Gounkoto complex. Barrick, the world’s second-largest gold miner, and the Mali military government have been in a dispute over new mining rules since 2023. The new rules seek to give the state and local private investors a 35 percent interest in mining projects, up from 20 percent. The International Arbitration, or ICSID, registered cases in six sub-Saharan countries this year: Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Senegal, South Sudan, and Tanzania. Of the cases filed by investors and countries, 28 percent were in the oil, gas, and mining sectors, the highest. Beverly Ochieng is a senior analyst with Control Risks, a firm specializing in political, security, and integrity risks. She says inward-looking countries and mineral rights are causing authorities to clash with mining firms. 'Across the continent, there has been this bigger drive toward resource nationalism whereby countries feel that because they are the biggest stakeholders of those resources, whether its gold, zinc, uranium, they ought to put in legislation or update their legislation to make sure that the government earns a lot more. So, it hasn’t quite led to disputes in other countries in a way it publicly played out in Mali, but it is bound to raise some concerns on how that transition happens,' said Ochieng. Mining experts argue that political instability, particularly in countries like Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, changes in mining laws and alliances have affected companies that have been mining in those countries for decades. Some countries have shut down mining sites because of alleged environmental damage and failure to remit taxes to the government. Disputes between companies and states arise from changes in government, insecurity, political instability, tax evasion, tribal authority, and environmental and social issues. Paul Ogendi teaches law at the University of Nairobi. He says strong governance and rule of law are crucial for effective dispute resolution and preventing conflict and suffering. 'We need to have the governance structure operating so that the judiciary and other arbitration or other dispute mechanisms can operate,' he said. 'If we don’t have strong governance and institutions, particularly working under the rule of law, it will be a waste of time to go to court or any other forum to arbitrate or resolve your dispute because the players will ignore it and will continue destabilizing the region and this will continue to spur a conflict and the suffering of the people.' Geopolitical tensions are also influencing some African countries' decisions to deny or revoke licenses of some companies and give them to their newfound friends, like China and Russia. Ochieng says African nations are diversifying partnerships, while Western operators face regulatory challenges as new players reshape the landscape. 'It also allows African countries to diversify their partners and to strengthen their own resources,' he said. 'It will take a very long time for that to happen, but it’s not necessarily the biggest threat for Western operators. For Western operators it’s the issue of compliance and ensuring they have an understanding of how these governments, various governments have various factors of compliance that they need to adhere to. The emergence of a new place is definitely going to change that environment, and it's going to be seen as an opportunity or a threat depending on who is assessing it.' The ICSID says 88 proceedings were concluded in 2024. Of these, 71 percent were settled by the tribunal, and 29 percent were settled or proceedings discontinued. This year, Tanzania reached an agreement with Canadian company Montero Mining and Exploration Limited over a licensing dispute and agreed to pay $27 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/africa-s-changing-political-scenes-laws-spark-disputes-with-mining-firms-/7908471.html	2024-12-20T07:06:15-08:00

Myanmar military appears to be using Thai fisherman as leverage, experts say	Myanmar’s recent arrest and sentencing of four Thai fishermen has heightened tensions between the Southeast Asian neighbors with some analysts telling VOA the move appears to be aimed at gaining legitimacy and recognition ahead of high-level government meetings in Bangkok this week. Earlier this week, a Myanmar court in Kawthoung sentenced the owner of a seized fishing vessel to six years in prison, and three other fisherman received four-year prison terms. The sentencing comes as Thailand’s foreign ministry continues talks for their release and as Myanmar is the focus of high-level government meetings in Bangkok. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist in Bangkok at Chulalongkorn University tells VOA that it’s clear that Myanmar is using the fishermen to leverage its own interests. 'The detention of Thai fisherman is designed to gain leverage over the Thai government in return for more official engagement and recognition of the State Administration Council,' Thitinan said. The State Administration Council, or SAC, is the official name of Myanmar’s military led government. 'This makes Thailand look kind of weak. This has been going on for some time, it’s not the first time for sure, but suddenly it has become a thorny issue,' Thitinan said. Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington who focuses on Southeast Asia politics, agrees. 'I think that the generals, in their Neanderthal-ish way, are using them to maintain Thailand’s full support,' he said, adding that it risks backfiring if they hold the fishermen too long. 'The Thai government is as supportive of the junta as it could be, but there will be a public backlash at some point.' Myanmar’s military led government has said little about the sentencing of the fishermen or when they might be released. VOA reached out to the SAC for comment but as of press has not received a response. Fishing disputes have long been a point of friction between the two countries but late last month Myanmar’s navy fired upon 15 Thai fishing vessels on the west coast off Ranong province in southern Thailand. Both Thai and Myanmar authorities blame each other for the incident. Dominic Thomson, regional director of Southeast Asia for the Environmental Justice Foundation, says the incident was the first of its kind in a long time. 'There have been no reports of similar incidences since at least 2015. The nature of the incident, coupled with the detention of the fishing vessels and crew is unprecedented,' he told VOA via in an emailed response earlier this month. One Thai national drowned during the altercation, while four Thai crew members were detained along with 27 Myanmar nationals. Myanmar authorities also seized one fishing vessel, the Sor Charoenchai 8. Fast forward two weeks and Bangkok is now hosting two meetings with representatives from Myanmar, Bangladesh, China, India, Laos and Malaysia. The meetings are focused on border security, transnational crime, ASEAN and the Myanmar’s crisis. The first meeting in Bangkok was held on Thursday. On Friday, a meeting centering on ASEAN’s role on Myanmar’s crisis is set to take place. The recent maritime altercation has added to bilateral tensions between Thailand and Myanmar’s military government ahead of the meetings. Nearly four years after the Min Aung Hlaing and his troops staged a coup in February 2021, removing the democratically elected government, Myanmar is in a state of nationwide conflict. Over the past year, the junta has been losing territory, with pro-democracy and ethnic armed groups in coalition to defeat military rule. Over 60% of Myanmar is not under the military’s control. At the same time, Myanmar is under increasing pressure to end the violence and hold an election next year. Thitinan says for Thailand to engage the Myanmar junta in such a high-level way is 'problematic' and that it’s no surprise that the Myanmar military is dragging the fisherman issue on. 'The question is why Thailand is suddenly giving in to this demand and leverage from the [State Administration Council]. The SAC is playing hardball here, to get recognition for legitimacy, and Thailand is playing along,' he said. The fisherman case dragging on is not surprising, the SAC is going to drag it on and milk it. It is surprising because in the medium long term it is detrimental. Engaging the SAC is very problematic because they are losing the civil war, and the future of Myanmar is not in favor of the SAC,' he added. For their part, Thai officials have sought to play down the incident. Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra says relations between Myanmar and Thailand remain strong, according to She said the four fishermen will be released on January 4, which, if it goes through, will be exactly five weeks since they were detained. Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura speaking on behalf of Thailand’s Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa says fisherman issue has already been discussed between the two countries in Thursday’s meeting. 'Our Thai Foreign Minister also had the opportunity to have bilateral meetings with the Myanmar foreign minister. They discussed key issues such as regarding the case of the four Thai fisherman,' Nikorndej told a press conference. 'The Thai Foreign Minister receives official assurance from the Myanmar side that all four Thai nationals will be released soon. Both countries will cooperate in promoting understanding and preventing recurrence of issues of the same nature,' he said. Thitinan, however, believes the meetings in Bangkok may not be the end of the issue. 'I would not be surprised if the Foreign Minister of Thailand Maris goes over to Naypyitaw next week or the coming days to clear up this issue,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-military-appears-to-be-using-thai-fisherman-as-leverage-experts-say-/7908345.html	2024-12-20T05:57:34-08:00	
Elon Musk gives nod to German far-right party as election looms	U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, set to join President-elect Donald Trump's administration, waded into Germany's election campaign on Friday, calling the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) the country's savior. The AfD is running second in opinion polls and might be able to thwart either a center-right or center-left majority, but Germany's mainstream, more centrist parties have vowed to shun support from the AfD at national level. Europe's leading power is expected to vote on February 23 after a center-left coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed. 'Only the AfD can save Germany,' Musk wrote in a post on his social media platform, X. Musk, the world's richest person, has already expressed support for other anti-immigration parties across Europe. The German government said it had taken note of Musk's post but declined to give any further comment at its regular press conference. Musk reposted a message by German right-wing influencer Naomi Seibt that criticized Friedrich Merz, chancellor candidate for the conservatives, who are comfortably ahead in surveys. Musk had already voiced support for the AfD last year, when he attacked the German government's handling of illegal migration. Last month, Musk called for the sacking of Italian judges who had questioned the legality of government measures to prevent irregular immigration. And this week Nigel Farage, leader of Britain's right-wing Reform UK party and friend of Trump, posted a photo of himself and Reform's treasurer meeting Musk at Trump's Florida residence, and said he was in talks with Musk about financial support.	https://www.voanews.com/a/elon-musk-gives-nod-to-german-far-right-party-as-election-looms-/7908237.html	2024-12-20T03:51:23-08:00	
Russia hands 16-year prison term to east Ukraine resident for 'treason'	Moscow — Russia on Friday sentenced a resident of east Ukraine's Lugansk region to 16 years in prison for 'high treason,' Moscow's FSB security service said. Moscow regularly hands heavy sentences to people it accuses of spying for Ukraine and has also consistently imprisoned Ukrainians in Russia and occupied regions. The sentencing came as President Vladimir Putin called on security services to be 'tough' in anti-terror measures and especially vigilant in military counterintelligence as the Kremlin's Ukraine offensive drags on for almost three years. Putin called for special services to 'identify spies and traitors' and to 'stop the work of foreign security services.' The unnamed man was sentenced Friday by a military court in Russia's southern city of Rostov-on-Don. Prosecutors said he had handed information on the Russian armed forces to Kyiv's security services. The FSB, cited by Russian news agencies, said the man was found guilty of state treason, being an accomplice in terrorist acts as well as the illegal handling and transport of explosives. The court ordered that he serve his sentence in a high-security penal colony. The Tass news agency published a video showing the man's arrest, in which FSB officers stopped a car, dragged a man out and threw him to the ground, before handcuffing him and taking him to the local headquarters of the security force. The video showed a man with his face blurred — filmed by the FSB — saying he had been recruited by Ukraine's SBU security service in 2016. Russia regularly releases confession videos filmed by the FSB after arrests. Russian independent media reported that an activist had killed himself Thursday in a Rostov detention center, shortly after being sentenced to 16 years in prison also in the Rostov region. The Mediazona website said it got confirmation from prison officials that Roman Shved — a 39-year-old anarchist sentenced for an arson attack on a government building after the Kremlin announced a military mobilization in 2022 — had died in a Rostov detention center. Several social media channels had said Shved had killed himself hours after being sentenced. Russia has punished thousands of its citizens for opposing the Ukraine campaign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-hands-16-year-prison-term-to-east-ukraine-resident-for-treason-/7908213.html	2024-12-20T03:15:03-08:00	
Russian missiles target Kyiv after Ukraine fires US-made missiles across the border	KYIV, UKRAINE — A Russian ballistic missile attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv early Friday killed at least one person and injured nine others, officials said. Moscow claimed it was in response to a Ukrainian strike on Russian soil using American-made weapons. At least three loud blasts were heard in Kyiv shortly before sunrise. Ukraine's air force said it intercepted five Iskander short-range ballistic missiles fired at the city. The attack knocked out heating to 630 residential buildings, 16 medical facilities, and 30 schools and kindergartens, the city administration said, and falling missile debris caused damage and sparked fires in three districts. 'We ask citizens to immediately respond to reports of ballistic attack threats, because there is very little time to find shelter,' the air force said. During the almost three years since the war began Russia has regularly bombarded civilian areas of Ukraine, often in an attempt to cripple the power grid and unnerve Ukrainians. Meanwhile Ukraine, struggling to hold back Russia's bigger army on the front line, has attempted to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country's war effort. The Russian Ministry of Defense said the strike was in response to a Ukrainian missile attack on Russia's Rostov border region two days earlier. That attack used six American-made Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, missiles and four Storm Shadow air-launched missiles provided by the United Kingdom, it said. That day, Ukraine claimed to have targeted a Rostov oil refinery as part of its campaign to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country's war effort. The use of Western-supplied weapons to strike Russia has angered the Kremlin. Ukraine fired several American-supplied longer-range missiles into Russia for the first time on Nov. 19 after Washington eased restrictions on their use. That development prompted Russia to use a new hypersonic missile, called Oreshnik, for the first time. President Vladimir Putin suggested the missile could be used to target government buildings in Kyiv, though there have been no reports of an Oreshnik being used for a second time. Answering the Ukrainian attack on Rostov on Wednesday, the Defense Ministry said it carried out a group strike with 'high-precision, long-range weapons' on the command center of Ukraine's military intelligence agency and another location where it said Ukraine's Neptune missile systems are designed and produced. The attack also targeted Ukrainian ground-based cruise missile systems and U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems, the Defense Ministry said. 'The objectives of the strike have been achieved. All objects are hit,' the defense ministry said in a Telegram post. Its claims could not immediately be verified.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-missiles-target-kyiv-after-ukraine-fires-us-made-missiles-across-the-border/7908204.html	2024-12-20T02:53:35-08:00	
Trump wants to quickly end Gaza war — can he?	WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump has signaled eagerness to wrap up the war in Gaza as quickly as possible, even as the outgoing Biden administration continues its last-ditch diplomatic push for a ceasefire deal. Earlier this week, Trump said if the hostages held by Hamas are not home by Jan. 20, 2025, the date of his inauguration, then 'all hell is going to break out.' The warning is similar to the threat he issued on social media earlier this month, where he said, 'There will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America.' It's not clear what Trump plans to do in Gaza. When asked to clarify the threat, he said, 'It means it won't be pleasant.' Trump may deploy resources to place military pressure on Hamas, said Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. However, it's unlikely to be 'significantly harsher than what the Israelis have brought to bear over the last 14 months.' 'There could be another element — which I hope that's not the approach — to maybe squeeze some of that humanitarian aid going in,' Alkhatib told VOA. It's also possible that Trump's threats are directed to Hamas members outside of Gaza and the countries that support them, and Trump might move to pressure those nations to cut off financing, Alkhatib added. Hamas is a U.S.-designated terror organization. Hamas' external wing may be more receptive to Washington's pressure, particularly since its patron, Tehran, has been weakened through the loss of Hezbollah in Lebanon and the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Like Hamas, Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy, while the Assad regime was Tehran's stalwart ally. Trump's warnings send 'an unmistakable message to the people in the Middle East that the U.S. wants to get this done,' said David Makovsky, director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy Project on the Middle East Peace Process. This leaves Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu navigating between placating the ultraright-wing faction of his coalition — which is pushing for building settlements in and even annexing Gaza — and pleasing Trump, who wants credit for ending the war and potentially expanding the Abraham Accords to include Saudi Arabia, Makovsky told VOA. The 2020 agreement brokered under the first Trump administration normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, then later with Morocco. 'Trump is not into building more settlements and staying in Gaza. Trump wants, I think, a Nobel Prize for a breakthrough with Saudi Arabia,' Makovsky said. 'And I don't think those things go together.' Analysts say that even before taking office, Trump is already shaping the calculations of combatants in the Middle East. His pick for national security adviser, Representative Mike Waltz, gave the president-elect credit for last month's ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, brokered by the U.S. and France. 'Everyone is coming to the table because of President Trump,' Waltz posted on social media. 'His resounding victory sent a clear message to the rest of the world that chaos won't be tolerated.' US 'hopeful' for deal Meanwhile, the Biden administration has pledged to spend all the time left in its waning days to try to make a deal happen. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday he is 'hopeful' an agreement can be reached. 'Gaza has to be translated into something different that ensures that Hamas is not in any way in charge, that Israel doesn't have to be, and that there's something coherent that follows that enables the governance, the security, the reconstruction of Gaza,' he said. That goal is still out of reach, despite Washington's renewed diplomatic push with Turkey, Egypt and Qatar. 'I don't see a scenario in which President Biden is going to be able to really fundamentally shift the needle here,' Alkhatib said. He added that while Hamas may be motivated to secure a deal while Biden is still in office rather than after Jan. 20 when the U.S. is likely to drive a much harder bargain, they know that any assurances provided by the Biden administration may not be fulfilled by the Trump administration. This despite officials from both the Biden and Trump administrations saying they are working together in handling global conflicts, partly to secure the transition period that may be seen by adversaries as moments of opportunity, said national security adviser Jake Sullivan. 'And so, the imperative on us, both the outgoing Biden administration, the incoming Trump administration, has to be to lash up more tightly than is typical, to spend more time together than is typical, and to try to ensure we are sending a common, clear message to both friends and adversaries in the Middle East.' The common message from the two leaders is that the U.S. wants the conflict to end. So far, the warring parties are not listening.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-wants-to-quickly-end-gaza-war-can-he-/7908063.html	2024-12-20T02:03:41-08:00	
US accuses man of being Chinese agent	LOS ANGELES — China's ruling Communist Party used an agent in California to influence state politics, U.S. prosecutors said Thursday as they unveiled criminal charges against a Chinese national. FBI agents arrested Yaoning 'Mike' Sun, 64, at his home in Chino Hills, near Los Angeles, on charges that he acted as an agent for a foreign government while getting involved in local politics. The complaint claims Sun served as the campaign manager and close confidante for an unnamed politician who was running for local elected office in 2022. During the campaign, he is alleged to have conspired with Chen Jun -- a Chinese national sentenced to prison last month for acting as an illegal agent of Beijing -- regarding his efforts to get the politician elected. The U.S. Department of Justice said Chen discussed with Chinese government officials how they could influence local politicians, particularly on the issue of Taiwan. China considers the self-ruled island of Taiwan part of its territory. Beijing -- which has said it would never rule out using force to bring Taiwan under its control -- has been accused of using local influence campaigns, among other tactics, to sway global opinion on the issue. Charging documents say after the local politician won office in late 2022, Chen instructed Sun to prepare a report on the election to be sent to Chinese government officials, who expressed their thanks for his work. 'The conduct alleged in this complaint is deeply concerning,' said United States Attorney Martin Estrada. 'We cannot permit hostile foreign powers to meddle in the governance of our country.' Sun was charged with one count of acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison. He also faces one count of conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, which carries a maximum penalty of five years. Asked about the charges on Friday, Beijing's foreign ministry said it was 'not aware of the details in the case you mentioned.' But spokesperson Lin Jian said, 'China never interferes in the internal affairs of other countries.' 'The international community sees clearly who is actually wantonly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries,' he said during a regular briefing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-accuses-man-of-being-chinese-agent-/7908166.html	2024-12-20T01:04:05-08:00	
Top US officials in Damascus to meet new Syrian rulers, State Department says	WASHINGTON — Top diplomats from the Biden administration are in Damascus on Friday to meet new Syrian authorities led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a State Department spokesperson said, the first in-person and official meeting between Washington and Syria's de-facto new rulers. The State Department's top Middle East diplomat, Barbara Leaf, Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens and newly appointed Senior Adviser Daniel Rubinstein, who is now tasked with leading the Department's Syria engagement, are the first U.S. diplomats to travel to Damascus since Syria's opposition militias overthrew oppressive President Bashar al-Assad. The visit comes as Western governments are gradually opening channels to HTS and its leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and start debating whether or not to remove the terrorist designation on the group. The U.S. delegation's travel follows contacts with France and Britain in recent days. In their meetings, the U.S. officials will discuss with HTS representatives a set of principles such as inclusivity and respect for the rights of minorities that Washington wants included in Syria's political transition, the spokesperson said. The delegation will also work to obtain new information about U.S. journalist Austin Tice, who was taken captive during a reporting trip to Syria in August 2012, and other American citizens who went missing during the Assad regime. 'They will be engaging directly with the Syrian people, including members of civil society, activists, members of different communities, and other Syrian voices about their vision for the future of their country and how the United States can help support them,' the department spokesperson said. 'They also plan to meet with representatives of HTS to discuss transition principles endorsed by the United States and regional partners in Aqaba, Jordan,' the spokesperson said. The United States cut diplomatic ties with Syria and shut down its embassy in Damascus in 2012. In a seismic moment for the Middle East, Syrian rebels seized control of Damascus on Dec. 8, forcing Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war, ending his family's decadeslong rule. The lightning offensive raised questions over whether the rebels will be able to ensure an orderly transition. Forces under the command of al-Sharaa - better known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani - replaced the Assad family rule with a three-month transitional government that had been ruling a rebel enclave in Syria's northwestern province of Idlib. Washington in 2013 designated al-Sharaa a terrorist, saying al Qaeda in Iraq had tasked him with overthrowing Assad's rule and establishing Islamic sharia law in Syria. It said the Nusra Front, the predecessor of HTS, carried out suicide attacks that killed civilians and espoused a violent sectarian vision. U.S. President Joe Biden and his top aides described the overthrow of Assad as a historic opportunity for the Syrian people who have for decades lived under his oppressive rule, but also warned the country faced a period of risk and uncertainty. Washington remains concerned that extremist group ISIS could seize the moment to resurrect and also wants to avoid any clashes in the country's northeast between Turkey-backed rebel factions and U.S.-allied Kurdish militia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-us-officials-in-damascus-to-meet-new-syrian-rulers-state-department-says/7908135.html	2024-12-19T23:12:46-08:00	
China's Xi swears in new leader of casino hub Macao	MACAO — Chinese President Xi Jinping urged the casino hub of Macao to diversify its economy as he swore in the former Portuguese colony's new government on Friday at an event marking the 25th anniversary of its handover to China. New Chief Executive Sam Hou Fai — Macao's first leader born in mainland China — vowed to address the territory's unbalanced and uncoordinated economic development. Since its 1999 handover, the city of 687,000 has transformed from a monopoly-driven gambling enclave into the world's largest gaming hub, drawing hordes of tourists from mainland China. The casino boom has improved living standards, but authorities are concerned that the semi-autonomous city's economy is unhealthily dependent on the industry. Some young people say the tourism-dominated economy has limited their career options and the city's diversified development. Critics say years of easy money from tourists have discouraged local businesses from innovating and improving, with many residents relying on personal connections to solve problems rather than civic participation. During a gala dinner on Thursday, Xi praised Macao's progress on economic diversification over the last five years and its strengthened international influence. He called for the city to expand its international role while attracting global talent to build a better Macao. On Friday, he said the city should enhance its industrial development planning, strengthen policy support and boost investment to nurture internationally competitive new industries, in what observers said were stronger and more specific comments than before. 'The special administrative region's government and all sectors of society have to show more care to young people and create a better environment and conditions for their growth, talent development and fulfilling their aspirations,' he said. Sam has promised to accelerate plans to boost tourism and other sectors such as Chinese medicine, finance, tech, exhibitions and commerce. Although political activism has never seriously challenged to Beijing in Macao, authorities have tightened control in recent years, particularly after Hong Kong was rocked by months of huge anti-government protests in 2019. Vocal political dissent has largely been silenced. A vigil commemorating China's military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in 1989 was banned, and pro-democracy figures were barred from competing in legislative elections. Last year, the city toughened its national security law. Xi said 'national sovereignty, security and development interests are above all,' while noting the need to safeguard the city's autonomy. He said security is a precondition for development and residents should cherish their hard-won stability and peace. Like neighboring Hong Kong, Macao is governed separately from the rest of China under a system that allows it to maintain elements of Western-style economic and social systems. It is the only Chinese city where casino gambling is legal. With Beijing's policy agenda now dominating Macao's development, the casino hub is deepening economic links and social integration with neighboring Guangdong province. China has designated a special zone on Hengqin Island in neighboring Zhuhai city, jointly run by Guangdong and Macao, to help foster new industries. That zone is planned to have about 120,000 Macao residents by 2035. Xi said that Macao must participate proactively in the Greater Bay Area initiative, which Beijing aims to link Macao, Hong Kong and nine other Guangdong cities into an economic powerhouse. Xi is due to conclude his three-day trip to Macao on Friday. During his stay, he visited a university, the special zone on Hengqin Island and met with Macao's former city leaders and Hong Kong's chief executive, among others.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-swears-in-new-leader-of-casino-hub-macao/7908131.html	2024-12-19T22:50:54-08:00

Australia announces $118 million deal to enhance policing in Solomon Islands	MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA — Australia announced on Friday it will pay for more police in Solomon Islands and create a police training center in the South Pacific island nation's capital, Honiara, where Chinese law enforcement instructors are already based under a bilateral security pact with Beijing. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia would spend 190 million Australian dollars ($118 million) over four years on funding and training new Royal Solomon Islands Police Force recruits with a package that would 'reduce any need for outside support.' 'My government is proud to make a significant investment in the police force of the Solomon Islands to ensure that they can continue to take primary responsibility for security in the Solomons,' Albanese told reporters in Australia's capital, Canberra. Albanese and his Solomons counterpart, Jeremiah Manele, said in a joint statement on Friday the package would build an enduring security capability in the Solomons, 'thereby reducing its reliance on external partners over time.' Australia has been energetically pursuing new bilateral security deals with its Pacific island neighbors since Beijing and the Solomons signed a security deal in 2022 under Manele's predecessor, Manasseh Sogavare. That deal has created fears among U.S. allies including Australia that the Chinese navy will be allowed to build a base in the strategically important Solomons. Albanese's Labor Party, which was the opposition at the time the pact was signed, described it as Australia's worst foreign policy failure in the Pacific since World War II. Australia has recently signed security deals with Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu and Nauru that effectively give Canberra veto powers over any security deals those countries might want to strike with third nations, including China. Asked if the new deal would require the Chinese security presence to be removed from the Solomons, Albanese did not directly answer. 'The Solomon Islands of course is a sovereign nation. They have some measures in place and we expect that to continue,' Albanese said. 'As a result of this agreement, what we've done is make sure that Australia remains the security partner of choice,' he added. Mihai Sora, a Pacific islands expert at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based international policy think tank, said the agreement was a 'clear win for Solomon Islands, which has gained a much-needed boost to its law and justice sector.' 'But Solomon Islands has not committed to scaling back the essentially permanent rotating presence of around 14 Chinese police trainers in the country, who have been running their own parallel training program with Solomon Islands police since 2022,' Sora said in an email. 'So, the agreement falls short of a solid strategic commitment to Australia from Solomon Islands, and there's no indication that it would derail China-Solomon Islands security ties,' Sora added. Blake Johnson, an analyst at the Australian Security Policy Institute, a Canberra-based think tank, said Chinese policing in the Pacific gives Beijing tools to control Chinese expatriates and pursue other goals. 'They can be very heavy-handed in their response sometimes. There are also concerns around data and privacy risks associated with Chinese police in the region,' Johnson said. 'Sometimes they're providing surveillance equipment. There are concerns about what that is being used for and what it's capturing,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-announces-118-million-deal-to-enhance-policing-in-solomon-islands-/7908092.html	2024-12-19T19:59:03-08:00

China counting on cyber-psychological cocktail to expand dominance	washington — China's push to develop the world's premier fighting force extends beyond conventional and nuclear capabilities, with U.S. officials warning that Beijing is pouring resources into a mix of psychological warfare and cyber operations. The goal in employing what are known in Beijing as cognitive domain operations, or CDO, is to influence the way China's adversaries think and behave, targeting everyone from the average citizen to senior officials. China 'views controlling the information spectrum in the modern battlespace as a critical enabler of information dominance early in a conflict,' according to the Pentagon's China Military Power report, released Wednesday. 'The PLA [People's Liberation Army] probably intends to use CDO as an asymmetric capability to deter U.S. or third-party entry into a future conflict or as an offensive capability to shape perceptions or polarize a society,' it said, adding that for Chinese military officers, 'subduing the enemy without fighting is the highest realm of warfare.' The Pentagon's report does not state how much money Beijing has allocated for these efforts but says that the PLA has spent parts of the past six years looking at how to incorporate cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence, to produce deepfakes and other material to mislead the U.S. public. It also says China has tasked some of its leading technology companies, including Baidu, Alibaba and Huawei, with using generative AI to produce better audio and video, in addition to more convincing text and images. Successes and failures The results, however, have been uneven. U.S. intelligence officials repeatedly called out China, along with Russia and Iran, for trying to deploy AI-boosted influence operations in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election in November. Some of the efforts, though, were described as clumsy. 'The quality is not as believable as you might expect,' said a U.S. intelligence official at the time. Earlier efforts, identified by tech giant Microsoft, described an improvement in Beijing's ability to produce 'eye-catching content,' though questions remained about the content's reach and impact. U.S. intelligence officials have also said that Beijing's influence efforts have been hampered by what they describe as a struggle by Chinese intelligence to understand the American psyche with the same sophistication as other U.S. adversaries, such as Russia. China has repeatedly denied such allegations, accusing the U.S. of calling out others for its own wrongdoing. 'For quite some time, the U.S. side has patched up all sorts of disinformation about threats of 'Chinese hackers' to serve its own geopolitical purposes,' Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in an email earlier this month regarding allegations that a Chinese-linked group known as Salt Typhoon had breached U.S. telecommunications companies. 'The US needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cybersecurity to smear and slander China,' he added. Still, U.S. officials warn that aspects of China's psychological and cyber operations have met with an alarming amount of success, most notably the exploits of the hacking group known as Volt Typhoon. Volt Typhoon has been 'working to embed, burrow into our most sensitive critical infrastructure, not for espionage, but rather for disruption or destruction in the event of a major crisis in the Taiwan Strait,' said Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. 'Induce societal panic' 'This is a world where a war in Asia could see very real impacts … across our nation, with attacks against pipelines, against water facilities, against transportation nodes, against communications, all to induce societal panic and to deter our ability to marshal military might and citizen will,' Easterly added, speaking at a virtual cyber conference earlier this month. The CISA director said U.S. cyber teams have worked with companies in the private sector to evict Volt Typhoon from their systems, but there still is a long way to go. 'We think what we've seen to date is really just the tip of the iceberg,' Easterly said. Pentagon officials echo those concerns. 'I think we're starting to see more emphasis in the cognitive space … not being only focused on our leaders but indeed on populations in a way that can be both corrosive to institutions we have but also is really, really hard to, frankly, prevent, deter,' said Christopher Maier, the assistant defense secretary for special operations and low-intensity conflict. China and other adversaries such as Russia are 'going to be a lot more aggressive. They're going to take a lot more risk,' Maier said in response to a question from VOA during an event in Washington on Wednesday. 'They're going to try to message our population in ways that, frankly, we would find completely inappropriate and threatening,' he said. But Maier questioned whether such tactics will ultimately yield the desired results. 'The information tool is most useful when it's paired with physical actions and done in a more, if you will, tactical way. That's something that China and Russia could do,' he said. 'But those effects don't tend to last for long.' And, he said, now that the U.S. is on the lookout, China and others could have a harder time finding more success. 'I think they'll see opportunities to exploit what they'll perceive as vulnerabilities,' Maier said, adding, 'I'm not sure they're as vulnerable as they might think.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-counting-on-cyber-psychological-cocktail-to-expand-dominance-/7908073.html	2024-12-19T19:10:51-08:00

Earthquake-hit Vanuatu braces for possible cyclone	On Thursday, two days after Port Vila, the capital city of Vanuatu, was hit by a deadly 7.3 magnitude earthquake with numerous aftershocks, residents were told to prepare for heavy rains that could grow into a cyclone that would bring more destruction to the ravaged island. Earthquakes are commonplace in the Pacific Island archipelago, but Tuesday's temblor was exceptional. Its shaking flattened buildings, destroyed reservoirs, damaged hospitals and roads, and cut off power and telecommunications systems. While most of the damage from the earthquake was in Port Vila, on the island of Efate, there was some damage, including landslides, in the 82 outlying islands. The earthquake was about 30 kilometers west of the capital, at a depth of 57 kilometers. At least 16 people have died, according to officials, but the death toll is expected to climb as emergency response teams search through the rubble for survivors and the dead. About 200 people have been treated for injuries, according to the government's disaster management office. Australia and France have dispatched first-response teams to help with the search. The Associated Press reported that there were 'dramatic rescues of dust-covered survivors that lifted spirits on Tuesday and Wednesday,' but the prospects of similar events grow dimmer as days tick by. According to the National Disaster Management Office, two reservoirs that supply water to the capital crumbled during the earthquake, forcing residents to stand in long lines at stores to purchase the necessity. 'People are not really concerned about electricity. They're just concerned about water,' a Port Vila resident told AP. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Thursday that about 80,000 people were directly affected by the earthquake, and close to 1,000 had been displaced from their homes. The international alliance has slated $1 million for Vanuatu's immediate response efforts, including water, shelter and food. 'Make sure your family is safe,' Vanuatu President Nikenike Vurobaravu said in an address on the country's national broadcaster's Facebook page. 'Help each other during this hard time for the nation.' Tourists who flock to Vanuatu for its lovely beaches found themselves scrambling to secure seats on military evacuation flights that several countries organized. Australia and New Zealand have delivered aid to the island and have been able to evacuate their citizens from the island on the aircraft that delivered the aid. U.S. Ambassador Ann Marie Yastishock brought aid to Vanuatu, including Starlink equipment, Reuters reported. Some information for this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/earthquake-hit-vanuatu-braces-for-possible-cyclone/7908050.html	2024-12-19T18:10:28-08:00	
Surveys show widespread Great Barrier Reef coral loss	sydney — Australian scientists said Wednesday that they had found a widespread decrease in coral cover in southern parts of the Great Barrier Reef. Researchers have just completed a routine annual underwater survey of reefs off central Queensland state a month after their analysis showed similar devastation in a northern section. The Australian Institute of Marine Science, a government research agency, said most of the damage it found in northern and southern sections of the Great Barrier Reef during the survey was the result of coral-bleaching warmer ocean temperatures. The Great Barrier Reef off northeastern Australia is the world’s largest coral system. It is roughly the size of Italy or Japan. Along with climate, tropical storms and infestations of coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish are also blamed for the coral loss. Mike Emslie, who runs the institute’s Long Term Monitoring Program, told VOA that 'more than a third of the coral around Cooktown-Lizard reefs have been lost since last summer and, similarly, on the southern Great Barrier Reef, we have recorded a 40% decline in coral cover, which is one of the measures we use to indicate reef health of the Capricorn-Bunker group.' The institute’s Long Term Monitoring Program has been running for four decades and examines key indicators of coral health. Researchers survey about 70 so-called core reefs off northeastern Australia each year. Campaigners say the latest underwater survey results have shown 'unprecedented coral losses.' The Australian Marine Conservation Society, a charity, said in a statement Wednesday that the Great Barrier Reef faces 'another summer from hell with heat already building up in the water and coral bleaching warnings for much of the northern reef.' Society Great Barrier Reef campaigner Simon Miller told VOA that it’s part of a global pattern affecting reefs around the world. 'This most recent mass bleaching event was also part of a global mass bleaching event - the Caribbean, in particular, and coral reefs around Florida were extremely badly affected by marine heat waves and by a mass bleaching event that led to really high levels of mortality earlier this year,' Miller said. Warmer seas cause bleaching, forcing the coral to expel the microscopic symbiotic algae that give it most of its energy and color. Reefs can recover from bleaching, but it can take years. If water temperatures do not return to normal, the coral can die.	https://www.voanews.com/a/surveys-show-widespread-great-barrier-reef-coral-loss-/7908041.html	2024-12-19T17:51:35-08:00	
Anger and soul-searching follow sentences in French rape trial	PARIS — Feminists and other critics say the sentences handed down in France’s mass rape trial are too lenient with some calling them shameful. The trial has shocked the nation of France and made international headlines. Speaking to reporters in the southern French city of Avignon, 72-year-old plaintiff Gisele Pelicot said she respected the verdict. She said she never regretted going public — which she said aimed to give other victims of sexual assault the courage to speak out. Pelicot’s ex-husband, Dominique, received the toughest sentence — the maximum of 20 years in prison – for drugging his wife and allowing dozens of men to rape her as she slept. The attacks went on for nearly a decade until police detained him for another sexual incident and discovered scores of videos of the rapes. Some 50 other defendants received sentences ranging from three to 15 years — many less than what prosecutors had recommended. Some walked out free after receiving suspended sentences. It’s not immediately clear whether Dominique Pelicot or others will appeal their sentences. Protesters outside the court in Avignon slammed the sentences as shameful and insufficient. So did women’s rights activists like Laura Slimani, of the Women’s Foundation. On France Info radio, she criticized the French justice system for what she said was its inability to handle sexual violence cases. The Pelicot trial has sparked soul searching — and protests — in France about rape and other forms of gender-based violence. Pelicot herself has become something of a heroine for her courage and dignity. She said France’s so-called macho, patriarchal society must change how it looks at rape. After the verdicts, many again saluted her courage — including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. 'The shame must change sides,’' Sholz said on X. 'Thank you, Gisele Pelicot.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/anger-and-soul-searching-follow-sentences-in-french-rape-trial/7908033.html	2024-12-19T17:43:14-08:00	
US slow to react to pervasive Chinese hacking, experts say	As new potential threats from Chinese hackers were identified this week, the federal government issued one of its strongest warnings to date about the need for Americans — and in particular government officials and other 'highly targeted' individuals — to secure their communications against eavesdropping and interception. The warning came as news was breaking about a Commerce Department investigation into the possibility that computer network routers manufactured by the Chinese firm TP-Link may pose a threat to the millions of U.S. businesses, households and government agencies that use them. Also on Wednesday, Congress took long-awaited steps toward funding a program that will purge other Chinese technology from U.S. telecommunications systems. The so-called rip-and-replace program targets gear manufactured by Chinese firms Huawei and ZTE. Too far behind While experts said the recent actions are a step in the right direction, they warned that U.S. policymakers have been extremely slow to react to a mountain of evidence that Chinese hackers have long been targeting essential communications and infrastructure systems in the U.S. The lack of action has persisted despite law enforcement and intelligence agencies repeatedly sounding alarms. In January, while testifying before the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, FBI Director Christopher Wray said, 'There has been far too little public focus on the fact that [People's Republic of China] hackers are targeting our critical infrastructure — our water treatment plants, our electrical grid, our oil and natural gas pipelines, our transportation systems. And the risk that poses to every American requires our attention now.' A year previously, Wray had warned lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee that his investigators were badly outnumbered. 'To give you a sense of what we're up against, if each one of the FBI's cyber agents and intel analysts focused exclusively on the China threat, Chinese hackers would still outnumber FBI Cyber personnel by at least 50-to-1,' Wray said. Decades of complexity Part of the problem, experts said, is that it is difficult for policymakers to summon the political will to make changes that could be disruptive to the lives and livelihoods of U.S. citizens in the absence of public concern about the problem. 'It still remains very, very difficult to impress upon average, typical everyday citizens the gravity of Chinese espionage, or the extent of it,' said Bill Drexel, a fellow with the Technology and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. He contrasted the relatively muted public response to the recent revelation of a Chinese hacking operation known as Salt Typhoon, which compromised mobile telephone networks throughout the country, with the uproar that accompanied the far less serious appearance of a Chinese spy balloon over the U.S. mainland in 2023. 'That just goes to show this … problem where really grave issues that are intangible — that are just in cyberspace — are really hard to wrap our minds around,' Drexel told VOA. 'For four decades, we intertwined our supply chains very deeply with China, and our digital systems became more and more complex, allowing more and more compounding ways to be hacked, to be compromised,' Drexel said. 'We've just started to try to change course on this stuff,' he added. 'But there's so much momentum for so long on these issues, and they continue to compound in complexity, such that it's just really hard to catch up.' Warning 'highly targeted' Americans The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued guidance on Wednesday, reporting that it 'has identified cyber espionage activity by People's Republic of China (PRC) government-affiliated threat actors targeting commercial telecommunications infrastructure.' It continued, 'This activity enabled the theft of customer call records and the compromise of private communications for a limited number of highly targeted individuals.' The warning appeared to be related to the Salt Typhoon hack that, according to government investigators, compromised all the major mobile phone carriers in the U.S., giving the Chinese government extraordinary access to the communications among millions of Americans. The five-page CISA document outlines steps that the agency advises all Americans, but particularly those most likely to be targeted, to take immediately. The first is to immediately curtail use of standard mobile communications platforms, such as voice calls and Short Message Service (SMS) texting. Instead, the agency advises Americans to restrict their communications to free messaging platforms that offer end-to-end encryption, such as Signal, which support one-on-one and group chats, as well as voice and video calls. Data sent with end-to-end encryption is extremely difficult to decrypt, even if a malicious actor is able to intercept it during transmission. Among the other advice CISA offered was to avoid using SMS messages for multifactor authentication by switching to apps that provide authenticator codes or, where possible, adopting hardware-based security keys for highly sensitive accounts. Other recommendations included the use of complex and random passwords stored in password manager software, as well as platform-specific suggestions for iPhone and Android users. TP-Link concerns On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported, and other outlets subsequently confirmed, that the Commerce Department, as well as the Justice and Defense departments, are investigating reports that computer routers manufactured by the Shenzhen-based TP-Link are one vector of attack for Chinese hackers. TP-Link currently dominates the market for computer routers in the U.S., with nearly two-thirds of total market share. In October, a report from Microsoft revealed that one Chinese hacking operation it identified as CovertNetwork-1658 has compromised thousands of TP-Link routers to create a network that is used by 'multiple Chinese threat actors' to gain illicit access to computer networks around the world. The Journal's reporting also revealed that the Commerce Department is considering a ban on the sale of TP-Link routers in the U.S. next year, an action that could significantly disrupt the U.S. market for networking hardware. Rip and replace Congress on Wednesday took long-delayed action to address a different potential threat from China, allocating $3 billion to a program that will remove telecommunications equipment manufactured by Huawei and ZTE from rural telecommunications networks in the U.S. Funding for the rip-and-replace program arrives years after the U.S. identified the two companies as posing a potential threat. Beginning in the first Trump administration and continuing during Joe Biden's time in office, the U.S. pressured allies around the world to block the installation of Huawei and ZTE 5G cellular communications equipment from their networks, in some cases threatening to stop sharing sensitive intelligence with allies that failed to comply.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-slow-to-react-to-pervasive-chinese-hacking-experts-say/7908035.html	2024-12-19T17:37:36-08:00	
Mogadishu development project brings hope to Somalia	washington — In a landmark event for Somalia, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud on Thursday officially launched the 'New Mogadishu' development initiative, a transformative project that aims to reshape the capital's economic landscape. The initiative includes construction of a modern airport, a port and a key economic zone, all focused on fostering growth and attracting investment. During the launch, Mohamud said the initiative showcases the resilience of the Somali business community. 'Somali businessmen have stepped up to provide essential services during challenging times, proving their commitment to the nation's progress,' he said. Mohamud also noted the initiative has the potential for massive job creation. 'The creation of this project is not just about infrastructure; it's about creating opportunities for our youth and uplifting our communities,' he said. 'The launch of the New Mogadishu project marks a significant milestone for Somalia as it seeks to revitalize its capital and strengthen investor confidence, paving the way for a brighter economic future,' Mohamud added. Fardowsa Osman Egal, Somalia's minister of transport and aviation, emphasized the significance of the new airport in this project. 'It is a long dream that is materializing now. Due to the capacity and function of the current Mogadishu airport, which only has one runway, this new international airport will help us increase international flights,' she said. 'The planned state-of-the-art airport and modern port will serve as vital infrastructure, creating a financial zone that is expected to draw both international and local investors.' Valued at approximately $650 million, the New Mogadishu initiative is expected to significantly boost Somalia's economic development. On behalf of Somali business community, Mohamud Abdikarim Gabeyre, the chairman of the Somali Chamber of Commerce and Industry, welcomed the initiative. 'New Mogadishu, on the northern outskirts of the capital, is a project we welcome because we heard that the Somali business community will get the priority of the investment, and we hope it will be successful,' he said. On Wednesday, the president also inaugurated a $400 million groundbreaking development project named Gateway Complex, poised to transform Somalia's capital by introducing Somalia's first five-star hotel, managed by the globally recognized Rotana hospitality group, and an international convention center capable of hosting up to 5,000 attendees. Plans also feature premium hotel apartments, a 300-bed modern hospital, a leading school, a vibrant shopping complex, residential units and recreational facilities. Mogadishu has long suffered from lawlessness and terrorist attacks. Although the capabilities of the al-Shabab terrorist group have been weakened, it continues to pose a threat by assassinating civilians, particularly those who install security cameras on their shops and business centers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mogadishu-development-project-brings-hope-to-somalia-/7907986.html	2024-12-19T17:15:33-08:00	
US Republicans plan vote on deal to avert shutdown, lift debt limit	Republicans in the U.S. Congress teed up a vote on Thursday for a new spending package that would avert a looming government shutdown, this time with the support of President-elect Donald Trump, who scuttled a prior bipartisan version. It was not clear whether the measure would survive an evening vote in the House of Representatives. House Democrats emerged from a closed-door meeting to say they would vote against the bill, which their leader, Hakeem Jeffries, called laughable. Republicans control the chamber by a 219-211 majority, meaning they can lose no more than three votes if Democrats unite against the bill. One Republican, Representative Rich McCormick, predicted at least 10 from his party would vote against it. Democrats also currently control the Senate, and Democratic President Joe Biden's support would be needed to sign the package into law and avert a shutdown starting on Saturday. If lawmakers fail to meet that deadline, the U.S. government will begin a partial shutdown that would interrupt funding for everything from border enforcement to law enforcement in the days leading up to Christmas and cut off paychecks for more than 2 million federal workers. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration warned that travelers could face long lines at airports. Trump urged lawmakers to vote for the package. The incoming president has demanded that lawmakers tie up loose ends before he takes office on January 20. 'Now we can Make America Great Again, very quickly,' Trump said in a statement. The new package would fund government operations for three months, until Trump is in the White House and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, according to sources familiar with the package. It also would provide $100 billion in disaster aid and $10 billion in farm aid and extend farm and food aid programs that were due to expire at the end of the year. It does not include other elements that had been included in the original package, such as a pay raise for lawmakers and new rules for pharmacy benefit managers. The package would also suspend the debt ceiling until January 2027, which could clear the way for trillions of dollars to be added to the $36 trillion federal debt. Trump's embrace of the deal marks a softening of his earlier demand that Congress eliminate the debt ceiling entirely before he returns to office. Previous fights over the debt ceiling have spooked financial markets, as a U.S. government default would send credit shocks around the world. The limit has been suspended under an agreement that technically expires on January 1, though lawmakers likely will not have to tackle the issue until the spring. Democrats said Trump and his Republicans were trying to remove a barrier to budget-busting tax cuts. 'That's to give them room for tax cuts for the wealthiest in America,' Democratic Representative Steny Hoyer told reporters. When he returns to office, Trump aims to enact tax cuts that could reduce revenues by $8 trillion over 10 years, which would drive the debt higher without offsetting spending cuts. He has vowed not to reduce retirement and health benefits for seniors that make up a vast chunk of the budget and are projected to grow dramatically in the years to come. Several Republicans earlier said they were not interested in getting rid of the debt ceiling if they did not also cut spending. 'It's like limiting, you know, increasing your credit card limit, while you don't do anything to actually constrain spending,' Representative Chip Roy told reporters. The last government shutdown took place in December 2018 and January 2019 during Trump's first White House term.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-republicans-plan-vote-on-deal-to-avert-shutdown-lift-debt-limit-/7907977.html	2024-12-19T16:14:08-08:00	
After a police stop in Serbia, journalist finds spyware on phone	Washington / belgrade, serbia — An encounter with police in the Serbian city of Pirot earlier this year unnerved investigative reporter Slavisa Milanov. A journalist for the independent media outlet FAR, Milanov was driving with a colleague in February when they were pulled over by police, who asked the pair to accompany them to a station to be tested for illegal substances. Once there, Milanov said he was asked to leave his phone and personal belongings behind during a check. The drug tests were negative, but when police handed Milanov his phone, he noticed the settings had been changed. Suspecting that spyware may have been installed, he reached out to Amnesty International. In a report published this week, the international watchdog confirmed Milanov’s suspicions, finding forensic evidence that spyware was installed on the phones of several journalists and activists, including Milanov. In at least two cases, software provided by Cellebrite DI — an Israeli company that markets products for government and law enforcement agencies — was used to unlock the phones prior to infection, the report found. Then, Serbian spyware called NoviSpy took covert screenshots, copied contacts and uploaded them to a government-controlled server. 'In multiple cases, activists and a journalist reported signs of suspicious activity on their mobile phones directly following interviews with Serbian police and security authorities,' Amnesty said. 'Major consequences' seen Aleksa Tesic, who has reported on spyware in Serbia for the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, said the Amnesty report precisely documented for the first time cases showing technology abuse for the purpose of affecting civil liberties. 'We had various indications that this was happening before, because Serbia has been interested in advanced spy software for more than 10 years. But this could now have major consequences for democracy in Serbia,' Tesic said. Serbia’s Security Intelligence Agency (BIA) rejected the findings. In a statement on its website, the agency said the report contained 'nonsensical statements,' and that the BIA operates within local law. The Serbian Interior Ministry also denounced the report as incorrect. Milanov said the existence of spyware on his phone could 'jeopardize me, my family, colleagues and my sources.' 'If anything happens to any of us, I will hold the state responsible for it. I don't see who else it could be,' he told VOA Serbian. Milanov is based in Dimitrovgrad, at the border of Serbia and Bulgaria, 330 kilometers from Serbia’s capital, Belgrade. He recalled to VOA the traffic stop and police headquarters, where he believes his phone was accessed. 'There, I was told to turn off my phone and leave other personal belongings during the check. Alcohol and drug tests were, of course, negative. Yet the policeman was, as it seemed to me, messaging with someone unknown to me,' Milanov said. The reporter asked if he was free to go but was told, 'We are waiting for the boss.' Not long afterward, two men arrived. Milanov said they did not identify themselves. 'I assumed they were police inspectors. We went to another police station, where they questioned me about my work, financing, if I have traveled to Bulgaria recently and with whom,' he said. Milanov answered the questions before being released with his belongings. But changes to his phone settings led to a suspicion that something was wrong. At home, he used specialized software and found that although he had left his phone off at the police station, it had been switched back on for the duration of his police encounter. Call for accountability Pavol Szalai, who heads the European Union-Balkans Desk of Reporters Without Borders, told VOA that Amnesty’s report corroborates information his organization had about journalists targeted by surveillance. 'Spyware and surveillance used in an illegitimate way kills journalism without spilling [any] blood of a journalist. Surveillance undermines confidentiality of sources, which is a cornerstone of press freedom,' he said. 'And as for Serbia on the international level, it must be held accountable by the international organizations of which it is a member.' Serbia is a European Union candidate country. But a report this year by the European Commission said the country lacked progress, including in the rule of law, the fight against corruption, nonalignment with Russia sanctioning and media freedoms. A European Commission spokesperson told VOA that any attempts to illegally access citizens’ data, including journalists and political opponents, if confirmed, are not acceptable. 'The commission expects national authorities to thoroughly examine any such allegations and to restore citizens’ trust,' the spokesperson said. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that while he could not comment on a specific case, the use of spyware raises concerns. 'Speaking broadly, we have made quite clear since the outset of this administration the concerns that we have about governments that use spyware to track journalists, to track dissident groups, to track others who legitimately oppose or report on government activities,' Miller said in response to a question by VOA. Grant Baker, a research analyst for technology and democracy at Freedom House, said Serbia should conduct an impartial investigation and provide remedy to those affected. 'Authorities should also amend excessively broad laws regulating surveillance so they better align with both the European Court of Human Rights rulings and the International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance,' Baker said. The international community should also 'make clear that such disproportionate surveillance is a grave threat to democracy,' Baker said. 'While export controls are not a panacea, they are one important and necessary step to reducing the technology’s negative impact on human rights around the world,' he said. Serbia has a vibrant media landscape, but reporters often face political pressure, and impunity for crimes against journalists tends to be the norm, according to press freedom groups. Reporters Without Borders ranks Serbia 98th out of 180 on the Press Freedom Index, where 1 reflects the best environment for media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-a-police-stop-in-serbia-journalist-finds-spyware-on-phone-/7907624.html	2024-12-19T16:05:10-08:00	
Somalia 'open' to Ethiopian troop role	The Somali government is 'open' to a potential role for Ethiopian troops in an African Union mission scheduled to take over peacekeeping operations in the country next month. A senior Somali government official on Thursday told VOA’s Horn of Africa Service that the Somali government has 'secured' and 'allocated' all troops needed from the four other AU-troop-contributing countries — Burundi, Djibouti, Kenya and Uganda — to participate in the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia, or AUSSOM. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he had not been cleared to speak with reporters. But Somali leaders, he added, are now 'ready to reconsider' Ethiopian involvement in AUSSOM following a conciliatory dialogue between the countries hosted by Turkey last week. In recent months, Mogadishu had repeatedly demanded that Addis Ababa withdraw its troops from Somali territory unless Ethiopia canceled a controversial Memorandum of Understanding with Somalia’s breakaway region of Somaliland. The memorandum grants Ethiopia access to a 20-kilometer stretch of Red Sea coastline in return for potential recognition of Somaliland’s independence. The anonymous official said although Somalia secured all troops from those four AU nations to compensate for the absence of Ethiopian troops, the recent diplomatic breakthrough has reopened the door for involving Ethiopia’s military support. During the talks in Ankara, Ethiopia and Somalia agreed to respect each other’s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. The possible breakthrough came just weeks after a spokesperson for Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nebiat Getachew, told media outlets that Ethiopia’s focus was on al-Shabab. 'Ethiopia's key role, in any situation — in bringing al-Shabab to a level where it cannot be a threat to the region, as well as its role in the establishment and stability of the Somali government — is known both by the Somalis and the international community,' he said. 'It is an undeniable fact that the Ethiopian army has made sacrifices in blood and bones for this great result,' Nebiat added. 'The work of weakening the [Somalia-based] al-Shabab terrorist group will continue under any circumstances so that it does not pose a threat to our national security and the victories achieved through the sacrifices made so far are not reversed.' In a Thursday meeting, the AU’s peace and security council expressed concern about the threat posed by al-Shabab and condemned the group’s attacks on Somali and AU forces. The AU appealed to the U.N. Security Council to explore financing options for AUSSOM. 'This is vital for #AUSSOM to fulfill its mandate & support the #Somalia Security Sector Development Plan (SSDP),' the AU said in a post on the X social media platform. Starting in January, AUSSOM will have 11,900 personnel operating on the ground in Somalia, including soldiers, police and civilian support staff, according to Somali and AU officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-open-to-ethiopian-troop-role/7907731.html	2024-12-19T16:03:06-08:00	
During Brazil's elections, women and minorities in media targeted with hate	WASHINGTON — In a polarized environment during Brazil's municipal elections, journalists — mostly women or minorities — faced a disproportionate number of online and offline attacks. A report compiled by the Coalition in Defense of Journalism, or CDJor, monitored hostility toward journalists between Aug. 15, when the election campaign began, and Oct. 27, the date of the runoff. The findings published in December show most attacks were directed at female journalists, despite women making up a minority of the media workers monitored. The rise in attacks underscores a culture of growing hostility toward both media and minority groups in the country, analysts say. 'We live in a very misogynistic and macho culture, so this is what happens when women are in a public space, getting power and being empowered,' said Cristina Zahar of the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, which is a member of the CDJor. Brazil's Foreign Ministry and Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA's emails requesting comment. The recent elections were for mayors, vice mayors and city councilors in Brazilian municipalities. An overwhelming majority of right or center-right candidates won mayoral races in state capitals this year. The shift is indicative of a rightward trend within the country, Reuters reported, even as the far-right former president, Jair Bolsonaro, was unseated during the 2022 presidential elections. Alongside harassment of female journalists covering the latest municipal elections, Black journalists experienced widespread racism, according to the CDJor report. The report cited attacks on journalist Pedro Borges, who was the target of racial comments online after interviewing a right-wing political candidate on television. Black journalists in Brazil are often targets of dehumanizing name-calling and appearance-based attacks, Zahar, who lives in Sao Paulo, told VOA. 'It's a way of taking away their identity, taking away their right to be a good professional and exist in the journalism space,' Zahar said. Similarly, attacks directed at female journalists often consisted of comments on physical appearance and name-calling, according to the CDJor report. The attacks on women mostly took place on social media platforms. On Instagram, two out of three attacks were directed at female journalists. On X it was more than half, the report found. Juliana Dal Piva, an investigative journalist for the outlet ICL Noticias, has been on the receiving end of such harassment since Bolsonaro, who analysts say made 'recurrent and vicious attacks on journalists,' was president. Dal Piva said that after she published investigations into Bolsonaro's leadership in 2019, she faced legal persecution and an onslaught of online hatred. She said she has also received threatening messages from Bolsonaro's lawyer. 'The people around Bolsonaro felt they had to destroy me in some way,' Dal Piva told VOA. 'They couldn't point out any mistakes in any of my stories, so instead they attacked me and destroyed me in other ways — my reputation, my career, who I am.' There were other attack incidents in 2021 and 2022, but she said the worst occurred this June. A right-wing influencer published a doctored image of a text conversation implicating her in a plan to arrest Bolsonaro; online hatred and threats quickly followed, she said. Through X and Instagram, Bolsonaro supporters have used misogynistic slurs, made sexualized comments using a double entendre of her surname, and criticized her appearance. She also received death threats and comments telling her to take her own life, she told VOA. 'All of the content is very misogynous. It's very against women,' she said in a September interview with Global Investigative Journalism Network. 'For us as women journalists, you have to be strong, right? You can't cry, you can't be weak, you can't be afraid. This is not an option.' Although Bolsonaro is no longer in power, his leadership created 'an environment of permanent hostility' toward the press, according to Reporters Without Borders. Journalists are still struggling to navigate this environment, Zahar said. 'Since Bolsonaro, a red line has been crossed for the relationship between the presidency and the press,' Zahar told VOA. 'And we, the media, must learn how to deal with this situation.' Zahar and Dal Piva are both worried about the future of free expression in Brazil. 'When you don't have free press, what do you have? A dictatorship,' Zahar said. To remedy the situation, the CDJor report recommends that Brazilian authorities strengthen public policies to protect journalists, hold aggressors accountable and review abusive judicial practices. The report encouraged online platforms to develop more effective mechanisms to curb online attacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/during-brazil-s-elections-women-and-minorities-in-media-targeted-with-hate-/7907723.html	2024-12-19T15:53:25-08:00	
New US administration, new regional laws are shifting migration dynamics	Migration flows from Latin America to the United States slowed in 2024. New policies in pass-through countries and promises of mass deportations from the incoming U.S. administration are reshaping migration dynamics.​ Veronica Villafane reports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-us-administration-new-regional-laws-are-shifting-migration-dynamics/7907727.html	2024-12-19T15:39:57-08:00	
UN chief tells Israel to stop bombing Syria	U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday called on Israel to halt its airstrikes on Syria, calling them violations of the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. 'Syria's sovereignty, territorial unity and integrity must be fully restored, and all acts of aggression must come to an immediate end,' Guterres told reporters. Since the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad abruptly fell earlier this month, Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes, including around the capital, Damascus, that it says are aimed at destroying strategic weapons and military infrastructure. The family of Austin Tice, the American journalist detained in Syria for more than 12 years, has raised concerns that Israel may be striking a part of the country where the reporter is held. Israeli troops have also moved into the demilitarized zone between Syria and the Israel-occupied Golan Heights — formed after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war — that U.N. peacekeepers patrol. 'Let me be clear: There should be no military forces in the area of separation other than U.N. peacekeepers — period. Israel and Syria must uphold the terms of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement, which remains fully in force,' Guterres said. Israeli officials have said the move is a limited and temporary measure intended to ensure the security of Israel’s borders. However, Israeli officials have not indicated when Israel’s troops will be withdrawn. Guterres also said the U.N. is focusing on helping foster an 'inclusive, credible and peaceful' political transition in Syria and getting aid moving to address one of the most severe humanitarian crises in the world. 'This is a decisive moment — a moment of hope and history, but also one of great uncertainty,' he said. 'But it is the obligation of the international community to stand with the people of Syria who have suffered so much. Syria’s future must be shaped by its people, for its people, with the support of all of us.' Also on Thursday, the Pentagon confirmed to VOA that it has 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, more than twice the 900 it previously said were there. The Pentagon said the additional troops are considered temporary forces. They were sent to Syria to support the mission against Islamic State militants. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder told reporters he did not know how long the number had been 2,000, but it predated the fall of Assad. 'For many of our deployments, numbers will fluctuate from time to time. But given that this number is significantly higher than what we've been briefing, I wanted to let you know as soon as I found out this information,' Ryder told VOA. He added that he learned of the new figure Thursday. Meanwhile, Iraq on Thursday sent nearly 2,000 Syrian soldiers back to Syria after they had sought refuge in Iraq during the push by rebel forces to oust Assad, according to an Iraqi military statement. The Syrian soldiers were returned at their request and entered via an Iraq-Syria border crossing, according to the statement. The Iraqi Defense Ministry kept the soldiers’ weapons and will return them to a new Syrian government once it is formed, the statement said. Russian response Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday rejected the notion that Assad’s ouster represented a defeat for Russia. Putin said during his annual news conference that Russia had 'achieved our goals' in Syria, where it rushed to provide direct military support for Assad’s government more than nine years ago to help push back rebel fighters. Russian forces operated out of a network of bases in Syria to carry out airstrikes that helped Assad’s military gain an advantage in the civil war. After rebels made a surprise surge that toppled Assad’s government earlier this month, Assad fled to Russia. Putin said Thursday that he had not yet met with Assad but planned to do so. Among the topics Putin said he would discuss is the whereabouts of Tice. He also said he could ask those now in control in Syria about Tice. Syrian transition U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that Syrians face an 'incredibly fraught' opportunity as they work to shift away from decades of Assad family rule to a new future. Speaking at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations, Blinken said the question is whether Syrians will 'seize an opportunity for the first time in decades not to be governed by a dictator, not to be governed by an outside power, not to be governed by a terrorist organization, not to be governed by one sect or minority over another.' He also pointed to the rebels who seized power, and the opportunity they have to engage with the outside world and not take actions that will isolate the country. Blinken highlighted the example of the Taliban in Afghanistan, saying the group pledged to be more moderate after it seized control but ultimately acted otherwise and ended up 'terribly isolated around the world.' He said those in Syria need to move the country forward in an inclusive, nonsectarian way, to protect minorities and deal with security challenges such as chemical weapons and groups such as Islamic State. Syria’s new education minister, Nazir Mohammad al-Qadri, said Thursday that the new government would not restrict the rights of girls to learn. 'Education is a red line for the Syrian people, more important than food and water,' he told Reuters in Damascus. 'The right to education is not limited to one specific gender,' he said. 'There may be more girls in our schools than boys.' Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-tells-israel-to-stop-bombing-syria/7907702.html	2024-12-19T15:12:16-08:00	
Biden's immigration legacy is a complex one	WASHINGTON — Immigration has been a defining challenge of the Biden presidency, marked by record numbers of asylum-seekers and other migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. President Joe Biden pledged to modernize the nation's immigration system and rebuild a refugee resettlement program that had hit historic lows under the previous administration. But despite issuing a record number of immigration-related executive actions — surpassing the Trump administration — Biden's efforts drew criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. Critics on the right said the administration was being too lenient, while those on the left said it was too harsh. The Biden administration inherited a fractured immigration system, including a backlog of asylum cases, a reduction in refugee processing capacity, and policies such as Title 42 that significantly shaped migration patterns. During a webinar, Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at Migration Policy Institute (MPI), provided an overview of the Biden administration's record. He noted that Biden's approach to enforcement away from the border has been seen as largely favorable by experts and immigration advocates. He said Biden administration officials focused on enforcement guidelines, rather than trying to deport everyone, yet the crisis at the border cast a long shadow over his legacy. He emphasized the success of legal immigration under Biden, pointing to the high numbers of visas issued, the record number of naturalizations and the resurgence of refugee admissions. About '3.5 million people were naturalized under the Biden administration, the highest of any one-term presidency,' he said. However, Chishti said the administration's handling of border security was less successful. The administration faced overwhelming numbers of migrants, many arriving from countries beyond Mexico and Central America. 'The Biden presidency entered office with a crisis at the border, which was precipitated by the COVID crisis and Title 42,' he said. The administration's failure to call the situation a crisis, he added, contributed to a perception of mishandling, despite efforts to manage it through new programs like the CBP One app and various parole initiatives. Handling the border Marielena Hincapie, a visiting scholar at Cornell Law School who participated in the webinar, praised efforts under the Department of Homeland Security's leadership to increase naturalization rates, expedite work permit processing, and implement innovative policies such as deferred action for undocumented workers who had experienced labor disputes. These measures, she said, benefited not only immigrants but also the broader U.S. workforce and economy. Hincapie also criticized the administration's handling of border issues, calling it mismanagement. She highlighted the role of Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in exacerbating the crisis by busing and flying thousands of migrants to New York, Chicago and elsewhere. Hincapie also pointed to additional involvement at the state level, saying, 'There's not only the busing and flying of migrants, which DeSantis did, but also litigation.' 'And I really see this as the Biden's inner circle, his political and communications folks, failed to understand that this was a narrative war and the fact that they refused to call it a crisis when that is what voters were seeing. … They fell silent and decided not to prioritize immigration, and by doing so, they ceded the narrative,' she said. Migration shifts The Biden administration also faced shifts in migration patterns. Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, associate policy analyst at MPI, said the reality at the U.S.-Mexico border shifted once again during Biden's term with migrants arriving in large numbers from across the Western Hemisphere and from countries around the world. The demographics of migrants also changed, she said, from single adults to families, and many were seeking asylum, further complicating border processing. U.S. law offers asylum to people facing persecution in their home countries on the basis of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular group. Though there are two kinds of asylum, affirmative and defensive, not all asylum claims come from migrants arriving at the border. Immigrants may claim affirmative asylum within one year of their latest arrival in the United States or request a defensive asylum while fighting an order of deportation. 'All this resulted in a high number of migrants released into the interior of the U.S.,' Putzel-Kavanaugh said. This brought the border crisis into the interior of the nation, with large numbers of newly arrived migrants heavily concentrated in cities like New York, Chicago and Denver — cities already facing housing shortages. Putzel-Kavanaugh also praised the Biden administration's work to pair increased enforcement with options for safe and orderly legal migration. 'We saw the introduction of programs like CBP One app, which allowed migrants to make appointments at ports of entry along the border, and the parole program for nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela,' she said. Despite these efforts, Putzel-Kavanaugh said many saw the measures as 'too little, too late.' But that shift in migrant arrivals from irregular crossings to legally arriving at ports of entry has been one of the few success stories of Biden's border management strategies. Monthly migrant encounters dropped significantly from the highs of December 2022, with a decrease from more than 300,000 encounters to about 106,000 in October 2024, according to CBP figures. Issue for years to come While Biden's efforts to modernize immigration systems and address asylum claims were significant, experts said the ongoing challenges of irregular migration and border security will remain a focal point in U.S. immigration policy for years to come. 'I do think in summary, we do have two real important crises in our country,' Chishti said. 'We do have a labor market crisis across occupations from low, mid to high levels [and a border crisis]. This is why a lot of these people who have come in, even though they came irregularly, have been absorbed.' Chishti pointed to remarks in 2022 from Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, about the U.S. labor market and its dynamics. Powell said immigration is a key source of labor supply, and the significant decline in immigration levels during the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the labor supply-demand mismatch. That shortfall in immigration resulted in fewer workers available to fill jobs, particularly in sectors that traditionally rely on immigrant labor, such as health care, hospitality and agriculture. Powell acknowledged that addressing the labor supply constraints, including through immigration policy, could help ease pressure to raise wages and reduce inflation without significant harm to employment levels. 'The reason nothing is happening on changes or reform to our legal immigration system — so we can get more people legally for our labor market needs — is because of the crisis of the border,' Chishti said. 'These are twin crises, but they're getting interlinked,' he said. 'Unless we get the border crisis under control, we won't be able to address our labor market crisis.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-s-immigration-legacy-is-a-complex-one/7907567.html	2024-12-19T13:04:27-08:00

US says Pakistan developing missiles that eventually could hit US	WASHINGTON — A senior White House official on Thursday said nuclear-armed Pakistan is developing long-range ballistic missile capabilities that eventually could allow it to strike targets outside of South Asia, including in the United States. In his stunning revelation about the onetime close U.S. partner, deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said Islamabad's conduct raised 'real questions' about the aims of its ballistic missile program. 'Candidly, it's hard for us to see Pakistan's actions as anything other than an emerging threat to the United States,' Finer told the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace audience. 'Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology, from long-range ballistic missile systems to equipment that would enable the testing of significantly larger rocket motors,' he said. If those trends continue, Finer said, 'Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.' His speech came a day after Washington announced a new round of sanctions related to Pakistan's ballistic missile development program, including on the state-run defense agency that oversees the program.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-pakistan-developing-missiles-that-eventually-could-hit-us/7907518.html	2024-12-19T12:28:19-08:00

US imposes sanctions on Iran, Houthi-related targets	The United States imposed sanctions on Thursday on Iran and Houthi-related entities, according to the Treasury Department website which listed a number of individuals, companies and vessels that had been targeted. The sanctions target three vessels involved in the trade of Iranian petroleum and petrochemicals, which generates billions of dollars for Iran's leaders, supporting Tehran's nuclear program, development of ballistic missiles and financing of proxies including Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis, the Treasury said. 'The United States is committed to targeting Iran’s key revenue streams that fund its destabilizing activities,' Bradley Smith, acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a release. Smith said Iran relies on a 'shadowy network' of vessels, companies, and facilitators for those activities. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. The vessels targeted were the Djibouti-flagged crude oil tanker MS Enola, owned by Journey Investment company, the San Marino-flagged MS Angia, and the Panama-flagged MS Melenia. The last two tankers are managed and operated by Liberia- and Greece-registered Rose Shipping Limited. The sanctions block all property and interests in the United States of the designated parties, and U.S. persons and entities dealing with them could be exposed to sanctions or enforcement actions including fines. The Treasury said it also imposed sanctions on 12 individuals to pressure procurement and financing schemes by the Yemen Houthi group. Those included Hashem Ismail Ali Ahmad al-Madani, the head of the Houthi-aligned central bank in Sanaa, for their alleged roles in trafficking arms, laundering money and shipping illicit Iranian oil for the benefit of the Houthis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-sanctions-on-iran-houthi-related-targets/7907399.html	2024-12-19T11:22:58-08:00	
Trump pushes for conflict-ending Ukraine-Russia ‘deal'	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump says the leaders of Ukraine and Russia should be 'prepared to make a deal' to end the brutal conflict that has consumed Ukraine since 2022.

HRW report: Israel committing genocide by depriving Gaza civilians of water	A new report Thursday from New York-based advocacy group Human Rights Watch, or HRW, has accused Israel of committing genocide for intentionally depriving civilians in Gaza of an adequate water supply, likely resulting in the deaths of thousands. The 179-page report published on the group’s website outlines how, since the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas began in October 2023, Israeli authorities and forces cut off and later restricted piped water to Gaza, as well as cutting electricity and restricting fuel, rendering most of the enclave’s sanitation infrastructure useless. Additionally, the report said Israel deliberately destroyed and damaged water and sanitation infrastructure and water repair materials; and blocked the entry of critical water supplies. In a statement, HRW Executive Director Tirana Hassan accused Israel of deliberately depriving Palestinians of an element essential for human life for more than a year. 'This isn’t just negligence,' Hassan said. 'It is a calculated policy of deprivation that has led to the deaths of thousands from dehydration and disease that is nothing short of the crime against humanity of extermination, and an act of genocide.' Israel emphatically denied the charges. In a statement, Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories agency, COGAT, called HRW’s charges a 'libelous claim,' and 'an egregious lie.' The COGAT statement said millions of liters of water flow into Gaza through three pipelines, and Israel has 'facilitated hundreds of water infrastructure repairs and fixed water lines leading to Gaza on the Israeli side that were damaged by Hamas.' 'We operate in accordance with international law,' the COGAT statement said. 'Saying otherwise is just flagrant deceit,' the statement said. Earlier Thursday, medics in Gaza reported Israeli airstrikes overnight killed at least 13 people in northern and central parts of the Gaza Strip. The strikes came as mediators worked to try to secure a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that would include the release of hostages still held in Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said late Wednesday that he is 'hopeful' an agreement can be reached and pledged to spend all the time left in the waning days of the Biden administration to try to make a deal happen. 'It should happen. It needs to happen. We need to get people home,' Blinken said during an event at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'We need to get the ceasefire. We need to get people moving in a different direction, toward better lives, toward repairing the terrible damage that’s been done.' Blinken said Hamas has been the 'main impediment' to a ceasefire deal, but that he thinks Hamas leaders understand at this point that their supporters such as Hezbollah and Iran are 'not coming to the rescue.' CIA Director William Burns landed in Qatar on Wednesday for meetings with Qatari officials, the latest in what has been months of work by the United States, Qatar and Egypt to try to broker an agreement. Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, expressed hope about achieving a deal as he spoke to reporters Wednesday. 'After many rejections by Hamas, we hope we're going to have some news before the holiday of Hanukkah and Christmas,' Danon said. Still, Danon cautioned that in the past, Hamas has made last-minute demands that had thwarted other possible agreements, while the militants have in turn blamed Israel for the monthslong stalemate in reaching a halt to the warfare. New possible terms of a ceasefire and hostage release seemed in flux. 'We hope it will be in one stage' with the release of all hostages, Danon said, 'because we want to see all the hostages back home.' He added, though, 'Maybe it will not be in one stage. And basically, it will be similar to what we saw in the past more than a year ago — that you have a ceasefire, a long one, and at the same time of the ceasefire, during that ceasefire, hostages will be released. And we are talking mainly on the humanitarian aspect of women and the sick and the older hostages.' Months of talks have proven fruitless in halting the fighting triggered by the shock Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Gaza health officials say Israel’s counteroffensive has killed at least 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, while Israel says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas combatants. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and others. VOA’s United Nations correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report. Some information came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hrw-report-israel-committing-genocide-by-depriving-gaza-civilians-of-water/7907367.html	2024-12-19T10:38:33-08:00	
Nicaragua's proposed media reform echoes that of other authoritarian regimes	Nicaragua is expected to rubber stamp a change to its constitution in January that alters presidential power and increases state control over media. If ratified, the change would mandate that the state has power to ensure media outlets and platforms are not 'subject to foreign interests and do not spread false news.' Analysts say it would replicate a move in other authoritarian countries around the world, including Cuba, Venezuela and former Soviet countries. Carlos Jornet, president of the freedom of the press and information committee of the Inter American Association, said that controlling free speech in social media and on the internet was a 'growing phenomenon' in the Americas. 'Worse still, the governments promoting such controls do so after having co-opted the judiciary, the legislature, and all oversight bodies,' he told VOA. 'It is clear that when the government labels information as false, there will be no possibility to exercise a defense or argue about the veracity of a complaint or the relevance of an opinion,' Jornet said. The latest reform, which was passed in November, must be confirmed in a second vote in January. Requested by President Daniel Ortega, the reform seeks to extend his term in office from five to six years and change the role of vice president, who is Ortega’s wife Rosario Murillo, to 'co-president.' The police and military will be strengthened in a way that allows Ortega to tighten his grip on power in the Central American state. Ortega’s attacks on media freedom have already forced hundreds of journalists and others into exile to avoid threat of arrest and imprisonment, say watchdogs. More than 200 political prisoners were freed last year and expelled to the United States, including five former presidential hopefuls jailed after seeking to challenge Ortega in the 2021 election, and the publisher of one of the country’s oldest newspapers. At least 229 people detained in Nicaragua for political reasons suffered torture and 'crimes against humanity,' according to the nongovernmental organization, Nicaragua Never Again Human Rights Collective. The group estimated that around 2,000 people have been arrested in connection with 2018 anti-government protests, Reuters reported this month. Critics of the latest constitutional change say it effectively legalizes the 'absolute power' wielded by Ortega and Murillo. However, Gustavo Porras, the head of the Nicaraguan legislature, has said the reform will be approved next month and described the criticism as a 'stupid way of carrying out opposition.' The Nicaraguan Embassy in Madrid did not respond to VOA’s emailed request for comment. Lucia Pineda Ubau, director of the news site 100% Noticias, said the new constitution will make it easier for authorities to target independent journalism. 'This is serious because it includes it in the constitution policy, which continues to punish, persecute and criminalize journalists and the media,' she told VOA from her home in exile in Costa Rica. 'This adds to the reform of cybercrime [legislation], which was passed in September this year,' she said. The impending constitutional reforms propose increased sentences from 10 to 15 years in prison for propagating false news or misrepresentations that are ruled to have caused alarm, fear or anxiety. It also expands the law’s reach beyond Nicaragua’s borders. 'This government has increased the terror for exiled journalists,' Pineda said. The changes in Nicaragua replicate similar laws and regulations in the region that analysts say are used to silence dissent and media. In Venezuela, attacks on independent media by the government of President Nicolas Maduro over the past 11 years have created a 'kind of news desert,' according to the Committee for Protection of Journalists. A report that the watchdog published earlier this year found that the government did not bother to carry out a fresh crackdown against the media before the July presidential election because of the effectiveness of its sustained campaign of repression. Cuba has also passed a series of laws that further regulate freedom of expression, said William LeoGrande, a Cuba expert and professor of government at American University in Washington. 'Cuba has similar laws to Nicaragua,' he told VOA, referencing Decree 35, which entails criminal penalties for dissemination of disinformation and requirements for telecommunications providers to suspend or terminate services. 'It also potentially gives authorities enormous latitude to criminalize online commentary [like] ‘inciting mobilizations or other acts that alter public order,’ ‘subverting the constitutional order’ or ‘defamation with an impact on the country’s prestige.’' LeoGrande said that Cuba’s penal code, which came into force in 2022, contains provisions so broadly worded that they can be used to charge people for criticism or non-violent protest. Cuba’s Social Communication Law, which came into force in October, imposes closer regulation on online communication and encourages the repression of dissenting voices. Reporters With Borders said in October that 11 journalists have already been summoned by Cuba’s National Revolutionary Police, charged and forced to resign from their jobs. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said the impending changes to Nicaragua’s constitution mark a further erosion of any checks and balances on executive power. 'If adopted, these changes will sound the death knell for fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in Nicaragua,' he said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nicaragua-proposed-reform-on-media-echoes-that-of-other-authoritarian-regimes/7907288.html	2024-12-19T10:15:58-08:00	
US ambassador: US arms manufacturers could help boost Vietnam's capabilities	HANOI, VIETNAM — U.S. weapons manufacturers could work with Vietnamese counterparts to help build Vietnam's armed forces, the U.S. ambassador to the southeast Asian country said on Thursday. 'Our goal is to ensure that Vietnam has what it needs to defend its interests at sea, in the air, on the ground and in cyberspace,' U.S. Ambassador Marc Knapper said at an international arms expo in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi. The expo, held at the Gia Lam airport, brought together 250 exhibitors, including geopolitical rivals such as the United States, China, Russia, Ukraine, Israel and Iran. U.S. exhibitors included Boeing and Textron Aviation. China was present with Norinco and Gaodu International Trade. Iran's defense ministry pavilion wasn't far from booths set up by Israeli companies Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries. Several Russian firms also attended, along with Ukraine's Motor Sich. Vietnam has been trying to increase its domestic arms manufacturing while reducing its reliance on Russia for weapon imports. In 2022, Russia made up around 60% of all of Vietnam's military purchases, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. But Vietnam's longstanding efforts to diversify its imports have been accelerated by the war in Ukraine. It has also been trying to boost its own capacity to make arms and displayed military equipment it made at the expo. A key driver for Vietnam is the escalating tensions in the South China Sea, a key trade and security route. It is a flashpoint in Asia and a fault line in the U.S.-China regional rivalry. Vietnam has been critical of China's increasingly hostile actions in the disputed waters. Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries have overlapping claims in the busy sea passage. Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh hailed the event as a 'message of peace, cooperation and development.' He was later given a tour of a military plane made by U.S. firm Lockheed Martin.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-ambassador-us-arms-manufacturers-could-help-boost-vietnam-s-capabilities/7907234.html	2024-12-19T09:07:42-08:00	
France's Macron visits cyclone-devastated Mayotte as residents plead for aid	MAMOUDZOU, MAYOTTE — French President Emmanuel Macron arrived Thursday in the Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte to survey Cyclone Chido's destruction and was immediately confronted with a firsthand account of devastation across the French territory. 'Mayotte is demolished,' Assane Haloi, a security agent, told Macron after he stepped off the plane. Macron had been moving along in a line of people greeting him when Haloi grasped his hand and spoke for a minute about the harrowing conditions the islands faced without bare essentials since Saturday when the strongest cyclone in nearly a century ripped through the French territory off the coast of Africa. 'We are without water, without electricity, there is nowhere to go because everything is demolished,' she said. 'We can't even shelter, we are all wet with our children covering ourselves with whatever we have so that we can sleep.' Numbers of dead unknown At least 31 people have died and more than 1,500 people were injured, more than 200 critically, French authorities said. But it's feared hundreds or even thousands of people have died. Macron arrived shortly after The Associated Press and other journalists from outside were able to reach Mayotte to provide accounts from survivors of the horror over the weekend when winds howled above 220 kph (136 mph) and peeled the roofs and walls from homes that collapsed around the people sheltering inside. In the shantytown Kaweni on the outskirts of the capital Mamoudzou, a swath of hillside homes was reduced to scraps of corrugated metal, plastic, piles of bedding and clothing, and pieces of timber marking the frame where homes once stood. 'Those of us who are here are still in shock, but God let us live,' Nassirou Hamidouni said as he dug in the rubble of his former home. 'We are sad. We can't sleep because of all of the houses that have been destroyed.' Macron took a helicopter tour of the damage and then met with patients and staff at a hospital, who described having to work around the clock. A woman who works in the psychological unit became emotional as she described staff becoming exhausted and unable to care for patients. 'Help the hospital staff, help the hospital,' pleaded the woman, whose name was not known. 'Everyone from top to bottom is wiped out.' More help on the way Macron, who was wearing a traditional red, black and gold Mayotte scarf over his white dress shirt and tie, put his hand on her shoulder as she wiped away tears. He sought to reassure people that food, medical aid and additional rescuers arrived with him and more help was on its way in the form of water and a field hospital to be set up Friday. A navy ship brought 180 tons of aid and equipment, the French military said. But the visit took a testy turn when Macron was criticized for being out of touch about what was happening on the ground by a man who said they had gone six days in Ouangani without water or a visit from rescue services. The president said it took the military four days to clear the roads and get a plan in place to deliver aid. 'If you want to continue shouting to get airtime,' Macron said as he was cut off, by the man saying he didn't intend to shout. 'If you are interested in my response, if not I will walk away.' Residents have expressed agony at not knowing if loved ones were dead or missing, partly because of the hasty burials required under Muslim practice to lay the dead to rest within 24 hours. 'We're dealing with open-air mass graves,' said Estelle Youssoufa, who represents Mayotte in the French parliament. 'There are no rescuers, no one has come to recover the buried bodies.' Macron acknowledged that many who died haven't been reported. He said phone services will be repaired 'in the coming days' so that people can report their missing loved ones. France's poorest territory Mayotte, with a population of 320,000 residents and an estimated 100,000 additional migrants, is France's poorest territory. It is part of an archipelago located between mainland Africa's east coast and northern Madagascar that had been a French colony. Mayotte voted to remain part of France in a 1974 referendum as the rest of the islands became the independent nation of Comoros. The cyclone devastated entire neighborhoods as many people ignored warnings, thinking the storm wouldn't be so extreme. Signs of the disaster and its impact were everywhere. Streets remained swamped in puddles. Bright clothing was hung to dry on the wooden frames of homes and along the railings of a footbridge over a debris-strewn stream in the Kaweni slum. Throngs of motorbikes and cars lined up at a gas station still in service. Families sprawled out on blankets at a school where 500 people were taking shelter. Women washed clothing in buckets of water as children played with the pieces of a giant chessboard. Alibouna Haithouna, a displaced mother of four, was with her own mother who had been forced to leave a hospital after her son died there. 'There was a tragedy. We lost my brother. We are here,' Haithouna said. 'My brother's body, we haven't been able to get it from the hospital because there is a lot of paperwork to do and in addition to that you have to pay to recover the body.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-macron-visits-cyclone-devastated-mayotte-as-residents-plead-for-aid/7907162.html	2024-12-19T08:30:05-08:00	
Appeals court removes prosecutor Fani Willis from Georgia election case against Trump, others	ATLANTA, Georgia — A state appeals court on Thursday removed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump and others but did not dismiss the indictment, leaving the future of the prosecution uncertain. The case against Trump and more than a dozen others had already been largely stalled for months while the Georgia Court of Appeals considered the pretrial appeal. The new ruling means it will be up to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia to find another prosecutor to take over the case and to decide whether to continue to pursue it, though that could be delayed if Willis decides to appeal to the state Supreme Court. But whether it is ultimately Willis or another prosecutor in charge, it seems unlikely that a prosecution against Trump could continue while he's president for the next four years. But there are 14 other defendants who still face charges. Two federal criminal cases against Trump have already been abandoned after the Republican won the presidency in November. Meanwhile, a judge in New York has refused throw out his hush money conviction from earlier this year, though the future of that case is uncertain. A grand jury in Atlanta indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023, accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn Trump's narrow 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the state. Four of them have since pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty. Trump and some of the remaining defendants tried to get Willis and her office removed from the case and to have the case dismissed. They argued that her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest and that she made improper public statements about the case. Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee ruled in March that no conflict of interest existed that should force Willis off the case. Trump and the others appealed that ruling.	https://www.voanews.com/a/appeals-court-removes-prosecutor-fani-willis-from-georgia-election-case-against-trump-others/7907133.html	2024-12-19T08:06:32-08:00	
Suspect in killing of US insurance CEO will return to New York to face murder charges	HOLLIDAYSBURG, Pennsylvania — The suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO will return to New York to face murder charges after agreeing to be extradited Thursday during a court appearance in Pennsylvania where he was arrested last week after five days on the run. Luigi Mangione waived a preliminary hearing on the Pennsylvania charges in exchange for the prosecutor giving him a 20-page investigative report from the Altoona Police Department. Mangione also waived extradition to New York. Blair County Judge David Consiglio ordered that Mangione be turned over to the New York Police Department. At least a dozen uniformed NYPD officers were in the courtroom. The 26-year-old Ivy League graduate is accused of ambushing and shooting Brian Thompson on Dec. 4 outside a Manhattan hotel where the head of the United States' largest health insurer was walking to an investor conference. Authorities have said Mangione was carrying the gun used to kill Thompson, a passport, fake IDs and about $10,000 when he was arrested on Dec. 9 while eating breakfast at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Mangione, 26, of Towson, Maryland, was arrested on Dec. 9 when police were called to a McDonald's restaurant on a commercial strip in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after he was reported to match the description of Thompson's killer. The shooting of Thompson was captured on security video, but the suspect eluded police before Mangione was captured 446 kilometers west of New York. Mangione, an Ivy League computer science graduate from a prominent family, was carrying a handwritten letter that called health insurance companies 'parasitic' and complained about corporate greed, according to a law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press last week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspect-in-killing-of-us-insurance-ceo-will-return-to-new-york-to-face-murder-charges/7907114.html	2024-12-19T08:04:33-08:00	
French court finds 51 defendants guilty in mass rape trial	After a French court Thursday found all 51 defendants guilty in a drugging-and-rape case, the victim, Gisele Pelicot said that the trial has been a 'difficult ordeal,' but that she never regretted making the case public. Following a four-month trial in the southeastern city of Avignon, Pelicot’s ex-husband of 50 years, 72-year-old Dominique Pelicot, received a sentence of a maximum of 20 years in prison. He pleaded guilty in September to repeatedly drugging his wife, raping her while she was unconscious and recruiting strangers to join him over a period of 10 years. The five-judge panel handed Pelicot’s 50 co-defendants, a group of men from 27 to 74 years old, sentences ranging from three to 20 years in prison. In her first comments following the verdicts, Gisele Pelicot told reporters her first thoughts were with her three children and her grandchildren, 'because they are the future, and it is also for them that I have fought this battle.' She said she was also thinking of all the other families affected 'by this tragedy.' Finally, she said, 'I think of the unrecognized victims whose stories often remain in the shadows. I want you to know that we share the same struggle.' Pelicot has become a symbol of courage and resilience to many, and crowds of supporters gathered outside the courthouse as the case went on. Asked by reporters about complaints by her supporters that the sentences were too lenient, Pelicot said she respected the court and the decision. She said, 'I trust, now, in our capacity to collectively seize a future in which each one of us, woman and man, may live in harmony with mutual respect and understanding.' Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-court-finds-51-defendants-guilty-in-mass-rape-trial/7907101.html	2024-12-19T07:54:36-08:00	
UN chief names Mexican lawyer to determine fate of Syria’s missing	UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Thursday that he is appointing the former head of Mexico’s National Search Commission to head an independent mechanism for determining the fate of tens of thousands of missing and forcibly disappeared persons in Syria. 'We pledge our support to those who continue to live with the agony of uncertainty,' Guterres said of the families of the missing. In June 2023, the U.N. General Assembly created the Independent Institution on Missing Persons in Syria, or IIMP. It is mandated to establish the fate and whereabouts of all missing persons in Syria, and to support victims, including survivors and families of the missing. 'I am announcing today the appointment of Karla Quintana of Mexico as head of this Institution,' Guterres told reporters. 'She and her team must be allowed to fully carry out their mandate.' From February 2019 to August 2023, Quintana was the national commissioner for the Search of Missing Persons in Mexico, where more than 110,000 people are listed as missing or disappeared, mostly because of organized crime. Quintana, 46, a human rights lawyer and professor, will have a mammoth task ahead of her. The Syrian Network for Human Rights, or SNHR, says at least 157,634 people went missing from the start of the Syrian civil war in March 2011 until August 2024. Since the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria on Dec. 8, prison doors in many parts of the country have been opened and thousands of the detained released. Mass graves have been discovered. But families continue to search for information about tens of thousands of loved ones who are still unaccounted for. In an interview with VOA last week, SNHR Founder and Director Fadel Abdul Ghany said about 105,000 people are still unaccounted for and the organization believes that 'the vast majority' of them are dead. Political transition The U.N. chief also urged an 'inclusive, credible and peaceful' Syrian-led political process, saying they must manage the situation carefully or risk progress unraveling. In the meantime, he said the United Nations is shifting its humanitarian response inside the country to respond to the new situation on the ground. Guterres’ new humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, has been on the ground in Damascus, Aleppo and Homs this week. After 14 years of civil war, Syria already was one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with 17 million people — more than 70% of the population — in need of assistance and funding in short supply. The U.N. chief warned that the war is 'still far from over.' He pointed to 'significant hostilities' in the north, the threat to 'many parts' of Syria from Islamic State fighters, and ongoing Israeli airstrikes and military movement in the zone where U.N. peacekeepers patrol between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria. 'They are violations of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. They must stop,' he said of the Israeli strikes, which have targeted military facilities, including chemical weapons stockpiles and the entire Syrian navy. 'Syria’s sovereignty, territorial unity, and integrity must be fully restored, and all acts of aggression must come to an immediate end,' Guterres said. 'This is a decisive moment — a moment of hope and history, but also one of great uncertainty.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-names-mexican-lawyer-to-determine-fate-of-syria-missing/7907110.html	2024-12-19T07:52:18-08:00	
Ukrainian military gets NATO-standard training in Poland, Lithuania	Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Ukrainian soldiers have been receiving training from NATO troops. VOA recently visited one of these training sites where troops from Britain and Canada are training Ukrainian soldiers.

Amazon workers strike at seven US facilities ahead of Christmas rush	Amazon.com workers at seven U.S. facilities walked off the job early on Thursday during the holiday shopping rush, aiming to pressure the retailer into contract talks with their union. Warehouse workers in cities including New York, Atlanta and San Francisco are taking part in the 'largest' strike against Amazon, said the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents about 10,000 workers at 10 of the firm's facilities. The company, however, said it does not expect any effect on its operations during one of the busiest times of the year. Unions represent only about 1% of the hourly workforce of Amazon, the world's second-largest private employer after Walmart, and it has multiple locations in many metro areas. The Teamsters had given Amazon a Dec. 15 deadline to begin negotiations and warehouse workers had recently voted to authorize a strike. 'If your package is delayed during the holidays, you can blame Amazon's insatiable greed,' Teamsters' General President Sean O'Brien said late on Wednesday. 'We gave Amazon a clear deadline to come to the table and do right by our members. They ignored it. This strike is on them.' The retailer's shares were trading 1.5% higher in premarket hours, a sign that investors do not expect a big disruption from the strike. The Teamsters have 'intentionally misled the public' and 'threatened, intimidated and attempted to coerce' employees and third-party drivers to join them, an Amazon spokesperson said on Thursday. Observers said Amazon was unlikely to come to the table to bargain as that could open the door to more union actions. It employs more than 800,000 people at its U.S. warehouses and has more than 600 fulfillment centers, delivery stations and same-day facilities in the country. Amazon has responded to recent organization efforts with legal challenges. Amazon has filed objections with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) over a 2022 union vote in Staten Island, alleging bias among agency officials. It also challenged the constitutionality of the NLRB in a September federal lawsuit. Earlier this year, the company announced a $2.1 billion investment to raise pay for fulfillment and transportation employees in the U.S., increasing base wages for employees by at least $1.50 to around $22 per hour, a roughly 7% increase.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amazon-workers-strike-at-seven-us-facilities-ahead-of-christmas-rush/7907005.html	2024-12-19T06:23:10-08:00	
China lets Sweden, Finland, Germany, Denmark board ship in cable breach case	COPENHAGEN, DENMARK — China has allowed representatives from Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark to board a Chinese bulk carrier at the center of an investigation into Baltic Sea cable breaches, the Danish foreign minister said on Thursday. The Yi Peng 3 vessel is wanted in Sweden for questioning over a breach of two undersea fiber-optic cables in November and has been stationary in waters nearby for a month while diplomats in Stockholm and Beijing discussed the matter. Investigators quickly zeroed in on the ship, which left the Russian port of Ust-Luga on Nov. 15, and a Reuters analysis of MarineTraffic data showed that the vessel's coordinates corresponded to the time and place of the breaches. The Baltic Sea cables, one linking Finland and Germany and the other connecting Sweden to Lithuania, were damaged on Nov. 17 and 18, prompting German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius to say he assumed it was caused by sabotage. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen on Thursday said his country had facilitated a meeting earlier this week between representatives from Germany, Sweden, Finland and China, helping break a monthlong standoff. 'It is our expectation that once the inspection has been completed by this group of people from the four countries, the ship will be able to sail towards its destination,' Lokke Rasmussen said. LSEG data showed Yi Peng 3 remained anchored in the same spot in the Kattegat strait between Denmark and Sweden. Swedish police in a statement said they participated on board the vessel as observers only, while Chinese authorities conducted investigations. 'In parallel, the preliminary investigation into sabotage in connection with two cable breaks in the Baltic Sea is continuing,' the police said. The actions taken on board the ship on Thursday were not part of the Swedish-led preliminary investigation, the police added. The breaches happened in Sweden's exclusive economic zone and Swedish prosecutors are leading the investigation on suspicion of possible sabotage. Western intelligence officials from multiple countries have said they are confident the Chinese ship caused the cuts to both cables. They have expressed different views on whether these were accidents or could have been deliberate. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson had urged the ship to return to Sweden to aid the investigation. The was no immediate response from the Chinese Foreign Ministry outside of business hours on Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-lets-sweden-finland-germany-denmark-board-ship-in-cable-breach-case/7906994.html	2024-12-19T06:19:08-08:00	
Pakistan defends ballistic missile development amid new US sanctions	Islamabad — Pakistan sharply criticized the United States Thursday for imposing new sanctions against the nuclear-armed country’s long-range ballistic missile program, labeling the move as 'double standards and discriminatory practices.' U.S. State Department spokesperson Mathew Miller announced the measures on Wednesday, saying they were imposed under an executive order that 'targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.' Miller said the sanctions cover Pakistan’s state-owned National Defense Complex and three entities collaborating with it in the development of long-range ballistic missiles, including the Shaheen services of missiles. Pakistan’s foreign ministry rejected the move as 'unfortunate and biased.' The ministry statement said Islamabad’s defense capabilities are aimed at safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty and preserving peace in South Asia. 'The latest installment of sanctions defies the objective of peace and security by aiming to accentuate military asymmetries,' the ministry said, apparently referring to Pakistan’s rivalry with nuclear-armed neighbor India. 'Such policies have dangerous implications for the strategic stability of our region and beyond,' the ministry warned, without elaborating. The designation of National Defense Complex and other firms freezes all U.S. property they own and bars U.S. citizens from engaging in business transactions with them. 'Pakistan’s strategic program is a sacred trust bestowed by 240 million people upon its leadership. The sanctity of this trust, held in the highest esteem across the entire political spectrum, cannot be compromised,' the foreign ministry stated Thursday in response to the U.S. announcement. The accompanying U.S. State Department fact sheet said the Islamabad-based National Defense Complex has worked to acquire items 'intended to be used as launch support equipment for ballistic missiles and missile testing equipment' to advance the country’s missile development program. The other companies hit with U.S. sanctions are Affiliates International, Akhtar and Sons Private Ltd., and Rockside Enterprise, all located in Karachi, according to the fact sheet. 'The United States will continue to act against proliferation and associated procurement activities of concern,' Miller said. Pakistan’s Shaheen surface-to-surface rocket is capable of carrying nuclear warheads to a range of approximately 2,750 kilometers, with experts saying the range enables the solid-fueled, multistage missile to reach targets anywhere in India and parts of the Middle East. New Delhi and Islamabad conducted their first nuclear weapons tests in May 1998, raising fears another war between the arch-rivals could escalate into a nuclear exchange in South Asia. Both nations have fought three wars, resulting in strained relations and persistent military tensions. India and Pakistan oppose and refuse to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty, an international agreement aimed at curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 'These country-specific U.S. sanctions against a close and longstanding strategic partner like Pakistan are unfortunate, divorced from historical realities, and indicate weaker U.S. commitment towards regional peace, security and strategic stability,' Syed Muhammad Ali, a security expert based in Islamabad, told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-defends-ballistic-missile-development-amid-new-us-sanctions/7906934.html	2024-12-19T05:45:40-08:00	
White House: NATO membership necessary for Ukraine security guarantees but invitation decision up to next president	WASHINGTON — As President Joe Biden’s administration prepares to transfer power to the incoming team of President-elect Donald Trump, VOA Ukrainian Iuliia Iarmolenko spoke with Michael Carpenter, the National Security Council director for Europe. Carpenter discussed the Biden administration's final efforts to strengthen Ukraine and why it would take more time and resources from Washington to start successful negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. VOA: In September, we talked about Ukraine's 'victory plan' and now it seems like the conversation is moving towards the negotiation process. Do you think the victory of Ukraine is still possible? And is there something that the Biden administration can still do to help Ukraine achieve that goal? Michael Carpenter, Senior Director for Europe at National Security Council: I do. I do think victory is possible. I think Ukraine must prevail. I think for the good of the international order, for the good of security in Europe and for the good of all those brave Ukrainians that are fighting for their freedom, it must prevail. The question is, what can we do now to set Ukraine up to be in a position of strength? It's going to take a dedicated effort of providing additional security assistance in order to stabilize the lines. And it's going to take a range of other efforts, including macro financial assistance, humanitarian support, support for the energy sector. But this is underway. And this administration, although it only has a month left in office, will continue to surge the support and it will spend every penny. Every dollar of security assistance that has been authorized for Ukraine will be obligated by the end of this year. VOA: But is there enough time? The Pentagon yesterday said that they might not be able to use every dollar, every penny of the remaining funding to provide security assistance. Michael Carpenter: Oh, they will. They will. Now, some of that security assistance is on contract, so some of it will not arrive until 2025. But all of the money will be spent down by January 20th. VOA: Air defense continues to be the biggest issue for Ukrainian civilians. In that remaining time, will the air defense be prioritized in order to give Ukrainian civilians some kind of protection? Michael Carpenter: Of all the capabilities that Ukraine needs, air defense is the most important one because this goes to the protection of cities which Russia has been targeting, targeting relentlessly with its drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, including the Oreshnik. And then also for critical infrastructure. It's really important to have, maybe not always Patriots, but a smaller version of an air defense system. So that is absolutely the priority. The problem is that a lot of our partners and allies have dug so deep into their own stocks that they don't have a whole lot left to give. So we are talking with all of our allies, seeing what else we can possibly get in advance of the winter to give Ukraine the air defense that it needs. VOA: President-elect Trump and his team talk about ending the war in 24 hours. And they also say that they're coordinating their work with the current administration. Is there a consensus between the two teams about the need for a just peace in Ukraine, not just for an end of fighting? Michael Carpenter: I can't speak for the Trump administration that's coming into office soon. You'll have to ask them for their views. What I can say is that in order for a negotiation to be successful, it has to be leveraged appropriately. And so Ukraine needs to be able to approach that negotiation from a position of strength, which first and foremost means stopping the erosion of the forward line of troops in the Donbas and at least stabilizing those lines, if not reversing the momentum. That's going to take some time. So it's going to take into 2025 and it's going to take resources. It's going to take additional security assistance, in order for Ukraine to be able to do that. Now, look, the notion that the Russians are really strong right now is, I think, false. We have seen that as many as 600,000 Russian casualties have accumulated over the course of these 2½ years of war and the Russian economy of course, inflation, is picking up. Interest rates are at 21%, potentially even going higher. Russia's not 10 feet tall. But, that said, we will have to resource Ukraine in order for it to be able to prevail. And no matter what administration or what country you're in, and what political party you affiliate with, that is an objective fact, that Ukraine will need to have the strength provided by resources to be able to approach Russia and have a negotiation where they can protect their sovereignty and independence. VOA: What is your message to the next administration? How do you hope they will approach this issue of Russia's war against Ukraine? And how do you think they can give Ukraine that leverage that it needs for any possible negotiations? Michael Carpenter: Well, I think that the fundamental message is that whether you're concerned about the growing influence and capability of the PRC, of Chinese unfair market practices, of what they're doing in terms of intellectual property rights and the theft of intellectual property, whether you're talking about other types of malign influence that the PRC projects, all of it is related in some way to the war in Ukraine, because Ukraine is about the fundamental basis within the international system upon which everything else rests, that sovereignty, its territorial integrity, it’s the inviolability of borders. If you don't protect that in Ukraine, you don't protect it anywhere. And so, regardless of what team we're talking to, what administration, what country, this centrality of Ukraine, not that this is some faraway conflict where, you know, two countries have a dispute over territory. It's much bigger than that. That has to be the fundamental message. VOA: President Zelenskyy said that invitation for Ukraine to join NATO would help to stop a 'hot phase' of the war. And he says that he intends to speak to President Biden about it. Should we expect any change of heart on this in Washington? Michael Carpenter: I think it's for the new team to decide on the NATO invitation. What I can say is that, ultimately, for Ukraine to have its security protected, it needs to be in NATO. There is nothing else that matches NATO's Article Five in terms of a security guarantee, because it's distributed across 32 allies and because it carries the weight of all of their collective defense capability. So this is where Ukraine obviously needs to get. It needs to have membership in the alliance. And at the NATO's summit in Washington last July, we all said that Ukraine is on an irreversible path to membership. That has to be the goal. The question is how long is it going to take for the 32 allies and their parliaments to ratify NATO's membership? It's going to take time. And what we need to do in the meantime, is we need to think about what kind of security guarantees, what kind of security assistance, do we need to help to tide Ukraine over, until such time as it has an Article Five guarantee? VOA: But why [has] President Biden decided that it's not the time to invite Ukraine? Because allies say that Washington and Berlin are the two capitals that are not greenlighting the invitation for Ukraine to join NATO. Michael Carpenter: Look, if the United States is going to support an invitation, it has to be something that is supported across administrations. It can't be that one administration supports it and then the next rescinds the invitation. It has to be durable. And so, you know, that's why I think this administration is not going to take any action on this without the support of the next administration. So basically, it's up to them to pursue this. But as I said earlier, the fact that Ukraine must be in NATO to have its security guarantees – I think that's an irrefutable fact. And so the question is the timeline and how do you build unity. Because you also don't want to have a fight within NATO where some countries are supportive and others are against. You need to align the diplomacy with the goals. And so you need to have all 32 allies saying, yes, now is the moment, and then we should do it together. So there's going to be a lot of behind-closed-doors conversation about this that I assume will take place over the course of the coming months into the new administration. And, you know, our team, President Biden, you know, will be supportive of those conversations and will be guiding the next team on this to the extent that they want to take that advice. Of course, this is going to be their call. VOA: Looking back at the Biden administration's response to Russia's war against Ukraine some critics say is that half-measures, indecision, hesitation, did not allow Ukraine to be fully successful. Is there something that President Biden wishes he could have done differently? Michael Carpenter: Look, I think there'll be time in the future to look at the lessons learned from this war, what could have been done differently. The fact of the matter is, there were different phases of this war. There was the initial assault on Kyiv when antitank weapons were paramount. And that was a capability that really, truly mattered on the battlefield. At later stages of the war, tanks did not figure as prominently, and so anti-tank weapons were perhaps less important. Then we started talking about F-16s and we started talking about air defense systems, Patriot systems and other sorts of capabilities. So each phase of this war has brought new capabilities to light that were that were critical in that phase. The reality is that neither the United States nor any of our other allies had massive surplus stocks of these capabilities available. For example, ATACMS [the Army Tactical Missile System] missiles, especially the long-range variants. None of us, not the United States, certainly not our allies, had large numbers of these missiles available, just to be able to hand over to Ukraine from one day to the next. So it's taken time. The one thing we've discovered is our defense industrial base in the United States needs a lot more investment. It needs to be ramped up dramatically to be able to deal with these sorts of contingencies. That's what we've learned. And then there's also the other piece to this, which is that the key variable in the fight currently is manpower. We can talk about all the types of capabilities and the weapons and the munitions that we want. But at the end of the day, the most important variable is how many troops does each country have on the front lines. And there we just simply see that Russia has numerical superiority. And so we have to devise a strategy going forward for how we can help Ukraine to recruit more people, to bring more people in, to serve on the front lines, even as Western countries provide the training and equipment. But just talking about the training and equipping without factoring in this manpower issue is not really doing justice to the situation as it stands on the front lines. VOA: But is there enough equipment? Michael Carpenter: The limiting factor right now is not equipment. I will tell you, there are a lot of munitions in Ukraine stocks right now. We have pledged, Western countries, not just the United States, our allies as well, that we will train every Ukrainian soldier that the Ukrainian armed forces can bring forward. VOA: President Zelenskyy right now is in Brussels. Do you think right now is the time for European allies to step up their support for Ukraine? Michael Carpenter: Unambiguously, yes. Absolutely. It is time for our European partners and allies to step up, to look at their stocks, to look at their defense industrial base. We have ramped up ours considerably. We still have a lot of work to do. It is not where we would like it to be. But when you take something like, for example, 155 [mm] ammunition, we have doubled and then doubled again, our production capability. In Europe, it lags far behind. So we need our European allies to step up and look at these key capabilities. When you talk about air defense systems, we just spoke about that. We need our European partners to also be able to produce air defense and to be able to give those systems to Ukraine or wherever else they may be needed. So this is not just about the United States. This is about our allies stepping up, too. They've done a lot. They've done a lot in terms of the overall figure of support that's been provided. But when you look country by country, certainly there are some countries that could do a lot more.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-nato-membership-necessary-for-ukraine-security-guarantees-but-invitation-decision-up-to-next-president/7906919.html	2024-12-19T05:26:26-08:00	
Stampede in southwestern Nigerian city causes multiple deaths	ABUJA — A stampede at a religious event in Ibadan, the capital of Nigeria's southwest Oyo state, resulted in multiple deaths and injuries, Governor Seyi Makinde said on Wednesday. The incident occurred at an Islamic high school where a large crowd had gathered for a family event. 'While investigations are ongoing, the primary organizers of the event that led to this stampede have been taken into custody,' Makinde said in a statement posted on X. Reuters could not immediately establish how many people had died or what caused the incident. Emergency services, including medical personnel and ambulances, were immediately dispatched to the scene, Makinde said. Security forces were also deployed to control the situation and prevent further casualties. The event has been halted, and the rest of the attendees have been safely evacuated from the venue, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stampede-in-southwestern-nigerian-city-causes-multiple-deaths/7906899.html	2024-12-19T04:56:14-08:00	
Putin says Assad ouster not a defeat for Russia	Russian President Vladimir Putin Thursday rejected the notion that the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad represented a defeat for Russia. Putin said during his annual news conference that Russia had 'achieved our goals' in Syria, where it rushed to provide direct military support for Assad’s government more than nine years ago to help push back rebel fighters. Russian forces operated out of a network of bases in Syria to carry out airstrikes that helped Assad’s military gain an advantage in the civil war. After rebels made a surprise surge that toppled Assad’s government earlier this month, Assad fled to Russia. Putin said Thursday he had not yet met with Assad but planned to do so. Among the topics Putin said he would discuss is the whereabouts of American journalist Austin Tice, who disappeared while reporting in Syria in 2012. Putin also said he could ask those now in control in Syria about Tice. Syrian transition U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that Syrians face an 'incredibly fraught' opportunity as they work to shift away from decades of Assad family rule to a new future. Speaking at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations, Blinken said the question is whether Syrians will 'seize an opportunity for the first time in decades not to be governed by a dictator, not to be governed by an outside power, not to be governed by a terrorist organization, not be governed by one sect or minority over another.' He also pointed to the rebels who seized power, and the opportunity they have to engage with the outside world and not take actions that will isolate the country. Blinken highlighted the example of the Taliban in Afghanistan, saying the group pledged to be more moderate after it seized control but ultimately acted otherwise and ended up 'terribly isolated around the world.' He said those in Syria need to move the country forward in an inclusive, nonsectarian way, to protect minorities, and deal with security challenges such as chemical weapons and groups such as the Islamic State. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-says-assad-ouster-not-a-defeat-for-russia/7906885.html	2024-12-19T04:44:05-08:00	
Vietnam police arrest suspect in Hanoi cafe fire that killed 11	Hanoi — Police in Vietnam have arrested a man suspected of starting a blaze that killed 11 following an argument with staff in a Hanoi cafe, authorities said on Thursday, while two of seven pulled from the flames were admitted to hospital. In a statement, police said the man had confessed to using gasoline to set Wednesday's fire on the ground floor of the three-story cafe, where people were also singing karaoke-style. The suspect is in his early 50s, said the state-run Tien Phong newspaper, adding that one witness reported hearing an explosion. 'The fire blocked all the exits,' another witness told the paper. 'The smell of gasoline was strong.' It took about 40 minutes to rein in the fire, reported just after 11 p.m., police added, with two of the seven rescued admitted to hospital. Images in an online newspaper, VnExpress, showed firemen working to douse the flames, while the bodies of several victims were carried away. 'I noticed a column of smoke from afar,' it cited a witness as saying. 'I was so frightened that I had to urge my grandchild to go downstairs.' 'The flames were so fierce. We saw the fire ... but there was nothing else we could do.' On Thursday, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh called for urgent investigation and strict action against anyone who violated the law.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-police-arrest-suspect-in-hanoi-cafe-fire-that-killed-11/7906848.html	2024-12-19T03:54:20-08:00	
Dominique Pelicot jailed for 20 years in landmark French mass rape trial	AVIGNON, France — A French court found all 51 defendants guilty on Thursday in a drugging-and-rape case that horrified the world and transformed the victim, Gisele Pelicot, into a stirring symbol of courage and resilience. Pelicot's ex-husband of 50 years, Dominique Pelicot, had pleaded guilty to drugging her repeatedly for almost a decade to rape her and to offer up her unconscious body for sex to dozens of strangers he had met online, while video recording the abuse. A panel of five judges sentenced him to the maximum 20 years in jail, as requested by prosecutors. The court imposed generally shorter terms than the four-to-18 years demanded by the prosecution for the other defendants, almost all of whom were accused of raping the comatose Gisele Pelicot. In all, the court found 47 of the defendants guilty of rape, two guilty of attempted rape and two guilty of sexual assault. A cheer went up outside the court in the southern French city of Avignon among the victim's supporters when news of the first guilty verdicts filtered out. Many of the accused had denied the charges, saying they thought it was a consensual sex game orchestrated by the couple and arguing that it was not rape if the husband approved. Dominique Pelicot, 72, denied misleading the men, saying they knew exactly what they were doing. 'I am a rapist like the others in this room,' he said during testimony. Gisele, who is also 72, waived her right to anonymity during the trial and demanded that horrifying videos of the serial abuse, which were recorded by her former husband, should be seen in court, saying she hoped this would help other women speak up. The trial has triggered protest rallies around France in support of Gisele, and spurred soul searching, including a debate on whether to update France's rape law, which at present makes no mention that sex should involve consent. Gisele stared down her abusers with steely determination in the packed courtroom day after day, scoffing at any claim that she might have been a willing participant. 'I've decided not to be ashamed, I've done nothing wrong,' she testified in October. 'They are the ones who must be ashamed,' she said. Horrifying secrets The Pelicots' children, David, Caroline and Florian, arrived in court to hear the verdict alongside their mother. The siblings have spoken out forcibly against their father, rejecting his pleas for forgiveness. The defendants come from all walks of life - lorry drivers, soldiers, firefighters, security guards, farm workers, a supermarket worker, a journalist and the unemployed. The youngest suspect was just 22 when he entered Pelicot's bedroom, while the oldest was in his early 70s. Many had children and were in relationships. Most lived within a 50-km radius of the Pelicots' picturesque village of Mazan, which nestles in vineyards below Mont Ventoux. The case only came to light in 2020, when Dominique was caught trying to take photographs up the skirts of women in a supermarket. Police then discovered more than 20,000 photos and videos on his computer drives revealing the horrifying secrets that he had hidden from his now ex-wife for a decade. Police believe 72 men had gone to the house to rape and abuse Gisele, but they were not able to identify them all. Pelicot acknowledged that he had put powerful tranquilizers into his wife's food and coffee that put her to sleep for hours. Gisele said she was worried she was developing Alzheimer's or had a brain tumor because of the memory gaps. She says she hopes the enormous interest in her case will help other women who have suffered sexual abuse, and brushes off praise for her own bravery in letting the world see her pain. 'It's not courage. It's determination to change things,' she told the court in October. 'This is not just my battle, but that of all rape victims.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dominique-pelicot-jailed-for-20-years-in-landmark-french-mass-rape-trial/7906841.html	2024-12-19T03:42:16-08:00	
Putin says Russia is moving closer to achieving goals in Ukraine	Moscow — President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russian forces were moving towards achieving their primary goals on the battlefield in Ukraine and touted what he said was the invincibility of Russia's new hypersonic missile. Fielding questions on state TV during his annual question and answer session with Russians, Putin said Moscow's forces were advancing along the whole of the battle front. 'I must say that the situation is changing dramatically... There is movement along the entire front line. Every day,' he said. Western and Russian military analysts say Russia is advancing in eastern Ukraine at the fastest pace since 2022, taking village after village and threatening strategically important cities such as Pokrovsk, a major road and rail hub. 'Our fighters are reclaiming territory by the square kilometer every day,' Putin said. He said the fighting was complex, so it was 'difficult and pointless to guess what lies ahead... (but) we are moving, as you said, towards solving our primary tasks, which we outlined at the beginning of the special military operation.' 'Everyone is fighting, literally heroically. And they are fighting right now. Let us wish them all...good luck, victory and to return home,' he said. Discussing the continued presence of Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region, Putin said Kyiv's troops would definitely be forced out, but declined to say exactly when that would happen. Putin also touted what he said was the invincibility of the 'Oreshnik' hypersonic missile which Russia has already test- fired at a Ukrainian military factory, saying he was ready to organize another launch at Ukraine and see if Western air defense systems could shoot it down. 'There is no chance of shooting down these missiles,' said Putin. 'Let Western experts propose to us, and let them propose to those in the West and the U.S. who pay them for their analysis, to conduct some kind of technological experiment, say, a high-tech duel of the 21st century. 'Let them determine some target for destruction, say in Kyiv, concentrate all their air defense and missile defense forces there, and we will strike there with Oreshnik and see what happens. We are ready for such an experiment, but is the other side ready?' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-says-russia-is-moving-closer-to-achieving-goals-in-ukraine/7906830.html	2024-12-19T03:25:09-08:00	
Polish defense chief: Poland ready to face Russia’s threats	Polish Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz laid out his country’s plans to deal with feared Russian aggression, such as possible missile infiltrations and conflict on its borders, in an interview with VOA Eastern Europe Bureau Chief Myroslava Gongadze. Plans include bolstering air defenses to building a $2.1 billion 'East Shield,' he said Tuesday. 'Polish F-16s are ready to act if a missile threatens our territory,' he said, confirming the military’s heightened readiness amid the war in Ukraine. Kosiniak-Kamysz emphasized the urgency of European countries pulling their weight in defense, warning that NATO’s unity is key to keeping American forces in Europe. With the war in Ukraine showing no signs of letting up, Poland is leading the charge in Europe, spending more on defense than any other NATO member and urging others to follow suit. This interview, translated from Polish, has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: You're buying a lot of equipment from the United States. How do you assess this cooperation, and what are you looking forward to? Polish Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz: Our cooperation is really at the best possible level. I have concluded several contracts worth dozens of billions of dollars, including the purchase of 26 Apache aircraft. Poland will be one of the best armies equipped with attack aircraft, Apaches. We're talking about a strategic partnership, and I think we are meeting President [-elect Donald] Trump's expectations. We're spending a lot on armaments, and we have good trade relations. We're buying a lot of equipment in the U.S. That's a guarantee of security, as well as it is investment in U.S. production. VOA: How do you assess the Russian threat today, and who are Poland’s main adversaries? Kosiniak-Kamysz: Russia is the greatest threat since the end of World War II. Many people have said that since the end of the second World War, but today, it's not the Cold War. We have an active war just beyond our border. We have crises — a conflict in the Near East. We have a conflict situation in the Pacific and also, recently, the developments in Syria have totally changed the position of Russia, Iran and other countries. So, we are living in very difficult times. Poland is spending 4.7% of its GDP —the greatest amount among NATO member states on defense — on armaments. Why are we spending that money? Because the situation is utmost difficult. The threat from Russia is realistic. The citizens of Ukraine are experiencing it every day. VOA: How important it is to invest in defense, and how would you encourage others to put more into defense? Kosiniak-Kamysz: Two percent is not enough. It is the absolute minimum. I believe that the 2% of GDP that NATO countries have committed to, and those that do not meet it, will not even be invited to the table with the new Trump administration. ... So, all countries must fulfill their obligations. ... Europe must do more for security, not to replace the Americans in Europe, but to keep them in Europe. If we do not spend more on security, if other countries do not follow Poland's example, we will not be able to keep Americans in Europe. The EU has created the program for defense development, but it has assigned just 1.5 billion euros ($1.55 billion). It's just symbolic. Where are the capacities to manufacture the munitions that North Korea, Russia and Iran have? Europe, as well as the Western world, the U.S., Canada and our allies don't have those capacities. We have to make up for it. 100 billion euros ($103 billion) — that would be the money we should be talking about. VOA: So, are you saying that Europe is not ready to fight the active war today? Kosiniak-Kamysz: We are ready — we have to be ready each day. But Europe has to be more ready to a better extent each day. So, it's not enough to say that we are ready and do nothing. A lot has happened since the outbreak of war in Ukraine. But it's still not enough to say that it's at the best level. We have to be ready to fight each time of day and night, each state. We are prepared for that. But each day, we could be prepared better, hence the pressure that we are exerting on other countries. Hence the building of a resilient society. This is something that Western societies don't have today. ... We have already been attacked with lies, fake news, with misinformation. And it does not matter if you live next to the border with the Kaliningrad region, near the Belarusian border here in Poland, or [if] you live in Portugal, in Quebec, or anyplace today. You are being attacked. Russia has already attacked you. VOA: Poland has experienced Belarusian helicopters entering its airspace. A Russian missile violated Poland’s airspace during an attack on Ukraine. Is Poland ready to do something about it? Kosiniak-Kamysz: The situation of infringing the airspace of Poland also affects Latvia, often affecting Romania with UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), and we've prepared the air defense system. We also have enhanced air defense. We're talking about Rzeszow Airport, which is almost being passed onto the protection of NATO. Our allies —America, Britain, Germany, Norway and other nations — are protecting us at the air base. And if that airspace is infringed, then the target missile or a drone can be shot [down]. ... But it's a different situation when it comes to shooting targets above the Ukrainian territory. There is no NATO decision on that position, or agreement to do so. We are protecting our territories. VOA: Are you saying that if a rocket infiltrates Polish airspace, you're ready to shoot them down? Kosiniak-Kamysz: Very often, we activate our F-16s to act accordingly, if there is a danger to Polish territory, to defend our territory. VOA: But it hasn't happened yet? Kosiniak-Kamysz: No, because there has been no such event where the missile would be aimed at a target in the Polish territory. But yes, last week, the Polish F-16s took off and were ready to protect near the border. VOA: There are talks about the defense line you’re building on the eastern border called the 'East Shield.' What are the plans for that for the next year or two? Kosiniak-Kamysz: This is preparation for the event of a conflict on the Polish-Russian, Polish-Belarusian borders. We are building barriers that will complicate the movement of enemy troops. We are also building warehouses for artillery and other means of defense. We are building places for the defense of manpower. .... This should be combined with the Baltic line of defense, [and] strengthening the Russian-Finnish border. In addition, we are increasing protection against illegal migrants. VOA: French President Emmanuel Macron visited Poland last week and hinted at the idea of Polish and French military personnel going to Ukraine as security guarantees if a peace agreement is signed. Poland declared it was not planning to do so. Why? Kosiniak-Kamysz: We have not seen any peace plan from President Trump yet. There are many reports in the press about this or that outcome, following the example of Finland, or the example of Germany, but these are all speculations. We exclude the possibility of the Polish military being on the territory of Ukraine. We believe that such decisions should not be made by the group of countries, but NATO should have a key role in this decision. We will consider further steps when that stage comes. At this stage, as you said, we do not plan to send troops to Ukraine. VOA: So, if NATO would make that decision, you're open to it? Kosiniak-Kamysz: Well, we'll see. I won't be making any declarations here. I'm just saying that we are not planning to deploy any troops to Ukraine, as long as the peace process has not been finalized, and that is not possible without Ukraine at the table.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polish-defense-chief-poland-ready-to-face-russia-s-threats-/7906788.html	2024-12-19T02:08:37-08:00	
US deaths are down and life expectancy is up, but improvements are slowing	NEW YORK — U.S. life expectancy jumped last year, and preliminary data suggests there may be another — much smaller — improvement this year. Death rates fell last year for almost all leading causes, notably COVID-19, heart disease and drug overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released Thursday. That translated to adding nearly a year the estimated lifespan of Americans. Experts note it's part of a bounce-back from the COVID-19 pandemic. But life expectancy has not yet climbed back to prepandemic levels, and the rebound appears to be losing steam. 'What you're seeing is continued improvement, but slowing improvement,' said Elizabeth Wrigley-Field, a University Minnesota researcher who studies death trends. 'We are sort of converging back to some kind of normal that is worse than it was before the pandemic.' Last year, nearly 3.1 million U.S. residents died, about 189,000 fewer than the year before. Death rates declined across all racial and ethnic groups, and in both men and women. Provisional data for the first 10 months of 2024 suggests the country is on track to see even fewer deaths this year, perhaps about 13,000 fewer. But that difference is likely to narrow as more death certificates come in, said the CDC's Robert Anderson. That means that life expectancy for 2024 likely will rise — 'but probably not by a lot,' said Anderson, who oversees death tracking at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. Life expectancy is an estimate of the average number of years a baby born in a given year might expect to live, given death rates at that time. It's a fundamental measure of a population's health. For decades, U.S. life expectancy rose at least a little bit almost every year, thanks to medical advances and public health measures. It peaked in 2014, at nearly 79 years, and then was relatively flat for several years. Then it plunged during the COVID-19 pandemic, dropping to just under 76 1/2 years in 2021. It rebounded to 77 1/2 years in 2022 and, according to the new report, to nearly 78 1/2 last year. Life expectancy for U.S. women continues to be well above that of men — a little over 81 for women, compared with a little under 76 for men. In the last five years, more than 1.2 million U.S. deaths have been attributed to COVID-19. But most of them occurred in 2020 and 2021, before vaccination- and infection-induced immunity became widespread. The coronavirus was once the nation's third leading cause of death. Last year it was the underlying cause in nearly 50,000 deaths, making it the nation's No. 10 killer. Data for 2024 is still coming in, but about 30,000 coronavirus deaths have been reported so far. At that rate, suicide may surpass COVID-19 this year, Anderson said. Heart disease remains the nation’s leading cause of death. Some underappreciated good news is the heart disease death rate dropped by about 3% in 2023. That’s a much smaller drop than the 73% decline in the COVID-19 death rate, but heart disease affects more people so even small changes can be more impactful, Anderson said. There's also good news about overdose deaths, which fell to 105,000 in 2023 among U.S. residents, according to a second report released by CDC on Thursday. The causes of the overdose decline are still being studied but there is reason to be hopeful such deaths will drop more in the future, experts say. Some pointed to survey results this week that showed teens drug use isn't rising. 'The earlier you start taking a drug, the greater the risk that you could continue using it and the greater the risk that you will become addicted to it — and have untoward consequences,' said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which funded the survey study. 'If you can reduce the pipeline (of new drug users) ... you can prevent overdoses.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-deaths-are-down-and-life-expectancy-is-up-but-improvements-are-slowing/7906762.html	2024-12-19T00:16:13-08:00	
Malaysian court acquits wife of ex-PM of money laundering, tax evasion	KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA — Malaysia's High Court on Thursday acquitted Rosmah Mansor, the wife of jailed former Prime Minister Najib Razak, of money laundering and tax evasion, citing insufficient grounds to charge her. Najib and Rosmah have been the subject of multiple graft investigations since Najib's surprise election defeat in 2018, when voters' fury over his alleged role in a multibillion-dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) ended his nine years in power. Both have repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Rosmah is not yet out of the woods, however, and is currently free on bail pending an appeal against a 10-year jail sentence in 2022 for soliciting and receiving bribes to help a company win a $279 million solar power supply project from Najib's government. Rosmah has been widely scorned in Malaysia for her extravagant lifestyle and penchant for luxury handbags, more than 500 of which were found at properties searched by police as part of investigations into the 1MDB scandal, on top of 12,000 items of jewelry. According to Thursday's High Court judgment seen by Reuters, Rosmah was acquitted of the 12 money laundering charges and five tax evasion charges against her, which it said lacked probity, propriety and legality. Rosmah said she was grateful the case had concluded and thanked her lawyers. 'I also want to thank the judge who has made the right decision. This is what I call justice, and this is the kind of justice that everybody should have,' she told a livestreamed news conference. Her acquittal follows the recent dropping of corruption charges against Najib linked to 1MDB due to procedural delays and the failure of the prosecution to disclose key documents. Najib faces several trials linked to the scandal at 1MDB, from which Malaysian and U.S. authorities say about $4.5 billion was stolen in a complex, globe-spanning scheme between 2009 and 2014. Najib, who helped found 1MDB when he was premier, was found guilty of corruption and money laundering in 2022 in a case linked to the scandal and sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2022, though the term was later halved by a pardon's board chaired by Malaysia's king. Najib has also apologized for his role in mishandling the 1MDB scandal, though he maintained he had no knowledge of any illegal transfers from the state fund. Najib has been pressing to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysian-court-acquits-wife-of-ex-pm-of-money-laundering-tax-evasion/7906759.html	2024-12-19T00:05:07-08:00	
UN peacekeepers guard Congolese farmers working their fields	DHENDRO, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — Under a scorching sun in the Democratic Republic of Congo, many of the farmers tending to their fields in the troubled eastern region are guarded by United Nations peacekeepers. The U.N. mission has fallen under increasing scrutiny over the years as the eastern conflict between rebel groups, self-defense forces and other militias has raged. But in this corner of Djugu territory in the village of Dhendro, farmers are unequivocal in their support for the U.N. force known by the acronym MONUSCO. The farmers, many displaced from their homes by the conflict, shelter in camps near the U.N. bases. 'I came here because of the presence of MONUSCO. It's thanks to their presence that I'm going to the field; otherwise I'm afraid,' 23-year-old Lokana Heritier, who left his village to live closer to the blue helmets, told Reuters. MONUSCO has been deployed in Congo since 2010, when it took over from an earlier U.N. operation to secure the troubled eastern region that borders Rwanda. The operation to guard farmers who grow corn, beans, potatoes and manioc is known as 'Secure Harvest' and it aims to allow them to work freely during the harvesting season and provide protection from militia groups who steal produce and kill people. 'The main objective is to secure the farmers in their farmland when they are working. We believe this is directly linked to the protection of civilians that MONUSCO is mandated for,' Brigadier General Monzurul Alam told Reuters. Last year, the U.N. Security Council approved the end of the mission at the request of President Felix Tshisekedi. The 13,500-strong force had faced attacks and protests over perceptions that it had failed to secure the population. Congo's government reversed course in July and asked MONUSCO to remain in Ituri and North Kivu provinces until conditions were met for the force's departure, without providing further details.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-peacekeepers-guard-congolese-farmers-working-their-fields/7906757.html	2024-12-18T23:57:06-08:00	
Russian officials report oil refinery fire after Ukraine targets border regions with dozens of drones	Officials in Russia’s Rostov region reported a fire Thursday at an oil refinery after a wave of attacks from several dozen Ukrainian aerial drones. Rostov acting Governor Yuri Slyusar said on Telegram that the fire happened at the Novoshakhtinsk refinery and was later extinguished. Slyusar reported one person was injured in the attack. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed 36 Ukrainian drones over Rostov, part of a total of 84 drones it shot down mostly over regions bordering Ukraine. The ministry said the other intercepts took place over Bryansk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Kursk, Tambov and Krasnodar. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that Ukrainian drone attacks damaged several residential buildings. Ukraine’s military said Thursday its air defenses shot down 45 of 85 Russian drones used in overnight attacks targeting the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava and Sumy regions. The military also said Russian missiles damaged residential buildings and municipal property in Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that the areas damaged included a school and a hospital in Kryvyi Rih. Some information for this story came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-officials-report-oil-refinery-fire-after-ukraine-targets-border-regions-with-dozens-of-drones-/7906754.html	2024-12-18T23:46:21-08:00	
Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen	Israel’s military said Thursday it carried out airstrikes against Houthi militant targets in Yemen. A military spokesperson said the strikes targeted energy and port infrastructure used by the Houthis as part of their 'military action.' Houthi-run media reported attacks in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, and that the strikes hit a power station and an oil facility. A short time earlier, Israel said it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen. The Houthis have conducted multiple missile attacks directed at Israel and have carried out more than a year of drone and missile attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Iran-backed Houthis say their campaign is in solidarity with the Palestinians amid the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The United States has designated Hamas and the Houthis as terror groups.

US effort to curb China's and Russia's access to advanced computer chips 'inadequate,' report finds	WASHINGTON — The Commerce Department's efforts to curb China's and Russia's access to American-made advanced computer chips have been 'inadequate' and will need more funding to stymie their ability to manufacture advanced weapons, according to a report published Wednesday by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The Biden administration imposed export controls to limit the ability of China and Russia to access U.S.-made chips after Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago. The agency's Bureau of Industry and Security, according to the report, does not have the resources to enforce export controls and has been too reliant on U.S. chip makers voluntarily complying with the rules. But the push for bolstering Commerce's export control enforcement comes as the incoming Trump administration says it is looking to dramatically reduce the size and scope of federal government. President-elect Donald Trump has tapped entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new 'Department of Government Efficiency' to dismantle parts of the federal government. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. BIS’s budget, about $191 million, has remained essentially flat since 2010 when adjusted for inflation. 'While BIS’ budget has been stagnant for a decade, the bureau works diligently around the clock to meet its mission and safeguard U.S. national security,' Commerce Department spokesperson Charlie Andrews said in a statement in response to the report. Andrews added that with 'necessary resources from Congress' the agency would be 'better equipped to address the challenges that come with our evolving national security environment.' In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, chair of the subcommittee, pointed to news reports of the Russian military continuing to acquire components from Texas Instruments through front companies in Hong Kong to illustrate how the export controls are failing as an effective tool. Blumenthal in a statement called on 'Commerce to take immediate action and crack down on the companies allowing U.S.-made semiconductors to power Russian weapons and Chinese ambition.' Texas Instruments said it opposes the use of its chips in Russian military equipment and the illicit diversion of its products to Russia. 'It is our policy to comply with export control laws, and any shipments of TI chips into Russia are illicit and unauthorized,' the company said in a statement. 'If we find evidence indicating product diversion, we investigate and take action.' It's not just Texas Instruments that's the issue. The subcommittee in September published a report that found aggregated exports from four major U.S. advanced chip manufacturers nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022 to Armenia and Georgia. Both of those countries are home to front companies known to assist Russia in acquiring advanced chips made in the U.S. despite export controls. China, meanwhile, has created 'vast, barely disguised smuggling networks which enable it to continue to harness U.S. technology,' the subcommittee report asserts. Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls in China, as President Joe Biden’s administration has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of chips in the U.S. But Chinese companies have found ways to evade export controls in part because of a lack of China subject matter experts and Chinese speakers assigned to Commerce's export control enforcement. The agency's current budget limits the number of international end-use checks, or physical verification overseas of distributors or companies receiving American-made chips that are the supposed end users of products. Currently, Commerce has only 11 export control officers spread around the globe to conduct such checks, the report said. The committee made several recommendations in its report, including Congress allocating more money for hiring additional personnel to enforce export controls, imposing larger fines on companies that violate controls and requiring periodic reviews of advanced chip companies’ export control plans by outside entities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-effort-to-curb-china-s-and-russia-s-access-to-advanced-computer-chips-inadequate-report-finds-/7906729.html	2024-12-18T21:22:40-08:00	
VOA Kurdish: US senators threaten sanctions against Turkey over Syrian ceasefire proposal	U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Lindsey Graham have warned of bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if it rejects a ceasefire proposal from the U.S. and a plan by Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) commander Mazlum Abdi to establish a demilitarized zone in Kobani. The senators argue that Turkey’s attacks on Kurdish allies in Syria undermine regional stability and efforts to prevent a resurgence by Islamic State. The proposed initiative, supported by the SDF and under U.S. supervision, aims to address Turkey's security concerns while maintaining stability in northern Syria. With 900 U.S. troops still deployed in Syria as part of the anti-ISIS coalition, the senators emphasized the importance of Turkey’s cooperation in fostering long-term peace and security in the region.

Expert: Several African governments unaware of young workers in Russian drone factories	WASHINGTON — They were promised a chance to earn money, get an education abroad, and gain work experience. Instead, they found themselves assembling military drones in Russia and, in one case, subjected to a Ukrainian drone strike. A series of investigative reports has shed light on a Russian labor recruitment program that has allegedly lured young African women to work at an industrial park in provincial Russia with false promises and coerced them into contributing to the Kremlin’s war effort in Ukraine. The reported victims of the program, which attracts recruits largely through online job advertisements, includes women from Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. Media reports from The Associated Press, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and others have exposed the operation, entitled Alabuga Start, but VOA reporting has found that African countries have largely failed to intervene or give an official response. Some even appear to be building ties with the Russian entity behind the program. That entity called the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, has been intensifying its outreach across the African continent, according to David Albright, founder of the Institute for Science and International Security and the researcher behind a report exposing the program that exploited the young women. 'In some of the initial investigations of this, the recruiters in Africa were oblivious when they were asked where these women were going,' Albright said, adding that some are now aware and that he hopes there will be 'pushback from these governments about what exactly [Alabuga is] recruiting these women to do.' Albright said representatives from Alabuga recently visited Sierra Leone, Zambia and Madagascar, signing memorandums of cooperation with local organizations, despite the reports of misleading recruitment practices and questionable labor actions. Albright said the young women are forced to handle toxic materials, which he says is forbidden in Russian labor law. But African and other governments have also been willing to send their citizens off to Alabuga Start. VOA discovered a series of documents online indicating the government ministries had officially promoted the program. VOA reached out to authorities of Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Nigeria but several emails and phone calls went unanswered. VOA also requested comment from Alabuga and the Russian Embassy in Washington but received no response. Recruitment under false pretenses Located 1,000 kilometers to the east of Moscow in Russia’s Tatarstan region, the city of Yelabuga, known as Alabuga in the local Tatar language, would hardly seem a desirable location for young people from Africa. But the nearby Alabuga Special Economic Zone has been casting a wide net on the African continent. In promotional materials, it paints an exciting, optimistic picture of life in the Alabuga Start program. In one recruitment video intended to appeal to potential recruits, an African woman arrives in Alabuga and begins work at a restaurant, where she waits on a young Russian man. At the end of the video, she returns to the restaurant as his pregnant wife. Other promotional videos show participants working in construction, cleaning and warehouse operations, as well as studying and playing sports with their friends. Only one video features the women assembling drones, but no indication is given that the drones have a military purpose. According to the Russian independent news outlet Protokol, the program has specifically targeted young women because its organizers believe young men from Africa 'could be too aggressive and dangerous.' Researchers and reporters found that some of the program’s internal documents, as reported by Albright and others, often referred to the women as mulattos using an outdated racial term that is now widely considered offensive. Its appeal to African young people is not difficult to understand, says Maxim Matusevich, a Russia-Africa expert and a global history professor at Seton Hall University. 'A lot of these nations have very high unemployment rates,' he told VOA. Russia is 'offering them attractively packaged and attractively sold job packages.' Matusevich believes Alabuga Start aims to solve the problem of a shortfall of workers in Russia due to the heavy demand of the war in Ukraine. Albright said that inaction has global ramifications: Alabuga Start is involving young Africans in Russian violence against Ukrainians. 'It’s been a very deceptive program in the sense that the applicants didn’t know they’d be working in essentially a U.S.- [and] European-sanctioned company making drones that are being used to devastating effect against Ukrainian civil targets, energy targets, electrical plants,' he told VOA. 'And so, in that sense, they’re complicit in a crime, an international crime, given that the war against Ukraine is illegal. They’re getting involved in making drones that are being used against civilian targets, not just military targets.' Exploitation factory Alabuga didn’t start out exploiting young African women. Before that, it used young Russians in drone production. Since 2019, the special economic zone has operated a program called Alabuga Polytech, which recruits Russian high school students. Unlike workers from the African continent and other countries, the Russian students take part in a four-year work-study program, receiving accredited technical education while doing industrial work. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, that program ramped up its activity. It hasn’t been entirely smooth sailing. When the program pivoted to drone production, Alabuga had to lobby the Russian authorities to alter labor laws. According to a July report from the Institute for Science and International Security, that allowed Alabuga to hire children under the age of 18 to work with toxic chemicals. Parents soon began to complain about the poor work conditions: Participants were working 12-hour factory shifts and their movements were strictly controlled, Albright recounted. He said the program has since stopped recruiting people younger than 18. When the special economic zone launched Alabuga Start and began recruiting workers from abroad in 2022, the program was almost entirely focused on drone production. According to estimates by Albright’s organization, only a third of Polytech students work on drone production, while over 90% of Alabuga Start participants do. Despite that stark distinction, organizers appear to have frequently conflated the two programs, including by sometimes depicting Alabuga Start participants wearing school uniforms in promotional materials. Multinational conveyer belt Alabuga’s recent outreach to African nations signals a potential expansion of its recruitment efforts. VOA found that African and other governments have at times been willing partners. Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Education shared on its website a document announcing open admissions to Alabuga Start in 2023. Uganda’s Ministry of Education and Sport shared a similar announcement. In the document upload site Scribd, a digital document library, VOA found two files that appear to be official letters from the government ministries of Mali and Burkina Faso announcing that Alabuga Start had reserved spots for participants from those countries in 2023. VOA also found a document by Bangladesh’s Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training announcing that applications were open for Alabuga Start in 2023. The special economic zone’s many meetings with African diplomats and government officials, some of which included the signing of memoranda of understanding, appear to signal a deepening of ties. Albright emphasizes that the special economic zone’s drone factory has been a linchpin of Russian-Iranian collaboration during the war against Ukraine. 'Alabuga is a special economic zone that basically builds and hires out or sells buildings for civilian industry,' he said. 'With the war in Ukraine, their international occupants pulled out and they were desperate for money. And so, they made a contract with the Russian government and the Iranian government to build drones.' The Alabuga factory in question primarily assembled the Shahed-136, an Iranian kamikaze drone. In the first half of 2023, around 100 Alabuga Polytech students traveled to Tehran for two months of training in Shahed-136 airframe production, The Washington Post reported in August 2023. Alabuga Start participants are largely used as low-skilled labor, assigned to complete the simplest tasks involved in assembling the airframes. A list of 100 Russian words that participants must know to take part in the program drives that conclusion home. It largely consists of basic vocabulary but also includes several higher-level words: 'to hook,' 'to unhook,' 'factory,' and 'task.' The military nature of the work is largely absent from promotional materials for the program viewed by VOA. They typically show participants working in the service industry, construction, or non-military industrial production. One brochure emphasizes that, after completing Alabuga Start, participants have the opportunity to continue working on a permanent basis, get a job at another Alabuga factory, or enroll in Polytech. It also includes images that appear to show articles by the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal with headlines praising the factory and its salaries. In reality, the images have been edited to conceal the fact that both stories are about military drone production at the facility. That work has placed African women in direct danger. On April 22, a Ukrainian drone crashed into the dormitory where Alabuga Start participants live. A day later, Alabuga Start released a video featuring a Kenyan woman –– one of the program’s public-facing participants –– who said she would be going to work in a cafe. The participant notably said she had come to work and study at Alabuga Polytech — and not Start. 'Those who attacked our hostel today are real barbarians and they deserve serious condemnation,' she said. 'In my opinion, they wanted to intimidate us. But I want to tell you they did not succeed. You won’t scare me, because Alabuga is a strong place and we will get through this.'

Expert: Several African governments unaware of young workers in Russian drone factories	WASHINGTON — They were promised a chance to earn money, get an education abroad, and gain work experience. Instead, they found themselves assembling military drones in Russia and, in one case, subjected to a Ukrainian drone strike. A series of investigative reports has shed light on a Russian labor recruitment program that has allegedly lured young African women to work at an industrial park in provincial Russia with false promises and coerced them into contributing to the Kremlin’s war effort in Ukraine. The reported victims of the program, which attracts recruits largely through online job advertisements, includes women from Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. Media reports from The Associated Press, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and others have exposed the operation, entitled Alabuga Start, but VOA reporting has found that African countries have largely failed to intervene or give an official response. Some even appear to be building ties with the Russian entity behind the program. That entity called the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, has been intensifying its outreach across the African continent, according to David Albright, founder of the Institute for Science and International Security and the researcher behind a report exposing the program that exploited the young women. 'In some of the initial investigations of this, the recruiters in Africa were oblivious when they were asked where these women were going,' Albright said, adding that some are now aware and that he hopes there will be 'pushback from these governments about what exactly [Alabuga is] recruiting these women to do.' Albright said representatives from Alabuga recently visited Sierra Leone, Zambia and Madagascar, signing memorandums of cooperation with local organizations, despite the reports of misleading recruitment practices and questionable labor actions. Albright said the young women are forced to handle toxic materials, which he says is forbidden in Russian labor law. But African and other governments have also been willing to send their citizens off to Alabuga Start. VOA discovered a series of documents online indicating the government ministries had officially promoted the program. VOA reached out to authorities of Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Nigeria but several emails and phone calls went unanswered. VOA also requested comment from Alabuga and the Russian Embassy in Washington but received no response. Recruitment under false pretenses Located 1,000 kilometers to the east of Moscow in Russia’s Tatarstan region, the city of Yelabuga, known as Alabuga in the local Tatar language, would hardly seem a desirable location for young people from Africa. But the nearby Alabuga Special Economic Zone has been casting a wide net on the African continent. In promotional materials, it paints an exciting, optimistic picture of life in the Alabuga Start program. In one recruitment video intended to appeal to potential recruits, an African woman arrives in Alabuga and begins work at a restaurant, where she waits on a young Russian man. At the end of the video, she returns to the restaurant as his pregnant wife. Other promotional videos show participants working in construction, cleaning and warehouse operations, as well as studying and playing sports with their friends. Only one video features the women assembling drones, but no indication is given that the drones have a military purpose. According to the Russian independent news outlet Protokol, the program has specifically targeted young women because its organizers believe young men from Africa 'could be too aggressive and dangerous.' Researchers and reporters found that some of the program’s internal documents, as reported by Albright and others, often referred to the women as mulattos using an outdated racial term that is now widely considered offensive. Its appeal to African young people is not difficult to understand, says Maxim Matusevich, a Russia-Africa expert and a global history professor at Seton Hall University. 'A lot of these nations have very high unemployment rates,' he told VOA. Russia is 'offering them attractively packaged and attractively sold job packages.' Matusevich believes Alabuga Start aims to solve the problem of a shortfall of workers in Russia due to the heavy demand of the war in Ukraine. Albright said that inaction has global ramifications: Alabuga Start is involving young Africans in Russian violence against Ukrainians. 'It’s been a very deceptive program in the sense that the applicants didn’t know they’d be working in essentially a U.S.- [and] European-sanctioned company making drones that are being used to devastating effect against Ukrainian civil targets, energy targets, electrical plants,' he told VOA. 'And so, in that sense, they’re complicit in a crime, an international crime, given that the war against Ukraine is illegal. They’re getting involved in making drones that are being used against civilian targets, not just military targets.' Exploitation factory Alabuga didn’t start out exploiting young African women. Before that, it used young Russians in drone production. Since 2019, the special economic zone has operated a program called Alabuga Polytech, which recruits Russian high school students. Unlike workers from the African continent and other countries, the Russian students take part in a four-year work-study program, receiving accredited technical education while doing industrial work. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, that program ramped up its activity. It hasn’t been entirely smooth sailing. When the program pivoted to drone production, Alabuga had to lobby the Russian authorities to alter labor laws. According to a July report from the Institute for Science and International Security, that allowed Alabuga to hire children under the age of 18 to work with toxic chemicals. Parents soon began to complain about the poor work conditions: Participants were working 12-hour factory shifts and their movements were strictly controlled, Albright recounted. He said the program has since stopped recruiting people younger than 18. When the special economic zone launched Alabuga Start and began recruiting workers from abroad in 2022, the program was almost entirely focused on drone production. According to estimates by Albright’s organization, only a third of Polytech students work on drone production, while over 90% of Alabuga Start participants do. Despite that stark distinction, organizers appear to have frequently conflated the two programs, including by sometimes depicting Alabuga Start participants wearing school uniforms in promotional materials. Multinational conveyer belt Alabuga’s recent outreach to African nations signals a potential expansion of its recruitment efforts. VOA found that African and other governments have at times been willing partners. Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Education shared on its website a document announcing open admissions to Alabuga Start in 2023. Uganda’s Ministry of Education and Sport shared a similar announcement. In the document upload site Scribd, a digital document library, VOA found two files that appear to be official letters from the government ministries of Mali and Burkina Faso announcing that Alabuga Start had reserved spots for participants from those countries in 2023. VOA also found a document by Bangladesh’s Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training announcing that applications were open for Alabuga Start in 2023. The special economic zone’s many meetings with African diplomats and government officials, some of which included the signing of memoranda of understanding, appear to signal a deepening of ties. Albright emphasizes that the special economic zone’s drone factory has been a linchpin of Russian-Iranian collaboration during the war against Ukraine.

Australian search and rescue teams arrive in quake-hit Vanuatu	SYDNEY — Australian rescue and medical teams have reached Vanuatu, authorities said on Thursday, where at least 14 people including one French and two Chinese nationals were killed and hundreds were injured in a 7.3 magnitude earthquake two days ago. France's Ambassador Jean-Baptiste Jeangène Vilmer on Thursday confirmed the death of a French national, Vincent Goiset, a resident in Vanuatu who was killed by the rubble of a collapsed building in the city center, he said in a Facebook post. French and Australian rescue teams are searching for survivors at a collapsed building, where eight to 15 people are buried, with some confirmed dead, he wrote. Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office said in a report the number of deaths and injuries was expected to increase, as search and rescue continues. A Chinese woman who ran a shop on the ground floor of another collapsed building, a four-story building owned by Chinese company Kenwu Industries, had died, said Michael Mai, who works for the company. She was one of two Chinese nationals the Chinese embassy said were killed in the earthquake, he told Reuters in an interview. 'She was near to the building, very close when it collapsed,' he said. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Australia would help Vanuatu restore operations at the international airport in the nation's capital of Port Vila, which has been closed to commercial airlines because of damage. 'Additional assistance will be provided where possible, ahead of the airport reopening,' Wong said in a post on X. About 150 Australian citizens returned home overnight on the two aircraft that delivered assistance, Wong said. Other countries have also offered support, with a U.S. military aircraft expected to arrive on Thursday, while France sent a military helicopter with satellite communications and military engineers. A Royal New Zealand Air Force Hercules arrived in Port Vila with rescue equipment and medics on Thursday and will assist with the evacuation of New Zealanders, New Zealand officials said. Another New Zealand military flight had to be diverted on Wednesday evening to New Caledonia due to an engine fire warning and will be repaired on Thursday. Disruptions to power and communication in Vanuatu are hindering rescue efforts, while UNICEF has said water contamination was a major concern.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-search-and-rescue-teams-arrive-in-quake-hit-vanuatu/7906684.html	2024-12-18T19:00:16-08:00	
Blinken: Trump can negotiate to stop Iran from getting nuclear bomb	new york — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that President-elect Donald Trump had a window to negotiate with Iran, saying the development of a nuclear weapon by Tehran was not inevitable. The outgoing top U.S. diplomat acknowledged that the cleric-run state might be more seriously considering a nuclear weapon after military setbacks in the region. In the last year, Israel's military has hit Iranian air defenses and weakened its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, while rebels have toppled its main Arab ally in Syria, Bashar al-Assad. 'I don't think that a nuclear weapon is inevitable,' Blinken said at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. As 'they've lost different lines of defense, sure, you're going to see more thinking about that,' Blinken said. But the U.S. secretary of state said Iran was aware of the consequences of obtaining a nuclear weapon and added: 'I think there is the prospect of negotiations.' Iran denies pursuing a nuclear weapon, saying its contested nuclear work is for peaceful purposes. In his first term, Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran that was negotiated under former President Barack Obama and then imposed sweeping sanctions. 'President Trump last time around in pulling out of the deal said that he wanted, as he called it, a better, stronger deal. Fine,' Blinken said. He said that no U.S. administration would allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. 'One way or another, I'm convinced that just as our administration had that policy, the next administration will, too,' he said of preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration upon taking office in 2021 entered indirect talks with Iran to restore the nuclear deal. Talks collapsed largely over disputes on the scope of U.S. sanctions relief, and Biden has backed pressure on Iran over its support for Palestinian armed group Hamas since its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Trump's billionaire ally Elon Musk reportedly met with a senior Iranian official following the U.S. election in a bid to encourage calm. Blinken also rejected calls for the United States to work to topple the government of Iran, which has opposed Washington since the overthrow of its U.S.-backed ruler in a popular uprising in 1979. 'I think if we look at the last 20 years, our experiments in regime change have not exactly been resounding successes,' Blinken said. Blinken acknowledged domestic opposition to Iran's current cleric-run state structure, but said it was not 'quite as clear-cut as that.' Opposition is 'reflective of at least half the population, but not the entirety of it,' he said, pointing to differences between cities and rural areas. 'There's a very conservative element in Iran that's significant in number that probably remains beholden to the regime,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-trump-can-negotiate-to-stop-iran-from-getting-nuclear-bomb/7906687.html	2024-12-18T18:52:18-08:00	
New details emerge on Israel’s actions in Syrian buffer zone, change in US position	washington — New details have emerged of Israel’s occupation of a Golan Heights buffer zone since Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad fell from power this month. Assad’s fall also coincided with a change in U.S. language on Israeli activity in the zone from several weeks prior, VOA has learned. A spokesperson for U.N. peacekeeping operations told VOA in a Monday interview that the U.N. Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) has identified at least 10 locations occupied by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the buffer zone as of December 15. The zone, which the United Nations calls an Area of Separation, is on the Syrian side of a 1974 ceasefire line that had divided Israeli and Syrian-administered territory following the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Under the ceasefire, the area was intended to separate, or be free of, Syrian and Israeli forces. UNDOF has called Israel’s latest actions in the zone a 'violation' of the ceasefire agreement. The zone is 75 kilometers long, spanning from the peak of Mount Hermon in the north to the Yarmouk River along the Jordanian border in the south. It varies in width from 10 kilometers in the center to just 200 meters in its southern sector. The area is home to 11 Syrian towns and villages, with tens of thousands of residents. Since 1974, UNDOF has monitored Syrian and Israeli ceasefire compliance from around 50 positions inside the zone and just outside it. The U.N. spokesperson said the IDF has severely constrained UNDOF’s freedom of movement between those positions since December 7 but added that Israeli troops’ posture toward UNDOF has 'for the most part not been aggressive.' An IDF spokesman contacted by VOA confirmed it has instructed UNDOF to avoid travel on roads during IDF movements. The U.N. spokesperson also said UNDOF has not observed the IDF building hard-walled accommodations for troops in the locations they have occupied. Rather, images published by the Israeli government showed troops positioned alongside green tents constructed at the summit of Mount Hermon as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the site on Tuesday. UNDOF is aware of Israeli troops installing 'mobility impairment devices,' or barriers, on some roads within the buffer zone, the U.N. spokesperson said. The IDF spokesman confirmed to VOA that the barriers are a security measure intended to slow the approach of unknown vehicles toward Israeli positions. In a Tuesday briefing, the U.N. secretary-general’s spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, provided more details on how Israel’s occupation of the buffer zone has impacted UNDOF. 'UNDOF used to conduct approximately 55 to 60 daily operational tasks and logistics activities. It is currently restricted to three to five essential logistics movements per day, which significantly affects its operations,' Dujarric said. Netanyahu, in a social media video posted from his visit to the Mount Hermon summit, said the IDF will remain in what he called an important place for Israel’s security 'until another arrangement is found' ensuring that security. Israel has said its occupation of the buffer zone is a temporary measure to prevent Syrian armed groups that ousted Assad from threatening Israeli territory. Retired Israeli Colonel Eran Lerman, vice president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, told VOA that Israel’s newly established control of the Mount Hermon summit and of commanding geographical features of the largely abandoned city of Quneitra and areas further south enable the IDF to see deeper into Syrian territory. 'This is crucial for intelligence gathering, both visual and otherwise,' said Lerman, a former deputy national security adviser. In his first public comment on Israel’s occupation of the buffer zone that began eight days earlier, Syria’s main rebel leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, told Britain’s The Times newspaper in a Monday interview that Israel must pull back to its previous positions. 'We are committed to the 1974 agreement. ... We do not want any conflict, whether with Israel or anyone else, and we will not let Syria be used as a launchpad for attacks,' said Sharaa, whose HTS militia is a U.S.-designated terror group. Syrian-born political analyst Rime Allaf, an Austria-based advocate of democracy in her native country, told VOA the new authorities in Syria have been much more focused on rebuilding the country after 13 years of war than on Israel’s expanded control over the Golan Heights. Prior to its occupation of the buffer zone, Israel had spent several months digging a trench along the Golan Heights ceasefire line as part of a nationwide effort to fortify its borders against future terror attacks like that perpetrated by Hamas from Gaza on October 7, 2023. UNDOF had publicly complained to Israel about the trench construction, accusing Israeli forces of straying several meters into the Area of Separation at several points. Responding to a VOA inquiry on November 15, the State Department said it had received the UNDOF complaints of 'unauthorized military personnel and equipment inside the Area of Separation.' It criticized those activities as 'encroachments [that] degrade the security situation.' Three weeks later, after the fall of Assad, U.S. officials changed their language regarding Israeli activities in the buffer zone, defending the Israeli presence as consistent with Israel’s right to self-defense and important for its security. They also said the U.S. continues to support the terms of the 1974 Israeli-Syrian ceasefire agreement and wants to see Syria’s territorial integrity upheld. Asked by VOA if the State Department stood by its earlier criticism of the Israeli trench construction along the ceasefire line, a spokesperson responded on December 12 by pointing to a department press briefing that discussed Israel’s buffer zone activities but not the trench issue specifically. The U.S. recognized the Golan Heights ceasefire line as Israel’s border with Syria in 2019. The rest of the international community has not done so, with most nations labeling the Israeli-administered part of the Golan Heights as occupied Syrian territory. Allaf said many Syrians do not see Israel as having acted in self-defense by occupying the buffer zone. 'I’m on the phone with people in Syria every day, and most of them are outraged about the Golan Heights because nobody has done anything to threaten Israel. They see Israel as acting illegally and opportunistically to expand its territory in a way that creates more tension with Syria,' she said. Lerman said that while Israel’s occupation of the buffer zone may be prolonged as Syria’s new rulers try to form an internationally recognized political entity, he does not anticipate an eventual Israeli annexation of the territory. 'Once there is a legitimate regime in Syria, Israel can trade away the buffer zone for a stable arrangement, perhaps short of a peace deal, that would enable us to concentrate on other missions,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-details-emerge-on-israel-s-actions-in-syrian-buffer-zone-change-in-us-position/7906679.html	2024-12-18T18:33:39-08:00	
Zelenskyy: Ukraine lacks military strength to recover its Russian-occupied land	Ukraine’s president told a French newspaper Wednesday that his country does not have the military might to take back its Russian-occupied territories. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Le Parisien that Ukraine’s military does not possess the strength it needs to expel Russian forces from the Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine that is has held since 2014. Ukraine’s constitution prohibits it from forfeiting its territories, he added. 'We can only count on diplomatic pressure from the international community to force [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to sit down at the negotiating table,' Zelenskyy said. If the West had given Ukraine all the defense systems it needed when Ukraine first asked for them, Ukraine would not be in the situation it is in now with Russia, he said. Russia occupies about 18% of Ukraine. NATO and Ukraine Zelenskyy arrived in Brussels on Wednesday where he met with NATO chief Mark Rutte and other European leaders as Ukraine seeks to bolster its defenses against Russian forces. As Rutte greeted Zelenskyy for their meeting, the NATO secretary-general said he did not want to speak publicly about when the peace talks would begin and if European peacekeepers would be involved because doing so would play into Putin’s hands. Rutte said Wednesday that Ukraine’s partners will do whatever they can to provide Ukraine with everything it needs to defend itself against the nearly three-year war with Russia, including air defense and other weapons system. On Tuesday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was in urgent need of military aid, especially air defense systems. 'We must do everything possible to destroy Russia’s ability to wage war from as far away as possible,' he said. 'For this, we need more drones, more modern artillery, and long-range missiles.' Wednesday’s talks come a month before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office, bringing uncertainty about the level of continued U.S. support for Ukraine from the new administration. Among those expected to meet with Zelenskyy in Brussels were German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, European Council President António Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Ahead of the talks, Russia launched another round of overnight aerial attacks. Ihor Taburets, governor of Ukraine’s Cherkasy region, said Wednesday on Telegram that Ukrainian air defenses shot down 13 drones. He said there was no damage to infrastructure in the area. Khmelnytskyi Governor Serhii Tiurin said Wednesday that Ukrainian forces shot down two drones. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it destroyed two Ukrainian aerial drones over the Belgorod region, along with a drone over Bryansk and another over Kursk. Moscow attack Russia said Wednesday it detained a suspect in the killing of Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces. Authorities described the suspect as a citizen of Uzbekistan who was recruited by Ukrainian intelligence services to carry out the Tuesday attack in Moscow. An official with Ukraine’s Security Service, or SBU, said Tuesday the agency was behind the attack and called Kirillov a 'war criminal and an entirely legitimate target.' Several countries, including Britain and Canada, had sanctioned Kirillov, 54, for his actions in Moscow’s nearly three-year war in Ukraine. Some information for this story came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-ukraine-lacks-military-strength-to-recover-its-russian-occupied-land/7906668.html	2024-12-18T18:19:20-08:00	
Expert: North Korea accelerating production, transfer of arms to Russia	UNITED NATIONS — An independent weapons expert told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday that North Korea is procuring parts for missiles from third countries and producing and transferring them to Russia faster than previously thought, for use in its war against Ukraine. Jonah Leff, who heads Conflict Armament Research (CAR), an independent organization that tracks weapons used in conflicts, said his researchers documented remnants of four missiles they assess came from North Korea that were recovered in July and August in Ukraine. He said one of the missiles had markings indicating it was produced this year. 'This is the first public evidence of missiles having been produced in North Korea and then used in Ukraine within a matter of months, not years,' Leff said. He said this indicates 'a very short' period between the production of these ballistic missiles, their transfer and eventual use in Ukraine. Leff also noted that some missile remnants had components not manufactured in North Korea, including with production marks as recently as 2023, indicating Pyongyang has a 'robust acquisition network for its ballistic missile program,' despite international sanctions prohibiting such transfers to the rogue regime. 'Despite nearly two decades of sanctions on the DPRK, it has demonstrated this year its ability to produce and supply ballistic missiles for use against Ukraine within just a matter of months,' he said, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name. Some parts for North Korean drones and missiles that have been used against Ukraine had components branded from companies in Europe, Japan and the United States. 'Through CAR’s collaborative approach with industry, we have ascertained that these components found in remnants of weapons systems used against Ukraine derived from supplies by third-party distributors, mostly based in East Asia,' Leff said. Russian, North Korean ambassadors Russia’s ambassador did not address the transfer of arms from Pyongyang to the Kremlin. Of their deepening relations, Vassily Nebenzia said they are close neighbors and developing relations in 'all areas.' 'This is our sovereign right. Russian cooperation with the DPRK at the military and other areas is in accordance with international law, not in violation thereof,' Nebenzia said. 'This is not directed against any third countries. It does not pose any threat to states in the region or the international community — and have no doubt, we will continue to develop such cooperation.' North Korea’s ambassador, Song Kim, said their relations are 'a positive contribution to peace and security' and should not be criticized. Wednesday’s meeting was called by the United States, with support from South Korea, Japan and several Western council members. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Washington has information that 'a large number of DPRK-origin 170 mm long-range self-propelled artillery pieces and 240 mm long-range multiple rocket launchers' are being introduced into the Ukrainian conflict. 'We also have information that Russia has transferred air defense systems to the DPRK,' she said, indicating what Pyongyang may be getting in return for sending both arms and more than 11,000 troops to assist Moscow. 'And not just any soldiers,' she said. 'North Korea sent elite special forces units to Russia.' She noted that this is the first time that North Korean troops have been deployed in large-scale fighting in more than 70 years, and it is the first time outside the Korean Peninsula. Ukraine’s ambassador said Russian forces have integrated North Korean troops into joint units in the Kursk region. 'They primarily advance in large numbers on foot across open terrain, and in extended chains,' Sergiy Kyslytsya said. 'This approach bears a striking resemblance of infantry tactics employed during World War II but is highly unusual for the Russian-Ukrainian war.' He said that the North Korean troops do not appear well-trained in modern warfare. 'Available video evidence reveals that North Korean soldiers seem unprepared to react to enemy drones and lack even the basic understanding of measures to counter drone-related threats,' he said, saying the joint units had suffered 'noticeable losses.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/expert-north-korea-accelerating-production-transfer-of-arms-to-russia-/7906665.html	2024-12-18T18:06:54-08:00	
Amazon workers to strike at US warehouses during busy holiday season	Thousands of Amazon.com workers will walk off the job on Thursday at 6 a.m. EST, in the crucial final days before Christmas, after union officials said the retailer failed to come to the bargaining table. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters said unionized workers at facilities in New York City; Skokie, Illinois; Atlanta, San Francisco and southern California will join the picket line to seek contracts guaranteeing better wages and work conditions. The Teamsters union has said it represents about 10,000 workers at 10 of the company's U.S. facilities, representing about 1% of Amazon's hourly workforce. The strike could disrupt Amazon's operations as it races to fulfill orders during its busiest season of the year. In the New York City area, however, the company has multiple warehouses, as well as smaller delivery depots for fast same-day delivery. Amazon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The union had given Amazon a deadline of Sunday to begin negotiations, and workers voted recently to authorize a possible strike. Teamsters local unions are also putting up primary picket lines at hundreds of Amazon Fulfillment Centers nationwide, the union said in a statement on Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amazon-workers-to-strike-at-us-warehouses-during-busy-holiday-season/7906664.html	2024-12-18T18:00:28-08:00	
Bluesky could become target of foreign disinformation, experts warn	washington — Experts on cybersecurity and online foreign influence campaigns are urging social media company Bluesky, whose app has exploded in popularity in recent weeks, to step up moderation to counter potential state-sponsored influence efforts. Over the past month, Bluesky, a microblogging platform with its roots in Twitter, has seen one of its biggest increases in new user registrations since it was publicly released in February. Over 25 million are now on the platform, close to half of whom joined after the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Rose Wang, Bluesky’s chief operating officer, said in a recent interview that Bluesky does not intend to push any political ideologies. 'We have no political viewpoint that we are trying to promote,' she said in early December. Exploiting users’ political leanings Many who joined Bluesky have cited user experience as one of the reasons for migrating from social media platform X. They also have said they joined the platform after Election Day because they are critics of Elon Musk and President-elect Donald Trump. Some commentators in the U.S. have questioned whether Bluesky is risking becoming an echo chamber of the left. Some experts contend the platform’s liberal-leaning users could be exploited by foreign propagandists. Joe Bodnar, who tracks foreign influence operations for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told VOA Mandarin that Russian propaganda often appeals to the anti-establishment left in the U.S. on contentious topics, like Gaza, gun violence and America’s global dominance. 'The Kremlin wants to make those arguments even louder,' Bodnar said. 'Sometimes that means they play to the left.' So far, at least three accounts that belong to RT, a Russia-controlled media outlet, have joined Bluesky. Sputnik Brazil is also actively posting on the platform. VOA Mandarin found that at least two Chinese accounts that belong to state broadcaster CGTN have joined the platform. Bluesky does not assign verification labels. One way to authenticate an account is for the person or organization to link it to the domain of its official website. There are at least four other accounts that claim to be Chinese state media outlets, including China Daily, the Global Times and People’s Daily. None of the three publications replied to VOA’s emails inquiring about these accounts’ authenticity. Additionally, Beijing has played heavily to the Western left on certain global issues. China has consistently called for a ceasefire in Gaza and blamed the West for supporting Israel. But those familiar with Chinese and Russian state media say the left-leaning user base on Bluesky actually could give Beijing and Moscow a hard time for pushing their narratives. 'Bluesky isn’t the most hospitable place for Russian narratives,' Bodnar said. Sean Haines, a British national who used to work for Chinese state media outlets, shared similar opinions in a recent blog post about Bluesky. 'With its predominately Western liberal leaning, the platform also will be an uphill challenge for those looking to push overtly nationalistic viewpoints,' he wrote. Most of the Chinese and Russian state media accounts have only hundreds of followers, with RT en Espanol at the top, with nearly 7,000. Could 'decentralization' be detrimental? China and Russia have been finding ways to reach the American public through covert disinformation operations on social media. During this year’s election, disinformation campaigns connected to China and Russia promoted claims that cast doubt on the integrity of the voting process. Similar tactics could soon be coming to Bluesky. 'I don’t think Bluesky is more vulnerable to influence campaigns than X or other social networks,' Jennifer Victoria Scurrell, a researcher on AI-supported influence operations, told VOA Mandarin. But Scurrell, of ETH Zurich’s Center for Security Studies, said Bluesky’s decentralized moderation approach is flawed. Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, started Bluesky as an internal project to give users more power over moderation. Bluesky then went independent in 2021. 'Our mission is to develop and drive large-scale technologies of open and decentralized public conversation,' the company says on its website. To do that, Bluesky 'decentralized' its moderation authority, giving users tools to customize their experience on the site. Bluesky offers a universal basic moderation setting for every user, which labels content such as extremism, misinformation, fake accounts and adult content. Users can choose whether to see the content labeled by Bluesky. Users can report to Bluesky content or accounts they believe have violated Bluesky’s guidelines. On top of that, users get to create their own moderation settings to label or filter out certain content and accounts. Other users can subscribe to these customized settings, should they choose. Scurrell, who helps test security weaknesses for OpenAI as a contractor, told VOA Mandarin the decentralized approach to moderation could be a double-edged sword. 'Societal values are diverse, contextual and local, which makes decentralized moderation an appealing concept,' she wrote in her replies to VOA. She warned that outsourcing content moderation to users, though, 'raises serious concerns' because the approach would give bad actors the same amount of power as normal users. 'What happens if an entire node is taken over by malicious actors spreading disinformation or manipulative content,' she wrote, or 'if the system gets hijacked by an army of bots?' VOA Mandarin emailed Bluesky a list of detailed questions about its moderation policy against potential foreign influence attempts but did not receive a response. Experts have urged Bluesky to implement measures to counter potential foreign influence campaigns. In a recent blog post, Sarah Cook, an independent China watcher and former China director at Freedom House, urged Bluesky to label state media accounts, a practice exercised by many social media companies, so users know of these accounts’ ties to foreign governments. Eugenio Benincasa, an expert on Chinese cyber threats at ETH Zurich, asserts that studying how Chinese tech companies help Beijing surveil social media platforms and manipulate online discussions can help Bluesky better prepare. 'It is crucial to thoroughly study the evolving influence tactics enabled by tools like public opinion monitoring systems to identify vulnerabilities that may have been overlooked or are emerging, in order to develop effective safeguards,' Benincasa said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bluesky-could-become-target-of-foreign-disinformation-experts-warn/7906626.html	2024-12-18T16:43:47-08:00	
Trump urges US lawmakers to reject spending bill, raising government shutdown odds	President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday called on U.S. lawmakers to reject a stopgap bill to keep the government funded past Friday, raising the likelihood of a partial shutdown. Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance called on lawmakers to pass a different temporary spending bill than the one unveiled on Tuesday, free from what they called 'Democrat giveaways.' Trump also called on lawmakers to use the bill to address the nation's debt ceiling, injecting a new element of complexity into the process. That could complicate efforts to avert a shutdown that would disrupt everything from air travel to law enforcement days before the December 25 Christmas holiday. It would be the first government shutdown since one that extended through December 2018 into 2019, during Trump's first four-year White House term. Democrats currently control the Senate, and Democratic President Joe Biden remains in power until Trump takes office on January 20. The current bill would fund government agencies at current levels and provide $100 billion for disaster relief and $10 billion in farm aid. It also includes a wide range of unrelated provisions, such as a pay raise for lawmakers and a crackdown on hidden hotel fees. Trump and Vance said Congress should limit the bill to temporary spending and disaster relief — and also raise the national debt ceiling, a politically painful task that is scheduled to come to a head next year. 'If Democrats won’t cooperate on the debt ceiling now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration?' they said in the statement. Congress's next steps were unclear. Bipartisan agreement will be needed to pass any spending bill through the House of Representatives, where Republicans have a narrow majority, and the Senate. The stopgap measure is needed because Congress has failed to pass regular spending legislation for the fiscal year that began on October 1. It does not cover benefit programs like Social Security, which continue automatically. The U.S. government has spent more money than it has taken in for more than 20 years, as Democrats have expanded health programs and Republicans have cut taxes, and an aging population is projected to push up the cost of retirement and health programs in the years to come. Steadily mounting debt — currently $36 trillion — will force lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling at some point, either now or when borrowing authority runs out next year. Failure to act could shock bond markets with potentially severe economic consequences. Trump's comments came after his ally Elon Musk pressured Congress to reject the bill and said those who back it should be voted out of office. The Tesla chief executive and world's richest person, who spent more than $250 million to help Trump get elected, has been tasked by Trump to prune the federal budget. Unless Congress acts, the federal government will run out of money to fund operations on Saturday. Negotiators on Tuesday agreed on a deal to extend funding through March 14. House Republicans who helped negotiate the bill said Musk's opposition complicated passage. 'There's never an easy fix to anything around here,' said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole. Democrats said Trump's statement was a sign of chaos ahead. 'House Republicans have been ordered to shut down the government. And hurt the working-class Americans they claim to support. You break the bipartisan agreement, you own the consequences that follow,' House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on social media. Many Republicans already object to additional spending and unrelated provisions that have been added to the package. Trump in the past has sometimes voiced support for government shutdowns, and the 2018-2019 one was the longest in U.S. history, lasting 34 days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-urges-us-lawmakers-to-reject-spending-bill-raising-government-shutdown-odds/7906388.html	2024-12-18T16:04:10-08:00	
Pakistan media experienced surge in violence, suppression in 2024	ISLAMABAD — Malik Zafar Iqbal Naich was delivering copies of the newspaper he works for last week when gunmen on a motorbike shot and killed the journalist. Naich, a 45-year-old reporter and newsagent for the Daily Khabrain, became the 12th journalist killed in what has been a deadly year for Pakistan’s media industry. Police are investigating the case in central-eastern Punjab province and have not yet identified a motive. However, the journalist’s employer suspected it could be related to his reporting. 'We demand that the Pakistani authorities ensure justice to the bereaved family,' Blaise Lempen, president of the Press Emblem Campaign, said in a statement. The Geneva-based media safety and rights body says the killings in Pakistan come amid criticism over a lack of justice or impunity for journalists' murders. The Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, has also flagged a failure to ensure accountability. It said that Pakistani authorities should implement urgent measures to curb attacks on media. 'The surge in violence is closely linked to the political turmoil and security situation in the country, but more alarming is the Pakistan government turning a blind eye to the sharp rise in journalist killings,' Beh Lih Yi, the CPJ Asia program coordinator, told VOA. 'This failure to put an end to impunity is sending a chilling message to newsrooms across the country that such heinous acts are tolerated in Pakistan,' she said via email. Alongside violence, journalists are at risk of arrest or threats for covering issues deemed critical or sensitive to authorities, including a crackdown on anti-government protesters. Pakistan’s minister of information, Attaullah Tarar, told VOA he would respond to a request for comment but at the time of publication, no response had been received. Tarar said in September that the government was working closely with provincial authorities to address challenges facing journalists. ‘Deep-rooted impunity’ The Islamabad-based Freedom Network, an advocate for press freedom, has determined that at least half of the journalists killed this year were targeted over their work. 'There is more than one factor contributing to the physical elimination of journalists,' said Iqbal Khattak, the executive director of the nonprofit network. He noted that no one has been held accountable for the killing of journalists to date. 'I think deep-rooted impunity for crimes against journalists and media organizations is encouraging press freedom predators to continue these attacks,' Khattak told VOA. Amir Zia, a political talk show host, said that journalists face threats from multiple fronts, including state actors, political party supporters, religious and sectarian groups, and militants. 'In rural areas, particularly the southern province of Sindh, feudal lords — many affiliated with the provincial ruling party — remain responsible for the murder and torture of journalists,' Zia said. The Sindh government denies the charges. Last month, it announced the establishment of a commission to protect journalists. The panel would provide legal assistance, arrange training and develop safety policies. However, critics remain skeptical about the commission's effectiveness. Most media freedom violations documented by the Freedom Network in 2024 were in Sindh, with Punjab and Islamabad the second- and third-most affected regions, respectively. But Zia said that authorities alone are not responsible for the safety and security of the media. 'Pakistani media organizations hardly take the safety of journalists seriously. There is hardly any training, and an overwhelming number of media persons even lack proper safety gear for covering violence and terrorist incidents,' he said. The CPJ has noted that various parties — from police to tribal chiefs — often pressure relatives, particularly those from rural areas, to abandon efforts to secure justice, with families in some cases paid in exchange for silence. Legal threats Watchdogs, too, have long criticized Pakistan for the poor media freedom environment, including laws that target media, arrests, accusations of torture and harassment. Coverage of protests last month led to one journalist being detained briefly and another called in for questioning. Harmeet Singh, a journalist from the country’s minority Sikh community, has been summoned to appear for questioning by the Federal Investigation Agency Cybercrime Center next week. The anchor for Such TV faces allegations of propagating a 'misleading, concocted and baseless campaign against state institutions and security agencies of Pakistan.' The case stems from Singh’s coverage of a Nov. 26 opposition protest march in Islamabad by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan. Pakistani security forces used tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition on protesters, according to local and foreign media. The PTI reported the deaths of at least 12 people and said that many more are still unaccounted for. The government refuted any casualties resulting from gunfire, saying that security forces were not armed with 'lethal' weapons. 'The targeting of Singh is part of a broader pattern of intimidation against journalists in Pakistan,' said CPJ’s Beh. She added that a second journalist — Matiullah Jan — was arrested on terrorism charges for his coverage of the same protest. Hours before he was detained at a hospital last month, Jan had said on his TV show that security forces used firearms to disperse protesters. He cited data from hospital sources and accused the government of pressuring hospital staff not to reveal details to the media. 'Truth is always the first casualty of war,' Jan told VOA, saying he believes his arrest was meant to deter journalists from investigating the protest. The reporter, who runs a YouTube channel with nearly 400,000 subscribers, added, '[Authorities] only care about some temporary arrangement to prevent journalists from completing their work, completing their job and bringing out facts, so that’s their ultimate success.' The arrests and violence contribute to Pakistan’s low ranking for media freedom. The country ranks 152 out of 180 on the Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media environment. And it has appeared every year on the CPJ Impunity Index that looks at countries where justice for killed journalists remains elusive. In the latest index, published Oct. 30, Pakistan was ranked 12th for countries failing to hold killers in media cases to account.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-media-experienced-surge-in-violence-suppression-in-2024/7906338.html	2024-12-18T14:39:48-08:00	
NATO chief aims to put Ukraine in position of strength for peace talks with Russia	BRUSSELS — NATO's secretary-general said he wants to discuss ways to put Ukraine in a position of strength for any future peace talks with Russia during a meeting Wednesday with Ukraine’s president and a small number of European leaders. But Mark Rutte appeared frustrated at growing speculation in NATO capitals about when those peace talks might start and whether European peacekeepers would be involved, saying that speaking publicly about it plays into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'High on the agenda is to make sure that the president, his team in Ukraine, are in the best possible position one day when they decide to start the peace talks,' Rutte told reporters as he welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his residence in Brussels. The focus, Rutte said, must be 'to do everything now to make sure that when it comes to air defense, when it comes to other weapons systems, that we make sure that we provide whatever we can.' He said that another issue up for discussion would be 'how to make sure that when peace comes one day that we also think about the economy of Ukraine now, but also after a future peace deal.' Zelenskyy posted on Telegram that he would hold talks with the leaders of the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands and Poland and U.K. representatives, who were in Brussels. He’s also due to take part in an EU summit in the Belgian capital on Thursday. Zelenskyy said that the meeting would provide 'a very good opportunity to speak about security guarantees for Ukraine, for today and for tomorrow.' Ukraine sees NATO membership as the ultimate security guarantee, but the U.S. and Germany lead a group of countries that oppose this while war continues. After separate talks with Zelenskyy, French President Emmanuel Macron said his country is making reinforced support for Ukraine its ″absolute priority″ and will continue giving Ukraine ″the means to defend itself and to make Russia’s war of aggression fail,″ according to Macron’s office. Noting his recent meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Zelenskyy, Macron said he will maintain a ″tight dialogue with Ukraine and its international partners to work for a return to a fair and lasting peace,″ the statement said. At NATO headquarters earlier, Rutte had said the terms of any peace talks should be up to Ukraine, Russia and any others at the negotiating table. 'If we now start to discuss amongst ourselves what a deal could look like, we make it so easy for the Russians,' he said. 'I think we would be very wise to put some lid on this and focus on the business at hand, and the business at hand is to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to prevent Putin from winning,' Rutte added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-chief-aims-to-put-ukraine-in-position-of-strength-for-peace-talks-with-russia/7906333.html	2024-12-18T14:10:33-08:00	
More than 2 million Nigerians kidnapped in one year, survey finds	Abuja, Nigeria — Security officials in Nigeria are raising concerns after a National Bureau of Statistics survey revealed that more than 2 million people were kidnapped in the West African nation between May 2023 and April 2024, and that Nigerians paid a cumulative $1.42 billion to kidnappers within the same period. The NBS released its Crime Experience and Security Perception Survey 2024 on Tuesday. The report said some 600,000 Nigerians were killed and 2.2 million others abducted across the country between May 2023 and April 2024. Armed gangs, known locally as bandits, were mostly responsible for the escalation of violence in northwest and north central Nigeria, while terror-related violence was reported in the northeast region of Nigeria. The report said 91% of the kidnappings were attributed to ransom demands, while other cases were due to political, criminal or terrorist motives. It also said Nigerians spent $1.4 billion cumulatively to free their loved ones from kidnappers at an average of $1,700 per incident. Security analyst Senator Iroegbu said the report is no surprise. 'The figure is not surprising. The only difference is that the media focus has shifted, and that's what makes it look as if it [insecurity] has reduced,' Iroegbu said. 'So, this report has brought back to light what is going on.' According to the NBS report, 82.1% of the kidnapped victims were released, 12.8% were killed, 3.3% remained in captivity and the outcome of about 1.3% of victims was unknown. The report comes amid growing security concerns in Africa's most populous nation already struggling to curb a range of insecurities that have stretched the security forces thin. It also revealed that nearly seven out of 10 households in Nigeria reported murder cases to the police within the same period. Security analyst Saheed Shehu said the trend is worrying. 'These figures should serve as a yardstick as a baseline for the president and commander-in-chief to hold his military, police, accountable,' Shehu said. 'The figures should serve as a tool to hold the leaders of the security agencies accountable. We should not just be reading figures and then wait for the end of 2025 to release another figure.' In November, Nigeria announced the discovery of a new terror group known as Lakurawa but said security forces were already on their trail. Two weeks ago, Nigerian defense authorities said the military killed a total of 8,000 terrorists and apprehended over 11,000 suspects and rescued over 6,000 victims between January and December. But Shehu is skeptical. 'This report coming from the National Bureau of Statistics — to be honest, it makes me to be at a quandary whether the reports we're getting from security agencies of successes ... it does not balance with this report,' Shehu said. 'So, something must be wrong somewhere.' Improving security is a major challenge for President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's government as it desperately seeks to attract foreign investments to grow the country's struggling economy. Nigeria allocated about $4 billion, or 12% of this year's budget, to defense and security — the largest single allocation to any sector.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-2-million-nigerians-kidnapped-in-one-year-survey-finds/7906304.html	2024-12-18T13:36:04-08:00	
South Sudan set to hold elections in 2026, but will it be ready?	JUBA, SOUTH SUDAN — South Sudan is due to hold long-delayed general elections in December 2026, and some wonder if the world’s youngest nation will be ready. The vote was set for this month but was delayed for a number of reasons, including the need for more time to complete a census, draft a permanent constitution and register political parties. The postponement, first announced in June, extended the term of the current transitional government, headed by President Salva Kiir. Abendengo Akok, head of South Sudan’s National Electoral Commission, told VOA that the political will must be present for the vote to be successful, using as an example the 2018 peace agreement that ended the country’s civil war. 'If we are serious, two years are enough for us to run the election,' Akok said, adding that adequate funding is necessary for a successful vote. Nicholas Haysom, the head of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan, warned last week that mismanaged elections could reignite violence and upset South Sudan’s stability. 'We have been insisting that properly prepared elections, which have also been preceded by proper trust-building exercises, can play a significant role in taking an exercise which can be very divisive and make it a nation-building exercise,' he said. People coming together to vote, he said, will help them recognize that 'together they control the future of South Sudan.' South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011. The country was set to hold its maiden election in 2015, but civil war broke out in 2013. Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar, Kiir’s former vice president, were locked in a power struggle, triggering fighting between forces loyal to each man. In 2018, Kiir and Machar signed the comprehensive peace agreement, which was to culminate in elections this month. In June, however, Kiir and Machar agreed to push the election out another two years. Wani Yusuf was 14 years old when he cast his vote in the referendum to secede from Sudan. Now he looks forward to casting his first vote as an adult and believes he will make an informed and independent decision in helping choose South Sudan’s first democratically elected government. Yusuf, however, questioned whether the 2026 vote will materialize. 'When you look at the period that we spend postponing the election, it still tells you that that if they cannot conduct election in that time up to now, then there is also high possibility that election might not take place within those two years’ time,' he said. Apart from budgetary constraints, the electoral commission still needs to conduct a census and draw up guidelines, which will take up to 17 months, according to the document outlining the delay in the vote. These processes have not started because of a lack of a budget, according to Gabriel Deng, the electoral commission’s deputy chair.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-sudan-set-to-hold-elections-in-2026-but-will-it-be-ready/7906296.html	2024-12-18T13:32:13-08:00	
Thailand joins other Asia nations in battle against cheap Chinese imports	Bangkok — For many countries in Southeast Asia, Chinese investment and tourism are key to their economies. However, cheap low-quality Chinese products that are flooding markets across the region are also raising concerns about how they are undercutting local businesses, experts say. That is forcing countries like Thailand to find ways to combat onslaught of low-priced goods. Last year, bilateral trade between Thailand and China was more than $126 billion, with direct Chinese foreign investment heavily contributing to the Thai economy. Three of Thailand’s main economic industries are manufacturing, agriculture and services. But manufacturing has seen a decline, with 2,000 factories closing in 2023, leading to thousands of jobs lost, according to data from the Department of Industrial Works. Business owners have long bemoaned the fact that low-quality Chinese goods are undercutting local Thai businesses. Bobae Shopping Mall – a retail and wholesale market in Bangkok – is one of the places where that impact is showing. With seven floors dedicated to shopping units, many have their shutters down, even though Thailand is in its peak season and Christmas is next week. Banchob Pianphanitporn is the owner of Ben’s Socks, which is located on the fifth floor. He has owned the business for 26 years and manages four units. He has one factory in Thailand that employs 24 staff in total. He said that over the last decade, his sales have dropped by half because of Chinese imports. 'I would say [sales are] 50% down since 10 years ago,' he told VOA. 'I sell socks for 150 baht ($4.38) per a dozen, but if this was a Chinese product, they would sell at 85 baht ($2.48). If [customers] have low budget they will say [my socks] are expensive. They don’t consider the materials, [my socks] are much better material and more flexible,' he added. Thailand’s slow manufacturing industry has contributed to a sluggish year for the economy. Forecasts project that Thailand’s economic will grow by 2.3% – 2.8% percent in 2024, which is less than its regional neighbors. Although the Bank of Thailand forecasts a 3% growth in 2025, concerns from business owners remain. Banchob points to several closures of units in his mall, blaming Thailand’s economy. But in an effort to remain open, he promotes his business on social media to attract more customers. 'Social media is a must. I’m on TikTok; I make much content. I have to work harder to tell people I’m still alive; Ben Sock’s made in Thailand is here,' he added. According to Thai government spokesperson Sasikarn Wattanachan, there has been a 20 percent decrease in low-quality imports in Thailand since July. Authorities have introduced tighter inspections of cheap imports, focusing on agricultural, consumer and industrial items. Thailand has also added a 7% value added tax on goods imported that are under 1,500 baht or $43.77, the Bangkok Post has reported. But for other sellers and store owners, they don’t see any difference. Pam, a seller at Pretty Baby, a baby clothes store in the Bangkok mall, says the seemingly unlimited stock from Chinese manufacturers has affected sales. Pam did not want to disclose her full name fearing retaliation for speaking with the press. '[Chinese products] are selling a lot, but we don’t have that much stock. The government still allows the products from overseas. Our sales have dropped down a little bit,' she told VOA. For some customers, retaining regular customers is key to beating cheaper alternatives. Prang is part-owner of V.C. shop, a clothing store which specializes in loose-fitting clothing known as elephant pants. 'The hard advertising from Chinese people [on social media] has had a big effect,' she told VOA. Prang too did not want to give her full name. 'Pants can sell here for 70 baht ($2.04) but Chinese sell for 50 baht ($1.46). In the past we can tell [the difference] between Thai and China products, now China copies look 99 percent the same. We cannot fight with the costs, but we are confident on our material and quality, and we can keep our customers,' she added. It’s not just Thailand that is trying to reduce low-quality imports. A growing number of countries across Asia are looking for ways to protect local manufacturers and trade. In India, a proposed temporary tax of 25% on steel imports is likely to be imposed to curb cheaper alternatives from China and boost production from Indian manufacturers, the Reuters news agency reported on December 17. And in Indonesia, protests against Chinese imports have prompted Jakarta to propose a 200% tariff on certain imported clothing and ceramic goods, to protect small and medium enterprises. Vietnam also relies heavily on China in trade. Beijing is Hanoi’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade amounting to more than $171 billion in 2023. Although both governments share communist ideologies and a 1,287-kilometer land border, Vietnam is also acting to combat China's cheap imports. In late November, Hanoi banned Chinese online retailers Shein and Temu after the two companies failed to meet a business registration deadline with the Vietnamese government. But local businesses in Vietnam have long voiced concern over discounted products and the sale of counterfeit items from the retailer. 'Cheap Chinese imports from platforms like Shein and Temu are flooding Vietnam’s markets, squeezing local producers and sparking outrage over unfair competition,' Nguyen Khac Giang, Visiting Fellow at ISEAS, told VOA. 'In response the government is cracking down by scrapping VAT exemptions, tightening oversight, and banning platforms which do not register in Vietnam. It’s a bold move to rein in Chinese e-commerce giants and defend local businesses, but I think the fight is far from over,' he added. Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington who focuses on Southeast Asia politics, says both Thailand and Vietnam may also have another motive. 'China produces on an economy of scale that no one in Southeast Asia can, their productions costs are lower for most products. I think what you see Thailand and Vietnam doing now is trying to court Chinese investment for local production, to create local product ecosystems. But neither is willing to take China head on and accuse them of unfair trading practices,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-joins-other-asia-nations-in-battle-against-cheap-chinese-imports/7906265.html	2024-12-18T13:29:29-08:00	
Manhattan man pleads guilty to helping establish secret Chinese police station in New York City	NEW YORK — A Manhattan resident has pleaded guilty to helping establish a secret police station in New York City on behalf of the Chinese government. Chen Jinping, 60, entered the guilty plea on a single count of conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government in Brooklyn federal court on Wednesday. Matthew Olsen, an assistant attorney general in the U.S. Justice Department, said Chen admitted in court to his role in 'audaciously establishing an undeclared police station' in Manhattan and attempting to conceal the effort when approached by the FBI. 'This illegal police station was not opened in the interest of public safety, but to further the nefarious and repressive aims of the PRC in direct violation of American sovereignty,' he said in statement, referring to the People's Republic of China. Prosecutors say Chen and his co-defendant, Lu Jianwang, opened and operated a local branch of China’s Ministry of Public Security in Manhattan’s Chinatown neighborhood starting in early 2022. The office, which occupied an entire floor of the building, performed basic services, such as helping Chinese citizens renew their Chinese driver’s licenses, but also identified pro-democracy activists living in the U.S., according to federal authorities. The clandestine Chinese police operation was shuttered in fall 2022 amid an FBI investigation. But in an apparent effort to obstruct the federal probe, Chen and Lu deleted from their phones the communications with a Chinese government official they reported to, prosecutors said. China is believed to be operating such secretive police outposts in North America, Europe and other places where there are Chinese communities. The country, however, has denied that they are police stations, saying that they exist mainly to provide citizen services such as renewing driver’s licenses. The arrest of Chen and Lu in April 2023 was part of a series of Justice Department prosecutions aimed at cracking down on 'transnational repression,' in which foreign governments such as China work to identify, intimidate and silence dissidents in the U.S. Lawyers for Chen and Lu didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment Wednesday. Chen faces up to five years in prison at his sentencing on May 30. Lu, who is due back in court in February, had a longstanding relationship with Chinese law enforcement officials, according to prosecutors. Over the years, they say, the Bronx resident, who was also known as Harry Lu, helped harass and threaten a Chinese fugitive living in the U.S. and also worked to locate a pro-democracy activist in California on behalf of China’s government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/manhattan-man-pleads-guilty-to-helping-establish-secret-chinese-police-station-in-new-york-city-/7906257.html	2024-12-18T13:23:16-08:00	
Sanctioned by China, Rubio confident in engaging Beijing as US top diplomat	STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken held a 'substantive' face-to-face meeting Wednesday morning with Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who has been selected by President-elect Donald Trump as his nominee for the next U.S. secretary of state. The meeting comes as Trump’s team prepares for the transition process. 'It was a good, constructive and substantive conversation,' State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters during a briefing. 'We continue to stand ready to help support a seamless transition on January 20,' he added. In August 2020, China sanctioned Rubio, a longtime critic of the government in Beijing, along with others, citing what it described as 'egregious behavior' related to 'Hong Kong-related issues.' Rubio told VOA earlier in December that he is confident in his ability 'to find some solution' to engage with Beijing if confirmed. When asked if he would maintain his previous stance on foreign policy issues, Rubio said, 'The president sets foreign policy, and our job at the State [Department] will be to execute it.' Here is a look at Rubio’s past legislative actions and public statements on key China-related issues: Securing US technologies Rubio has warned that 'Communist China is the most powerful adversary the United States has faced in living memory,' in a September report titled 'The World China Made.' The report asserts that the Chinese Communist Party controls the world’s largest industrial base through 'market-distorting subsidies' and 'rampant theft.' Rubio urged a 'whole-of-society effort' by U.S. lawmakers, CEOs, and investors to 'rebuild our country, overcome the China challenge, and keep the torch of freedom lit for generations to come.' Rubio has been a vocal critic of U.S.-China research collaborations, warning that taxpayer funds have unknowingly supported Chinese military-linked experiments in areas like stealth technology, semiconductors, and cybersecurity — potentially giving Beijing a strategic edge. In July, he introduced a bill to fortify U.S. research, with key provisions including the creation of a 'TRUST' database to track high-risk Chinese research entities, stricter grant application transparency, and penalties for undisclosed foreign funding. The bill also enhances visa screening for individuals linked to adversarial foreign research and mandates stronger oversight of U.S.-China research partnerships. Rubio has advocated for the bipartisan 2021 Secure Equipment Act, a law that prohibits the U.S. government from issuing new equipment licenses to Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE that the United States and other Western countries have deemed a national security risk. Revoking China’s ‘most favored nation’ status Rubio is among the Republican lawmakers who proposed a bill to revoke China's Permanent Normal Trade Relations, or PNTR, with the United States. Commonly known as 'most favored nation' status, PNTR means that Chinese goods being imported into the United States are granted the most advantageous terms that the country offers when it applies tariffs and other restrictions. Introduced in September 2024, the Neither Permanent Nor Normal Trade Relations Act marks a shift toward a more protectionist U.S. trade strategy. The bill aims to impose higher tariffs on Chinese imports, strengthen supply chain resilience, and reduce U.S. dependence on Chinese goods. One of the key provisions includes the establishment of a trust fund using tariff revenue to compensate U.S. industries harmed by China's retaliatory trade actions, with priority support for agriculture, semiconductor, and aerospace sectors. Rubio outlined his position as early as a 2022 speech at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, calling the belief that free trade and globalization would change China 'the single biggest geopolitical blunder of the last quarter century.' 'For over two decades, China methodically undermined our economic strength by stealing our critical technology, our manufacturing capacity, and our jobs,' he argued. Monitoring China's human rights record Rubio also chaired the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, CECC, from 2017 to 2019 and continues to serve as a commissioner. The CECC was established in 2000 in response to concerns that granting PNTR to China would eliminate Congress's ability to annually review and debate China's human rights record. The commission monitors China’s compliance with international human rights standards and maintains a list of victims of human rights abuses. Rubio has criticized China’s crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, introduced bills to ban imports linked to forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and expanded sanctions on Uyghur human rights abusers. The Florida senator has also supported U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and efforts to enhance its global standing. He has met with Hong Kong’s pro-democracy activists and has been a staunch advocate for their movement. He introduced the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which was signed into law in 2019. Rubio also headed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, signed into law in 2020, which imposed sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses in Xinjiang. With the law's sanctions set to expire in 2025, Rubio introduced the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Reauthorization Act of 2024 in June, sponsored by CECC co-chair Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, to extend key provisions for another five years, ensuring continued U.S. support for the human rights of Uyghurs and other ethnic groups in China. On April 10, 2024, Rubio and Merkley introduced a resolution reaffirming the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's vibrant democracy and recognizing the 45th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act – a landmark U.S. public law that has guided U.S.-Taiwan relations since 1979. The TRA, as it is called, outlines U.S. policy to provide Taiwan with defensive arms and commits Washington to provide Taipei with the capacity to resist coercion or force that could threaten its security or economic system. Rubio has been a vocal critic of China’s increasing economic, military, and political coercion against Taiwan. He has introduced bills aimed at bolstering deterrence in the Taiwan Strait and led legislation to facilitate visits between U.S. and Taiwanese officials, such as the Taiwan Travel Act, which President Trump signed into law in 2018. The law is considered a substantial upgrade to U.S.-Taiwan relations, as it removed previous restrictions on travel for officials. The Communist Party-led People’s Republic of China has never governed Taiwan but claims sovereignty over the self-ruled democracy. China has not ruled out the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sanctioned-by-china-rubio-confident-in-engaging-beijing-as-us-top-diplomat-/7906276.html	2024-12-18T13:19:07-08:00	
Pakistani village grapples with loss after migrant boat capsizes off Greece	Washington — 'Ehtisham was the darling of the family. He was very fond of cricket. His only obsession was that one day he would go to Europe and poverty would end at home.' This is a statement from Fazlur Rehman, a close relative of 35-year-old Ehtisham Anjum, who went missing after a migrant boat he was in capsized in Greek territorial waters on Saturday. According to locals, 10 of the passengers, including Anjum, were from Helaan, a village in Pakistan’s central Punjab province. The initial list of 47 survivors released by the Pakistani embassy in Greece does not include Anjum’s name. But the family is holding out hope that he is still alive. However, according to Pakistan embassy in Greece, the rescue operation for the missing has been called off by the Greek authorities. According to the embassy in Athens, three boats carrying 175 illegal migrants of different nationalities including Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Egyptians and Sudanese crew members, capsized off the Greek coast. While all the passengers on two of the boats were rescued, only 39 out of 83 have been rescued from the third. Several teens were on board and at least one 12-year-old Pakistani was among the passengers. In a video shared with VOA, several Pakistanis give the details of their perilous journey and the poor condition of the boats ferrying them to Greece from Tobruk, Libya. One survivor of the boat that capsized said the sea was rough, and the boat was small and not in good working condition. Despite that, he said, the smugglers put many people on board, way over the boat’s capacity. That man and another said the boat hit a coast guard ship or cargo ship before it capsized. They said they were in the water for an hour and a half before being rescued. Last year more than 350 Pakistanis lost their lives when an overcrowded boat carrying hundreds of illegal migrants sank en route to Greece from Tobruk, Libya. According to Pakistan’s National Commission for Human Rights, Pakistan, 'in the year 2023 alone over 6,000 Pakistanis undertook illegal journeys to reach European shores' -- though some estimates put the number significantly higher. A report released by the commission in May of this year said most of the illegal migrants were motivated by economic concerns. Human smugglers are a big part of this journey and one of the locals in Helaan village told VOA’s Urdu service that a local agent had asked for the equivalent of $14,380 each from the clients to get them to Europe. The agent went missing after the news of the accident. Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency intensified its crackdown on human smugglers in the wake of the tragedy off Greece last year. In 2023, 189 cases were registered, leading to 854 arrests. Fazlur Rehman, the relative of Ehtisham Anjum, says four youngsters from the same village died four years ago while trying to get to Europe illegally. He adds that people are becoming greedier and will soon forget the dangers involved. This story originated in VOA’s Urdu Service, with Ehtisham Shami and Ishraq Nazir contributing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-village-grapples-with-loss-after-migrant-boat-capsizes-off-greece/7906247.html	2024-12-18T13:14:51-08:00

US Federal Reserve cuts key loan rate by quarter-point	WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate Wednesday by a quarter-point — its third cut this year — but also signaled that it expects to reduce rates more slowly next year than it previously envisioned, largely because of still-elevated inflation. The Fed’s 19 policymakers projected that they would cut their benchmark rate by a quarter-point just twice in 2025, down from their estimate in September of four rate cuts. Their new projections suggest that consumers may not enjoy much lower rates next year for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of borrowing. Fed officials have underscored that they are slowing their rate reductions as their benchmark rate nears a level that policymakers refer to as 'neutral' — the level that is thought to neither spur nor hinder the economy. Wednesday's projections suggest that the policymakers may think they are not very far from that level. Their benchmark rate stands at 4.3% after Wednesday’s move, which followed a steep half-point reduction in September and a quarter-point cut last month. This year’s Fed rate reductions have marked a reversal after more than two years of high rates, which largely helped tame inflation but also made borrowing painfully expensive for American consumers. Balancing inflation and unemployment But now, the Fed is facing a variety of challenges as it seeks to complete a 'soft landing' for the economy, whereby high rates manage to curb inflation without causing a recession. Chief among them is that inflation remains sticky: According to the Fed’s preferred gauge, annual 'core' inflation, which excludes the most volatile categories, was 2.8% in October. That is still persistently above the central bank’s 2% target. At the same time, the economy is growing briskly, which suggests that higher rates haven’t much restrained the economy. As a result, some economists — and some Fed officials — have argued that borrowing rates shouldn’t be reduced much more for fear of overheating the economy and re-igniting inflation. On the other hand, the pace of hiring has cooled significantly since 2024 began, a potential worry because one of the Fed’s mandates is to achieve maximum employment. The unemployment rate, while still low at 4.2%, has risen nearly a full percentage point in the past two years. Concern over rising unemployment contributed to the Fed’s decision in September to cut its key rate by a larger-than-usual half point. On top of that, President-elect Donald Trump has proposed a range of tax cuts — on Social Security benefits, tipped income and overtime income — as well as a scaling-back of regulations. Collectively, these moves could stimulate growth. At the same time, Trump has threatened to impose a variety of tariffs and to seek mass deportations of migrants, which could accelerate inflation. Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have said they won’t be able to assess how Trump’s policies might affect the economy or their own rate decisions until more details are made available and it becomes clearer how likely it is that the president-elect’s proposals will be enacted. Until then, the outcome of the presidential election has mostly heightened the uncertainty surrounding the economy. 'I’ve got the least amount of conviction about what will happen with the economy over the next 12 months than I’ve had in years,' said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale. 'This is going to be a work in progress as things evolve.' Projections for 2025 Such uncertainty was underscored by the quarterly economic projections the Fed issued Wednesday. The policymakers now expect overall inflation, as measured by their preferred gauge, to rise slightly from 2.3% now to 2.5% by the end of 2025. Inflation by their measure is now far below its peak of 7.2% in June 2022. Even so, the prospect of slightly higher inflation makes it harder for the Fed to reduce borrowing costs because high interest rates are its principal weapon against inflation. The officials also expect the unemployment rate to inch up by the end of next year, from 4.2% now to a still-low 4.3%. That slight increase might not be enough, by itself, to justify many more rate cuts. Most other central banks around the world are also cutting their benchmark rates. Last week, the European Central Bank lowered its key rate for the fourth time this year to 3% from 3.25%, as inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro has fallen to 2.3% from a peak of 10.6% in late 2022. The Bank of Canada also cut its rate by a quarter-point last week, as did the Bank of England last month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-federal-reserve-cuts-key-loan-rate-by-quarter-point/7906218.html	2024-12-18T12:30:09-08:00	
Future uncertain for Syria's Kurds amid potential Turkish offensive	Turkey is chief among local, regional and global powers seeking to fill the power vacuum following the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Dec. 8. Ankara is poised to be one of the biggest winners in post-Assad Syria. Despite being in a military alliance with the United States via the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Turkey’s main target in Syria is also the United States’ ally in the country — the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. For years, the SDF has worked with U.S. forces to fight Islamic State in Syria’s northeast, defeating IS in its final holdout, Baghuz, near Syria’s Iraqi border, in March 2019. Roughly 900 U.S. troops are deployed alongside Kurdish-led forces to keep IS from reestablishing a geographical foothold, and the Kurds oversee prisons housing thousands of IS fighters and their families. Yet, Turkey views the People's Defense Units, or YPG, which make up most of the SDF’s fighting force, as an extension of the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. The PKK has been engaged in an insurgency in southeast Turkey for decades, sometimes resorting to violence in its pursuit of more autonomy and rights for ethnic Kurds. Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union all view the PKK as a terrorist organization. The SDF does not deny its connections to the PKK but has said it will not engage in terror attacks on Turkish soil. On Dec. 15, Turkish National Defense Minister Yasar Guler called dismantling Kurdish forces Ankara’s 'primary issue in Syria.' 'We have expressed this to our American friends. We expect them to reassess their position [on support for the Kurds],' Guler said. That echoed earlier comment from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who on Dec. 10 said the fight against Kurdish forces in Syria, 'which threatens the security and perpetuity of both countries, will continue without any concession.' Uncertain US support for Kurds During a press conference in Aqaba, Jordan, on Dec. 14, a BBC journalist asked U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken what degree of Kurdish autonomy in Syria was acceptable to Washington. Blinken was noncommittal, saying Syria’s organization and the formation of a new state are 'decisions for Syrians to make.' Blinken said he had discussed with Turkey the importance of allowing Kurdish forces to continue fighting IS during a time of vulnerability, as Syria is in a state of transition. Ankara has responded by amassing troops on its border with Syria, with a senior U.S. official telling The Wall Street Journal on Dec. 17 that Turkey could attack Kurdish forces within hours or days. As Turkey potentially prepares for a broader assault, the future of U.S. support for the Kurds remains unclear. On Dec. 16, President-elect Donald Trump characterized the ouster of Assad as an 'unfriendly takeover' by Turkey. But during his first term, Trump sought to withdraw U.S. forces supporting the Kurds in 2018 and 2019. In November, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trumps’s pick for health secretary, said Trump wanted to remove U.S. troops from northern Syria, and not leave them there as 'cannon fodder' if fighting erupted between Turkish and Kurdish forces. Kurds 'stand to lose the most' While analysts view Turkey as one of the primary benefactors of the collapsed Assad regime, the Kurds 'stand to lose the most,' from their autonomy to the security of their communities, Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, told France 24 on Dec. 5. After Syria’s civil war erupted in 2011, Kurdish forces declared autonomy over parts of northeastern Syria in November 2103, where they form a majority. An estimated 30 million Kurds are spread across northern Iraq, western Iran, northern Syria, and make up roughly 18% of Turkey’s population. The largest ethnic group without a homeland, Kurds have long faced persecution in Syria and elsewhere. Turkey, which shares a nearly 900-kilometer border with Syria, was a long-standing opponent of the Assad regime, and a primary supporter of armed groups there, including Sunni jihadist factions. Turkey also took in roughly 3.6 million Syrian refugees, which became a source of domestic disquiet. Since 2016, Turkey has launched multiple military operations in Syria targeting the Kurds with the goal of preventing an autonomous Kurdish region being established on its border. In 2019, Turkey tried and failed to create a 30-kilometer buffer zone along its border with Syria. For years, Erdogan has signaled that his plans to establish that defensive area remain in place. Immediately after the ouster of Assad, Turkish-backed fighters swept in to take territory under SDF control as part of that plan. Syrian National Army While insurgents led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, a powerful Islamist faction, were instrumental in bringing down the Assad regime, another group with ties to Turkey — the Syrian National Army, or SNA, played a key role in that fight and will prove pivotal in shaping Syria’s future. The Turkey-backed Syrian Interim Government, an alternative government in Syria, helped establish the SNA in 2017 as part of efforts to consolidate the anti-Assad resistance. The SNA, which is trained, equipped and funded by Turkey, helped HTS recapture Syria’s second-largest city, Aleppo, from regime forces in early December. SNA is in lockstep with Ankara in its bid to crush any prospects of Kurdish autonomy in Syria. The SNA took part in Turkish-backed offensives against Kurdish forces in 2018 and 2019. Guler, the Turkish defense minister, said the YPG will be eliminated in Syria sooner or later, adding 'we and the new administration in Syria want this.' He also claimed Turkey’s problem was 'exclusively with terrorists,' and not 'our Kurdish brothers living in Iraq and Syria.' However, the United Nations, the U.S. and other Western governments also consider HTS to be a terrorist group, while acknowledging that they appear to have moderated their positions in recent years. Some groups within the SNA likewise adhere to extremist ideologies and have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department for committing grave human rights abuses in northern Syria. That has not stopped Turkey from promising aid, including military support, to the rebel-led transitional government. Despite those and other allegations leveled at Turkish and Turkish-backed forces, Erdogan on Dec. 10 claimed that Turkey has strictly observed international law 'from the very beginning of the Syrian conflict.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/future-uncertain-for-syria-kurds-amid-potential-turkish-offensive/7906014.html	2024-12-18T11:56:45-08:00	
US cyber watchdog seeks switch to encrypted apps following 'Salt Typhoon' hacks	WASHINGTON — The U.S. cybersecurity watchdog CISA is telling senior American government officials and politicians to immediately switch to end-to-end encrypted messaging following intrusions at major American telecoms blamed on Chinese hackers. In written guidance released on Wednesday, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said 'individuals who are in senior government or senior political positions' should 'immediately review and apply' a series of best practices around the use of mobile devices. The first recommendation: 'Use only end-to-end encrypted communications.' End-to-end encryption — a data protection technique that aims to make data unreadable by anyone except its sender and its recipient — is baked into various chat apps, including Meta Platforms' WhatsApp, Apple's iMessage, and the privacy-focused app Signal. Corporate offerings, which allow end-to-end encryption, also include Microsoft's Teams and Zoom Communications' meetings. CISA's message is the latest in a series of increasingly stark warnings issued by American officials in the wake of dramatic hacks of U.S. telecom companies by a group dubbed 'Salt Typhoon.' Last week, Democratic Senator Ben Ray Lujan said, 'this attack likely represents the largest telecommunications hack in our nation's history.' U.S. officials have blamed China for the hacking. Beijing routinely denies allegations of cyberespionage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-cyber-watchdog-seeks-switch-to-encrypted-apps-following-salt-typhoon-hacks-/7906048.html	2024-12-18T11:30:49-08:00	
Bird flu spillover to other species poses global health threat, experts warn	GENEVA — International human and animal health experts warn the H5N1 avian influenza is evolving quickly and posing a global health threat as the virus is increasingly crossing species barriers and infecting a wide range of domestic and wild mammals. 'These developments pose significant challenges to animal, human and environmental health,' Dr. Gregorio Torres, veterinarian and head of the science department at the World Organization for Animal Health, told journalists in Geneva Tuesday. He noted that avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has been reported in 108 countries and territories over five continents in the last three years. 'And as of December 2024, the infection has been detected in over 70 species of domestic and wild mammals. This includes the ongoing detection of H5N1 in dairy cattle in the United States,' Torres said. 'So far, the close monitoring of the virus has not found markers that could suggest effective mammalian adaptation, but we know this can change at any time,' he said. Most human cases in US The World Health Organization this week reported 76 people were infected with the H5 avian influenza viruses in 2024, most of them among farm workers. Sixty-one of these cases occurred in the United States, which has reported outbreaks in wildlife, poultry and, more recently, dairy cattle. 'This is the first time we have seen the infections from dairy cattle to humans, and so many within the U.S.' said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, director of epidemic and pandemic threat management at WHO. 'In the U.S., all but two have direct links with infected animals, whether this was working on farms, whether this was part of culling exercises,' she said. 'We have not seen any detection of human-to-human transmission among these cases.' While much attention on the bird flu situation has focused on the United States this year, Van Kerkhove noted that Australia, Cambodia, Canada, China and Vietnam also reported outbreaks. Based on available information, she said that the H5N1 viruses have remained avian viruses and have not adapted to spread among people, stressing that follow-up epidemiologic, virologic and serologic investigations 'so far have not reported or identified human-to-human transmission.' 'However, this can change quickly as the virus is evolving, which is why we are actively assessing the situation and why surveillance is so critical,' she said. 300 million birds dead Although the WHO assesses the current risk of infection for the public as low, it considers the public health risk for farm workers and others exposed to infected animals to be low-to-moderate. The WHO advises exposed groups to use personal protective equipment such as coveralls, respirator masks, eye protection, gloves and boots to minimize the risk. Since October 2021, H5N1 has caused the deaths of more than 300 million birds worldwide, affecting the livelihood of millions of people. 'In addition to the direct impact on livelihoods, the economic burden on farmers can lead to reduced investments in biosecurity measures,' said Madhur Dhingra, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization’s senior infectious diseases animal health officer. 'This increases the risk and leads to a dangerous cycle of risk, vulnerability, and loss. … In regions heavily reliant on poultry as a primary protein source, HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] poses a serious threat to food and nutrition security,' she said. 'The impacts of HPAI have spilled over into wildlife, with more than 500 bird species and over 70 mammalian species affected, including endangered animals like the California condor and polar bears,' she said. 'The biodiversity impacts, particularly among seabirds and marine mammals, and disruption of fragile ecosystems, such as the Antarctic region, are concerning.' Health experts agree that increased surveillance and close monitoring of the evolution of the H5N1 virus are essential to prevent the disease from spreading widely around the world. 'We are in an interpandemic period right now where we have a number of different zoonotic viruses, with avian influenza, H5N1 one of several,' Van Kerkhove said. 'While we are operating in a state of readiness, I think the world is not ready for another infectious disease, massive outbreak or pandemic because we have lived through COVID and it was incredibly traumatic, and it is still ongoing. 'We are recommending to our member states and national authorities to increase surveillance and vigilance in human populations, especially those who are occupationally exposed, for the possibility for infection, and, of course, doing thorough investigations around each and every human case,' she said. In the meantime, she advised people to minimize their risk of becoming sick from bird flu by carefully watching what they eat and drink. 'Cows infected with the H5N1 virus have been reported to have high viral loads in their milk,' she said, so, it is advisable that people 'consume pasteurized milk.' 'If pasteurized milk is not available, heating milk until it boils also makes it safe for consumption. Similarly, we recommend thoroughly cooking meat and eggs when in areas affected by avian flu outbreaks,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bird-flu-spillover-to-other-species-poses-global-health-threat-experts-warn/7906070.html	2024-12-18T11:28:40-08:00

This is a standard litigation play at the end of one administration, with a petitioner hoping that the next administration will provide a stay of execution. This court should no more countenance it coming from foreign adversaries than it does from hardened criminals.' McConnell noted Congress set the January 19 date that 'very clearly removes any possible political uncertainty in the execution of the law by cabining it to an administration that was deeply supportive of the bill’s goals.' TikTok did not immediately comment. The company noted in legal filings that President-elect Donald Trump has said he does not want TikTok banned. The American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation and Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University in a joint filing urged the court to block a ban of TikTok 'that millions use every day to communicate, learn about the world, and express themselves.' The groups called the ban unprecedented, adding it 'will cause an extraordinary disruption in Americans’ ability to engage.' New downloads of TikTok on Apple or Google app stores would be banned but existing users could continue to access TikTok but services would degrade over time and eventually stop working as companies will be barred from providing support. TikTok said in a court filing this week it estimates one-third of the 170 million Americans using TikTok would stop accessing the app if the ban lasts a month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-us-senate-republican-urges-supreme-court-to-reject-tiktok-appeal/7906013.html	2024-12-18T10:52:39-08:00	
US repatriates 3 Guantanamo detainees, one held 17 years without charge	WASHINGTON — The United States has transferred two Malaysian detainees at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. military prison to their home country after they pleaded guilty to charges related to deadly 2002 bombings in Bali and agreed to testify against the alleged ringleader of that and other attacks, the Pentagon said Wednesday. Prosecutors say Mohammed Farik bin Amin and Mohammed Nazir bin Lep worked for years with Encep Nurjaman, known as Hambali, an Indonesian leader of al-Qaida affiliate Jemaah Islamiyah. That includes helping Nurjaman escape after bombings on Oct. 12, 2002, killed 202 people at two nightspots in Bali, U.S. officials said. The two men entered guilty pleas to conspiracy and other charges in January. Their transfer comes after they provided testimony that prosecutors plan to use against Nurjaman, the alleged mastermind, the Pentagon said in a statement. Nurjaman is in custody in Guantanamo awaiting resumption of pretrial hearings in January involving the Bali bombings and other attacks. The two Malaysian men's transfers leave 27 detainees in custody at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay. Then-President George W. Bush set up a military tribunal and prison after the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks on the United States. At its peak, Guantanamo detained hundreds of men, most of them Muslim, in the U.S.-led global war on terrorism after the attacks. Just two of the men at Guantanamo are serving sentences. U.S. prosecution of seven others currently facing charges has been slowed by legal obstacles — including those presented by the torture of the men in their first years under CIA custody — and logistical difficulties. Kenyan held 17 years On Tuesday, U.S. authorities repatriated a Kenyan man, Mohammed Abdul Malik Bajabu, after 17 years at Guantanamo without charge. His release leaves 15 other never-charged men awaiting release. The U.S. is searching for suitable and stable countries willing to take them. Many are from Yemen, a country split by war and dominated by an Iranian-allied militant group. Amnesty International urged President Joe Biden to end the detention of those never-charged men before he leaves office. If not, the rights group said in a statement, 'he will continue to bear responsibility for the abhorrent practice of indefinite detention without charge or trial by the U.S. government.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-repatriates-3-guantanamo-detainees-one-held-17-years-without-charge/7905849.html	2024-12-18T09:01:42-08:00

Kenyan president strongly defends animal vaccination program	NAIROBI, KENYA — Kenya's president said Tuesday that a mass livestock vaccination campaign will continue despite fears of some herders and farmers that the inoculations will somehow hurt their animals. Kenyan President William Ruto lashed out at those objecting to a Ministry of Agriculture livestock vaccination program, which the ministry says is aimed at blocking the spread of several diseases and making the livestock meet international standards. Critics have questioned the effectiveness of the vaccines, and some livestock farmers expressed concern — not backed by any evidence — that the vaccine program is meant to sabotage their herds. Patrick Torome, a livestock farmer in the Rift Valley region of Kenya, said he will not allow his animals to be inoculated. 'I will not vaccinate my animals because maybe I will be compromising the quality of my cows,' he said. 'We don't know whether someone is trying to introduce a virus to the animals. So, the rich will be able to afford the cure but the poor maybe will not be able, so people will introduce poverty in Africa.' Ruto, speaking at a goat auction in Baringo County, said the vaccinations will help Kenyan farmers make money — and was critical of those who oppose them. 'I want to promise the people of Kenya that we are going to carry out this vaccination because our farmers deserve improved earnings,' he said. 'I want to ask leaders who have no knowledge, who have no understanding, who have no plan, to spare us their ignorance.' According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, the vaccination drive targets 22 million cattle and 50 million sheep and goats. The ministry has assured animal owners the vaccines are safe and are produced locally. Ruto said those against the vaccination of animals are preventing livestock owners from accessing international markets for their products. 'Vaccination is about disease control. … You cannot use disinformation and fake news to deny the people of Kenya international markets by discouraging disease control in Kenya,' he said. Anthrax, foot and mouth disease, rift valley fever, African swine fever and rinderpest are some of the diseases that affect livestock in Kenya. According to the World Health Organization, animal vaccination helps prevent and control the spread of the diseases. The Ministry of Agriculture says so far, only 10% of animals have been vaccinated. It says the vaccination rate needs to rise to 85% to make livestock products eligible for export. Some farmers and experts have blamed the government for the low uptake of vaccines, saying it failed to provide a clear message and allowed politicians to assume the roles of experts and veterinarians, which has fueled the false message about vaccines.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-president-strongly-defends-animal-vaccination-program/7905837.html	2024-12-18T08:51:52-08:00	
Pentagon: Chinese military saw ‘new wave’ of corruption with senior leaders	PENTAGON — A Pentagon report says the Chinese military experienced 'a new wave' of corruption among its senior leaders last year that may have disrupted progress toward its military modernization goals, even as China ratcheted up aggression toward Taiwan and the Philippines. The U.S. Department of Defense’s annual China Military Power report released Wednesday says at least 15 high-ranking military officers and defense-industry executives were removed from their posts between July and December 2023. Several of the leaders who were investigated and removed for corruption had overseen projects related to modernizing Chinese ground-based nuclear and conventional missiles. 'I think it’s (the corruption is) having some impact already,' said a senior defense official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity based on ground rules set by the Pentagon. Corruption in the military is not new, but it seeped into the top military leadership when Chinese Minister of National Defense Li Shangfu was removed from office in late October last year. Li led the Central Military Commission Equipment Development Department from 2017 to 2022, where he would have signed off on all People's Liberation Army, PLA, weapons acquisitions, before serving as defense minister. China’s military goals include completing a modernization by 2035 and becoming a 'world-class' military by the end of 2049. It also has set a 2027 goal as a short-term marker to make sure its modernization plans continue to progress. In 2027, the PLA will mark the 100th anniversary of its founding. The report calls Chinese progress toward its stated 2027 capability milestone 'uneven' without explicitly saying whether the Chinese military has been backsliding. 'We certainly do highlight and take very seriously the progress they're making in a number of the areas that we noted in the report, and at the same time, we try to take note of those areas in which they've demonstrated some shortcomings,' the official added. Despite China’s shrinking economy, Beijing’s defense spending was estimated at 40% to 90% more than it announced in its public defense budget, which equates to $330 billion to $450 billion in total defense spending for 2024. Chinese nuclear and missile capabilities China had more than 600 operational nuclear warheads in its stockpile as of mid-2024, according to the report, and will have more than 1,000 of these warheads by 2030. The arsenal’s growth is consistent with last year’s estimates. The United States maintains about 1,550 active warheads, based on treaty agreements, but its nuclear arsenal and infrastructure is aging. The Pentagon plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade to update and replace it. In addition, the report says, China is developing new intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that will significantly improve its nuclear-capable missile forces, and it may also be exploring the development of conventionally armed intercontinental-range missile systems. 'If developed and fielded, such capabilities would enable the PRC to threaten conventional strikes against targets in the continental United States, Hawaii and Alaska,' the report said, using the abbreviation for China's formal name, the People's Republic of China. The PRC continues to maintain the world’s leading hypersonic missile arsenal. Hypersonic weapons fly at five times the speed of sound and can maneuver and change trajectories during their glide phase, making them more difficult to defend against than ballistic missiles, which also fly at hypersonic speed but travel along a set trajectory. PLA navy The Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong (CV-17) carried out three deployments to the Philippine Sea in 2023, a record number for a Chinese carrier in a calendar year, according to the report. The PLA navy also carried out the first extended area deployment of its new Yushen-class amphibious assault ship. The deployments show the PLA navy has continued to grow its ability to conduct missions beyond the first island chain that includes Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia and portions of the Philippines. However, the senior official stressed, while the PLA has demonstrated some limited joint operational capabilities beyond the first island chain, its navy’s overseas activities in general lack inclusion from its army or air force and do not involve combat operations. China has the largest navy in the world, based on the number of ships in its fleet, but its numbers remained consistent to last year’s assessment. The Chinese have more than 370 ships and submarines, with more than 140 of those considered major surface vessels. In terms of producing military ships, maritime weapons and electronic systems, the report says, the Chinese defense industry is 'nearly self-sufficient for all shipbuilding needs.' Taiwan and the Philippines Increased Chinese military pressure against Taiwan 'continued to erode long-standing norms in and around' the democratic island in 2023, according to the report. Beijing has stated it wants to be ready to control the island by 2027, by force if necessary. China maintains a naval presence around Taiwan, and it has increased crossings into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone and conducted major military exercises nearby. This month, China massed dozens of navy and coast guard vessels in what appeared to be the largest maritime exercises targeting Taiwan since the 1990s. This week alone, China sent several military aircraft toward Taiwan, with four of the aircraft crossing the middle line of the Taiwan Strait that forms an unofficial border between the sides, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry. Despite this increasingly aggressive behavior, the senior defense official told reporters that conflict with China over Taiwan was not 'imminent or inevitable.' 'We think that we have deterrence today that's real and strong. We're doing a lot to try to keep it that way,' the official told reporters. Tensions with the Philippines were also 'notably higher' last year, the report said. Chinese maritime vessels have used water cannon against Philippine vessels and even rammed into vessels that were trying to resupply the Second Thomas Shoal. Since late 2023, however, the Chinese military has reduced the number of risky air intercepts of American military aircraft, according to the report, while continuing 'unsafe maneuvers' near allied forces in the region. The shift in behavior toward the U.S. military appeared to coincide with diplomatic developments: President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to resume military-to-military communication in late 2023. Bradley Bowman, the senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, warned that China’s aggressive posture toward Taiwan and the Philippines is likely to continue until the United States and its allies shift Beijing’s cost-benefit analysis. 'Any reduction in direct aggressive activity toward the United States is a temporary measure and should not be misinterpreted as a fundamental change in Beijing’s grand strategy or hostility toward the United States and its interests,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-chinese-military-saw-new-wave-of-corruption-with-senior-leaders/7905760.html	2024-12-18T08:07:53-08:00	
Sewage-polluted lake water kills rhinos, other wildlife in Zimbabwe	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — A Zimbabwean national park is hosting relocated wildlife from a game park just outside the country's capital after an autopsy report on Saturday confirmed that four rhinos and several other animals died after drinking contaminated lake water. Tinashe Farawo, the spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, confirmed to VOA the death of four rhinos after drinking bacteria-polluted water at Lake Chivero Recreational Park, about 20 kilometers west of the capital, Harare. 'We are not only losing the rhinos, but [we] also lost some zebras, wildebeest and some birds,' Farawo said. 'We have tried to treat some of the rhinos, but unfortunately it seems like we are not managing at the moment. But we have made some temporary collective measures to make sure we do the best we can with this challenge,' he said, referring to the temporary transfer of wildlife away from the lake. 'We need to continue to make sure that at least we deal with the issue of pollution around Lake Chivero,' Farawo said. Amkela Sidange, spokesperson for the Environmental Management Agency of Zimbabwe, said that, nationwide, about 415 megaliters of untreated sewage are being discharged into the environment daily. The 'city of Harare on its own ... contributes about 219 megaliters of raw and partly treated sewer that is discharged into the environment on a daily basis, and that goes to show how huge the crisis is,' she said. 'We need the whole of government and societal approach,' Sidange said, adding that temporary solutions aren’t getting the job done. Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume said he is counting on the central government to provide money to help the city provide proper sewer services, especially for those who live in 'informal settlements.' 'We have over 150,000 informal settlements, and these informal settlements do not have sewer reticulation systems,' he said. 'Therefore, their discharge is going straight into our water bodies.' While the bickering continues among high-ranking officials about who is polluting Harare water with cyanobacteria, Farai Maguwu, director of the Center for Natural Resource Governance, is worried about the residents of Zimbabwe’s capital. 'There is a need to carry out scientific investigations about the water that is pumped into people’s homes by Harare city council and see if that water is still safe for drinking and inform the citizens of Harare accordingly,' Maguwu said. On Tuesday, Mafume declared that Harare’s water was still meeting the World Health Organization’s standards and was safe for drinking. The city council provides bottled water during its meetings and, for years now, many residents of Harare drink bottled water and water from boreholes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sewage-polluted-lake-water-kills-rhinos-other-wildlife-in-zimbabwe/7905685.html	2024-12-18T07:21:12-08:00	
Analysts: Syrian rebels adopt approach similar to Taliban's to seek international recognition	Washington — While the international community is setting conditions for the new rulers in Syria, the leading rebel group has taken a conciliatory approach, similar to one the Taliban adopted in Afghanistan, to seek international recognition, say analysts. Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, met with the U.N. special envoy for Syria on Sunday and emphasized 'rapid and effective cooperation' to rebuild Syria's economy and maintain its territorial integrity. In an interview with The Times of London, al-Jolani said that Syrian soil will not be used against any neighboring country, including Israel. Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the Washington-based U.S. Institute of Peace, told VOA that HTS presented 'a conciliatory message,' similar to the one the Taliban presented after seizing power in 2021, by 'positioning itself in regional politics in a way that would not provoke regional countries [and global powers] against them.' After seizing power in August 2021, the Taliban tried to assure the neighboring countries and regional powers that the group would not allow anyone to use Afghanistan as a launchpad against any country. But the U.N. said in July that while the Taliban claims there are no foreign terrorist groups in Afghanistan, member states reported more than two dozen terrorist groups were operating inside the country. He added that HTS learned from its own experience, and also from observing the Taliban, to avoid making enemies overseas 'by signaling and trying to assure them that look, we don't have any beef with you,' Mir said. Mir said the global and regional powers have relatively moderate aims when dealing with the rebels in Syria, 'but they are going to spend time watching HTS.' Syrian rebels, led by HTS, started an offensive against former President Bashar al-Assad's forces on November 27 in the northern Idlib province and, after capturing some strategic cities, seized control of the capital, Damascus, in 11 days. The U.S. welcomed the rebels' 'hopeful' statements but said that 'we're going to judge them by their actions.' 'We're going to make our decisions when it comes to sanction posture, when it comes to recognition, posture, when it comes to all the tools in our toolbox, based on what we see from HTS and other actors on the ground here,' Mathew Miller, the spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said Monday in response to a question from VOA. A top EU diplomat said Sunday the European Union would not lift sanctions on Syria before its new rulers provide guarantees to safeguard minorities and women's rights and disavow terrorism. The international community demanded similar guarantees from the Taliban after the group seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021. The international community urged that the Taliban honor their commitments to counter terrorism, form an inclusive government and respect human rights, particularly women's rights, before they were recognized as a legitimate government of Afghanistan. No country has yet formally recognized the Taliban, though many countries have established diplomatic relations with the Taliban government. Colin Clarke, the director of research at The Soufan Group, told VOA that the U.S. policy toward Syria is shaped by its experience in Afghanistan. 'I think that informs a lot of what they do in terms of foreign policy,' said Clarke. He said there are 'a lot of similarities' between how the Taliban and HTS present themselves. 'Being more pragmatic, being more moderate, distancing themselves from more hardcore Jihadist ideology,' he added. larke said the question, though, is whether HTS would remain moderate. He said concerns exist about hardcore foreign militants, particularly those from Central Asia, within the rebel groups. 'They may defect and either split off their own, or they may want to go and join other groups like IS because they may see this whole governing project as a fool's errand,' he added. The U.N., the U.S., Turkey, and many other countries have designated HTS as a terrorist organization. HTS is 'a coalition of northern Syria-based Sunni Islamist insurgent groups that evolved from Jabhat al-Nusrah, or 'Nusrah Front,' al-Qaida's former branch in Syria,' says the website of the National Counterterrorism Center, the U.S. agency with primary responsibility for analyzing and integrating information on international terrorism. In 2013, the U.S. State Department designated al-Sharaa as a global terrorist, and the U.S. offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to his arrest. Though the Taliban are not designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. State Department, the Haqqani Network, now part of the Taliban's government, is among the U.S.-designated terrorist groups. Clarke said he thinks the Syrian rebels will be recognized sooner than the Taliban because they represent 'a newer phenomenon, and they don't have as many skeletons in the closet at this point.' Merissa Khurma, director of the Middle East Program at the Washington-based Wilson Center think tank, said it is 'very difficult' to compare the Syrian rebels to the Taliban. 'With Syria, it was freeing the Syrian people from a brutal regime. With Afghanistan, it was essentially the return of a brutal regime to power,' said Khurma. But, she said, in both cases the governments these groups fought against suffered from 'low morale.' 'It does showcase that both systems were already eroding,' she said.

Chadian election officials ask military for protection ahead of vote	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Chad's electoral commission has asked the central African state’s military to help protect election officials and candidates amid a spike in attacks ahead of Dec. 29 elections. Witnesses say opposition supporters have used clubs and iron bars to prevent the ruling MPS party from holding rallies in several cities and towns. The National Election Management Agency in Chad, known as ANGE, said campaigning for the parliamentary, local council and regional elections has been plagued by attempts to disrupt rallies and attacks on candidates and elections officials. Chadian officials say the elections will mark an end to the central African state’s three-year 'transitional period' following the April 2021 death of longtime President Idriss Deby Itno. ANGE Vice President Assane Bairra said ongoing tensions may worsen into armed conflicts if Chad's military fails to deploy troops. ANGE reported that more than 8.3 million of Chad's 18 million civilians have registered to vote. About 180 political parties have put forward nearly 1,300 candidates to compete in the country's parliamentary elections, with several thousand others taking part in local council and provincial elections, according to Chad's government. More than 1,000 election observers have been accredited for the polls. However, a coalition of over 75 opposition parties and civil society groups describe the planned polls as a 'masquerade,' saying that Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno and his Patriotic Salvation Movement, or MPS, are planning to use the polls to consolidate their grip on power. Opposition and civil society groups said their supporters this week used clubs and iron bars to attack MPS campaign caravans in several towns, including Ndjamena, Bongor, Abeche, Lai and Moundou. In other areas, the military said, it has dismantled roadblocks set up by opposition parties to prevent MPS campaigners from entering towns. Avocksouma Djona, president of Chad's Party of Democrats, said his supporters have been blocking campaigners from both MPS and the opposition from holding election rallies. He said his party wants elections to be postponed because all the officials of Chad's elections management body were appointed by Deby. He also said Deby controls Chad's constitutional court and has instructed the court to declare his party victorious in all elections. ANGE organizes elections and declares provisional results. The country's constitutional court declares final results. Deby appoints officials to both institutions. Deby told state TV this week that elections for Chad to fully return to civilian rule will be fair and transparent. Opposition groups quickly dismissed that claim, saying the Chadian leader wants to rig the polls to ensure control of parliament. Deby became Chad's transitional president in April 2021 after his father, Idriss Deby Itno, was killed in a gun battle with rebels following 30 years in power. He promised an 18-month transition to civilian rule but extended it by two years. Deby won Chad's contested May 6 presidential polls, which many opposition parties boycotted, asserting that Deby wanted at all costs to continue his late father's rule.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chadian-election-officials-ask-military-for-protection-ahead-of-vote/7905643.html	2024-12-18T06:37:00-08:00

Saadi Ahmed Pira, PUK spokesman, dismissed the reports as politically motivated, emphasizing that Sulaymaniyah is not geographically accessible from Syria. 'Sulaymaniyah airport has no direct flights to Damascus, and the city is not located on the sea, so it is unclear how someone from Syria could even reach Sulaymaniyah,' Pira said.

Xi Jinping visits Macau to mark 25 years of Chinese rule	MACAU — China's President Xi Jinping arrived in Macau on Wednesday to mark a quarter century of Beijing's rule over the former Portuguese enclave, and is likely during his three-day visit to urge further diversification from its casino industry. Xi's trip to the world's biggest gambling hub is his third as president, during which he will attend the inauguration of the territory's new chief executive, elected in October. Xi last visited in 2019 when anti-government protests were rocking the neighboring financial hub of Hong Kong. A special administrative region of China, Macau is the only place in the country where gambling is legal, and its economy is heavily dependent on the casino industry, which contributes about 80% of regional tax revenue. Located on China's southern coast, Macau returned to Chinese rule on December 20, 1999, governed under the same 'one country, two systems' formula as Hong Kong. Beijing has consistently praised Macau for its loyalty and stability, with more than half of its 700,000 population immigrating from China in recent decades. The city was on high security ahead of Xi's arrival on Wednesday, with several roads closed and Macau's light rapid transit operator announcing the temporary closure of a key section. Xi, who was greeted at Macau's airport by dozens of cheering school children waving yellow and red flowers and lion dancers, said Macau was the 'jewel of the motherland.' 'I have always been concerned about the development of this place and the well-being of all its residents,' he told the crowd, which included senior government officials and Macau's current leader Ho Iat Seng. 'In the next few days, I will take a walk, have a look, and have extensive and in-depth exchanges with friends from all walks of life to discuss Macau's development plans.' Since he took office in 2013, Xi has called for the Macanese economy's 'appropriate diversification and sustainable development,' including casinos and the flow of funds across borders within a sweeping anti-corruption drive. The move has throttled gambling revenues from the high roller VIP sector. On Thursday, Xi is scheduled to attend a banquet dinner and cultural performance at the Macau Dome, located alongside Macau's Las Vegas-style Cotai strip, according to the city's government. On Friday, he will attend the anniversary ceremony and the inauguration of Chief Executive Sam Hou Fai, 62, who was born in China's southern Guangdong province and speaks fluent Portuguese. Sam, head of Macau's highest court since 1999, will become the first city leader to be born and raised in mainland China. He was the only candidate given permission by a panel of 400 pro-China loyalists to run in Macau's election. In December, Sam unveiled his team of officials to govern Macau for the next five years.

Sam has vowed to improve residents' livelihoods and develop non-gaming industries once he takes charge on Friday. He said Macau will also develop its role as a conduit between Chinese and Portuguese-speaking countries and its collaboration with other southern Chinese cities in the Greater Bay Area. At Beijing's directive, last year Macau's government rolled out its first economic blueprint centered on a strategy envisaging tourism and leisure as the main pillars.

Gaza medics say Israeli strikes kill at least 12	Medics said Wednesday that Israeli airstrikes killed at least 12 people in the Gaza Strip. The strikes included one in the town of Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, that killed at least 10 people, the medics said. Other Israeli strikes hit central Gaza and the Rafah area in the southern part of the Palestinian enclave. The continued violence came amid a fresh push to secure a ceasefire agreement between Israel and the militant group Hamas that would include the release of hostages still being held by militants in Gaza. Israeli officials in recent days have cited optimism about a potential breakthrough in the long-stalled negotiations, while Hamas said Tuesday it believes a deal is possible if Israel does not add new conditions. The United States, Egypt and Qatar have worked for months to try to broker an agreement. The Gaza conflict began with Hamas militants attacking southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 hostage. About 100 hostages are still being held, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 people, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and fighters in its count but has previously said more than half of those killed have been women and children. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and others. Some information for this story was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-medics-say-israeli-strikes-kill-at-least-12/7905419.html	2024-12-18T02:16:32-08:00	
G20 watchdog urges governments to address non-bank financial risks	ZURICH — The Financial Stability Board (FSB) on Wednesday pitched recommendations for governments to reduce risks around hedge funds, insurers and other non-bank financial intermediaries, which now account for almost half of global financial assets. The sector of non-bank financial intermediation has grown by around 130% between 2009 and 2023, making markets more vulnerable for stress events, according to the Basel-based FSB, which acts as the G20's financial risk watchdog. 'This growth comes with an increase in complexity and interconnectedness in the financial system, which, if not properly managed, can pose substantial risks to financial stability,' said FSB Secretary-General John Schindler. In its consultation report, the FSB proposed member governments and institutions enhance their focus on non-banks and ensure they manage their credit risks adequately. One set of recommendations calls for the creation of domestic frameworks to identify and monitor financial stability risks related to non-bank leverage. Another group proposes that policy measures be selected, designed and calibrated by governments to mitigate the identified financial stability risks. A third group deals with counterparty credit risk management, calling for a timely and thorough implementation of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's revised guidelines. The FSB also proposed stepping up private disclosure practices in the non-bank sector and addressing any regulatory inconsistencies by adopting the principle of 'same risk, same regulatory treatment.' A last recommendation calls for improved cross-border cooperation and collaboration. With the consultation report, the FSB is inviting comments from member governments and institutions on its policy recommendations. A final report is planned for release in mid-2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/g20-watchdog-urges-governments-to-address-non-bank-financial-risks/7905414.html	2024-12-18T02:07:41-08:00	
Rescuers dig for survivors of Vanuatu earthquake with no water and unclear death toll	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Vanuatu's capital was without water on Wednesday, a day after reservoirs were destroyed by a violent magnitude 7.3 earthquake that wrought havoc on the South Pacific island nation, with the number of people killed and injured expected to rise. The government's disaster management office said early Wednesday that 14 deaths were confirmed, but hours later said nine had been verified by the main hospital. The number was 'expected to increase' as people remained trapped in fallen buildings, a spokesperson said. About 200 have been treated for injuries. Frantic rescue efforts that began at flattened buildings after the quake hit early Tuesday afternoon, continued 30 hours later, with dozens working in dust and heat with little water to seek those yelling for help from inside. A few more survivors were extracted from the rubble of downtown buildings in Port Vila, also the country's largest city, while others remained trapped and some were found dead. A near-total telecommunications collapse meant people struggled to confirm their relatives' safety. Some providers began Wednesday to reestablish phone service but connections were patchy. Internet service had not been restored because the submarine cable supplying it was damaged, the operator said. The earthquake hit at a depth of 57 kilometers and was centered 30 kilometers west of the capital of Vanuatu, a group of 80 islands home to about 330,000 people. A tsunami warning was called off less than two hours after the quake, but dozens of large aftershocks continued to rattle the country. The Asia-Pacific head of the International Federation of Red Cross, Katie Greenwood, speaking to The Associated Press from Fiji, said it was not clear how many people were still missing or killed. 'We have anecdotal information coming from people at the search and rescue site that are fairly confident that unfortunately those numbers will rise,' she said. The capital’s main medical facility, Vila Central Hospital, was badly damaged and patients were moved to a military camp. Clement Chipokolo, Vanuatu country director at the Christian relief agency World Vision, said health care services, already strained before the quake, were overwhelmed. No water in Port Vila While power was out in swathes of Port Vila, the biggest fear among aid agencies was the lack of water. Two large reservoirs serving the capital were totally decimated, the National Disaster Management Office said. Resident Milroy Cainton said people were joining large queues to buy water in stores, but could only purchase two or four bottles at a time. 'People are not really concerned about electricity. They're just concerned about water,' he said. UNICEF was recording a rise in diarrhea among children, a sign that they had begun to drink tainted water, said the chief of the Vanuatu office, Eric Durpaire. Officials told residents of areas where water had been restored to boil it. Some people remain trapped under the rubble At least 10 buildings sustained major damage, many in a busy downtown area full of lunchtime shoppers when the quake hit. An unknown number of people were trapped inside, and Cainton, the resident, said rescuers had been forced to target their efforts to where they believed people could be saved. Michael Thompson, who runs a tourism business in Vanuatu, was among the rescuers and posted a video on Facebook of the frenzied efforts and dust-covered survivors on gurneys along with pleas for people to bring tools and water to the site. Officials said Wednesday night that Port Vila appeared to be the worst-hit area, but some nearby villages and offshore islands had experienced landslides. Three bridges were 'at high risk of collapse' in heavy rain, the government said. Embassies are damaged A building housing a number of diplomatic missions in Port Vila — including those of the United States, Britain, France and New Zealand — was destroyed, with a section of the building cleaving off and flattening the first floor. Windows were buckled and walls crumbled. The U.S. State Department said its embassy staff were safe, but the building was no longer functional. The office opened in July as part of a push by the U.S. to expand its Pacific presence to counter China’s influence in the region. New Zealand’s foreign ministry said officials have accounted for all embassy staff. Australia’s foreign ministry said its workers were safe. All flights grounded Damage to the seaport and airport is likely to hamper aid efforts and economic recovery in a country dependent on agricultural exports and tourism. The airport was closed to commercial flights for a further 72 hours from Wednesday. But the runway was deemed functional for humanitarian flights by French engineers, who arrived by helicopter. Military craft from Australia and New Zealand were due to begin arriving Wednesday night, carrying search and rescue personnel and equipment, as well as relief supplies. Dan McGarry, a journalist living in Vanuatu, said there had been a 'massive landslide' at the international shipping terminal. The government said the main wharf was closed. Vanuatu’s position on a subduction zone — where the Indo-Australian tectonic plate moves beneath the Pacific Plate — means earthquakes of greater than magnitude 6 are not uncommon, and the country’s buildings are intended to withstand quake damage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rescuers-dig-for-survivors-of-vanuatu-earthquake-with-no-water-and-unclear-death-toll/7905409.html	2024-12-18T01:50:07-08:00	
Nissan, Honda confirm talks on closer collaboration but say there's been no decision on a merger	BANGKOK — Japanese automakers Nissan Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. confirmed Wednesday that they are discussing closer collaboration but denied reports they have decided on a merger. Nissan’s share price soared more than 22% in Tokyo after reports citing unnamed sources said it might merge with Honda to form the world’s third-largest automaking group. Honda’s share price fell as much as 3%. The reports said that Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. was included in the talks. All three Japanese automakers announced in August that they planned to share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March. Trading in Nissan’s shares was suspended but then resumed after the companies jointly issued a statement saying they were 'considering various possibilities for future collaboration, but no decisions have been made.' A merger could result in a behemoth worth about $55 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Joining forces would help the two companies gain larger scale to compete with Japan's market leader Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany’s Volkswagen AG. Nissan has an alliance with Renault SA that is under review. Last month, it said it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of $61 million. Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes. He said Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes. Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China. The ascent of Chinese automakers is shaking up the industry at a time when manufacturers are struggling to shift from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electrics. Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4.2 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger, Toyota would remain the biggest Japanese automaker.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nissan-honda-confirm-talks-on-closer-collaboration-but-say-there-s-been-no-decision-on-a-merger/7905398.html	2024-12-18T01:06:11-08:00	
Community members wrestle with grief in aftermath of Wisconsin school shooting	MADISON, Wis. — Community members in Wisconsin continued to wrestle with grief and called for change in the aftermath of a school shooting that killed a teacher and a student and wounded six others. Several hundred people gathered outside the Wisconsin State Capitol for a vigil Tuesday night to honor those slain at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison the day before, with some passing candles to each other and standing close against the winter chill. Among those in attendance was Naomi Allen, 16, who was in a nearby classroom Monday when a 15-year-old girl attacked people in a study hall before fatally shooting herself. 'It’s doesn’t matter who you are or where you are, something like this could happen. There’s nothing that is going to exempt someone,' Allen said at the vigil. Allen's father, Jay Allen, reflected on the dangers students face these days. 'When I was in school these things never happened,' he said. 'This country at some point needs to take mental health seriously and we need to pour resources into it. We really need some changes in the way we handle that issue.' The motive for the shooting appears to be a 'combination of factors,' Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said Tuesday as he appealed to the public to call in to a tip line and share what they might know about the shooter. He offered no details about what that motive might be, though he said bullying at Abundant Life Christian School would be investigated. He also said police are investigating writings that may have been penned by the shooter, Natalie Rupnow, and could shed light on her actions. 'Identifying a motive is our top priority, but at this time it appears that the motive is a combination of factors,' Barnes told reporters. Two students among the six people wounded Monday remain in critical condition. Officials have declined to disclose the names of the victims. 'Leave them alone,' Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said. The school shooting was the latest among dozens across the U.S. in recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown, Connecticut; Parkland, Florida; and Uvalde, Texas. The shootings have set off fervent debates about gun control and frayed the nerves of parents whose children are growing up accustomed to doing active shooter drills in their classrooms. But school shootings have done little to move the needle on national gun laws. School shootings by teenage females have been extremely rare in U.S. history, with males in their teens and 20s carrying out the majority of them, said David Riedman, founder of the K-12 School Shooting Database. Abundant Life is a nondenominational Christian school — prekindergarten through high school — with approximately 420 students. Barbara Wiers, the school's director of elementary and school relations, said the school does not have metal detectors but uses cameras and other security measures. Barnes said police were talking with the shooter’s father and other family members, who were cooperating, and searching the shooter's home. The shooter's parents, who are divorced, jointly shared custody of their child, but the shooter primarily lived with her 42-year-old father, according to court documents. Investigators believe the shooter used a 9mm pistol, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation. Madison resident Cristian Cuahutepitzi said he attended Tuesday's vigil to let the families of the victims know 'we're thinking of them.' He said his uncle's two daughters go to the school. 'They're still a little bit shook,' he said. Joe Gothard, the superintendent of the Madison Metropolitan School District, said at the vigil that the tragedy happened less than two blocks away from his childhood home. He said it wasn't enough to say the district would work on safety. 'We need to connect like we are tonight, each and every day and make a commitment that we know we’re there for one another, hopefully to avoid preventable tragedies like yesterday,' he said. A prayer service was also held Tuesday night at City Church Madison, which is affiliated with the school. Several teachers from the school prayed aloud one by one during the service, speaking into a microphone and standing in a line. One middle school teacher asked for courage, while another sought help quieting her own soul. 'God, this isn’t a Abundant Life Christian School tragedy,' said Derrick Wright, the youth pastor at the church. 'This is a community tragedy. This is a nation tragedy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/community-members-wrestle-with-grief-in-aftermath-of-wisconsin-school-shooting-/7905395.html	2024-12-18T00:54:48-08:00	
Top creditor China has not approved any loans to Cambodia so far this year, data shows	China has not approved any new loans to Cambodia in the first nine months of 2024, Cambodian finance ministry data shows, even though it has been Cambodia's top creditor country in recent years. The reduction in funding may signal China's more cautious approach to investment in Cambodia after a series of so-far unsuccessful infrastructure projects in the Southeast Asian country. China accounts for more than a third of the country's $11.6 billion in outstanding debt, Cambodian government data shows. But no new loan was signed from January to September this year after lending of nearly $212 million over the same period last year, the data shows. A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry did not respond to a question about loans but said on December 11 that 'China and Cambodia are iron-clad friends. We will continue to strengthen cooperation with Cambodia and support Cambodia in promoting development and improving people's livelihood.' Meas Soksensan, a spokesman for Cambodia's finance ministry, did not reply to a request for comment for this article. However, in a Facebook post on Sunday to counter what he said was information he had seen on social media about China-Cambodia relations, he wrote: 'I find laughable the information that was shared that China stops providing loans.' 'We have a lot of projects that the countries will review and will sign agreements of financing, including grants and other concessional loans,' he said. He did not comment about data published by the finance ministry about lending so far this year. Overall lending to Cambodia was not affected by China's lack of funding, as other creditors have stepped in with loans totaling around $1 billion, almost as much as was lent to the country in the first nine months of last year. The World Bank has signed loans worth $564 million so far this year, making it Cambodia's top lender for 2024, followed by Japan with $262 million. Last year, China was Cambodia' top lender among partner countries, providing more than $300 million for the full year. Only the World Bank did more last year, with signed loans worth half a billion dollars, according to official data. In 2022, Beijing topped the overall list of lenders with $567 million in signed loans, followed by Japan and the Asian Development Bank.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-creditor-china-has-not-approved-any-loans-to-cambodia-so-far-this-year-data-shows-/7905387.html	2024-12-18T00:31:32-08:00	
Zelenskyy to meet with NATO, European leaders in push to bolster defenses	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet Wednesday with NATO chief Mark Rutte and European leaders in Brussels as Ukraine seeks to bolster its defenses against Russian forces. Zelenskyy on Tuesday cited an urgent need to boost military aid to Ukraine, especially air defense systems. 'We must do everything possible to destroy Russia’s ability to wage war from as far away as possible,' Zelenskyy said. 'For this, we need more drones, more modern artillery, and long-range missiles.' Wednesday’s talks come a month before U.S. President Donald Trump takes office, bringing uncertainty about the level of continued U.S. support for Ukraine from the new administration. Among those expected to meet with Zelenskyy in Brussels were German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, European Council President António Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Ahead of the talks, Russia launched another round of overnight aerial attacks. Ihor Taburets, governor of Ukraine’s Cherkasy region, said Wednesday on Telegram that Ukrainian air defenses shot down 13 drones. He said there was no damage to infrastructure in the area. Khmelnytskyi Governor Serhii Tiurin said Wednesday that Ukrainian forces shot down two drones. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it destroyed two Ukrainian aerial drones over the Belgorod region, along with a drone over Bryansk and another over Kursk. Some information for this story came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-to-meet-with-nato-european-leaders-in-push-to-bolster-defenses/7905371.html	2024-12-17T23:49:30-08:00	
Vietnam seeks to boost domestic defense industry as it hosts arms fair	HANOI — Vietnam will showcase locally made weapons at an international arms fair in Hanoi on Thursday, as it seeks to boost its domestic industry and possibly export military equipment. Among the nearly 250 exhibitors will be top defense companies, including from the United States, Europe, Turkey and countries at war with each other, such as Israel, Iran, Russia and Ukraine. The Southeast Asian nation is a major importer of weapons, especially from Russia, having invested for years in its defense capabilities in an unstable region where it has clashed with China over boundaries in the South China Sea. But recently it has also bolstered its domestic defense industry and promoting exports of military products is now a priority, defense ministry officials have repeatedly said. State-owned defense firm Viettel and other local companies will showcase missile defense systems, drones, air defense radars, armored vehicles and artillery, according to defense ministry media. Some of these weapons will be displayed for the first time, said Nguyen The Phuong, an expert on Vietnam security at Australia's University of New South Wales. He noted a key strategy to strengthen the local industry had been the signing of deals with foreign arms exporters to have some of their components produced in Vietnam. Talks with South Korean companies were underway for possible new deals under those conditions, especially for artillery and aviation, he said. Similar talks had also been held with companies from other countries, including the Czech Republic, officials said. Rivals' gear on display At the expo, Iran's defense ministry will have an entire pavilion, not far from the booths of Israel's defense firms Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. The fair will also host a dozen booths of Russian firms and one for Ukraine's Motor Sich, an aircraft engine manufacturer. A dozen Turkish defense companies, including Aselsan, Turkish Aerospace Industries and Roketsan, are among listed participants, making Turkey's one of the largest delegations. China's Norinco will be one of two Chinese exhibitors, in a first for a Vietnamese defense fair. U.S. defense giants Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Textron Aviation Defense will also have their booths at the fair. They have all been involved in talks with Vietnamese authorities for the sale of helicopters. Lockheed is also discussing a possible deal on C-130 Hercules military transport planes, sources had told Reuters. Brazil's Embraer said it will exhibit its C-390 Millennium plane - a rival to the C-130. Top European defense firms will also attend, including aerospace giant Airbus, Britain's BAE Systems, Germany's Rheinmetall, Italy's Leonardo and France's Thales Group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-seeks-to-boost-domestic-defense-industry-as-it-hosts-arms-fair/7905366.html	2024-12-17T23:29:52-08:00	
Return to Earth for 2 stuck NASA astronauts delayed until March	CAPE CANAVERAL, florida — NASA's two stuck astronauts just got their space mission extended again. That means they won't be back on Earth until spring, 10 months after rocketing into orbit on Boeing's Starliner capsule. NASA on Tuesday announced the latest delay in the homecoming for Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. The two test pilots planned on being away just a week or so when they blasted off June 5 on Boeing's first astronaut flight to the International Space Station. Their mission grew from eight days to eight months after NASA decided to send the company's problem-plagued Starliner capsule back empty in September. Now the pair won't return until the end of March or even April because of a delay in launching their replacements, according to NASA. A fresh crew needs to launch before Wilmore and Williams can return, and the next mission has been bumped more than a month, according to the space agency. NASA's next crew of four was supposed to launch in February, followed by Wilmore's and Williams' return home by the end of that month alongside two other astronauts. But SpaceX needs more time to prepare the new capsule for liftoff. That launch is now scheduled for no earlier than late March. NASA said it considered using a different SpaceX capsule to fly up the replacement crew in order to keep the flights on schedule. But it decided the best option was to wait for the new capsule to transport the next crew. NASA prefers to have overlapping crews at the space station for a smoother transition, according to officials. Most space station missions last six months, with a few reaching a full year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/return-to-earth-for-2-stuck-nasa-astronauts-delayed-until-march-/7905291.html	2024-12-17T18:10:18-08:00	
Vanuatu earthquake death toll rises to 14 as rescuers continue search	Rescuers in Vanuatu on Wednesday searched for people still trapped after a 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck the Pacific nation's capital, Port Vila, on Tuesday, killing 14 people and damaging reservoirs, commercial buildings, embassies and a hospital. At least 200 people were being treated for injuries at the capital's main hospital and other medical centers, a Red Cross official said on X, citing the Vanuatu government. 'Rescue ops continue to free those trapped after the quake, and attention turns to urgent needs like first aid, shelter and water,' said Katie Greenwood, head of the delegation for the Pacific at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Vanuatu police said in a statement there had been deaths and many injuries, without giving numbers. National broadcaster VBTC showed people queuing for fuel and essentials on Wednesday morning. Rescue efforts continued at one of the collapsed buildings, Billabong House, where people had been trapped under rubble. Footage posted on social media showed vehicles crushed under the debris, boulders strewn across a highway and landslides near Port Vila's international shipping terminal. Basil Leodoro, an emergency doctor in Vanuatu with health emergency firm Respond Global, said two buildings — Billabong House and a Chinese store — had collapsed, with rescuers trying to save people. 'So far they have been able to remove two casualties,' he said in a social media post, citing police reports. Concrete pillars on a building in the capital hosting foreign missions, including the U.S., British, French and New Zealand embassies, collapsed in the powerful quake. Triage tents have been set up outside Port Vila's hospital to manage the influx of patients. Aftershocks overnight Several aftershocks, including one of magnitude 6.1, rattled Vanuatu overnight. 'Even just two minutes ago, we had another shock ... probably wouldn't even count how many. Loads and loads of aftershocks throughout the night,' Australian Caroline Bird, who manages a resort in Port Vila, told ABC News on Wednesday. Caretaker Prime Minister Charlot Salwai said a national disaster committee has declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew for seven days in the worst-affected areas. International assistance has been sought. Australia's Defense Minister Richard Marles said two military planes would fly to Vanuatu on Wednesday morning with a medical assistance team and a search-and-rescue team. 'This is a very significant incident, and we hold anxiety about how it will unfold,' he told ABC Radio. New Zealand said it would send a plane to check if aircraft could land in Vanuatu, where the international airport remained closed. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated 116,000 people, around one-third of the country's population, had been affected by the earthquake. Australian Michael Thompson, who runs a zip line adventure business in Vanuatu, said in a post on Facebook that he had been helping to dig people out of the rubble overnight. 'Three people have been removed alive with one in a very serious condition ... incredible displays of bravery with people entering confined spaces to conduct rescues,' Thompson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vanuatu-earthquake-death-toll-rises-to-14-as-rescuers-continue-search-/7905288.html	2024-12-17T18:01:45-08:00

Police look for motive in latest US school shooting	Police in Madison, Wisconsin, said Tuesday that they were working to establish a motive for the shooting at a small, private Christian school that killed a teacher and a student and wounded six other people. 'Identifying a motive is our top priority,' Police Chief Shon Barnes said of the shooting Monday that he called a 'hurting and haunting situation.' Police were trying to verify a document posted online by the 15-year-old shooter, who apparently died of a self-inflicted wound. Authorities said the shooter, Natalie Rupnow, was a student at the Abundant Life Christian School, which has an enrollment of just over 400 students from kindergarten to high school. She opened fire in a study hall late Monday morning. 'We don't know nearly enough yet,' Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway told reporters Tuesday about the shooting. Rhodes-Conway also said it was too early to determine whether the shooter's parents, who were cooperating with the police investigation, would face criminal charges. 'We have to allow law enforcement the time and space for a careful and methodical examination,' she said. Barnes said Tuesday that several schools across the Madison metropolitan area 'were targeted by false threats, often known as swatting.' He said police and the school district were working together to determine who initiated the scheme. The mayor lashed out at reporters' requests Tuesday for more information about the victims. 'I'm going to say this and then we're done,' she said. 'It is absolutely none of y'all's business who was harmed in this incident. Please have some human decency and respect for the people who have lost loved ones or were injured themselves or whose children were injured. Just have some human decency, folks.' Vice President Kamala Harris, speaking in Maryland, said, 'Our nation mourns for those who were killed, and we pray for the recovery of those who were injured.' The vice president said stronger gun controls were needed. 'Solutions are in hand,' she said, 'but we need elected leaders to have the courage to step up and do the right thing.' President Joe Biden said in a statement Monday that the shooting was 'shocking and unconscionable.' 'Every child deserves to feel safe in their classroom,' he said. 'Students across our country should be learning how to read and write, not having to learn how to duck and cover.' Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers ordered flags to be flown at half-staff to honor the shooting victims. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-look-for-motive-in-latest-us-school-shooting/7905275.html	2024-12-17T17:22:19-08:00	
US Senate to vote on bill that fuels possibility of Chinese drone ban	WASHINGTON — The 2025 defense spending authorization bill is coming up to a final vote in the U.S. Senate. As the American Northeast buzzes with drone sightings and fears of foreign surveillance, the bill moves to ban products from the world's largest drone-maker: China. In a procedural vote on Monday, senators voted 83-12 in favor of moving to a full vote on the National Defense Authorization Act, a massive piece of annual legislation that sets priorities and authorizes funding for the U.S. Department of Defense. A provision within the 2025 NDAA aims to create mechanisms for further oversight and prohibition of the use of Chinese drones while working to increase drone supply chain resilience within the U.S. and partner countries. The bill mandates an investigation into two Chinese drone manufacturers, DJI and Autel Robotics, with the aim of placing them on the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) 'Covered List.' This would prevent their use in telecommunications industries. Another section calls for the Department of Defense to regularly disassemble and analyze the components of DJI drones. The provision on drones draws in part from earlier anti-Chinese drone legislation introduced by Republican Representative Elise Stefanik and Senator Rick Scott. These bills received bipartisan support, showing how concerns over the risk that Chinese drones pose to U.S. national security have united a politically divided Congress. 'DJI drones pose the national security threat of TikTok, but with wings,' Stefanik said. 'This Chinese-controlled company cannot be allowed to continue to operate in the U.S.' During an interview on Fox News, Democratic Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi described how he collaborated with Stefanik to draft legislation on Chinese drones to be included in the NDAA. 'These Chinese-manufactured drones allow for the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, to access data in a backdoor manner and ultimately surveil Americans,' Krishnamoorthi said. China's DJI dominates the production and sale of household drones, with 2021 estimates suggesting that the company accounts for 76% of the worldwide consumer market and about 90% of the U.S. market. While more companies have emerged in past years, DJI still controls the largest share of the market. This gives the U.S. an increased imperative to diversify the domestic drone economy, Carlos Gimenez, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee's Transportation and Maritime Security Subcommittee, told VOA. 'We have to go a little cold turkey on this one. To say, ‘No, we can't buy that anymore,’' Gimenez said. 'You have to look for other suppliers, which then will slowly incentivize American companies to start building them.' While the Chinese drone ban has bipartisan support within Congress, it faces pushback from drone enthusiasts and nongovernmental organizations that oppose a blanket ban on Chinese drone products. Brandon Karr, spokesperson for the nonprofit Law Enforcement Drone Association (LEDA), supports the development of stricter and more rigorous data security regulations for drones rather than an all-out ban, which could pose problems for American law enforcement and safety agencies. Karr has written to Congress, advocating for agencies to develop their own protocol and oversight for drone data security and to maintain their right to use Chinese drones while minimizing their risk. LEDA leads training on drone operation and best practices for public safety and law enforcement. All 30 of the drones the group uses for training are made by Chinese companies. 'Generally speaking, over 90% of public safety agencies in the nation and worldwide today are utilizing Chinese aircraft,' Karr said. 'So in the event that a bill like this would go fully through and would potentially ban the use of Chinese drones for public safety, it'd be catastrophic for the public safety drone industry.' The biggest advantage of Chinese drones is their low cost, especially when compared with American models. Karr told VOA that he'd rather use American products, but that domestically produced drones were double the price of those made in China and included more maintenance fees. 'There's not a law enforcement entity across the United States that would rather fly a Chinese aircraft over an American if they were competitively priced,' he said. In addition to LEDA, the California Fire Chiefs Association, the Air Public Safety Association and other groups have written to Congress saying the bill will harm them, with most citing concerns over cost. In an interview with VOA in August, Republican Senator Marco Rubio called Chinese drones 'a huge vulnerability,' and said that data security regulations would not address the security risks of Chinese drones given their frequent software updates. People 'just want drones, and these are the cheapest ones they can find,' said Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state in the next administration. 'We need to help incentivize the development of alternative manufacturers that are cost effective for law enforcement, for utility companies, for others.' DJI has not yet responded to VOA's request for comment on the latest version of the NDAA, which could ban the company's drones. However, when votes were taken to include a ban of DJI drones in the NDAA in the House of Representatives earlier this year, DJI representatives told VOA that the moves 'suggest protectionism and undermine the principles of fair competition and an open market.' 'Our drones have enabled the growth of entire industries, empowering small businesses in sectors such as agriculture, real estate, and transportation. These businesses depend on the accessibility of DJI's drone technology to thrive. We believe that innovation, security, and privacy can coexist and are essential to advancing the drone industry and the interests of all stakeholders,' wrote DJI representatives. DJI has consistently denied claims that it sends drone data to the Chinese government.

Congo files criminal complaints against Apple in Europe over conflict minerals	Paris — The Democratic Republic of Congo has filed criminal complaints against Apple subsidiaries in France and Belgium, accusing the tech firm of using conflict minerals in its supply chain, lawyers for the Congolese government told Reuters. Congo is a major source of tin, tantalum and tungsten, so-called 3T minerals used in computers and mobile phones. But some artisanal mines are run by armed groups involved in massacres of civilians, mass rapes, looting and other crimes, according to U.N. experts and human rights groups. Apple does not directly source primary minerals and says it audits suppliers, publishes findings and funds bodies that seek to improve mineral traceability. Apple last year said it had 'no reasonable basis for concluding' its products contain illegally exported minerals from conflict-hit zones. The tech giant has insisted it carefully verifies the origin of materials in its output. Its 2023 filing on conflict minerals to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said none of the smelters or refiners of 3T minerals or gold in its supply chain had financed or benefited armed groups in Congo or neighboring countries. But international lawyers representing Congo argue that Apple uses minerals pillaged from Congo and laundered through international supply chains, which they say renders the firm complicit in crimes taking place in Congo. In parallel complaints filed to the Paris prosecutor's office and to a Belgian investigating magistrate's office on Monday, Congo accuses local subsidiaries Apple France, Apple Retail France and Apple Retail Belgium of a range of offenses. These include covering up war crimes and the laundering of tainted minerals, handling stolen goods, and carrying out deceptive commercial practices to assure consumers supply chains are clean. 'It is clear that the Apple group, Apple France and Apple Retail France know very well that their minerals supply chain relies on systemic wrongdoing,' says the French complaint, after citing U.N. and rights reports on conflict in east Congo. Belgium had a particular moral duty to act because looting of Congo's resources began during the 19th-century colonial rule of its King Leopold II, Congo's Belgian lawyer Christophe Marchand said. 'It is incumbent on Belgium to help Congo in its effort to use judicial means to end the pillaging,' he said. The complaints, prepared by the lawyers on behalf of Congo's justice minister, make allegations not just against the local subsidiaries but against the Apple group as a whole. France and Belgium were chosen because of their perceived strong emphasis on corporate accountability. Judicial authorities in both nations will decide whether to investigate the complaints further and bring criminal charges. In an unrelated case in March, a U.S. federal court rejected an attempt by private plaintiffs to hold Apple, Google, Tesla, Dell and Microsoft accountable for what the plaintiffs described as their dependence on child labor in Congolese cobalt mines. Minerals fuel violence Since the 1990s, Congo's mining heartlands in the east have been devastated by waves of fighting between armed groups, some backed by neighboring Rwanda, and the Congolese military. Millions of civilians have died and been displaced. Competition for minerals is one of the main drivers of conflict as armed groups sustain themselves and buy weapons with the proceeds of exports, often smuggled via Rwanda, according to U.N. experts and human rights organizations. Rwanda denies benefiting from the trade, dismissing the allegations as unfounded. Among the appendices to Congo's legal complaint in France was a statement issued by the U.S. State Department in July, expressing concerns about the role of the illicit trade in minerals from Congo, including tantalum, in financing conflict. The statement was a response to requests from the private sector for the U.S. government to clarify potential risks associated with manufacturing products using minerals extracted, transported or exported from eastern Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. Congo's complaints focus on ITSCI, a metals industry-funded monitoring and certification scheme designed to help companies perform due diligence on suppliers of 3T minerals exported from Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. Congo's lawyers argue that ITSCI has been discredited, including by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) of which Apple is a member, and that Apple nevertheless uses ITSCI as a fig leaf to falsely present its supply chain as clean. The RMI, whose members include more than 500 companies, announced in 2022 it was removing ITSCI from its list of approved traceability schemes. In July, it said it was prolonging the suspension until at least 2026, saying ITSCI had not provided field observations from high-risk sites or explained how it was responding to an escalation of violence in North Kivu province, which borders Rwanda and is a key 3T mining area. ITSCI criticized the RMI's own processes and defended its work in Congo as reliable. It has also rejected allegations in a 2022 report by campaigning group Global Witness entitled 'The ITSCI Laundromat,' cited in Congo's legal complaint in France, that it was complicit in the false labeling of minerals from conflict zones as coming from mines located in peaceful areas. Apple mentioned ITSCI five times in its 2023 filing on conflict minerals. The filing also made multiple mentions of the RMI, in which Apple said it had continued active participation and leadership but did not mention the RMI's ditching of ITSCI. In its July statement, the U.S. State Department said flaws in traceability schemes have not garnered sufficient engagement and attention to lead to changes needed. Robert Amsterdam, a U.S.-based lawyer for Congo, said the French and Belgian complaints were the first criminal complaints by the Congolese state against a major tech company, describing them as a 'first salvo' only. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-files-criminal-complaints-against-apple-in-europe-over-conflict-minerals-/7905254.html	2024-12-17T16:50:50-08:00	
Congress nears funding deal with more than $100 billion in disaster aid	WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders are nearing the unveiling of a spending agreement that will keep the federal government funded through March 14 and provide more than $100 billion in emergency aid to help states and local communities recover from Hurricanes Helene and Milton and other natural disasters. The stopgap measure would prevent a partial government shutdown set to begin after midnight Friday. It would kick final decisions on this budget year's spending levels to a new Republican-led Congress and President-elect Donald Trump. The continuing resolution generally continues current spending levels for agencies. Passage of the measure is one of the final actions that lawmakers will consider this week before adjourning for the holidays and making way for the next Congress. It's the second short-term funding measure the lawmakers have taken up this fall as they struggled to pass the dozen annual appropriations bills before the new fiscal year began October 1, as they typically do. While text of the legislation was not yet available Tuesday, House Republican lawmakers emerged from a closed-door meeting saying that the disaster aid would come to about $100 billion, plus there's $10 billion in economic assistance for farmers who have been struggling with drought in some regions of the country and flooding in others. 'We have to be able to help those who are in these dire straits,' said House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters. Net farm income is projected to decline 4.1% this year after falling 19.4% the year before from the record highs reached in 2022. Johnson indicated more farm aid could be delivered in the next Congress, saying, 'We can't do all it right now.' 'Congress is doing the best it can under difficult circumstances, and I think it will be a big boost for the industry,' Johnson said. Representative Glenn Thompson, the Republican chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, said he was hoping for more economic relief for farmers, but 'it's a great start.' 'I think it's going to send the right signal to the markets that most farmers and ranchers are going to be able to get eligible for the credit they need to borrow in order to plant a crop or raise a herd,' Thompson said. President Joe Biden has sought about $114 billion in disaster aid, submitting a $99 billion request in November, telling lawmakers the funding was 'urgently needed.' The administration subsequently updated its request to include funding to repair federal facilities damaged due to natural disasters. As it typically does, Congress is expected to act just before another shutdown deadline. House Republicans generally give lawmakers 72 hours to review text of the legislation, which would push a vote on final passage to Friday if they follow through on that rule. The Senate also is not known for acting speedily, but many lawmakers are eager to adjourn for the year and make way for the next Congress. Since the bill is the last must-pass legislation of the current Congress, lawmakers have worked to get certain priorities included. On the health care front, the legislation seeks to extend coverage of telehealth appointments for Medicare enrollees and rein in how much money pharmacy benefits managers — the companies that negotiate how and what drugs are covered by insurance plans — make off those deals. Johnson said he hoped that text of the bill would be available later Tuesday, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that 'negotiations continue between both parties.' 'Obviously we are getting closer to the December 20th deadline, so time is of the essence for Republicans to reach an agreement with us that we can act on quickly,' Schumer said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congress-nears-funding-deal-with-more-than-100-billion-in-disaster-aid-/7905246.html	2024-12-17T16:31:59-08:00	
In 2024, voters’ discontent with incumbents meant opting for change	Ruling parties often have an advantage in elections. But in history's biggest election year so far, incumbents of all political stripes found that presiding over a period of economic inflation carries a heavy price at the ballot box.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-2024-voters-discontent-with-incumbents-meant-opting-for-change-/7904991.html	2024-12-17T15:40:48-08:00	
Overcrowded boat capsizes in Congo; at least 25 dead, dozens missing	KINSHASA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — An overcrowded boat capsized on a river in central Congo on Tuesday, killing at least 25 people, including children, and leaving dozens missing, officials and local residents said. The vessel was believed to have more than 100 passengers on board after leaving from the town of Inongo, northeast of the capital of Kinshasa. It capsized a few hundred meters into the journey along the Fimi River, the latest such tragedy to strike Congo. A search for the missing was underway hours later Tuesday as concerns rose that the death toll could be far higher. 'There was overloading at roof level and, as far as the lifeless human bodies are concerned, at least 25 have been recovered so far,' said David Kalemba, Inongo's river commissioner. The capsized boat was also loaded with goods, according to Alex Mbumba, a resident of the area. 'Among the dead are children, but it's difficult to give an exact death toll at the moment as ... the boat had a lot of passengers,' said Mbumba. Tuesday's wreck was the fourth this year in the Maï-Ndombe province, a region surrounded by rivers and where many rely on river transportation. Congolese officials have often warned against overloading and vowed to punish those violating safety measures for water transportation. However, in remote areas where most passengers come from, many are unable to afford public transport for the few available roads. At least 78 people drowned in October when an overloaded boat sank in the country's east, and 80 lost their lives in June in a similar accident near Kinshasa. The latest accident prompted calls for the government to equip the province with flotation devices. 'The government must act to improve safety on the waters of our province [because] navigation conditions are dangerous,' said Mbumba.	https://www.voanews.com/a/overcrowded-boat-capsizes-in-congo-at-least-25-dead-dozens-missing-/7904979.html	2024-12-17T15:24:38-08:00	
US lawmakers propose bills to hit China over fentanyl trade	WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday proposed three bills aimed at cracking down on China's role in the U.S. fentanyl crisis, with measures that would set up a U.S. task force to disrupt narcotics trafficking and pave the way for sanctions on Chinese entities. China is the dominant source of chemical precursors used by Mexican cartels to produce fentanyl, while Chinese money launderers have become key players in the international drug trade, U.S. authorities say. The proposed legislation would help hold China's ruling Communist Party (CCP) accountable for 'directly fueling the fentanyl crisis through its state subsidies of precursors,' said the House of Representatives' Select Committee on China, on which all of the sponsors of the bills sit. One bill, The CCP Fentanyl Sanctions Act, introduced by Democratic Representative Jake Auchincloss, would codify authorities for the U.S. to cut off Chinese companies from the U.S. banking system, including vessels, ports and online marketplaces that 'knowingly or recklessly' facilitate shipment of illicit synthetic narcotics. 'This is state-sponsored poisoning of the American people,' Auchincloss said at an event introducing the legislation. 'The genesis of this is squarely on the mainland of the People's Republic of China.' Two other bills would create a task force of U.S. agencies to conduct joint operations to disrupt trafficking networks and allow for the imposition of civil penalties on Chinese entities that fail to properly manifest or follow formal entry channels when shipping precursors to the U.S., the committee said. There is growing consensus in Republican circles close to President-elect Donald Trump that Beijing has exploited, even engineered, the synthetic opioid epidemic to harm Americans, something Beijing denies. China says it has some of the strictest drug laws in the world, and that the U.S. needs to curb narcotics demand at home. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bills. With little time remaining in the current congressional term, the bills would likely need to be reintroduced next year after the new Congress is sworn in on January 3. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the committee, wrote in an article this month that it was 'time to get tough' on Beijing over fentanyl.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-propose-bills-to-hit-china-over-fentanyl-trade-/7904949.html	2024-12-17T15:01:45-08:00	
Unknown disease in Congo revealed to be severe malaria, health authorities say	KINSHASA — Democratic Republic of Congo's Health Ministry said on Tuesday that a previously unidentified disease circulating in the southwestern Kwango province is a severe form of malaria. Earlier this month, local authorities said the disease had killed 143 people in the country's Panzi health zone in November. The symptoms of the disease are fever, headache, cough, runny nose and body aches. 'The mystery has finally been solved. It's a case of severe malaria in the form of a respiratory illness,' the Health Ministry said in a statement, adding that malnutrition in the area had weakened the local population, leaving them more vulnerable to disease. The statement also said that 592 cases had been reported since October, with a fatality rate of 6.2%. Provincial health minister Apollinaire Yumba told Reuters that anti-malaria medicine provided by the World Health Organization was being distributed in the main hospital and health centers in the Panzi health zone. A WHO spokesperson said more health kits for moderate and critical cases were due to arrive on Wednesday. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week that 10 early samples from patients in Congo suffering from a mystery illness had tested positive for malaria, but that he had not ruled out the possibility that they suffered from other concurrent diseases.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unknown-disease-in-congo-revealed-to-be-severe-malaria-health-authorities-say/7904952.html	2024-12-17T15:00:05-08:00	
Storm Chido kills at least 7, leaves trail of damage in Malawi	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — The storm named Chido killed at least seven people in Malawi and affected more than 30,000 others, disaster officials said Tuesday. A preliminary assessment report released by Malawi’s Department of Disaster Management Affairs said the storm blew off the roofs of schools, health facilities and houses. Department spokesperson Chipiliro Khamula said at least 7,721 households representing 34,741 people were affected. Three people died in Salima district. Kasungu, Machinga, Blantyre and Lilongwe districts each recorded one death. Khamula also said the department recorded 16 injuries. Tropical Cyclone Chido developed northeast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean and made landfall Sunday near Nacala, Mozambique, where it caused significant damage. A report from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs released Tuesday said the storm affected more than 174,000 people in Mozambique and 64,000 in the Comoros archipelago, destroying thousands of homes. Chido’s remnants passed Malawi on Monday as a moderate tropical storm causing heavy rains and flooding in about 17 districts, many of them in the south. Lucy Mtilatila, director for the Malawi Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services, told VOA Tuesday the storm had dissipated. 'Our eyes are on the Indian Ocean in case there will be another development,' she said. 'But so far, so good.' School classes resumed after the government suspended them Sunday as a precautionary measure. Khamula said the disaster agency has withdrawn all search and rescue teams it had deployed in at-risk areas. The agency, in collaboration with other humanitarian partners, is facilitating relief efforts to assist affected households, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cyclone-chido-kills-at-least-7-leaves-trail-of-damage-in-malawi/7904928.html	2024-12-17T14:37:25-08:00	
Kenyan aid group is enabling refugees to access loans	NAIROBI, KENYA — A Kenyan aid group is helping refugees improve their lives by providing affordable loans that will help finance their businesses. At least 13,000 refugees in exile have received loans. Adelle Mubalama, a tailor at Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp, fled her home in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2019. Mubalama said she abandoned her business selling clothing, and her efforts to get funds to begin a new trade in exile was futile. 'If you want to borrow money from the bank, they would ask you for statements and the Kenya Revenue Authority PIN number,' she said, 'which is very hard for us refugees to get.'' Mubalama said her dream came alive when she was granted a loan from Inkomoko, an organization that helps to empower micro and small business entrepreneurs, including refugees in Africa. She now makes bags and sells fabrics in Kakuma. After an assessment, Mubalama went through training for running a business. She then got a loan of 30,000 shillings, which she used to launch her business. At least 13,000 refugees in Kenya have received loans from Inkomoko, which means 'origin' in Nyarwanda. But according to a 2024 World Bank report, despite the significant progress Kenya has made in developing a policy framework for refugees and host communities, refugees continue to face challenges in accessing services to improve their lives. Inkomoko founder Julienne Oyler said entrepreneurs can access up to $50,000 and pay back at an interest rate of 10% annually – lower than what most banks charge, and without collateral. Oyler said that with the loans, many refugees see their skills and talents revived. ''The system that was established to support refugees is completely outdated, humanitarian funding is incredibly declining, while the number of displaced people is increasing,' Oyler said. 'What we see is that the old way of working isn't working. It's when we bring in private sector solutions into these communities that we actually start to see economic development.' The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported that at the end of June 2024, 122.6 million people worldwide remained forcibly displaced due to disasters, persecution, conflicts, violence and human rights violations, among others. This represents an increase of 5%, or 5.3 million people, compared to the end of 2023. International Organization of Migrants senior program manager Pravina Gurung told VOA that climate-induced disasters are adding to the growing numbers of displaced individuals and are destroying livelihoods. ''When people are on the move in search of safety and better livelihood opportunities, there is a risk of exploitation,' Gurung said. 'And without documentation, they cannot access any kind of services, including financial services. Also, they cannot access any type of assistance that is in existence.'' Kenya hosts over 1 million international migrants, according to IOM, and nearly 800,000 registered refugees. Officials believe initiatives to help them access affordable financing will help improve their lives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-aid-group-is-enabling-refugees-to-access-loans-/7904929.html	2024-12-17T14:33:55-08:00	
Trump sues Des Moines Register, pollster for 'election interference' after inaccurate poll	President-elect Donald Trump sued the Des Moines Register and its pollster for 'brazen election interference' in publishing a survey the weekend before the election that showed Democrat Kamala Harris with a surprising lead of 3 percentage points in the state. The Register's parent Gannett Co. on Tuesday dismissed the lawsuit as meritless and said it would vigorously defend its First Amendment rights. The lawsuit continues the president-elect's campaign against media outlets he feels have wronged him. ABC this past weekend agreed to pay $15 million toward a Trump presidential library in order to settle a defamation lawsuit against George Stephanopoulos for inaccurately saying Trump had been found civilly liable for rape. The Des Moines survey, done by since-retired pollster J. Ann Selzer, was considered shocking for indicating that an earlier Trump lead in the Republican-leaning Midwestern state had been erased. In the actual election, Trump won Iowa by more than 13 percentage points. 'There was a perfectly good reason nobody saw this coming: because a three-point lead for Harris in deep-red Iowa was not reality,' the lawsuit said. 'It was election-interfering fiction.' The poll increased enthusiasm among Democrats, compelled Republicans to divert campaign time and money to areas in which they were ahead, and deceived the public into thinking Democrats were doing better than they actually were, Trump charged. The lawsuit was filed late Monday in Polk County district court in Iowa. It cites Iowa consumer fraud law, and doesn't ask for specific monetary damages, but rather wants a trial jury to award triple the amount of what it determines actual damages to be. Whatever happens legally, the case could have a chilling effect beyond Iowa. Trump said in legal papers that he wanted it to deter 'radicals from continuing to act with corrupt intent in releasing polls manufactured for the purpose of skewing election results in favor of Democrats.' Lark-Marie Anton, Des Moines Register spokeswoman, said the newspaper acknowledged the pre-election poll did not reflect actual results and released technical information to explain the data and what went wrong. 'We stand by our reporting on the matter and believe a lawsuit would be without merit,' she said. Selzer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. But she told PBS in Iowa last week that 'it's not my ethic' to set up a poll to deliver a specific response. She said she was mystified about what motivation people would think she had. 'To suggest without a single shred of evidence that I was in cahoots with somebody, I was being paid by somebody, it's all just kind of, it's hard to pay too much attention to it except that they are accusing me of a crime,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-sues-des-moines-register-pollster-for-election-interference-after-inaccurate-poll-/7904918.html	2024-12-17T14:20:49-08:00	
Archivist: Equal Rights Amendment can't be certified as Democrats push Biden to recognize it	Washington — In a rare joint statement, the archivist and deputy archivist of the United States said Tuesday that the 1970s-era Equal Rights Amendment cannot be certified without further action by Congress or the courts, as Democrats press President Joe Biden to act unilaterally on its ratification before he leaves office next month. The five-decade push to amend the Constitution to prohibit discrimination based on sex remains stalled. Congress sent the amendment, which guarantees men and women equal rights under the law, to the states in 1972 and gave states seven years to ratify it, later extending the deadline to 1982. But the amendment wasn't ratified by the required three-quarters of states before the deadline. Four years ago, however, Virginia lawmakers voted to ratify the amendment, becoming the 38th and final state needed — albeit nearly four decades after the congressionally mandated deadline for ratification. More than 120 House Democrats, led by Representatives Cori Bush and Ayanna Pressley, called on Biden on Sunday to direct the archivist to certify and publish the amendment despite the missed deadline. 'Solidifying your legacy on equal rights with a final action on the ERA would be a defining moment for the historic Biden-Harris administration and your presidency,' they wrote to Biden. But the archivist, Colleen Shogan, and her deputy, William J. Bosanko, who are responsible for certifying and publishing new amendments once they meet the required ratification threshold, say neither they nor Biden can act without Congress or the courts lifting the deadline. 'In 2020 and again in 2022, the Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice affirmed that the ratification deadline established by Congress for the ERA is valid and enforceable,' they said in a joint statement. 'The OLC concluded that extending or removing the deadline requires new action by Congress or the courts. Court decisions at both the District and Circuit levels have affirmed that the ratification deadlines established by Congress for the ERA are valid.' They added: 'Therefore, the Archivist of the United States cannot legally publish the Equal Rights Amendment. As the leaders of the National Archives, we will abide by these legal precedents and support the constitutional framework in which we operate.' Congress tried last year in the latest push to lift the deadline to allow for the amendment's ratification, but the measure didn't reach the required 60-vote threshold in the Senate. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who is leading the effort among Democrats in the Senate, insisted in a statement that the archivist's analysis was flawed and said she was 'wrongfully inserting herself into a clear constitutional process, despite the fact that her role is purely ministerial.' She encouraged Biden to ignore the OLC memo and certify the ERA anyway. 'OLC memos are advisory in nature and can easily be disregarded by the current administration,' she said. The Biden White House has been discussing the possibility with lawmakers and in internal meetings, according to a person familiar with the matter, but believes the best path forward is for Congress to lift the deadline and thereby eliminate the risk of a legal challenge to the amendment. White House spokesperson Kelly Scully said: 'President Biden has been clear that he wants to see the Equal Rights Amendment definitively enshrined in the Constitution.' 'Senior administration officials have and will continue to engage with key Congressional leaders and other stakeholders on this issue in the weeks ahead,' she added. 'It is long past time that we recognize the clear will of the American people.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/archivist-equal-rights-amendment-can-t-be-certified-as-democrats-push-biden-to-recognize-it-/7904905.html	2024-12-17T14:17:53-08:00	
First winner of FIFA’s Marta Award? Marta, of course	DOHA, QATAR — It could only have been her. Marta won the inaugural FIFA award for the best goal in women's soccer — named after the Brazil great. The 38-year-old was given the Marta Award at FIFA's 'The Best' awards on Tuesday for her goal for Brazil in an international friendly against Jamaica in June. Prior to this year, the Puskas award covered all of soccer but it was decided to award it to the best goal in the men's game — won this year by Manchester United forward Alejandro Garnacho — and create the new Marta Award for the women's game. 'To compete against so many great players — we had some fantastic goals,' she said. 'It's been a wonderful season, too. But I'm even happier to receive an award that bears my name; this is undoubtedly the greatest honor.' Marta is widely regarded as the greatest female soccer player of all time and had won the award for the women's player of the year on a record six occasions. She scored a record 119 goals for Brazil in 185 appearances for her country, spanning six World Cups and six Olympics, before retiring from international soccer after the Paris Games — where Brazil lost to the United States in the final. Marta won the first NWSL title of her career last month when Orlando Pride beat Washington Spirit 1-0 in the final. She had scored in the semifinal. Marta was asked the day before the title match if she thought it was possible she might give the award to herself. 'You guys need to decide, because who votes for the best goal in the year? It's you. It's the people in the public. So it should be really interesting, like Marta's Award goes to Marta!' she said with a laugh.

Suspect in killing of US insurance CEO charged with murder as act of terrorism	NEW YORK — The man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare's CEO has been charged with murder as an act of terrorism, prosecutors said Tuesday as they worked to bring him to a New York court from a Pennsylvania jail. Luigi Mangione already was charged with murder in the Dec. 4 killing of Brian Thompson, but the terror allegation is new. Under New York law, such a charge can be brought when an alleged crime is 'intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policies of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion and affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder, assassination or kidnapping.' Mangione's New York lawyer has not commented on the case. Thompson, 50, was shot dead as he walked to a Manhattan hotel where Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare — the United States' biggest medical insurer — was holding an investor conference. 'This was a frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock and attention and intimidation,' Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said at a news conference Tuesday. 'It occurred in one of the most bustling parts of our city, threatened the safety of local residents and tourists alike, commuters and businesspeople just starting out on their day.' After days of intense police searches and publicity, Mangione was spotted at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and arrested. New York police officials have said Mangione was carrying the gun used to kill Thompson, a passport and various fake IDs, including one that the suspected shooter presented to check into a New York hostel. The 26-year-old was charged with Pennsylvania gun and forgery offenses and locked up there without bail. His Pennsylvania lawyer has questioned the evidence for the forgery charge and the legal grounding for the gun charge. The attorney also has said Mangione would fight extradition to New York. Mangione has two court hearings scheduled for Thursday in Pennsylvania, including an extradition hearing, Bragg said. Hours after his arrest, the Manhattan district attorney's office filed paperwork charging him with murder and other offenses. The indictment builds on that paperwork. Investigators' working theory is that Mangione, an Ivy League computer science grad from a prominent Maryland family, was propelled by anger at the U.S. health care system. A law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press said that when arrested, he was carrying a handwritten letter that called health insurance companies 'parasitic' and complained about corporate greed. Mangione repeatedly posted on social media about how spinal surgery last year had eased his chronic back pain, encouraging people with similar conditions to speak up for themselves if told they just had to live with it. In a Reddit post in late April, he advised someone with a back problem to seek additional opinions from surgeons and, if necessary, say the pain made it impossible to work. 'We live in a capitalist society,' Mangione wrote. 'I've found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it's impacting your quality of life.' He was never a UnitedHealthcare client, according to the insurer. Mangione apparently cut himself off from his family and close friends in recent months. His family reported him missing to San Francisco authorities in November. Thompson, who grew up on a farm in Iowa, was trained as an accountant. A married father of two high-schoolers, he had worked at the giant UnitedHealth Group for 20 years and became CEO of its insurance arm in 2021. His killing kindled a fiery outpouring of resentment toward U.S. health insurance companies, as Americans swapped stories online and elsewhere of being denied coverage, left in limbo as doctors and insurers disagreed, and stuck with sizeable bills.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspect-in-killing-of-us-insurance-ceo-charged-with-murder-as-act-of-terrorism/7904904.html	2024-12-17T14:04:24-08:00

VOA Mandarin: China expands private pension system nationwide	China has fully rolled out its 'private pension' system this week. According to the plan, each person can deposit no more than $1,600 every year to invest in financial products as a supplementary source of basic pension. However, Chinese people interviewed by VOA bluntly said that this is a 'Ponzi scheme' because China's economy is in a slump, and that the medical insurance and social security funds have long been in deficit.

VOA Persian: Iran executed at least 40 people in one week, group says	The 'No to Executions Tuesdays' campaign reported that at least 40 people were executed in Iran in recent days. The group released a statement, obtained by VOA, that comes amid the 47th consecutive week of a hunger strike involving prisoners across 27 prisons nationwide. The imprisoned members of the campaign have also expressed concern about the possibility of the confirmation of death sentences of two political prisoners, Mohammad Amin Mahdavi Shayesteh and Saman Mohammadi Khiyareh. The 'No to Execution Tuesdays' campaign was launched last year by several political prisoners with the aim of abolishing the death penalty in Iran.

Press freedom continues to deteriorate in Hong Kong	Washington — Jailed pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai testified Tuesday that the Hong Kong government became 'very strict' after Beijing's national security law came into effect in 2020. The 77-year-old British national made the statement when the court asked him to explain comments he made in August 2020 following the arrest of pro-democracy former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting. At the time, Lai said the arrest showed that the Beijing-imposed national security law, or NSL, 'definitely had destroyed our rule of law.' Lam was found guilty of rioting last week. 'I think the NSL has, you know, affected the way … the government conducted the law,' Lai told the court Tuesday. 'After the NSL, the government has been very strict in using the law.' The founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper stands accused of collusion with foreign forces and sedition under Beijing's national security law. He rejects the charges, which press freedom groups have decried as politically motivated. 'The trial is entirely a sham,' Yaqiu Wang, the China research director at the nonprofit Freedom House, told VOA. Lai's plight is a feature, not a bug, of the current press freedom landscape in Hong Kong, according to analysts. The past year has been particularly devastating for media freedom in a place that was once considered a bastion of press freedom in Asia, say analysts, who point to Lai's trial, a new national security law, and other trials of journalists as evidence that the media landscape has continued to deteriorate in Hong Kong. 'It's just the continuation of a dramatic decline in press freedom in Hong Kong,' Wang said. Next year is unlikely to be any better, multiple experts told VOA. Lai's trial began in December 2023 and was initially expected to last about 80 days. But now, his year is set to end the same way it began: attending hearings for a trial that could sentence him to life in prison. Sebastien Lai, the son of Jimmy Lai, has consistently voiced concern about his father's health. The elder Lai has been held in solitary confinement since late 2020. 'His health has gotten much worse, as you can expect when you put a 77-year-old man in solitary confinement for four years. But his spirit is holding strong. His mind is holding strong,' Sebastien Lai told VOA in November. Lai's case is intended to scare other people in Hong Kong from criticizing the government, says Caoilfhionn Gallagher, the head of Lai's international legal team. 'His case was also designed to send a chill down the spine of anyone who might want to wear a T-shirt or sing a song or post a tweet or say anything which might stand up to Hong Kong or Beijing's leaders,' Gallagher said at a November press conference in Washington. In late November, a Hong Kong government spokesperson told VOA it was 'inappropriate' to comment on Lai's case because legal proceedings are ongoing. Hong Kong authorities have previously denied that Lai's trial is unfair. The spokesperson also said Hong Kong 'rejected any fact-twisting remarks and baseless smears against the legal system' and emphasized that 'Hong Kong citizens enjoy freedom of the press and freedom of speech.' When it comes to press freedom in Hong Kong, Lai's trial is part of a broader pattern. In August, two editors — Chung Pui-kuen and Patrick Lam — at the now-shuttered Stand News were convicted of sedition and later sentenced to prison. Like Lai's, that case was also viewed as a bellwether of the poor state of press freedom in Hong Kong, according to Sophie Richardson, a visiting scholar at Stanford University. The cases 'are a very clear message across the board to journalists that they cannot expect the protections of law to guarantee their free speech rights in order to practice journalism without fear of reprisal,' Richardson told VOA. In November, 45 pro-democracy activists were sentenced to prison under the national security law. And in September, the Hong Kong Journalists Association reported that dozens of Hong Kong journalists and their families had faced harassment since June. 'You're not safe if you cross the government,' Mark Clifford, who recently published a biography on Jimmy Lai, told VOA. Those developments have taken place against the backdrop of a new, homegrown national security law known as Article 23, which expands on Beijing's national security measure. Enacted in March, Article 23 covers treason, sedition and state secrets, and allows for trials to be held behind closed doors. Experts have warned the law will likely further the deterioration of press freedom and other civil liberties in Hong Kong. 'Almost any conduct can now be labeled as a threat to national security,' said Richardson, the former China director at Human Rights Watch. Wang said the law may also underscore insecurity on the part of the Chinese and Hong Kong governments. 'They feel the need to take out more tools to repress people,' Wang said. In 2019, before Beijing's national security law was enacted, Hong Kong ranked 73 out of 180 countries on the Global Press Freedom Index. In 2024, it ranked 135 — a more than 60-spot drop. That rapid decline in press freedom and broader civil liberties has fundamentally changed the identity of Hong Kong, whose population long celebrated their freedoms, according to Clifford, president of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong. 'It's surreal. It's traumatic,' Clifford said. 'I don't think we've seen another country or another city in the past 100 years that has seen its freedom so quickly and thoroughly and comprehensively snuffed out.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/press-freedom-continues-to-deteriorate-in-hong-kong/7904843.html	2024-12-17T13:00:17-08:00	
VOA interview: US urges Europe to end energy dependency on Russia	The outgoing administration of U.S. President Joe Biden plans in its final weeks to 'continue tightening the noose' around Russia's key energy exports with new sanctions to deprive Moscow of revenue for its war on Ukraine, according to Assistant Secretary of State Geoffrey Pyatt. Pyatt over the past two weeks has traveled in Europe and Asia to discuss energy security with allies and the G7+Ukraine energy resilience group. In an interview with VOA Ukrainian's Oksana Bedratenko, Pyatt said Europe should use the Dec. 31 expiration of a gas transit contract between Ukraine and Russia to decisively end its dependency on Russian energy. He said he is encouraged that Europe sees American liquid natural gas (LNG) as part of its energy solution, noting that countries in Europe and even Japan — which imports 10% of its gas from Russia — understand the need to find alternative energy suppliers. The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. VOA: Over recent weeks Russia staged several massive attacks on the Ukrainian energy sector. With all of the preparations, with all of the help from Ukraine's allies before winter, what is your assessment of Ukrainian energy sector resilience? Assistant Secretary of State Geoffrey Pyatt: We knew coming into this winter that this was going to be a very fragile period, but I think the good news is support for Ukraine, support for Ukrainian energy workers, is as strong as it's ever been. We saw another brutal attack on Friday, especially in western Ukraine, in Lviv, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk. … And this is the bitterest part of the winter. So we know we need to continue to work together. I've just returned from two weeks of travel. I was in Tokyo and before that I was in Paris and London. The message I heard consistently from all of our G7 partners was a very clear focus on doing everything we can to help ensure that Russia's attempt to weaponize the winter is a failure. VOA: The gas transit contract between Russia and Ukraine expires at the end of this year. Do you think Europe is ready for it? There has already been some pressure on Ukraine to continue the gas transit. Do you think this will actually be the end of Europe's dependency on Russian gas? Pyatt: I certainly hope so. And importantly, the pressure that I see is only coming from one or two countries. I was very glad to see the statements over the weekend from the new [EU] Energy Commissioner [Dan] Jorgensen making very clear the need to make progress on gas phaseout, on nuclear, on all forms of dependency on Russian energy, in line with the EU goal of getting to zero by 2027. Obviously, Brussels and Kyiv need to make some decisions in the next couple of weeks. But I think long-term it is very clear that the energy and gas trade in particular has been the principal vector of Russian influence on the Ukrainian economy since independence. So why on earth would anybody be interested in extending that relationship? VOA: Europe has been buying more LNG from Russia. Are there any plans to have more sanctions on Russian LNG projects? Pyatt: We welcome Europe's steps. Just today [Dec. 15], the 15th sanctions package, which is quite substantial. I have said publicly on a couple of occasions recently that there will be more coming from the Biden administration. I'm very confident of that. And we're working very hard to maintain alignment between Washington, Brussels, London. That's part of what I was doing in Europe two weeks ago. Everybody's pace of operations is slightly different. ... I was glad to see Commissioner Jorgensen also talk about the important role of American LNG as part of Europe's energy solution. So, I'm very confident that we are going to continue to tighten the noose. We're going to do everything that we can to drive down [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's energy revenues, which go to pay for the North Korean missiles and the Russian drones that are destroying Ukrainian civilian infrastructure every day of the week. VOA: When we look into the next year, the U.S. support for Ukraine might go down. Do you think that Europe and other allies are ready to step up and continue supporting Ukrainian energy? Pyatt: Everybody is already stepping up. As I think you saw Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken just signed with [Ukrainian] Foreign Minister [Andrii] Sybiha a second energy [Memorandum of Understanding]. This is for the implementation of $825 million in additional energy sector assistance just from the United States. … That very high level of U.S. assistance is exceeded by the assistance that has come from the other G7-plus partners. This is a really important point that it's not just the United States that's providing this assistance, and in fact, the majority of assistance in the energy sector has come from the other G7-plus countries. VOA: In the MOU there's a lot of attention going to the protection of Ukrainian companies from political influence. How important are reforms in Ukraine even during the war? Pyatt: Well, as you know, I've been working on these reform issues for 10 years now. So I can appreciate the progress that has been achieved, and that progress is real. Look for instance at the improved production numbers at Naftogaz. Maybe that improved production is because of better management; maybe it's because production that was previously skimmed off is now being declared transparently. But either way, it's a positive outcome. There's more that needs to be done. … Ukraine will not become a member of the European Union in one day, but I think fulfilling the aspirations that the Ukrainian people expressed during the revolution of dignity, when I was ambassador in Kyiv, is as important today as it's ever been, and aligning Ukraine's energy sector with the highest European and OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) standards is very much part and parcel of that larger process of becoming a member of the EU.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voa-interview-us-urges-europe-to-end-energy-dependency-on-russia/7904825.html	2024-12-17T12:56:48-08:00

IT consultant found guilty in San Francisco stabbing death of Cash App founder	SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA — A San Francisco jury on Tuesday found a tech consultant guilty of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee, which carries a sentence of 16 years to life. Jurors took seven days to deliver their verdict against Nima Momeni in the April 4, 2023, death of Lee, a beloved tech mogul who was found staggering on a deserted downtown street, dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. Lee, 43, later died at a hospital. 'We think justice was done here today,' the victim's brother, Tim Oliver Lee, told reporters. 'What matters today is that we had a guilty verdict and Nima Momeni is going away for a very long time.' Prosecutors said Momeni planned the attack on Lee, driving him to an isolated spot under the Bay Bridge and stabbing him three times with a knife he took from his sister's kitchen. They say Momeni was angry with Lee for introducing his younger sister to a drug dealer she says gave her GHB and other drugs and then sexually assaulted her. But Momeni testified on the stand that Lee was the one who attacked him with a knife, angry after the tech consultant chided him about spending more time with his family instead of searching for a strip club that night. Momeni, who studies martial arts, claimed self-defense and said he didn't realize he had fatally wounded Lee or that Lee was even hurt. The case has drawn national attention, partly given Lee's status in the tech world. Momeni, 40, has been in custody since his arrest in April 2023, when he was charged with murder in the first degree. Jurors received the case, which started Oct. 14, on Dec. 4. Lee had created mobile payment service Cash App and was the chief product officer of the cryptocurrency MobileCoin when he died. He had moved to Miami from the San Francisco Bay Area, where his ex-wife Krista Lee lives with their two children.	https://www.voanews.com/a/it-consultant-found-guilty-in-stabbing-death-of-cash-app-founder/7904653.html	2024-12-17T10:48:59-08:00	
Damaged Russian ships spill estimated 3,700 tons of oil in Kerch Strait, state media say	MOSCOW — An estimated 3,700 tons of low-grade fuel oil had spilled into the Kerch Strait after two Russian ships were seriously damaged by stormy weather, Russian state media reported Monday. The two ships, the Volgoneft-239 and the Volgoneft-212, were transporting roughly 9,200 tons of mazut, a heavy, low-quality oil product. Social media footage from the scene showed a black liquid rising among the waves. Preliminary estimates say that 3,700 tons of mazut leaked into the sea, Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti reported, citing an unnamed source. In a statement, the leader of Russia’s nearby Krasnodar region, Governor Veniamin Kondratev, said that the oil had not yet reached the shore. An emergency rescue operation was launched Sunday after the Volgoneft-212 tanker ran aground and had its bow torn away in storm conditions, Russia’s Emergency Situations Ministry said. One sailor in the 13-man crew died, officials said. A second tanker, the Volgoneft-239, was also left damaged and adrift with 14 crewmembers on board. It later ran aground 80 meters from shore, close to the port of Taman in Russia’s Krasnodar region, from where the sailors were later rescued. Russian officials confirmed the oil spill Sunday, but they said that experts were still working to assess its full impact and extent. In a statement, Greenpeace Ukraine said they will monitor the situation. The charity has had no presence in Russia since 2023, when it was designated as an 'undesirable organization' by the Russian government. 'Any oil or petrochemical spill in these waters has the potential to be serious,' said Dr. Paul Johnston, head of Greenpeace Research Laboratories, based at the University of Exeter in the U.K. 'It is likely to be driven by prevailing wind and currents and in the current weather conditions (it) is likely to be extremely difficult to contain. If it is driven ashore, then it will cause fouling of the shoreline which will be extremely difficult to clean up.' The Kerch Strait separates the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula from Russia and is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to seize control of the area illegally. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the office of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, described the oil spill as a 'large-scale environmental disaster' of the war and called for additional sanctions on Russian tankers. 'The accidents on two rusty vessels in the Kerch Strait resulted in another large-scale environmental disaster of our war. Thousands of tons of fuel oil spilled from the Volgoneft-212 and Volgoneft-239, causing tragic damage to the natural systems of the Azov and Black Seas,' he wrote in a post Monday on social media platform X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/damaged-russian-ships-spill-estimated-3-700-tons-of-oil-in-kerch-strait-state-media-say-/7904652.html	2024-12-17T10:48:29-08:00

Cyclone Chido kills at least 34 in Mozambique	MAPUTO, MOZAMBIQUE — At least 34 people were killed and 43 injured when Cyclone Chido smashed into three northern provinces of Mozambique on Sunday and Monday. The head of the country’s disaster management agency says the numbers are preliminary, as rescue teams search through rubble. After visiting the affected areas late Monday, the chair of Mozambique’s National Institute for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction, Luisa Meque, said around 2.5 million people were affected by the cyclone. Several districts in Cabo Delgado province, including the capital Pemba, were hit hard by the cyclone, and teams on the ground are reporting significant damage. The cyclone made landfall Sunday in Mecufi, a district in the province of Cabo Delgado, and destruction in the area was near total, with 100% of homes damaged and very few structures still standing. Canjar Amade told VOA via WhatsApp that he lived through the cyclone tearing apart his house. He said the wind took the sheets off during the night, and the house fell down Monday morning. Meteorologist Acacio Tembe from the national weather agency said the provinces of Niassa and Cabo Delgado, as well as other parts of Mozambique, are still getting hit by remnants of the storm, including rains and strong winds. The system, which also hit Malawi and the island of Mayotte, is expected to dissipate near Zimbabwe by late Tuesday. Mozambique is considered one of the countries most severely affected by global climate change. During the rainy season, which runs from October to April, it experiences cyclical floods and tropical cyclones. Experts say with a potential La Nina effect in southern Africa in early 2025, the frequency and intensity of heavy rains and tropical cyclones is expected to increase in the Indian Ocean, with floods expected in areas currently affected by drought.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cyclone-chido-kills-at-least-34-in-mozambique/7904521.html	2024-12-17T09:28:31-08:00	
Nigeria investigates nearly 800 suspects arrested in massive cybercrime raid	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigeria's anti-corruption agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, says it is investigating nearly 800 suspects arrested for alleged internet fraud during a massive raid last week in Lagos. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission says this is the greatest number of arrests it has ever made during a single raid. EFCC spokesman Wilson Uwujaren told VOA on Tuesday that the raid followed months of intelligence work and surveillance. The 792 suspects, including 193 foreigners, mostly Chinese, were nabbed December 10 in a seven-story building believed to be a 'hustle kingdom' - a place where people are trained to carry out cybercrimes. Uwujaren said the foreigners were recruiting Nigerians there and training them on romance and investment scams targeting victims from North America and Europe. 'For us it's a testament to the fact that we're unrelenting in our efforts to ensure that financial crimes wherever they exist in the country are checked. And then this current operation for us is an eye opener because of the large number of foreigners involved which is an indication that the perception of Nigerians as fraudulent people may not be true. We have a number of foreigners now coming to Nigeria to perpetrate frauds that are ascribed to Nigerians,' he said. The EFCC recovered hundreds of computers, phones and vehicles during the raid. The commission says it is collaborating with international partners to determine whether the suspects are linked to a broader network of internet fraud cells. Cybercrime is a growing problem in Nigeria. In April, a report by a coalition of researchers from the Universities of Oxford and New South Wales ranked Nigeria fifth in the world for cybercrime activities, behind only Russia, Ukraine, China, and the United States. Lack of economic opportunities, inadequate cyber security awareness and poor law enforcement are the reasons the trend is rising in Nigeria, according to cybersecurity analyst Abayomi Adeyanju. 'There are very good IT [information technology] people with skills, and then they graduate from universities, study, get certifications and there are no jobs for them, and they would have to [eat]. I am not one to encourage crime but these people - their skills can be used,' he said. Adeyanju said beyond prosecuting offenders, Nigeria must create more opportunities in the tech sector to significantly curb cybercrimes. 'If we can fix employment issues, these people are not being gainfully used. The skill is just there and so, if they have nothing to eat, the instinct of humans first is survival, so I think the first thing that should be done is that the economy should be fixed and then more employment opportunities be created,' he said. The EFCC said the suspects will be brought into court to face charges in the coming days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-investigates-nearly-800-suspects-arrested-in-massive-cybercrime-raid/7904519.html	2024-12-17T09:27:25-08:00	
EU investigates TikTok over Romanian presidential election	LONDON — European Union regulators said Tuesday they're investigating whether TikTok breached the bloc's digital rulebook by failing to deal with risks to Romania's presidential election, which has been thrown into turmoil over allegations of electoral violations and Russian meddling. The European Commission is escalating its scrutiny of the popular video-sharing platform after Romania's top court canceled results of the first round of voting that resulted in an unknown far-right candidate becoming the front-runner. The court made its unprecedented decision after authorities in the European Union and NATO member country declassified documents alleging Moscow organized a sprawling social media campaign to promote a long-shot candidate, Calin Georgescu. 'Following serious indications that foreign actors interfered in the Romanian presidential elections by using TikTok, we are now thoroughly investigating whether TikTok has violated the Digital Services Act by failing to tackle such risks,' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a press release. 'It should be crystal clear that in the EU, all online platforms, including TikTok, must be held accountable.' The European Commission is the 27-nation European Union's executive arm and enforces the bloc's Digital Services Act, a sweeping set of regulations intended to clean up social media platforms and protect users from risks such as election-related misinformation. It ordered TikTok earlier this month to retain all information related to the election. In the preliminary round of voting on Nov. 24 Georgescu was an outsider among the 13 candidates but ended up topping the polls. He was due to face a pro-EU reformist rival in a runoff before the court canceled the results. The declassified files alleged that there was an 'aggressive promotion campaign' to boost Georgescu's popularity, including payments worth a total of $381,000 to TikTok influencers to promote him on the platform. TikTok said it has 'protected the integrity' of its platform over 150 elections around the world and is continuing to address these 'industry-wide challenges.' 'TikTok has provided the European Commission with extensive information regarding these efforts, and we have transparently and publicly detailed our robust actions,' it said in a statement. The commission said its investigation will focus on TikTok's content recommendation systems, especially on risks related to 'coordinated inauthentic manipulation or automated exploitation.' It's also looking at TikTok's policies on political advertisements and 'paid-for political content.' TikTok said it doesn't accept paid political ads and 'proactively' removes content for violating policies on misinformation. The investigation could result in TikTok making changes to fix problems or fines worth up to 6% of the company's total global revenue.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-investigates-tiktok-over-romanian-presidential-election/7904485.html	2024-12-17T09:02:41-08:00	
US targets North Korean money laundering network with sanctions	Washington — The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on two people and one entity based in the United Arab Emirates, accusing them of being involved in a network that launders millions of dollars generated by IT workers and cybercrimes to support the North Korean government. The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement that the two people hit with sanctions worked through a UAE-based front company to facilitate money laundering and cryptocurrency conversion services that funneled the illicit proceeds back to Pyongyang. North Korea's mission to the United Nations didn't immediately return a message seeking comment. Tuesday's action comes as Washington seeks to cut off funding for North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, the Treasury said. 'As the DPRK continues to use complex criminal schemes to fund its WMD and ballistic missile programs — including through the exploitation of digital assets — Treasury remains focused on disrupting the networks that facilitate this flow of funds to the regime,' Treasury Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley Smith said in the statement. Tuesday's move targeted UAE-based Chinese nationals Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian as well as UAE-based Green Alpine Trading LLC. It freezes any of their U.S. assets and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. Those that engage in certain transactions with them also risk being hit with sanctions. The Emirati embassy in Washington didn't immediately return a message seeking comment. Reuters could not immediately locate contact details for Green Alpine Trading, Lu or Zhang.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-targets-north-korean-money-laundering-network-with-sanctions/7904463.html	2024-12-17T08:35:12-08:00	
Russian lawmakers approve new bill expanding definition of high treason	MOSCOW — Russian lawmakers on Tuesday approved a bill that broadened the definition of high treason, part of authorities' efforts to tighten control as the fighting in Ukraine is nearing the three-year mark. The amendments approved by the lower house, the State Duma, in second and third readings expand the definition of high treason to include affiliation with any organization involved in 'activities against security of the Russian Federation.' The current legislation has a more narrow interpretation of 'turning to the enemy side,' defining it as joining the enemy's armed forces. Those convicted of high treason could be sentenced to life in prison. 'In the situation when our soldiers are risking their lives in the battle for Russia's sovereignty, there are no 'neutral' or 'peaceful' organizations on the enemy side,' said Vasily Piskarev, head of the Duma's security affairs committee and one of the bill's authors. 'We can't allow anyone to work for the enemy on our territory.' Rights advocates have warned that the bill's vague formulation could be used to target anyone who has ties to any Ukrainian organization and potentially could be interpreted more broadly to also punish those who have any contact with Western organizations or companies. The legal definition of treason already has been expanded to include providing vaguely defined 'assistance' to foreign countries or organizations. The proposed amendments, which also must be approved by the upper house and signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin to become law, also introduce punishment of up to 15 years in prison for foreigners and people without citizenship who are accused of 'assisting enemy activities aimed against security of the Russian Federation.' Treason and espionage cases have skyrocketed after Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. The cases have targeted a wide range of suspects, from Kremlin critics and independent journalists to scientists, drawing attention from rights groups.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-lawmakers-approve-new-bill-expanding-definition-of-high-treason/7904450.html	2024-12-17T08:34:05-08:00	
Alabama woman doing well after latest experimental pig kidney transplant	NEW YORK — An Alabama woman is recovering well after a pig kidney transplant last month that freed her from eight years of dialysis, the latest effort to save human lives with animal organs. Towana Looney is the fifth American given a gene-edited pig organ — and notably, she isn't as sick as prior recipients who died within two months of receiving a pig kidney or heart. 'It's like a new beginning,' Looney, 53, told The Associated Press. Right away, 'the energy I had was amazing. To have a working kidney — and to feel it — is unbelievable.' Looney's surgery marks an important step as scientists get ready for formal studies of xenotransplantation expected to begin next year, said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led the highly experimental procedure. Looney is recuperating well after her transplant, which was announced Tuesday. She was discharged from the hospital 11 days after surgery to continue recovery in a nearby apartment although temporarily readmitted this week while her medications are adjusted. Doctors expect her to return home to Alabama in three months. If the pig kidney were to fail, she could begin dialysis again. 'To see hope restored to her and her family is extraordinary,' said Dr. Jayme Locke, Looney's original surgeon who secured Food and Drug Administration permission for the Nov. 25 transplant. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney. Thousands die waiting and many more who need a transplant never qualify. Now, searching for an alternate supply, scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike. Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later a complication during pregnancy caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed. It's incredibly rare for living donors to develop kidney failure although those who do are given extra priority on the transplant list. But Looney couldn't get a match — she had developed antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney. Tests showed she'd reject every kidney donors have offered. Then Looney heard about pig kidney research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and told Locke, at the time a UAB transplant surgeon, she'd like to try one. In April 2023, Locke filed an FDA application seeking an emergency experiment, under rules for people like Looney who are out of options. The FDA didn't agree right away. Instead, the world's first gene-edited pig kidney transplants went to two sicker patients last spring, at Massachusetts General Hospital and NYU. Both also had serious heart disease. The Boston patient recovered enough to spend about a month at home before dying of sudden cardiac arrest deemed unrelated to the pig kidney. NYU's patient had heart complications that damaged her pig kidney, forcing its removal, and she later died. Those disappointing outcomes didn't dissuade Looney, who was starting to feel worse on dialysis but, Locke said, hadn't developed heart disease or other complications. The FDA eventually allowed her transplant at NYU, where Locke collaborated with Montgomery. Even if her new organ fails, doctors can learn from it, Looney told the AP: 'You don't know if it's going to work or not until you try.' Blacksburg, Virginia-based Revivicor provided Looney's new kidney from a pig with 10 gene alterations. Moments after Montgomery sewed it into place, the kidney turned a healthy pink and began producing urine. Looney was initially discharged on Dec. 6, wearing monitors to track her blood pressure, heart rate and other bodily functions and returning to the hospital for daily checkups before her medication readmission. Doctors scrutinize her bloodwork and other tests, comparing them to prior research in animals and a few humans in hopes of spotting an early warning if problems crop up. 'A lot of what we're seeing, we're seeing for the first time,' Montgomery said. During a visit last week with Locke, who now works for the federal government, Looney hugged her longtime doctor, saying, 'Thank you for not giving up on me.' 'Never,' Locke responded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/alabama-woman-doing-well-after-latest-experimental-pig-kidney-transplant/7904331.html	2024-12-17T08:12:10-08:00	
Australia deals with Pacific nations aim to curb China’s influence	Taipei, Taiwan — Australia signed two multi-million dollar deals with Nauru and Papua New Guinea last week that analysts say will help Canberra counter China’s growing influence in the Pacific. The deals, which support development in Nauru and pledge to pour hundreds of millions over the next 10 years into the establishment of a rugby team in Papua New Guinea, also give Australia some power to prevent the two island nations from signing security-related deals with China. Beijing has been aggressively expanding its cooperation with islands in the Pacific in recent years, to the concern of Australia, the U.S. and other allies in the region. Under the multi-million dollar deal that Australia signed on December 9 with Nauru, Canberra will offer $89 million to the Pacific Island country over five years, providing key development support in banking, telecommunication, and security. In exchange, Australia can veto any engagements by third countries in the Pacific island country’s security and critical infrastructure sectors. During a signing ceremony at Australia’s Parliament House on December 9, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the agreement as 'a serious responsibility and a sign of the enduring respect between our two nations.' Nauruan President David Adeang said the treaty would help his country, which faces serious financial challenges, strengthen its economy and address critical challenges. Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands program at Lowy Institute in Australia, says Australia has to make such agreements despite the cost. 'China has an increasing security access to the Pacific, whether through policing, or military land, air or sea assets, and that raises the cost of Australia’s defense posture,' Sora told VOA in a video interview. 'Locking in this legal agreement with Nauru is one part of the effort to maintain Australia’s access and to deny China’s access to that space.' Last week, Australia also struck a deal with Papua New Guinea, or PNG, that will see Canberra provide $384 million over 10 years to help the Pacific Island country set up a rugby team that will start competing in Australia’s national rugby league in 2028. The funding is also expected to help build a compound to accommodate players and offer tax breaks to recruit players. In return, PNG signed a separate pact that reaffirms Australia as the country’s major security partner. While many details of the two agreements remain confidential, analysts and media outlets briefed by Canberra said the deals allow Australia to withdraw funding for the rugby team if PNG signs a security agreement with a country outside the so-called 'Pacific Family,' which excludes China. 'We know from briefings with government officials and media reports that there is a security commitment that PNG has agreed to not to sign a policing or military deal with China,' Sora told VOA. Some PNG analysts say the agreement is part of Australia’s attempt to build closer ties with PNG’s civil society. 'Australia realized that all this aid and budgetary support that it has been giving to PNG hasn’t translated into buying support for them at the grassroots level and since a lot of people in PNG support Australian rugby teams, [Canberra] picks a sport that a good portion of the PNG population is crazy over, with a hope that it could generate more support for Australia at the grassroots level in PNG,' Michael Kabuni, an analyst who previously taught at the University of Papua New Guinea, told VOA in a video interview. During a ceremony announcing the deal in Sydney on December 12, PNG Prime Minister James Marape said the agreement could help his country foster domestic unity and unite PNG and Australia together 'in ways that matter most, people to people.' Analysts say the agreements with Nauru and PNG are part of the more 'assertive' diplomatic push in the Pacific that Australia initiated in 2022 after China signed a secretive security agreement with the Solomon Islands. 'Australia and a lot of its allies, including the United States, were caught off guard with the security deal between the Solomon Islands and China, and by signing the deals with these Pacific Island countries, Canberra demonstrates that it wants to show itself as the partner of choice, and some of the Pacific states are responding,' Henryk Szadziewski, an expert on Pacific affairs at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, told VOA by phone. While Australia may limit China’s security presence in the Pacific region through these deals, Szadziewski said Pacific island countries can still deepen relations with Beijing in other sectors, including education and trade. 'The ways that Chinese companies can enter the economic sector in the Pacific region are not excluded by these deals and this has been a key way for China to make inroads in the Pacific region in terms of influence,' he added. VOA reached out to the Chinese foreign ministry and the Chinese embassy in Australia for comment but has yet to receive a response. During a meeting with Samoa’s prime minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa in Beijing last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China 'is willing to make empowering Pacific island countries to tackle climate change a priority in its cooperation with these countries.' Now that Australia has obtained some power to veto security deals in some Pacific countries, Sora said Canberra has to ensure its own priorities don’t overshadow Pacific island countries’ interests and needs. 'Canberra has retained the security manager role [in the Pacific] so the challenge is to demonstrate that Pacific countries’ security needs aren’t subordinate and their own priorities don’t come after Australia’s interests,' he told VOA. Australia’s focus will be 'proving to Pacific countries that their security needs will now be better met as a result of these agreements because anything short of that will leave themselves open to criticism,' Sora added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-deals-with-pacific-nations-aim-to-curb-china-s-influence/7904314.html	2024-12-17T06:56:57-08:00

Ugandan court asks government to pay LRA war crimes' victims	Kampala — A Ugandan International Crimes Division Court has ordered the Ugandan government to pay reparations to war crimes victims affected by atrocities committed by former Lord’s Resistance Army commander Thomas Kwoyelo. The judges argue the order is based on both international and domestic law considering Kwoyelo, 50, has no funds. Kwoyelo was captured in 2009 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and held in detention until a court found him guilty in August of murder, kidnap with intent to murder, pillaging, cruel treatment, torture, rape, and crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison in October. The LRA, founded in 1986 by Joseph Kony, led a more than 20-year insurgency against the Ugandan government and is accused of carrying out multiple massacres. Kony remains at large. Justice Duncan Gaswaga said the court declaration is not based on fault or vicarious liability but on principles of collective responsibility. 'Atrocities committed on a scale warranting transitional justice is considered a manifestation of a failure on the part of the government that triggers a responsibility for the state to pay reparations to the victims,' said Gaswaga. Transitional justice is a set of policies or mechanisms to address the aftermath of large-scale human rights abuses and sometimes political instability. The office of the Ugandan Attorney General, the government's representative, reiterated its argument that the government is not liable to compensate for crimes committed by private actors and that reparations sought are matters of policy. Speaking to VOA by phone, Silas Aogon, a lawmaker from Northern Uganda, says the draft Transitional Justice Bill has been in the offing since 2019 but has not been brought before Parliament for consideration. He says the bill would address accountability, reparations, institutional reforms, and enable truth telling. Aogon faults the delayed justice on a number of weaknesses. 'There is already institutional weakness, legislative weakness, oversight weakness, given the kind of situation that we have in the country,' he said. 'The kind of polarization that the country went through. The kind of human and other injustices that occurred in society. The social unrest. We needed a strong law, and we needed the Transitional Justice Bill to be passed into law as soon as possible.' The court declarations include $2,700 to be paid to families of each deceased person, $1,000 to those who suffered physical injuries, $950 for each victim household of property loss and $1,350 for victims of gender-based violence such as rape, forced marriage, forced labor and other physical abuse. Lawmaker Betty Ocan says they have been pushing for this bill for a year, and fears they are running out of time since the current Parliament ends in 2026 and passing the Transitional Justice Bill doesn’t seem to be a priority. 'We need the bill to be worked on to come to an Act of Parliament. In order for our victims also to have, you know, fair compensation,' she said. 'You know, this Parliament is also a difficult one. Instead of prioritizing things which are really for the people, sometimes we prioritize things which are for the president [Yoweri Museveni]. So, we will continue to push.' The court’s judges noted their inability to enforce orders in this matter, stating that the establishment of a trust fund for victims, provisions for an annual budget for victims, and a draft implementation plan to serve the victims, all hinge on parliament.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ugandan-court-asks-government-to-pay-lra-war-crimes-victims-/7904267.html	2024-12-17T06:43:06-08:00

Lawyer accused of being Chinese spy loses legal case against UK intel agency	London — A lawyer accused of trying to interfere in British politics on behalf of the Chinese government has lost a legal challenge against the U.K.'s domestic intelligence agency MI5. Britain's Security Service issued a security alert to all lawmakers in January 2022, warning that London-based lawyer Christine Lee was knowingly engaged in 'political interference activities in the U.K.' in coordination with the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work Department, an organization known to exert Chinese influence abroad. The House of Commons' Speaker warned at the time that Lee had 'facilitated' covert donations to British political parties and legislators 'on behalf of foreign nationals.' Members of Parliament are required to declare the source of donations they receive, which must be from U.K.-registered electors or entities. Lee's firm, Christine Lee & Co., provided legal services mainly to the British Chinese community and had acted as a legal advisor to the Chinese embassy in London. Her son, Daniel Wilkes, worked for lawmaker Barry Gardiner as a diary manager for five years, while she had donated some 500,000 pounds ($635,000) to Gardiner, mostly for office costs, according to official records. Lee, who was not accused of a criminal offense, brought a legal action, arguing that the security alert against her was political and that it breached her human rights. On Tuesday, three judges at the Investigatory Powers Tribunal unanimously dismissed her claim, saying MI5 had issued the warning for 'legitimate reasons.' The tribunal decision came the day after British authorities named Chinese national Yang Tengbo as an alleged spy who cultivated close ties with Prince Andrew and sought to exert influence among British establishment figures on behalf of China's United Front Work Department. Yang, 50, also known as Chris Yang, was banned from entering the U.K. last year after MI5 found that he was believed to have carried out 'covert and deceptive activity' for China. Authorities said his relationship with the royal had a covert nature, citing correspondence that referenced getting people 'unnoticed in and out of the house of Windsor.' Yang strongly denied the claims. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Tuesday called the spying allegations against Yang 'ridiculous,' while the Chinese Embassy in Britain condemned U.K. lawmakers for 'smearing' China. 'We urge the UK side to immediately stop creating trouble, stop anti-China political manipulations, and stop undermining normal personnel exchanges between China and the UK,' a statement released on the embassy's website said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lawyer-accused-of-being-chinese-spy-loses-legal-case-against-uk-intel-agency/7904203.html	2024-12-17T05:40:37-08:00	
Japan targets 40-50% power supply from renewable energy by 2040	Tokyo — Japan wants renewable energy to account for up to 50% of its electricity mix by fiscal year 2040 with nuclear power taking up another 20%, according to a draft of its revised basic energy policy, as it makes a clean energy push while meeting rising power demand. As the world's second-largest importer of liquefied natural gas and a major consumer of Middle Eastern oil, Japan and its basic energy plans are drawing global attention from oil, gas and coal producers. Thermal power usage, particularly from inefficient coal-fired power plants, is set to decrease to between 30% and 40% by 2040 from 68.6% in 2023, although the draft energy policy does not specify the breakdown of coal, gas and oil. 'It is necessary to utilize LNG-fired power as a realistic means of transition, and the government and the private sector must jointly secure the necessary long-term LNG contracts in preparation for risks such as price hikes and supply disruptions,' the draft said. The industry ministry's policy draft unveiled on Tuesday proposes increasing renewables to between 40% and 50% of power supplies in the 2040 fiscal year, roughly doubling the 22.9% share in the 2023 fiscal year and exceeding the 2030 target of between 36% and 38%. Japan's 2040 nuclear power target is in line with the 2030 target of between 20% and 22%, despite the challenges faced by the industry after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Nuclear power accounted for 8.5% of the country's power supply in 2023. The new energy plan removes the previous target of 'reducing reliance on nuclear power as much as possible' and includes plans to build innovative next-generation reactors at nuclear power sites owned by operators who have decided to decommission existing reactors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-targets-40-50-power-supply-from-renewable-energy-by-2040-/7904135.html	2024-12-17T05:35:43-08:00	
Japan, India startups to study laser-equipped satellite to tackle space debris	Tokyo — Space startups in Japan and India said on Tuesday they had agreed to jointly study using laser-equipped satellites to remove debris from orbit, an experimental approach to the increasingly imminent problem of orbital congestion. Tokyo-based Orbital Lasers and Indian robotics company InspeCity said they would study business opportunities for in-space services such as de-orbiting a defunct satellite and extending a spacecraft's life. Carved out from Japanese satellite giant SKY Perfect this year, Orbital Lasers is building a system that will use laser energy to stop the rotation of space junk by vaporizing small parts of its surface, making it easier for a servicing spacecraft to rendezvous. Orbital Lasers plans to demonstrate the system in space and supply it to operators after 2027, said Aditya Baraskar, the company's global business lead. It can be mounted on InspeCity satellites if the companies clear regulatory requirements in India and Japan, Baraskar added. The companies said they had signed a preliminary agreement to initiate the collaboration. InspeCity was founded in 2022 and raised $1.5 million last year, while Orbital Lasers has raised $5.8 million since it was established in January. A United Nations panel on space traffic coordination in late October said that urgent action was necessary to track and manage objects in low Earth orbit because of the rapid increase in satellites and space junk. There are already more than 100 companies in the space servicing market as satellite constellations expand, Nobu Okada, chief executive of Japanese debris mitigation pioneer Astroscale, said earlier this year. The project is the latest example of collaboration between Japan and India, whose governments are working together on the joint Lunar Polar Exploration (LUPEX) mission, which could launch as early as 2026. Indian rocket maker Skyroot and satellite builder HEX20 are also working with Japanese moon exploration firm ispace on a future lunar orbiter mission. The two countries' commercial space tie-ups have been driven by Japanese satellite data solutions for India's disaster management and agriculture, and can expand to more fields such as manufacturing, said Masayasu Ishida, chief executive of Tokyo-based nonprofit SPACETIDE, which has hosted space business conferences since 2015. 'The key is finding where and how to build complementary relationships' that align with national policies such as Make in India, which aims to boost local production, Ishida said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-india-startups-to-study-laser-equipped-satellite-to-tackle-space-debris-/7904129.html	2024-12-17T04:58:09-08:00	
Russia sells out of vast Kazakh uranium deposits to China	Moscow — Kazakhstan's state-controlled nuclear resources company said on Tuesday that Russia's state Rosatom corporation was selling its stakes in vast uranium deposits that it had been developing with the world's largest uranium producer. Kazatomprom said that Rosatom unit, Uranium One Group, had sold its 49.979% stake in the Zarechnoye mine to SNURDC Astana Mining Company Limited, whose ultimate beneficiary is China's State Nuclear Uranium Resources Development Company. Uranium One Group is also expected to give up 30% in the Khorasan-U joint venture to China Uranium Development Company Limited, the ultimate beneficiary of which is China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN, China), Kazatomprom said. Kazatomprom's stakes will remain unchanged, it said. Zarechnoye's uranium reserves amounted to approximately 3,500 tons at the beginning of 2024, according to Kazatomprom. Khorasan-U operates at the Kharasan-1 block of Severny Kharasan deposit in the Zhanakorgan district of the Kyzylorda region. Uranium reserves of the deposit amounted to about 33,000 tons at the beginning of 2024, with an expected maturity in 2038, Kazatomprom said. Rosatom did not immediately comment. Uranium One produced 4,831 tons of uranium in Kazakhstan in 2023. Kazatomprom is the world's largest producer of uranium and has the largest reserve base. It accounted for approximately 20% of global primary uranium production in 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-sells-out-of-vast-kazakh-uranium-deposits-to-china-/7904119.html	2024-12-17T04:51:11-08:00	
France to impose nighttime curfew on 'devastated' Mayotte	Saint-Denis de la Reunion, France — France said it will impose a nighttime curfew on the Indian Ocean island of Mayotte starting on Tuesday evening, after the French overseas territory was devastated by a cyclone feared to have killed hundreds. According to the latest official toll, 21 people are confirmed to have been killed by Cyclone Chido when it barreled into the island and its surrounding archipelago at the weekend. But authorities fear that hundreds, and possibly even thousands, were killed, once the true scale of the toll is revealed, after the rubble is cleared and roads unblocked. The health services are in tatters, power and mobile phone services have been knocked out, the airport closed to civilian flights, and there is mounting concern about how to ensure supplies of drinking water. Cyclone Chido is the latest in a string of storms worldwide fueled by climate change, according to experts. The curfew from 10:00 pm to 4:00 am local time (1900 GMT to 0100 GMT) is being put in place as a security measure to prevent looting, the French interior ministry said. 'Completely devastated' French President Emmanuel Macron, who chaired a crisis meeting on Monday night, has described the situation as a 'tragedy' and promised to visit Mayotte in the coming days. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, who on Monday was the first top Paris official to visit the island after the cyclone, said that Mayotte has been 'completely devastated,' with 70 percent of inhabitants affected. 'The toll will be heavy; too heavy,' Retailleau warned. He announced the arrival 'in the coming days' of 400 additional gendarmes to reinforce the 1,600 gendarmes and police officers present on the archipelago, while specifying that there had 'not really been any looting' so far. The 'exceptional' cyclone was super-charged by particularly warm Indian Ocean waters, meteorologist Francois Gourand of the Meteo France weather service told AFP. Mayotte is France's poorest region, with an estimated one third of the population living in shantytowns whose flimsy sheet metal-roofed homes offered scant protection against the storm. 'We're starting to run out of water. In the south, there's been no running water for five days,' said Antoy Abdallah, a resident of Tsoundzou in the territory's capital Mamoudzou. 'We're completely cut off from the world,' the 34-year-old lamented. Most of Mayotte's population is Muslim and religious tradition dictates bodies must be buried rapidly, meaning some may never be counted. And assessing the toll is further complicated by irregular immigration to Mayotte, especially from the Comoros islands to the north, meaning much of the population is not even registered. Mayotte officially has 320,000 inhabitants but authorities estimate there could be 100,000 to 200,000 more people, taking into account illegal immigration. Ousseni Balahachi, a former nurse, said some people did not dare venture out to seek assistance, 'fearing it would be a trap' designed to remove them from Mayotte. Many had stayed put 'until the last minute' when it proved too late to escape the cyclone, she added. 'Not seen for decades' Mayotte is one of several French overseas territories that span the globe from the Caribbean to the Pacific via the Indian Ocean, and are integral parts of France which are ruled from Paris. French military planes have been shuttling between Mayotte and the island of La Reunion, also a French overseas territory, to the east which was spared the cyclone and is serving as the hub for rescue efforts. The first air evacuation of 25 badly wounded from Mayotte to La Reunion took place on Monday night, Health Minister Genevieve Darrieussecq said. The disaster poses a major challenge for a national government still operating in merely a caretaker capacity, days after Macron appointed the sixth prime minister of his presidency. New Prime Minister Francois Bayrou was facing a torrent of criticism less than a week into the job after choosing to chair a provincial town hall meeting in his capacity as mayor of the city Pau instead of attending in person a crisis meeting on Mayotte called by Macron. 'In the face of such a catastrophe — of a kind that has not been seen on French territory for decades — it is important to be side-by-side with the people,' said French National Assembly speaker Yael Braun-Pivet, a member of Macron's centrist party. 'I would have preferred that the prime minister, instead of taking a plane for Pau, took a plane for Mamoudzou,' she told Franceinfo radio.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-to-impose-nighttime-curfew-on-devastated-mayotte-/7904113.html	2024-12-17T04:41:48-08:00	
Taipei mayor calls for reduced tensions during rare visit of Chinese officials	TAIPEI — The mayor of Taiwan's capital told visiting Chinese officials on Tuesday he hoped for peace and wanted less of the 'howls of ships and aircraft' around the island, saying dialog trumps confrontation. China, which views democratically-governed Taiwan as its own territory, sends warplanes and warships near the island on an almost daily basis, and held a new round of mass military activities last week. Addressing the annual Taipei Shanghai City Forum with Shanghai Vice Mayor Hua Yuan in attendance, Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an used poetic language to say he wished for peace across the Taiwan Strait. 'More dialog and less confrontation; more olive branches of peace and less sour grapes of conflict. More lights from fishing boats to adorn the sunset; less of the howls of ships and aircraft,' Chiang said. 'I always say that the more tense and difficult the moment, the more we need to communicate,' he added. China has continued to send warplanes and warships into the strait even with the forum taking place, with Taiwan's defense ministry saying on Tuesday morning that in the past 24 hours it had detected 10 military aircraft and seven warships. Chiang is from Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang, which traditionally favors close ties across the Taiwan Strait although it denies being pro-Beijing. He is widely considered a future presidential contender. The forum, first held in 2010, is one of the few high-level venues for talks between Chinese and Taiwanese officials after China cut off a regular dialog mechanism with Taiwan's central government in 2016 following the election of Tsai Ing-wen as president. Tsai, and her successor Lai Ching-te, refuse to acknowledge Beijing's position that both China and Taiwan are part of 'one China.' Lai, like Tsai, says only Taiwan's people can decide their future, rejecting Beijing's sovereignty claims. Hua told the forum he hoped for closer practical cooperation. 'Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have always been one family. We often come and go, getting closer and closer to each other,' he said. Shanghai tour group trips to Taiwan will restart, Hua added, offering his own olive branch given China has yet to allow a full post-pandemic resumption of tourism to the island. Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council said on Monday the government was showing goodwill by allowing the forum to take place even in the face of the 'still serious situation across the Taiwan Strait.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taipei-mayor-calls-for-reduced-tensions-during-rare-visit-of-chinese-officials-/7904110.html	2024-12-17T04:32:26-08:00	
Political strife erupts over South Korean court as it is set to determine fate of impeached Yoon	SEOUL — South Korea’s acting leader vowed Tuesday to convey to the world that things are back to normal following parliament’s impeachment of conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, but rival parties began squabbling over the mechanics of a court ruling to determine whether to formally unseat or reinstate him. The country’s liberal opposition-controlled parliament voted to impeach Yoon last Saturday over his short-lived Dec. 3 martial law imposition, suspending his presidential powers until the Constitutional Court determines whether to uphold or overturn the decision. If Yoon is dismissed, a national election must be held to pick his successor within two months. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who became acting leader, has taken steps to reassure the U.S. and other countries and stabilize markets. Presiding over a Cabinet Council meeting on Tuesday, Han said he will 'continuously do my utmost to inform the international society that Republic of Korea is fast regaining stability and maintain confidence with partners.' But the country’s intense political strife appears to be far from over, as the rival parties began bickering over whether to fill three vacant justices’ seats at the Constitutional Court. To formally end Yoon’s presidency, the nine-member court panel needs support from at least six justices. But since three seats remain vacant following retirements, a unanimous decision in favor of Yoon's impeachment is required to throw him out of office for good. Three of the court’s nine justices are directly appointed by the president. Three others are nominated by the Supreme Court head and another three by the National Assembly, and their formal appointments by the president has widely been a formality. The three seats that are currently open are to be nominated by the National Assembly — two by the Democratic Party and the other by Yoon’s ruling People Power Party. The court can rule on Yoon’s case only with the current six justices. But the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which led the impeachment efforts against Yoon, has said it would speed up the process of restoring the court’s nine-justice system to promote fairness and public confidence in its ruling. But PPP floor leader Kweon Seong-dong, a Yoon loyalist, created a stir Tuesday as he voiced his objection to a Democratic Party push to fill the three vacancies. He said it would be inappropriate for Han, the acting leader, to appoint justices nominated by parliament, saying such authorities solely rest with the president. 'An acting president can appoint Constitutional Court justices when there is a presidential vacancy, but not when the president’s duties are just suspended,' Kweon said. Many observers say the court’s current six-member configuration is advantageous for Yoon’s chances to return to office, as it would only require a single justice rejecting the parliament impeachment. They note Cheong Hyungsik, one of the six justices, is a clear conservative who was directly appointed by Yoon. The Democratic Party quickly dismissed Kweon’s argument as 'absurd and utterly nonsensical' and urged PPP to abide by a November agreement between the rival parties to nominate the three Constitutional Court justices. Party lawmaker and spokesperson Jo Seoung-lae said PPP has 'blatantly revealed their true intention to obstruct the constitutional trial.' There was no immediate response from Han, who during the Cabinet meeting stressed that the government will cooperate with the ruling and opposition parties to stabilize the economy. There is no clear definition about what an acting president can and cannot do over the appointments of court justices. The Democratic party accuses PPP of trying to drag out the impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court, which has up to 180 days to determine Yoon's fate. Time is a crucial issue for Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, who is favored by polls to win a presidential by-election in the event of Yoon’s ouster but grapples with his own legal troubles. Lee could possibly be prohibited from running for president if the appellate and Supreme courts uphold his lower court conviction for election law violation in November. Yoon faces allegations of rebellion and abuse of power over his martial law introduction. Investigative authorities want him to appear for questioning later this week, but officials at Yoon's office and residence on Monday refused to receive requests for his appearance. The martial law declaration, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, drew hundreds of troops who tried to encircle parliament and prevent lawmakers from voting on the decree. Many lawmakers still managed to get inside a National Assembly chamber and voted to overturn Yoon's decree unanimously, forcing Yoon's Cabinet to lift it. Yoon's decree, which harkened back to an era of past military-backed dictatorships, has sparked massive street protests calling for his ouster and resulted in his approval rating plummeting. Yoon's defense minister, police chief and several other senior military commanders have been arrested over their roles in the martial law enforcement. Supporters of Yoon worry that his early exit would severely hamper the country's conservatives and cause them to likely lose a presidential by-election to the liberals, like they did in 2017, when then-impeached conservative President Park Geun-hye was ousted and arrested over a corruption scandal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/political-strife-erupts-over-south-korean-court-as-it-is-set-to-determine-fate-of-impeached-yoon-/7904108.html	2024-12-17T04:25:12-08:00	
Israel’s defense minister envisions Israeli post-war security control in Gaza	Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Tuesday that Israel would have security control over Gaza after its war against the Hamas militant group. 'After eliminating Hamas's military and governmental capabilities in Gaza, Israel would have security control over Gaza with complete freedom of action' Katz posted on X. He compared the vision for Gaza to the situation in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces routinely conduct raids they say are aimed at disrupting terrorist activity. Israel has said its war aims include ensuring the military defeat of Hamas and ensuring militants cannot attack Israel like Hamas did in its October 2023 assault that killed 1,200 people. Israeli control of Gaza would go against the stated post-war vision of the United States, the United Nations and others. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in October that the war in Gaza needs to end 'in a way that keeps Hamas out and makes sure Israel doesn’t stay.' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in September that the U.N. envisions the Palestinian Authority, which governs some of the West Bank, would assume authority in Gaza. Gaza health officials said Tuesday that Israeli strikes had killed at least 10 people in Gaza City, while Israel’s military reported the deaths of two of its soldiers during operations in southern Gaza. In addition to those killed in the Hamas attack on Israel, the militants also took about 100 people hostage, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israeli officials in recent days have cited optimism about a potential breakthrough in long-stalled talks to secure a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages still held by the militants. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 people, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and fighters in its count but has previously said more than half of those killed have been women and children. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and others. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-defense-minister-envisions-israeli-post-war-security-control-in-gaza-/7904094.html	2024-12-17T04:10:26-08:00	
US hits North Korea and Russia with new sanctions, Treasury says	Washington — The United States hit North Korea and Russia on Monday with new sanctions targeting Pyongyang's financial and military support to Moscow as well as its ballistic missile program. The sanctions, which list North Korean banks, generals and other officials, as well as Russian oil shipping companies, are the latest U.S. measure aimed at disrupting North Korea's support to Russia's war in Ukraine. The North Korean banks targeted include Golden Triangle Bank, one of the biggest banks in the northeastern Rason Special Economic Zone, and Pyongyang-based Korea Mandal Credit Bank, which has representatives throughout China, the Treasury Department said in a statement. South Korea's foreign ministry separately said on Tuesday that it has blacklisted 11 individuals and 15 entities linked to illicit military cooperation between North Korea and Russia. The responses came as 10 countries, including the U.S., South Korea, Australia, Britain, France and Japan, as well as the European Union, issued a joint statement on Tuesday condemning Pyongyang and Moscow's military ties 'in the strongest possible terms.' The statement said North Korea's support for Russia's war against Ukraine was a 'dangerous expansion of the conflict' and a 'flagrant violation' of United Nations' sanctions. It urged the country to withdraw its troops from Russia. Pyongyang and Moscow have ramped up diplomatic and economic ties in recent years, culminating in Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to North Korea in June when the countries' leaders agreed a mutual defense pact. Military cooperation between the two countries has been met by international alarm, with Washington, Kyiv and Seoul condemning North Korea for sending military equipment and more than 10,000 troops to support Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. North Korea's actions, including its most recent test of a long-range ballistic missile and its deepening military support to Russia, undermine the stability of the region and sustain Putin's war in Ukraine, said Bradley Smith, acting Under Secretary of the U.S. Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence. 'The United States remains committed to disrupting the illicit procurement and facilitation networks that enable these destabilizing activities,' he said. The officials sanctioned by both Washington and Seoul include North Korean generals leading tens of thousands of North Korean troops in Russia, including Kim Yong Bok, who has appeared at seven events with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this year, including special forces exercises. South Korea separately blacklisted the North's special forces unit known as the Storm Corps, also in Russia fighting against Ukraine, and its chief, Ri Pong Chun. Ukraine said on Monday that at least 30 North Korean soldiers had been killed or injured in combat in Russia's Kursk region over the weekend. It said that Moscow began deploying them in the southern region in significant numbers last week to conduct assaults on Ukrainian forces. Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk in August. Kyiv estimates there are 11,000 North Koreans in total, adding to a force of tens of thousands of Russians. Russia has neither confirmed nor denied the presence of North Koreans on its side. Oil and gas to the North The Treasury sanctions freeze the U.S. assets of the designated entities, ban their trade with Americans, and block them from transactions with the U.S. financial system. The Treasury blacklisted Russia-based foreign trade companies that it said were shipping oil and gas to North Korea. The companies include Vostok Trading, DV Ink, and Novosibirskoblgaz. Treasury said they began shipping 'thousands of tons of oil and gas' to North Korea beginning in 2022 and continuing through at least April 2024. North Korea has likely received more than 1 million barrels of oil from Russia over an eight-month period this year in breach of U.N. sanctions, according to an analysis of satellite imagery published in November by the British-based Open Source Centre and the BBC. North Korean oil tankers have made more than 40 visits to Russia's Far Eastern port of Vostochny since March, the report on the research group Open Source Centre's website said. The sanctions also targeted Sibregiongaz, AO, the Russia-based parent company and 100% owner of Novosibirskoblgaz. They also hit Okryu Trading Company, or Okryu, a North Korea-based foreign trade company that Treasury said has received thousands of tons of oil shipments from Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-hits-north-korea-and-russia-with-new-sanctions-treasury-says-/7904085.html	2024-12-17T03:55:37-08:00	
South Korean authorities make new attempt to raid presidential office, Yonhap reports	Seoul — South Korean authorities made a new attempt on Tuesday to search the presidential office and obtain evidence as part of a probe into the legality of President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived bid to impose martial law, the Yonhap news agency reported. Yoon was impeached on Saturday over his martial law decree and suspended from his presidential duties. A joint investigation team including police and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) was trying to access computer servers of the presidential office's security service to get records of phones including one used by the police commissioner, Yonhap said, citing the team. This would be the second time authorities have tried to raid the presidential office over the declaration of martial law that was reversed within hours after a standoff with parliament. An attempt on Dec. 11 ended without entry, but the presidential office voluntarily submitted some data. The police and the presidential office did not have an immediate comment. The CIO declined to comment. Since his last public remarks shortly after he was impeached by parliament in a vote on Saturday, Yoon has kept a low profile and authorities and the Constitutional Court have not been able to contact or summon him, according to the court and officials. Yoon has been putting together a legal team to defend himself against accusations of insurrection and in the Constitutional Court case which will decide whether to remove him from office or restore his powers. Meanwhile, South Korea's acting president Han Duck-soo on Tuesday called during a cabinet meeting for next year's government budget to be swiftly implemented from the start of 2025 in order to help revive the country's slowing economy. Han has been working to reassure South Korea's allies and calm financial markets since taking over the duties of Yoon after the president was impeached. The government has decided to frontload 75% of its 2025 budget to be implemented during the first half of the year, the finance ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. South Korea faces economic challenges, including heightened uncertainty for the trade-dependent country created by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to hike tariffs, as export growth in Asia's fourth-largest economy slowed for a fourth-straight month in November, to the weakest level in 14 months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-authorities-make-new-attempt-to-raid-presidential-office-yonhap-reports-/7904075.html	2024-12-17T03:43:52-08:00	
Iran says awaiting 'necessary conditions' to reopen Syria embassy	Tehran — Iran's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that its embassy in Syria would reopen once the 'necessary conditions' are met, after the diplomatic mission was vandalized following the ouster of Tehran ally Bashar al-Assad. 'The reopening of the embassy in Damascus requires preparations, the most important of which is ensuring the security and safety of the embassy and its staff,' said foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei. He added that work to that end will be pursued 'as soon as the necessary conditions are provided,' without offering a specific timeline. The Iranian embassy in Damascus was ransacked after diplomats abandoned it in the wake of the rapid advance of Islamist-led rebels opposed to Assad's rule. On December 8, the rebel forces took Damascus and ousted the longtime ruler. Iran had supported Assad through Syria's civil war, which began in 2011, sending 'military advisers' at his request. But since his fall, Iran has sought to distance itself from the deposed leader, instead stressing the history of friendship between the two countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-awaiting-necessary-conditions-to-reopen-syria-embassy-/7904063.html	2024-12-17T03:33:12-08:00	
Bomb kills senior Russian general in Moscow	Russian officials said a bomb exploded Tuesday on a Moscow street, killing two people, including the commander of Russia’s Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Forces. The blast happened as Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov and his deputy were leaving an apartment building in southeastern Moscow, according to Russia’s investigative committee. Authorities said the bomb was hidden in an electric scooter parked near the building’s entrance. Video from the blast site showed a charred façade, crumpled bricks and broken windows. The bombing came a day after Ukrainian prosecutors charged Kirillov in connection with the use of chemical weapons by Russian forces in their nearly three-year-old war in Ukraine. In October, Britain also sanctioned Kirillov for helping deploy what it called 'barbaric' chemical weapons against Ukrainian forces.

UN expresses hope for ‘ambitious’ boost in humanitarian support for Syrians	U.N. officials on Tuesday signaled optimism about access for humanitarian aid to Syria, while European nations further engaged with the rebels who ousted longtime President Bashar al-Assad from power. U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said Tuesday he had a 'constructive discussion' with rebel leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, and that the U.N. has 'basis for ambitious scaling-up of vital humanitarian support.' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement he welcomed a commitment from the caretaker government led by Mohammed Bashir, Syria’s interim prime minister, to protect humanitarian workers, grant humanitarian access through all border crossings and to speed permits and visas for humanitarian workers. 'As the Syrian people seize the opportunity to build a better future, the international community must rally behind them,' Guterres said. French special envoy for Syria Jean-Francois Guillaume said during a visit to Syria on Tuesday that France 'is preparing to be with Syrians' during their transitional period. Guillaume was among the latest envoys to go to Syria for talks with those leading the transition. Germany’s foreign ministry said Tuesday its diplomats would hold their first talks with rebel leaders in Damascus. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc was already stepping up its humanitarian assistance to Syria, and that it must see how it can support Syria’s 'democratic aspirations.' 'Assad had proven time and again that there would be never a peaceful, united and stable Syria, nor regional stability, under his rule,' Kallas said. She cited a 'historic moment of opportunity,' saying this is a 'critical moment for Syria and for the international community.'

Suspected abduction of Lao rights advocate remembered on 12-year anniversary of disappearance	bangkok — Rights groups and activists Monday continued to urge the government of Laos to provide answers about the suspected abduction of prominent rights advocate Sombath Somphone, who was last seen at a police checkpoint in the country’s capital 12 years ago. In CCTV footage captured by a roadside camera on December 15, 2012, in central Vientiane, Sombath is seen being pulled over at a police post, stepping out of his Jeep and getting into a pickup truck that drives him away. He has not been seen or heard from since. The government of Laos, an authoritarian, one-party communist regime, claims it knows nothing of what happened. 'We continue to ask: Where is Sombath? We continue to say we are not going anywhere. We’re going to continue to demand answers from the Lao government. His is a case of enforced disappearance in the purest form,' Phil Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates, said Monday at an event in Bangkok marking the anniversary. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists were among 78 nongovernment groups that also signed an open letter urging the United Nations to press Laos for answers at a coming review of the government’s human rights record next year. A tireless champion for his country’s impoverished farmers, Sombath won the U.N.’s Human Resource Development Award in 2001 and Asia’s prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership four years later. To help carry on Sombath’s legacy, his wife, Shui Meng Ng, set up a memorial fund in 2022 that awards small grants for projects in Laos and its neighbors, promoting vocational education, environmental sustainability and other causes Sombath had fought for. She also co-founded the Sombath Somphone & Beyond Project to seek answers to the suspected abductions of her husband and others. On the day Sombath vanished, Ng was driving just ahead of him in another car to join him for dinner at home. Despite the government’s 'wall of silence' about why he never made it, she continues to wait. 'I still need to know what happened to Sombath, whether he is even alive. I need the truth,' Ng, who traveled from Laos to Thailand for Monday’s event, told VOA. 'I still hope that he’s alive and wish he will come back,' she said. 'I continue to seek answers. I will not give up trying to wait for Sombath to come back until my dying day.' Hundreds of families across the region could relate. In its latest annual report, the U.N.’s Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances says it has counted more than 1,130 cases across Southeast Asia since 1980, the majority of which remain unsolved. It defines the practice as an arrest, detention or abduction by state agents or their proxies, and the state’s refusal to either acknowledge the event or to reveal the victim’s fate. Although many of the cases date back decades, the lack of resolution has lasting consequences, said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch in Thailand. 'It has created a sense of impunity that wrongdoers can continue their wrongdoings and get away with their crimes. And in parallel to that, the climate of fear … has been reinforc[ed],' he said. In Laos, Ng said, the space for even mild dissent has only shrunk since her husband’s disappearance, out of fear that the same could happen to those who would follow in his footsteps. She said precious few even dare to try anymore. 'So, it is not very hopeful in terms of activism or people raising issues of concern on any kind of sensitive area,' said Ng. 'Everybody knows where the limit is and people are even stepping back way, way behind the line. ... They’re not even testing the line.' Phasuk said enforced disappearance has become a common feature of the so-called swap mart the governments are allegedly running by returning each other’s wanted dissidents regardless of the persecution they may face back home. 'Assassination, abduction and enforced disappearance seem to be grouped together in this network of transnational repression in mainland Southeast Asia,' he said. In a 2024 report, Human Rights Watch chronicled 25 confirmed or suspected cases of cross-border repression in the region, including disappearances, over the previous decade. Sombath’s case in particular, though, 12 years on, continues to serve as a bellwether in the search for answers in those cases. 'I hope that we’re not here next year doing this,' Robertson said. 'I would like to see a breakthrough in this case. I want to have an event midyear where we say we’ve now found out what’s going on. … But if we have to be here next December, we will be.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspected-abduction-of-lao-rights-advocate-remembered-on-12-year-anniversary-of-disappearance-/7903920.html	2024-12-16T19:00:15-08:00	
Western nations agree to 'disrupt, deter' Russian shadow fleet	TALLINN, estonia — Twelve Western countries have agreed to measures to 'disrupt and deter' Russia's so-called shadow fleet of vessels in order to prevent sanctions breaches and increase the cost to Moscow of the war in Ukraine, Estonia's government said Monday. The measures were agreed to by Germany, Britain, Poland, the Netherlands, the five Nordic nations and the three Baltic states, said Estonia, where leaders of the 10-nation Joint Expeditionary Force were due to meet Tuesday. Western nations have slapped sanctions on a wide range of ships they say are used by Moscow to avoid restrictions on the export of Russian oil and other cargoes. Vessels in the shadow fleet are not regulated or insured by conventional Western providers. 'We are taking concerted steps to deter Russia's shadow fleet and avoid attempts to evade sanctions,' Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal said in a statement. Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Finland and Estonia will begin to check insurance documents of ships under suspicion passing through the English Channel, Danish straits, the Gulf of Finland and the sound between Sweden and Denmark, he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/western-nations-agree-to-disrupt-deter-russian-shadow-fleet-/7903917.html	2024-12-16T18:43:48-08:00	
Exclusive: US condemns Iran’s prison sentence for former Radio Farda journalist	washington — The Biden administration has condemned Iran for sentencing an Iranian American dual national to 10 years in prison, in the only publicly reported case of a U.S. citizen being jailed by the Islamic Republic since a rare U.S.-Iran prisoner swap in September 2023. 'We are aware of reports dual Iranian-U.S. citizen journalist Reza Valizadeh has been sentenced to 10 years in prison in Iran,' a State Department spokesperson said in a Monday email, responding to a VOA inquiry. 'We strongly condemn this sentencing and call for his immediate release and the release of all political prisoners in Iran,' the spokesperson added. It was the first U.S. confirmation that Valizadeh had been jailed in Iran since reports emerged in October that he had been detained in Iran in late September. He is a former journalist for VOA sister network Radio Farda. Valizadeh left Radio Farda, the Persian-language service, in 2022. He flew to Tehran in February to visit his family after living in the West for 14 years, according to his last post on the X platform, formerly Twitter, in August. Valizadeh’s lawyer, Mohammad Hossein Aghasi, broke the news of his client’s sentencing in a Saturday post on X. He wrote that an Iranian court recently ruled Valizadeh should face 10 years in prison, as well as a two-year travel ban, a two-year ban on residing in Tehran province and its neighboring provinces, and a two-year prohibition on membership in parties or groups. In a Sunday interview with VOA Persian TV, Aghasi said Valizadeh had been convicted of cooperating with a hostile government, a reference to the United States. 'This was a heavy sentence in my opinion based on an incorrect charge,' Aghasi said. 'In the past, working for media outlets like Voice of America had been viewed [by Iranian courts] as engaging in propaganda against [Iran’s Islamist ruling] system, but [the charge for this activity] recently changed into cooperating with a hostile government.' Iran views VOA, Radio Farda and other Western-based Persian media as hostile entities because they draw attention to public dissent and protests against the nation's authoritarian Islamist rulers. Aghasi told VOA Persian he was hopeful of mounting a successful appeal against Valizadeh's verdict in a higher court. In a statement sent to VOA, Stephen Capus, the president and CEO of Radio Farda’s parent network, RFE/RL, said Valizadeh is an American citizen who has been unjustly charged, convicted and sentenced. Capus wrote: 'Time and again, the Iranian regime has attempted to spread its malign influence around the world, trampling on human rights at every opportunity. Clearly, this regime feels threatened by the forces of freedom, including independent journalism. It's why Radio Farda's mission of providing uncensored news and other programming to the Iranian people is more important than ever. Journalism is not a crime. Reza should be released to his family immediately.' Iranian officials have said little publicly about Valizadeh’s case beyond noting media reports that he had been arrested and pledging to look into the matter. In a separate message to VOA, Aghasi said there has been no reference to Valizadeh in the Persian platforms of Iranian state media. Iran’s U.N. mission in New York did not immediately respond to a VOA request sent Monday, seeking a comment on the U.S. condemnation of Valizadeh’s sentencing. 'The Iranian government has repeatedly suppressed press freedom through threats, intimidation, detentions, forced confessions and the use of violence against journalists in Iran,' the U.S. State Department spokesperson wrote to VOA. The spokesperson said the State Department reminds U.S. citizens of a warning on the travel.state.gov website, which says: 'Do not travel to Iran, due to the risk of kidnapping and the arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens.' This article was produced in collaboration with VOA’s Persian Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exclusive-us-condemns-iran-s-prison-sentence-for-former-radio-farda-journalist-/7903902.html	2024-12-16T17:48:09-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: 10 years on, what happened to Beijing’s ‘Made in China 2025’ policy?	Ten years after Bejing launched an ambitious effort called 'Made in China 2025' to accelerate the country’s high-tech industries, VOA Mandarin speaks with experts about how the effort fared. Launched in 2015, 'Made in China 2025' is an umbrella policy by the Chinese government to reduce reliance on foreign technology and help domestic companies to lead globally in high-tech industries like semiconductors, electric vehicles and renewable energy. China downplayed 'MIC 2025' in recent years, partly because of resistance from the U.S. and Western countries. But experts say as geopolitical tensions rise, including the return of Donald Trump, the legacy of this initiative remains central to U.S.-China competition for global economic and technological supremacy.

Judge rejects Trump's bid to dismiss hush money conviction because of Supreme Court immunity ruling	NEW YORK — A judge Monday rejected President-elect Donald Trump's bid to have his hush money conviction dismissed because of the U.S. Supreme Court's recent ruling on presidential immunity. But the case's overall future remains unclear. Manhattan Judge Juan Merchan's decision eliminates one potential off-ramp from the case ahead of Trump's return to office next month. His lawyers have raised other arguments for dismissal, however. Prosecutors have said there should be some accommodation for his upcoming presidency, but they insist the conviction should stand. Trump's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A jury convicted Trump in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in 2016. Trump denies wrongdoing. The allegations involved a scheme to hide the payout to Daniels during the final days of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to keep her from publicizing — and keep voters from hearing — her claim of a sexual encounter with the married then-businessman years earlier. He says nothing sexual happened between them. A month after the verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that ex-presidents can't be prosecuted for official acts — things they did in the course of running the country — and that prosecutors can't cite those actions to bolster a case centered on purely personal, unofficial conduct. Trump's lawyers then cited the Supreme Court opinion to argue that the hush money jury got some improper evidence, such as Trump's presidential financial disclosure form, testimony from some White House aides and social media posts made while he was in office. In Monday's ruling, Merchan denied the bulk of Trump's claims that some of prosecutors' evidence related to official acts and implicated immunity protections. The judge said that even if he found that some evidence related to official conduct, he'd still find that prosecutors' decision to use 'these acts as evidence of the decidedly personal acts of falsifying business records poses no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the Executive Branch.' Even if prosecutors had erroneously introduced evidence that could be challenged under an immunity claim, Merchan continued, 'such error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt.' Prosecutors had said the evidence in question was only 'a sliver' of their case. Trump communications director Steven Cheung on Monday called Merchan's decision a 'direct violation of the Supreme Court's decision on immunity, and other longstanding jurisprudence.' 'This lawless case should have never been brought, and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed,' Cheung said in a statement. The Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecuted the case, declined to comment. Trump takes office January 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-rejects-trump-s-bid-to-dismiss-hush-money-conviction-because-of-supreme-court-immunity-ruling-/7903893.html	2024-12-16T17:25:54-08:00	
VOA Kurdish: Experts warn of health risks from unsafe food imports into Kurdistan Region	Food experts are raising concerns about the safety of agricultural imports into the Kurdistan Region, saying many products contain high levels of harmful chemicals like nitrite. These chemicals, often caused by excessive fertilizer use, can lead to serious health problems, including cancer. Despite warnings since 2019, many imported crops are not properly tested for chemicals, as smuggling and corruption allow unsafe products to enter the region unchecked.

Trump, SoftBank CEO announce $100 billion investment in US	In a joint appearance Monday morning, President-elect Donald Trump and Masayoshi Son, chairman and CEO of the Japanese technology conglomerate SoftBank Group, announced that the company would invest $100 billion in U.S. companies over the coming four years, saying that the infusion of cash would create 100,000 jobs in fields such as artificial intelligence. Son attributed the decision to make the investment directly to Trump’s win in last month’s presidential election. 'I would really like to celebrate the great victory of President Trump,' Son said. 'My confidence level [in] the economy of the United States has tremendously increased with his victory. So, because of that, I'm now excited to commit this 100 billion dollars and 100,000 jobs into the United States.' In introducing Son, Trump pointed out that eight years ago, after Trump’s victory in the 2016 election, SoftBank had made a similar pledge, promising $50 billion in U.S. investments and 50,000 new jobs. 'And they did,' Trump said. 'They kept that promise in every way, shape and form.' The president-elect then went on to press Son to double his pledge, saying 'I’m going to ask him right now. Would you make it $200 billion?' Son reiterated his promise of $100 billion, but said he would 'try' to get to $200 billion. 'All right. $200 billion,' Trump said. Son burst into laughter, telling the crowd Trump is 'a great negotiator.' ‘Trump effect’ After the announcement Monday, Trump’s rapid response director, Jake Schneider, sent media outlets an email attributing the announcement to what he called the 'Trump Effect.' 'President Trump is already delivering on his commitment to re-make America into the world's manufacturing superpower once again — and he hasn't even taken office yet,' Schneider wrote. 'It's all centered around his Made in America agenda, which incentivizes companies that make their products in America with American workers.' He added, 'In January, President Trump will immediately begin implementing bold reforms to restore the nation to full prosperity and make sure AI, emerging technologies, and the other industries of tomorrow are created, built, and grown in the United States.' Hits and misses Since founding SoftBank in 1981 at age 24, Son has become one of the most storied — and controversial — technology investors in the world. The company has several investment funds and owns significant shares of hundreds of companies across multiple fields, including telecommunication, robotics, internet services, e-commerce, artificial intelligence and much more. Throughout his decades-long career, Son has made headlines for spectacular victories as well as disastrous failures. For a time, at the beginning of 2000, he claimed to be the world’s richest man, with a fortune worth an estimated $78 billion amassed by buying up internet startups. However, the collapse of the dotcom bubble just months later wiped out more than 90% of his wealth. Son started rebuilding his business that same year, and a $20 million investment that bought SoftBank a 34% ownership share in a little-known Chinese e-commerce startup known as Alibaba would prove key to his fortunes. In 2014, Alibaba went public at a price that valued SoftBank’s shares at $58 billion, some 2,900 times its initial investment. Along the way, Son successfully managed to merge mobile telecommunications firms T-Mobile and Sprint, creating one of the largest U.S. service providers in 2020. Just two years later, though, SoftBank suffered disastrous losses with the collapse of the office-sharing startup WeWork, in which it had invested heavily, as well as other failed investments by in-house venture and hedge funds. At the time, Son announced that he was retiring from public life. However, by 2023, he was back in the headlines when ARM Holdings, a British computer chip design firm that SoftBank bought at a valuation of $30.8 billion in 2016, went public in the U.S. at a valuation of $54.5 billion. Choosing the West over China Lionel Barber, the former editor-in-chief of the Financial Times, told VOA that he believes Son’s appearance at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort Monday signals more than just an international investor seeking to get on the good side of an incoming U.S. president. Barber is the author of Gambling Man: The Wild Ride of Masayoshi Son, the first biography of the investor by a Western author, which will be published in the U.S. next month. He said that when Son made his pledge of $50 billion in 2016, he and Trump had clearly aligned interests. 'Trump wanted a big signal about business confidence in the Trump agenda and Masayoshi Son and SoftBank wanted to get in with the new Republican administration with an eye to getting [a] blessing for his big project, which was Sprint merging with T-Mobile,' Barber told VOA by phone. Now, though, he sees something larger at play. 'Obviously, the world looks very different. Eight years on, we've got wars around the world, and we've also got de-risking and decoupling between China and the West,' Barber said. In his last interview with him, Barber told VOA, Son said that he had realized that it was necessary for SoftBank to make a choice between China and the West. Paraphrasing Son, Barber said, 'He basically said, ‘We understand the world's changed. We've been a global investor. We've been the biggest investor in China and the biggest investor in America. But now we have to choose. We've chosen the West.’' 'So, I see his getting into Mar-a-Lago as [saying], ‘I've chosen the West. I've chosen America, and I'm going with Trump.’' Investment details unclear The announcement at Mar-a-Lago did not include any details about specific investments that SoftBank intends to make, and not all foreign investments touted by Trump over the years have come to pass. Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn in 2017 promised a $10 billion investment in a manufacturing facility in Wisconsin that was later dramatically scaled back. Even SoftBank’s 2016 pledge is difficult to consider truly fulfilled unless the more than $20 billion the company poured into Sprint in 2013 — three years before making the pledge — is included in the total. Barber, Son’s biographer, said he has some doubts about SoftBank’s ability to identify $100 billion in U.S. investments over the course of four years. 'I’m not saying it's impossible, but I haven't figured out how he gets to 100 billion, yet,' Barber said. However, he said, it’s also important not to underestimate Son’s ability to achieve unexpected successes. 'You can't write him off,' Barber said. 'That's what he does. He's a bloody genius in that respect.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-softbank-ceo-announce-100-billion-investment-in-us-/7903846.html	2024-12-16T17:09:22-08:00	
Tice's mother asks Netanyahu to pause Syria strikes to locate journalist	WASHINGTON — The mother of American journalist Austin Tice, who has been detained in Syria for more than 12 years, reiterated her call Monday for the Israeli military to pause strikes in a part of Syria where her son may be held. 'I think it would be polite, to say the least, that perhaps they’re not bombing while people are trying to clear the prisons,' Debra Tice told reporters Monday afternoon outside the Syrian Embassy in Washington. That call comes days after she made the same appeal in a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a letter dated Dec. 14, Debra Tice told the Israeli leader her family has 'credible information' that her son may be held in a prison outside the Syrian capital, Damascus, and urged the Israeli military to pause strikes in the area to allow rescuers to search the site. 'We are aware that your military has an active campaign in the area, preventing rescuers from approaching and accessing the prison facility,' she wrote in the letter, which The New York Times published Monday. The Israeli military has been bombing weapons depots and air defenses in Syria. Israel says it wants to keep military equipment away from extremists. In the letter, Debra Tice said her son may be held in a prison under a Syrian military museum in the mountainous Mount Qasioun area. The prison was connected by a tunnel to a neighborhood and a government palace, she added in the letter. 'We have no way of knowing if the prisoners there have food and water. We urgently request you pause strikes on this area and deploy Israeli assets to search for Austin Tice and other prisoners. Time is of the essence,' she said. The Israeli Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting comment. But Gal Hirsch, the Israeli government's lead envoy for hostage affairs, told The Times that he had received the letter and was coordinating with U.S. officials. 'We will do everything possible in assisting the United States of America to bring the hostages and missing persons back home,' Hirsch said. A Texas native and former U.S. Marine, Austin Tice has been held in Syria since 2012, when he was detained at a checkpoint in Damascus. Aside from a brief video after his capture, little has been heard or seen of him since. Earlier in December, before the Bashar al-Assad government fell, the Tice family revealed it had obtained information vetted by the U.S. government that confirmed Austin Tice was still alive and detained in the Damascus area. Since Syrian rebels, led by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), took Damascus and toppled Assad’s government on December 8, thousands of prisoners have been released from prisons run by the now-deposed government. The release of those prisoners has raised hope in the Tice family that Austin will be among them. 'I feel like we’re standing in line, and we’re not the only ones that are still standing in line,' Debra Tice told reporters Monday. 'It’s going to take a while.' Austin Tice is an award-winning freelance journalist and photographer who works for outlets that include The Washington Post, CBS and McClatchy. He is the longest-held American journalist abroad. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters Monday that the United States has communicated with HTS on the importance of locating Austin Tice, but that there are no U.S. government personnel on the ground in Syria looking for the journalist. 'We have a number of people engaged on trying to find Austin Tice and bring him home, and we communicated directly to HTS that anything that they could do to help us find him, we would greatly appreciate,' Miller said. Syria’s transitional government said last week that the search for Austin Tice is ongoing, and that it would cooperate with the U.S. government in finding Americans who were disappeared by the former Assad government. Outside the Syrian Embassy in Washington, which the U.S. government forced to close in 2014 but may now reopen soon, Debra Tice told reporters she has never lost hope that her son will return home. 'I’ve always had hope. I’ve never had even a millisecond of hopelessness,' she said. 'We just need to get all those prisons opened, get all those families reunited, including us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tice-s-mother-asks-netanyahu-to-pause-syria-strikes-to-locate-journalist-/7903606.html	2024-12-16T16:39:48-08:00	
Man sentenced for helping pregnant Chinese women in 'US birthing scheme'	Los Angeles — A California man was sentenced Monday to nearly 3½ years in prison for running an extensive business that helped pregnant Chinese women travel to the United States to deliver babies who would automatically have American citizenship. U.S. authorities had sought a more than five-year prison term for Michael Wei Yueh Liu, 59, who was convicted in September of conspiracy and money laundering for running a company known as USA Happy Baby. Phoebe Dong, Liu's wife — though the couple have since separated — was also convicted in connection with the scheme and is expected to be sentenced early next year. After receiving a 41-month sentence, Liu was led out of the courtroom by authorities and taken into custody. He gave his attorney his belt and a folder and held Dong's hand briefly while she sobbed. In court, Liu had pleaded for leniency to care for his elderly parents and 13-year-old son, all of whom depend on him, while about a dozen supporters, many from his church, attended to provide moral support. Liu said his family has suffered deeply for nearly a decade since a 2015 raid on his business. 'My intent was always to uphold the values of integrity and responsibility, so I regret any actions or decisions that may have brought us to this moment of judgment,' Liu told the court during his sentencing hearing. 'I have tried my best to remain a source of stability for my family, but my incarceration will place them in a more vulnerable position.' 'I am not here to deflect responsibility, but to seek mercy,' he said. U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner said defendants’ family members are often the ones who suffer, but it is the defendant’s actions, not the court’s, that caused the harm. Nevertheless, Klausner said he was reducing the sentence due to Liu’s family situation. 'These are choices you make, not that the court makes,' Klausner said. U.S. authorities said USA Happy Baby helped several hundred women travel from China to give birth to U.S.-citizen babies between 2012 and 2015. The tourists paid as much as $40,000 for services including apartment rentals during their stays in Southern California and worked with overseas entities that coached women on what to say during visa interviews and upon arriving in U.S. airports, advising them to wear loose clothing to hide their pregnancies. 'For tens of thousands of dollars each, [the] defendant helped his numerous customers deceive U.S. authorities and buy U.S. citizenship for their children,' federal prosecutors wrote in court papers. 'This criminal conduct is serious and requires a meaningful sentence to promote respect for the law and hold [the] defendant accountable.' Prosecutors declined to comment immediately after the sentencing. Kevin Cole, Liu’s attorney, had asked that his client face no more than 26 months and requested he be allowed to serve his sentence from home. On Monday, Cole asked the judge to consider his client’s critical role as the caretaker for his 95-year-old father and 82-year-old mother, shuttling them to medical appointments, bathing them and cooking their food, and his otherwise upstanding life growing up in Taiwan — serving in its military and attending to his family. 'He’s somebody that has lived an honorable life,' Cole told the court. 'There’d be no benefit to him or the public for an extensive prison sentence in this case.' The case against Liu and Dong dates back years. Federal authorities searched more than a dozen homes across Southern California in a 2015 crackdown on operators of businesses catering to Chinese women seeking to deliver their babies in the United States and four years later charged the pair and more than a dozen others, including a woman who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 months in prison for running a company known as You Win USA. Such businesses have long operated in California and other states and have catered to people not only from China, but also from Russia, Nigeria and elsewhere. It isn’t illegal to visit the United States while pregnant but lying to U.S. consular and immigration officials about the reasons for travel on government documents is not permitted. The key draw for travelers has been that the United States has birthright citizenship, which many believe could help their children secure a U.S. college education and provide a sort of future insurance policy — especially since the tourists themselves can apply for permanent residency once their American child turns 21. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to end birthright citizenship once in office, but any such effort would face steep legal hurdles.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-sentenced-for-helping-pregnant-chinese-women-in-us-birthing-scheme-/7903856.html	2024-12-16T16:27:02-08:00	
Clashes in east DR Congo day after aborted peace summit	GOMA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — The Congolese army lost territory Monday in fighting with Rwanda-backed rebels in eastern DR Congo, military and local sources said, a day after a peace summit between the presidents of the two countries was canceled. Since 2021, the Kigali-backed M23 rebel militia has seized swathes of the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, displacing thousands and triggering a humanitarian crisis. DRC armed forces lost control of Matembe, a town in North Kivu province located on the road to the key commercial hub of Butembo, after clashes broke out Sunday with the M23, according to the local and military sources. Fighting resumed early Monday 'in the hills between Matembe and the neighboring town of Vutsorovya,' John Mahangaiko, spokesperson for a pro-Kinshasa militia operating alongside the army in the area, told AFP. A Congolese military source confirmed that the army was forced to 'retreat.' Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame were due to meet Sunday, hosted by Angolan President Joao Lourenco, the African Union mediator to end the conflict. But the summit was abruptly canceled after talks between delegations from both sides stalled overnight. The Congolese presidency said that negotiations had hit a deadlock over a Rwandan demand that the DRC hold direct dialogue with the M23 rebels. Home to a string of rival armed groups, the mineral-rich eastern DRC has been plagued by internal and cross-border violence for the past three decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-in-east-dr-congo-day-after-aborted-peace-summit-/7903599.html	2024-12-16T15:33:18-08:00

Labor organization: International migrants play crucial role in global economy	GENEVA — Migrants play a crucial role in the global economy by filling essential jobs in foreign countries and sending much-needed remittances to their home countries, according to a report released Monday by the International Labour Organization. The report’s release comes as President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to deport millions of undocumented migrants from the United States. During his presidential campaign, he accused them of draining economic resources and taking jobs from native-born Americans. The ILO report says migrants usually bring a net economic benefit to the countries they enter and those from which they depart. 'Migrants drive economic growth in destination countries, and they support home countries through their remittances and skills transfer,' Sukti Dasgupta, director of the ILO’s conditions of work and equalities department, told journalists at a briefing in Geneva on Monday. Rafael Diez de Medina, chief statistician at ILO, said the report debunks the assertion by some that 'migrants are taking away [the] jobs of nationals.' 'I would like to say that migrant workers often fill specific roles in low-wage or specialized jobs, and often as seasonal workers, and that they complement, rather than displace, the national labor force. 'There might be competition in specific contexts, but we do not really have evidence of migrants taking away jobs from nationals,' he said. 'In this report, migrants in the labor force include all foreign-born persons in the labor force of a host country who are employed or unemployed regardless of their legal status in the country,' Diez de Medina added. 'So, documented and undocumented, regardless of the employment permission to the host country, are included in our figures.' The report presents global and regional estimates of migrants in the labor force covering 189 countries and territories for 2022, representing 99% of the world population at that time. Migrant labor force increases The report says 167.7 million migrants were part of the international labor force as of 2022, accounting for 4.7% of the working force worldwide. The report finds that the migrant global labor force has increased by more than 30 million since 2013, but notes that from 2019 to 2022, 'the rate of growth slowed down to less than one percent annually.' This is attributed largely to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While migration patterns have changed in some regions of the world, the ILO said the overall composition of migrant workers has remained relatively stable, with men accounting for about 61% percent and women making up 39%. About 68% of international migrants in the labor force, the report noted, were concentrated in high-income countries located in northern, southern and western Europe, North America, and the Arab states. 'Migrants were concentrated in high-income countries drawn by higher living standards and more job opportunities,' said Dasgupta, who added that most migrants work in the service sector. 'This is where we find 70 percent of all working migrants, and this is particularly true for women,' she said. Diez de Medina said the estimates presented are based on a new and improved methodology that allows for more detailed breakdowns than before. In 2022, the ILO reported that more migrants faced a higher unemployment rate of 7.2% compared to the rate of 5.2% for non-migrants, with more migrant women than men out of work. According to the report, 'This disparity may be driven by factors such as language barriers, unrecognized qualifications, discrimination, and limited childcare options.' Migrants and legal protections Diez de Medina stressed the importance of ensuring that migrant workers have access to social and labor protection and 'are covered by the country’s labor laws, particularly for domestic workers.' Instead of being a drain on society, he said, migrant workers are a benefit and 'are essential for the global economy, particularly in certain sectors such as services, manufacturing and agriculture.' 'If there were to be major restrictions on the movement of migrant workers, there would be labor shortages in particular sectors in the destination countries,' he said. Dasgupta agreed that migrants contribute significantly to host economies through taxes, social security payments and other means. 'Their employment to population ratios are often higher,' she said, noting the report finds that 'migrants contribute more than they withdraw, particularly for the second-generation migrants.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/labor-organization-international-migrants-play-crucial-role-in-global-economy-/7903578.html	2024-12-16T15:06:21-08:00	
US Census Bureau adding refugees to immigrant count	The U.S. Census Bureau is changing how it counts immigrants in annual estimates by including more people who were admitted for humanitarian, and often temporary, reasons. The change is being made in an effort to better reflect population shifts this decade, officials said Monday. Population estimates, including immigration, are due to be released Thursday showing how the populations of the United States and the 50 states changed this year. However, the new approach to counting immigrants will only be reflected nationally. The percentage of U.S. residents who were foreign born rose to its highest level in more than a century in 2023. It could be even higher under the new methodology. Census Bureau officials wouldn't say Monday how much larger they expected the immigration figures to be in Thursday's release because of the change. Capturing the number of new immigrants is the most difficult part of the annual U.S. population estimates. Although the newly announced change in methodology is unrelated, the timing comes a month before a return to the White House of President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised mass deportations of people in the United States illegally. 'We feel confident that this was a good approach in order to make our estimates more current and reflect recent trends that we’ve seen,' said Eric Jensen, a senior research scientist at the Census Bureau. The bureau's annual calculation of how many migrants entered the United States in the 2020s has been much lower than the numbers cited by other federal agencies, such as the Congressional Budget Office. The Census Bureau estimated 1.1 million immigrants entered the United States in 2023, while the Congressional Budget Office's estimate was 3.3 million people. The group of people being included in the international migration estimates are those who enter the country through humanitarian parole, which has been granted for seven decades by Republican and Democratic presidential administrations to people unable to use standard immigration routes because of time pressure or their government’s poor relations with the U.S. The Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based research organization, said last week that more than 5.8 million people were admitted under various humanitarian policies from 2021 to 2024. Trump appears certain to dismantle humanitarian parole, saying during his campaign that he would end the 'outrageous abuse of parole.' The annual population estimates released by the Census Bureau each year are calculated from births, deaths, migration to the United States and migration between states. The population estimates provide the official population counts each year between the once-a-decade census for the United States, the 50 states, counties and metro areas. The figures are used for distributing trillions of dollars in federal funding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-census-bureau-adding-refugees-to-immigrant-count/7903554.html	2024-12-16T14:35:47-08:00	
Sudan conflict ups pressure on South Sudan to aid amputees, others with disabilities	JUBA, SOUTH SUDAN — South Sudan is grappling with an influx of people living with disabilities as victims of ongoing conflicts in neighboring countries, such as Sudan, come in search of devices like artificial limbs. This surge puts immense pressure on South Sudan, a nation with just three specialized orthopedic centers. At 9 years old, Ladu Jackson had to learn to walk with elbow crutches after a road accident forced doctors to amputate his left leg. The incident initially turned Jackson’s life upside down, leaving him unable to engage in his favorite childhood activity, football. Today, Jackson, now 23 years old, is one of South Sudan’s most recognizable amputee footballers, using the crutches to move while he kicks the ball with his remaining leg. 'In 2021, I started learning how to play football with one limb,' he said. ‘I didn’t know there was something called amputee football. I was just thinking, ‘I wish my leg was not amputated’ because I loved playing football so much.' Jackson received support at the Physical Rehabilitation Reference Centre in Juba, established in 2009, two years before the country gained independence. The center, supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), is not only helping South Sudanese like Jackson but also aiding refugees fleeing civil war in Sudan. 'Of course, there are already clients with these conditions, but their numbers keep getting bigger because of conflicts and more road accidents,' said Uwar Bosco, head of the Juba-based prosthetic and orthotic center. One such client is Adam Ahamed Mohamed, a refugee from Sudan who received his first prosthetic leg at the center. He fled to South Sudan after his entire family was displaced from their home in Sudan’s Darfur region. Mohamed said he was shot in both legs. One leg was amputated at the Juba Teaching and Referral Hospital before he was taken to the Rehabilitation Reference Center, where he got a prosthetic leg. The growing influx of refugees has placed immense strain on South Sudan’s fragile health care system, still recovering from its own civil war. James Ochan, a disability inclusion adviser, said the center is coping with a rising tide of patients. 'So far, the data we’ve registered this year — from January to October — is 2,549,' he said. 'We’ve not yet recorded the data for November.' Ochan attributes the increase to neighboring Sudan's civil war, which has intensified over the past year. 'This year, we’ve seen a lot of influx from the crisis in Sudan. We have a team doing response at all the entry points from Sudan to South Sudan,' he said. South Sudan ratified the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on Feb. 21, 2023. The convention ensures equal rights for individuals with disabilities and supports societal reintegration for people like Jackson and Mohamed. Ochan said that beyond providing prosthetics, the center helps individuals rebuild their lives and reintegrate into society. 'After rehabilitation and fitting with devices, they need to go back home or into society to start anew. After such incidents, some may feel they’re no longer part of society,' he said. The center also promotes sports and economic activities for persons living with disabilities, helping them regain a sense of normalcy. 'We are supporting sporting activities like wheelchair basketball and amputee football,' Ochan said. 'This is fully supported by the ICRC. We also have microeconomic initiatives to help persons with disabilities start businesses and become productive citizens.' South Sudan is in the process of enacting a disability act, which Ochan believes will further cement the rights and freedoms of persons with disabilities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-conflict-ups-pressure-on-south-sudan-to-aid-amputees-others-with-disabilities/7903541.html	2024-12-16T14:20:01-08:00	
Human Rights Watch accuses Sudan’s RSF of rape, sexual slavery	Nairobi, Kenya — Human Rights Watch has accused Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and allied militias of rape and other acts of sexual violence against women and girls in South Kordofan state. The rights group says the sexual violence constitutes war crimes, and that it underscores the urgent need for international action to protect Sudanese civilians and deliver justice to the victims. Human Rights Watch says representatives met with raped or sexually abused women in Sudan’s South Kordofan state during their visit this past October. The women, from the Nuba minority ethnic group, said they were violated and exploited by members of Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and allied militias. The RSF was not available to respond to the allegations against its fighters. Belkis Wille is an associate director in the Crisis, Conflict and Arms Division at Human Rights Watch. 'In this new report of Human Rights Watch, we have included details that we gathered into the cases of 79 women and girls who were raped by the RSF, including girls as young as seven years old. And indeed we also documented the case of a group of 51 women and girls who were taken by the RSF and held on a military base and used as sex slaves for months,' she said. The survivors and witnesses told investigators that they had been gang-raped since December 2023, and some of the victims were still missing. Local and international rights groups have documented many alleged human rights violations by both the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces since the sides went to war in April 2023, battling for power and control of the country. Hala al-Karib is the regional director of the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa. She said RSF is known to use sexual violence against communities to drive them out of their homes. 'Most of the communities and families who are forced to leave their homes in Sudan, in Khartoum, in Al Gezira and other territories under the control of the RSF. People left because of sexual violence, so it’s used as a land grabbing tool, it’s used to break communities’ capacity to resist and its used also to control communities and to spread fear,' she said. The International Criminal Court in The Hague issued an arrest warrant in 2009 against former President Omar al-Bashir and some commanders of militia groups on allegations of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region. Experts say the failure to hand over Bashir, who was ousted in 2019 and is now being held at a military hospital on the outskirts of Khartoum, is one factor that is fueling the conflict in Sudan. Al-Karib said despite victims of past abuses not receiving justice, people will refuse to accept any solution that does not address the abuse and violations against them. 'Demands for justice should never be silenced. This time, it should be an integral part of any political process because the grievances and the pain communities are having is way too much, and I don't think they are going to accept a political process that will conclude without justice arrangements,' she said. Wille of HRW said survivors and victims of sexual violence need justice and protection. 'It's really important, first and foremost, for the RSF to take action against these abuses. That means investigating their own forces for carrying out incidents of rape. It means immediately releasing any women and girls who are still being held and ensuring that this kind of act doesn't continue. But we do need to see leadership from other actors as well. The U.N. Security Council and the African Union could do far more, for example, creating this mission with a mandate to protect civilians that could be sent into Sudan,' she said. As the violence and suffering of Sudanese civilians continued, in September, Sudan's military-led government rejected a U.N. plan to deploy a mission to protect civilians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/human-rights-watch-accuses-sudan-s-rsf-of-rape-sexual-slavery/7903527.html	2024-12-16T14:09:56-08:00	
EU sanctions Chinese firms, North Korean minister over Ukraine war	BRUSSELS — The EU on Monday for the first time imposed fully fledged sanctions, including asset freezes and visa bans, on Chinese firms for supplying Russia's military for the war on Ukraine. It has also added North Korea's defense minister to its sanctions blacklist after the secretive state sent troops to Russia to reinforce its military. The move — part of the EU's 15th round of sanctions over the conflict — represented a heightened effort to tackle the crucial role allegedly being played by China in keeping Russia's war machine going. The EU said it was blacklisting four Chinese companies for 'supplying sensitive drone components and microelectronic components' to the Russian military. Two other firms and one Chinese businesswoman were hit for circumventing EU sanctions aimed at stopping equipment flowing to Moscow. Among the companies was Xiamen Limbach, alleged to have supplied engines for long-range attack drones used by Russia against Ukraine. The EU has targeted Chinese firms before for supporting Russia's military. But until now the bloc has imposed bans on European firms doing business with the Chinese companies — rather than the tougher sanctions now being applied. The EU also took aim at North Korea in the latest package, after Pyongyang dispatched troops to Russia to fight Ukraine. The 27-nation bloc added defense minister No Kwang Chol and deputy chief of the general staff Kim Yong Bok to a number of North Korean officials already blacklisted. Ukraine said Monday that its troops killed or wounded at least 30 North Korean soldiers who had been deployed in Russia's western Kursk region, where Ukraine has seized territory. In a bid to limit Russian revenues, the EU included around 50 oil tankers from Moscow's 'shadow fleet' used to help the Kremlin get around Western oil sanctions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-sanctions-chinese-firms-north-korean-minister-over-ukraine-war/7903525.html	2024-12-16T13:54:19-08:00	
Who controls Syria after Assad?	During Syria’s brutal 13-year civil war, the country was divided up in a multi-sided conflict between several armed factions whose ideologies, composition, and alliances were constantly shifting. Now, the rapid collapse of Bashar al-Assad's government has left both Syrians and foreign observers wondering who will fill the vacuum and what comes next. The key players who will likely determine Syria’s future: Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) The most powerful faction, which now controls most of western Syria, is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, who used the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the group has its origins in the al-Nusra Front, initially aligned with terrorist groups al-Qaida and the Islamic State. Sharaa’s focus on local Syrian governance over global jihad led him to split from both groups by 2017 and merge with several other Islamist factions to form HTS. The group has since rebranded as a more moderate and pragmatic organization that does not enforce strict sharia law and has promised to protect minority rights. However, it is still designated as a terrorist group by multiple countries, including Turkey and the United States, and remains accused of ongoing human rights violations. HTS supported the Idlib-based Syrian Salvation Government led by Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir, which has now become the country’s de facto transitional government. Southern Operations Room To the south is a diverse coalition calling itself the Southern Operations Room, which includes both secular and Islamist factions as well as Druze militias. Some of these had previously fought against extremist rebel groups such as al-Nusra, and in 2018 many reconciled with the Syrian government, with some even integrating into the Syrian armed forces. But as the recent HTS offensive in the north gained momentum, the southern rebels rejoined the fight against Assad and were the first to enter Damascus. Syrian National Army Still holding territory in the northwest is the Syrian National Army, or SNA. Having grown out of the loose coalition of rebel groups known as the Free Syrian Army early in the civil war, the SNA represents both Islamic and secular factions that are directly backed by Turkey and support the so-called Syrian Interim Government based in the town of Azaz. While they have at times been both an ally and a rival to HTS, the SNA has consistently fought against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Syrian Democratic Forces The SDF is the military force of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, which controls the region east of the Euphrates River. Led by the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG), it also includes Arab militias as well as minorities such as Assyrians and Armenians. While the group’s secular democratic ideology and equal treatment of women has garnered international support, they have been accused by other rebel groups of collaborating with the Assad regime and are considered by Turkey to be a branch of the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), who are designated as a terrorist group by multiple governments. The United States, however, directly supports the SDF as a key ally in the fight against Islamic State. IS remnants and foreign forces The Islamic State itself has been reduced to a fraction of its former power, holding only small pockets of territory in the southern desert. However, they continue to launch terrorist attacks throughout the country, with over 150 occurring in the first half of 2024. In addition, foreign forces have also occupied parts of Syria. Turkey has deployed its own military alongside the SNA near its border, claiming the territory as a ‘safe zone’ while using it to launch attacks against the SDF. The United States maintains a military base and a surrounding deconfliction zone at Al-Tanf near the Jordanian and Iraqi borders with Syria. Russia has so far retained control of its naval port at Tartus and air base near Latakia, though their future may be in question. Satellite images Friday appeared to show Russian forces packing up and dismantling military equipment at key bases, suggesting that it may be preparing for a withdrawal. And following the fall of Assad, Israel took control of a demilitarized buffer zone in Syria near the Golan Heights, which it already occupied, citing the need for increased security along the border until a deal with the new government can be reached. With so many factors in play, Syria’s future is far from certain. The country’s people are hoping that agreements between the major factions will ensure a smooth transition and bring an end to the chaos.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-controls-syria-after-assad/7903494.html	2024-12-16T13:37:05-08:00	
EU suspending visas for Georgian officials over security crackdown on protesters	Brussels — The European Union moved to impose visa restrictions on Georgian diplomats and government officials Monday over the police crackdown on opposition protesters demanding a rerun of October’s contested election. Tens of thousands of people have filled the streets regularly in recent weeks since the governing party decided to suspend negotiations on joining the EU. Police have increasingly used force in their attempts to break up the rallies. Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became Georgia’s president Saturday as the governing Georgian Dream party tightened its grip on power in the election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. After chairing what she described as a 'very tense discussion' among the bloc’s foreign ministers, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said they had decided 'to suspend the visa free regime for diplomatic passports and service passports.' The EU’s executive branch, the European Commission, was tasked to prepare the measure. Kallas also tabled a list of Georgian officials for the ministers to weigh sanctions against them, but Hungary and Slovakia — considered the most Russia-friendly of the 27 EU countries — blocked the move. 'With sanctions, we need 27 on board,' Kallas said. But she called the imposition of visa restrictions an important first step. Chairing her first meeting since taking office on Dec. 1, Kallas added: 'It’s my first Hungarian veto but I can guarantee it’s not the last.' Hungary holds the EU’s rotating presidency until the end of the month, when Poland takes over. Over the past year it has routinely blocked joint moves against Russia or in support of Ukraine, complicating procedures. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kęstutis Budrys told reporters that a visa ban is the 'minimum we should do,' adding that 'we have to send the message to Georgian people in the streets that Europe doesn’t abandon you.' The EU granted Georgia candidate status for membership in December 2023 but put the accession bid on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-suspending-visas-for-georgian-officials-over-security-crackdown-on-protesters/7903493.html	2024-12-16T13:32:52-08:00	
Trump, Pentagon spar over drone secrecy	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump contended Monday that the country's military 'for some reason' was keeping details secret about unexplained drones flying across the nighttime skies above the eastern United States, but the Pentagon quickly rebuffed his claim. 'Our military knows … something strange is going on,' Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in his first wide-ranging news conference since his election to a new four-year term in the White House starting next month. After Trump spoke, Air Force Major General Pat Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters there was 'no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus.' 'We are sensitive to the fact that there are public concerns and many questions,' Ryder said. 'We are also committed to providing as much information as possible as quickly as possible on this.' The military has a rationale for not shooting them down, Ryder said, offering a 'loose analogy' to unexplained cars traveling near military bases. 'On any given day, an unauthorized car or truck may approach one of the base gates, usually on accident,' Ryder said, and '99% of the time those cars are turned away without incident.' 'The point being is that flying drones is not illegal,' Ryder said. 'There are thousands of drones flown around the U.S. on a daily basis. It's not that unusual to see drones in the sky, nor is it an indication of malicious activity or any public safety threat.' For weeks now, residents in the state of New Jersey, which borders New York City, and other states to the north and south along the Atlantic Ocean coastline have reported seeing more than 5,000 supposed drones, a figure U.S. officials have concluded is wildly inflated. They say that most of the alleged unmanned drones are manned aircraft, and that fewer than 100 of the sightings need to be investigated further. All manner of conspiracy theories has been offered for the unexplained sightings, including the dispatching of drones by foreign countries and the deployment of Iran-launched drones from a mothership positioned off U.S. eastern coastal waters. In recent days, Republican and Democratic officials alike have called on officials in the administration of President Joe Biden to be more forthcoming in saying what they know about the drones. Republican Representative Michael Waltz of Florida, who is set to become Trump's national security adviser when he takes office Jan. 20, told CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday, 'We need to get to the bottom of it.' In his hourlong news conference, Trump touched on a wide range of topics five weeks before assuming power again and becoming the second president after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s to take over the White House for a second nonconsecutive term. He said his reception from world leaders this time is sharply more favorable than it was in 2017 after his first presidential victory. 'It's really the opposite of hostile. They're calling me,' he said. 'I've spoken to over 100 countries.' Trump said he would not end the use of the long-accepted polio vaccine in the U.S. but questioned the mandates in many U.S. states for a range of childhood vaccines. 'I'm not really a big mandate guy,' he said, and asked rhetorically, 'Why is the autism rate so high' in the United States, although any link between autism and vaccines has long been scientifically debunked. He also questioned why Americans 'are paying so much more than people in other countries' for medicines. Trump said that he was doing his best to stop Russia's nearly three-year war on Ukraine, and that he would have ongoing conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about a halt to the fighting. He called much of Ukraine 'a demolition site' because of Russian attacks. 'People can't go back there.' Trump called the U.S. media 'very corrupt' after winning a $15 million defamation settlement against ABC News over the weekend. He said he is planning lawsuits against other news outlets and individual journalists for what he considers to be false reporting, even as he lost other media-related suits. The president-elect reiterated his plan to impose tariffs against imports from some of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners. 'Tariffs will make our country rich,' he contended, although individual importers pay the fees and often pass on their costs to customers buying the goods.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-pentagon-spar-over-drone-secrecy/7903491.html	2024-12-16T13:17:26-08:00	
As refugees go home, families fear Syria's 'disappeared' are lost forever	Outside al-Mujtahid Hospital in Damascus, families study gruesome printouts taped to the walls. The pictures are of the bodies of prison victims, mangled from years of torture. Everyone in the crowd is searching for someone. Most leave without answers. A young woman in a black ponytail walks away from the wall, shrieking. 'You knew about this. You always knew,' she yells. 'You didn’t do anything about it.' The crowd is silent. Then one man says, 'God will have his justice after death.' 'What God?' she answers, storming away. 'I don’t believe in God.' Roughly 100,000 people are missing from Syria’s now defunct prison system, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, but locals believe that number is underestimated. We are told the most common cause of arrest under the fallen government of Bashar al-Assad was a real or perceived criticism of the regime. On the streets of Damascus, every single person we meet is missing someone. And as more mass graves are discovered, hope is fading that more victims will be found alive. At a crowded bakery, where families queue for about an hour for bread, outside a mosque where young people celebrate their new-found freedom, and on the streets near the hospital, where men and women weep openly, we ask the same question, loudly: 'Does anyone here NOT know someone who has disappeared?' 'Every family in Damascus is missing someone,' says a man outside the bakery. At the mosque, one woman, Hiba al-Sadfy, says she is one of the lucky few who hasn’t lost anyone. But her husband was in jail for three years, and her nephew is still missing. 'I was sending food and medicine to Ghouta,' says her husband, Anas al-Nesmeh, 45, in the courtyard of the iconic Umayyad Mosque. Ghouta is a suburb of Damascus that supported the uprising against the Syrian government from its beginning in 2011. It was made famous in 2013 when the regime dropped chemical weapons on neighborhoods there, killing more than 1,400 people. 'They arrested the driver, and he told them I was sending it,' Nesmeh explains. He then spent three years in a prison where inmates died from lack of food and medicine and torture was a regular part of life. Sadfy, his wife, points out marks still prominent on his wrists, where officers stubbed out their cigarettes. 'He still has lines on his back from whipping,' she adds. Funeral Around the corner from the hospital, there is a funeral for Mazen al-Hamada, a young man who died in prison after years of torture. Originally, Hamada was reportedly arrested for smuggling baby food into rebel areas. After his release, he moved to Europe where he became an international advocate for Syrian torture victims. 'The human brain can’t imagine it,' he says in a film widely circulated online where he describes gruesome beatings and sexual assaults. 'Many people died under torture.' A week ago, Hamada’s body was found in the hospital among other victims of the notorious Sednaya Prison. Outside the funeral, one young man hugs his friend as he cries. He tells us he didn’t know Hamada, but his heart is too broken to say more. 'I can’t stand this pain anymore,' he says. 'I’m so sorry but I can’t talk.' We follow the funeral procession as a growing crowd carries the coffin through the streets, draped in what was, less than two weeks ago, a rebel flag. Now it is the flag of Syria. Soon it is as much a protest as a procession and the crowd chants familiar slogans like 'The people of Syria are one!' and less common ones, like, 'The people demand the execution of Bashar!' Pictures of Assad, the former president who fled Syria as rebels swept through the country, have been torn off buildings or scratched out. A rubbed-out poster of Assad’s face is placed on the ground at the entrance of Damascus’ ancient market, so shoppers can stamp on it, or walk over it like it was nothing. Another torn-up poster of Assad’s face hangs on the Ministry of Justice, now manned by a single bearded soldier, wearing a blue windbreaker under his camouflage jacket. I ask him if he thinks the people who are demanding justice will get it. 'Sheik Abu Mohammed will provide justice, God willing,' he says, referring to Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, who is now called by his given name, Ahmed al-Sharaa. He is the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that led the militias as they took over Syria. In less than two weeks, the rebels conquered lands held by the Assad-family dictators for half a century. We read in the news that HTS was blessed with a just cause and excellent timing. Russia and Iran were embroiled in other wars as Syrian rebels swept through the country. Nobody I know believes that this is the full story. We leave the ministry guard and find the rowdy funeral/protest has moved on. A shopkeeper tells us he didn’t see where they went. We got a taxi to the cemetery where some locals say the burial was quick, and the people left. We asked the driver to take us back to the hospital. As we pass through the next square, he tells us there is a prison under the road. 'How do you know?' I ask. 'I was taken there when I was nine years old,' he says. At the time, one of his friends stole something, but his memory is fuzzy, he adds. The prison was crowded, and he was beaten with a cable before his mother bailed him out. 'They butcher women and children,' he says. 'Even if you mention Bashar’s name unintentionally, you may be arrested.' Celebration On the way back to our hotel, Umayyad Square is packed with revelers. Young men hang out of cars, waving Syria’s new flag and honk their horns. Children pose on a tank or with AK-47s for pictures. Sellars prepare banners and fireworks for the night’s festivities. We find the remnants of a similar party in the main square in Aleppo the next day, but the crowds have dissipated. Many businesses have reopened but the currency is fluctuating so fast in Aleppo, shop owners say they don’t know how much to charge. At the market outside the Aleppo Citadel, a thousands-of-years-old castle, young men sell cigarettes and coffee, while camel owners encourage people to purchase short rides. 'Don’t be afraid of the camel!' one man calls as he leads his camel by a rope through the crowds. We meet Imad al-Sawa, 20, who returned from Iraq only last week, selling coffee and cigarettes near the citadel. After three years abroad as a refugee, he came home the day after the rebels took Aleppo. Sawa fled Syria at 17 years old, like so many other teenage boys, to avoid being forced to either join the military or go to jail. In Iraq he found hard work, deep poverty and no possibility for a better future. 'It was like I had no soul,' he says. 'And now it is back.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-refugees-go-home-families-fear-syria-s-disappeared-are-lost-forever/7903308.html	2024-12-16T12:04:17-08:00	
US military says strikes kill 12 Islamic State group militants in Syria	WASHINGTON — American forces carried out air strikes against the Islamic State group in Syria on Monday, killing a dozen of its fighters, the US military said. 'The strikes against the ISIS leaders, operatives and camps were conducted as part of the ongoing mission to disrupt, degrade and defeat ISIS,' U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said on social media, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. The aim is to prevent 'the terrorist group from conducting external operations and to ensure that ISIS does not seek opportunities to reconstitute in central Syria,' CENTCOM said. 'These recent strikes are in former regime and Russian-controlled areas ensuring pressure is maintained on ISIS,' it added. Washington is seeking to prevent the jihadist group from taking advantage of the fall of Bashar al-Assad's government, which was overthrown by an Islamist-led rebel alliance that took the capital Damascus on December 8. That day, U.S. forces hit more than 75 targets associated with the Islamic State group in Syria using a combination of warplanes including B-52s, F-15s, and A-10s. The U.S. military has around 900 troops in Syria and 2,500 in Iraq as part of an international coalition against the Islamic State group that was established in 2014 to combat the jihadists.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-military-says-strikes-kill-12-islamic-state-group-militants-in-syria/7903316.html	2024-12-16T11:31:33-08:00	
Former FBI informant pleads guilty to lying about bribery scheme involving Bidens	LOS ANGELES — A former FBI informant pleaded guilty Monday to lying about a phony bribery scheme involving President Joe Biden and his son Hunter that became central to the Republican impeachment inquiry in Congress. Alexander Smirnov entered his plea to a felony charge in connection with the bogus story, along with a tax evasion charge stemming from a separate indictment accusing him of concealing millions of dollars of income. An attorney for Smirnov declined to comment after the hearing in Los Angeles federal court. Prosecutors and the defense have agreed to recommend a sentence of between four and six years in prison when he's sentenced next month. Smirnov will get credit for the time he has served since his February arrest on charges that he told his FBI handler that executives from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma had paid President Biden and Hunter Biden $5 million each around 2015. Smirnov had been an informant for more than a decade when he made the explosive allegations about the Bidens in June 2020, after 'expressing bias' about Joe Biden as a presidential candidate, prosecutors said. But Smirnov had only routine business dealings with Burisma starting in 2017, according to court documents. An FBI field office investigated the allegations and recommended the case be closed in August 2020, according to charging documents. No evidence has emerged that Joe Biden acted corruptly or accepted bribes as president or in his previous office as vice president. While Smirnov’s identity wasn’t publicly known before the indictment, his claims played a major part in the Republican effort in Congress to investigate the president and his family, and helped spark a House impeachment inquiry into Biden. Before Smirnov's arrest, Republicans had demanded the FBI release the unredacted form documenting the unverified allegations, though they acknowledged they couldn’t confirm if they were true. During a September 2023 conversation with investigators, Smirnov also claimed the Russians probably had recordings of Hunter Biden because a hotel in Ukraine’s capital where he had stayed was 'wired' and under their control — information he said was passed along to him by four high-level Russian officials. But Hunter Biden had never traveled to Ukraine, according to Smirnov's indictment. Smirnov claimed to have contacts with Russian intelligence-affiliated officials, and told authorities after his arrest this year that 'officials associated with Russian intelligence were involved in passing a story' about Hunter Biden. The case against Smirnov was brought by special counsel David Weiss, who also prosecuted Hunter Biden on gun and tax charges. Hunter Biden was supposed to be sentenced this month after being convicted at a trial in the gun case and pleading guilty to federal charges in the tax case. But he was pardoned this month by his father, who said he believed 'raw politics has infected this process, and it led to a miscarriage of justice.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-fbi-informant-pleads-guilty-to-lying-about-bribery-scheme-involving-bidens/7903299.html	2024-12-16T11:24:36-08:00

Canada's finance minister resigns as PM Trudeau deals with declining popularity	TORONTO — Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, long Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's most powerful and loyal minister, announced Monday she was resigning from the Cabinet in a move that stunned the country and raised questions about how much longer the unpopular Trudeau can stay in his job. Freeland, who was also deputy prime minister, said Trudeau had told her Friday that he no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister and that he offered her another role in the Cabinet. But she said in her resignation letter to the prime minister that the only 'honest and viable path' was to leave the Cabinet. 'For the past number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds about the best path forward for Canada,' Freeland said. Freeland and Trudeau disagreed about a two-month sales tax holiday and $250 Canadian (US$175) checks to Canadians that were recently announced. Freeland said Canada is dealing with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose sweeping 25% tariffs and should eschew 'costly political gimmicks' it can 'ill afford.' 'Our country is facing a grave challenge,' Freeland said in the letter. 'That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war.' The resignation comes as Freeland, who chaired a Cabinet committee on U.S. relations, was set to deliver the fall economic statement and likely announce border security measures designed to help Canada avoid Trump's tariff threat. The U.S. president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. Trudeau has said he plans on leading the Liberal Party into the next election, but there are some party members who do not want him to run for a fourth term. It wasn't immediately clear what Freeland's resignation from the Cabinet means for Trudeau's immediate future. 'This news has hit me really hard,' a shocked Transport Minister Anita Anand said. She added she needed to digest it before commenting further. No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms. The federal election has to be held before October. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one major party in Parliament, as they don't hold an outright majority themselves. If the opposition New Democrats pull support, an election can be held at any time. Trudeau channeled the star power of his father in 2015, when he reasserted the country's liberal identity after almost 10 years of Conservative Party rule. But the son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is now in big trouble. Canadians have been frustrated by the rising cost of living and other issues like immigration increases following the country's emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. Freeland said in the resignation letter that Canadians 'know when we are working for them, and they equally know when we are focused on ourselves. Inevitably, our time in government will come to an end. But how we deal with the threat our country faces will define us for a generation, and perhaps longer.' Freeland's resignation comes as Trudeau has been trying to recruit Mark Carney to join his government. Carney is the former head of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada. He was so well regarded after helping Canada dodge the worst of the global economic crisis that the U.K. named him the first foreigner to serve as governor of the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming the leader of the Liberal Party. It wasn't immediately clear if Carney has agreed to join Trudeau's Cabinet. 'This is quite a bombshell,' said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. 'Freeland was not only finance minister but also deputy prime minister and, until a couple of years ago, was seen as Trudeau's heir as Liberal leader and prime minister. ' Wiseman said leaks from the prime minister's office suggest that she was a poor communicator and made Freeland's status questionable. 'There was talk about her becoming foreign minister again and that would have been a good fit for her but the stab in the back from the prime minister's office cast the die,' Wiseman said. Daniel Beland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, also called it a political earthquake and not just because Freeland was the second most powerful official in government. 'Also because of how she resigned: by publishing a letter on social media that clearly criticizes the Prime Minister only hours before she was supposed to present the government's fall economic statement,' Beland said. 'This is clearly a minority government on life support but, until now, the (opposition) NDP has rejected calls to pull the plug on it. It's hard to know whether this resignation will force the NDP to rethink its strategy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-s-finance-minister-resigns-as-pm-trudeau-deals-with-declining-popularity/7903204.html	2024-12-16T11:14:54-08:00	
5 dead in shooting at private Christian school in Wisconsin	MADISON, WISCONSIN — Five people are dead and others injured after a shooting Monday at a private Christian school in Wisconsin, including a child who caused the attack, authorities said. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes was speaking to reporters when the death toll rose to five from three people. He offered no details on the victims but says others were wounded in the shooting at Abundant Life Christian School. Barnes says police officers who responded did not fire their weapons. Police had blocked off roads around the school Monday afternoon. Agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have responded to the scene to assist local law enforcement. 'We are praying for the kids, educators, and entire Abundant Life school community as we await more information and are grateful for the first responders who are working quickly to respond,' Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement. Abundant Life Christian School is nondenominational and has about 390 students, from kindergarten through high school, according to its website.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-shooting-at-private-christian-school-in-wisconsin/7903242.html	2024-12-16T11:06:41-08:00

Germany's Scholz loses confidence vote, setting up early election in February	BERLIN — Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote in the German parliament on Monday, putting the European Union's most populous member and biggest economy on course to hold an early election in February. Scholz won the support of 207 lawmakers in the 733-seat lower house, or Bundestag, while 394 voted against him and 116 abstained. That left him far short of the majority of 367 needed to win. Scholz leads a minority government after his unpopular and notoriously rancorous three-party coalition collapsed on November 6 when he fired his finance minister in a dispute over how to revitalize Germany's stagnant economy. Leaders of several major parties then agreed that a parliamentary election should be held on Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally planned. The confidence vote was needed because post-World War II Germany's constitution doesn't allow the Bundestag to dissolve itself. Now President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call an election. Steinmeier has 21 days to make that decision — and, because of the planned timing of the election, is expected to do so after Christmas. Once parliament is dissolved, the election must be held within 60 days. In practice, the campaign is already well under way, and Monday's three-hour debate reflected that. What did the contenders say? Scholz, a center-left Social Democrat, told lawmakers that the election will determine whether 'we, as a strong country, dare to invest strongly in our future; do we have confidence in ourselves and our country, or do we put our future on the line? Do we risk our cohesion and our prosperity by delaying long-overdue investments?' Scholz's pitch to voters includes pledges to 'modernize' Germany's strict self-imposed rules on running up debt, to increase the national minimum wage and to reduce value-added tax on food. Center-right challenger Friedrich Merz responded that 'you're leaving the country in one of its biggest economic crises in postwar history.' 'You're standing here and saying, business as usual, let's run up debt at the expense of the younger generation, let's spend money and ... the word 'competitiveness' of the German economy didn't come up once in the speech you gave today,' Merz said. The chancellor said Germany is Ukraine's biggest military supplier in Europe and he wants to keep that up, but underlined his insistence that he won't supply long-range Taurus cruise missiles, over concerns of escalating the war with Russia, or send German troops into the conflict. 'We will do nothing that jeopardizes our own security,' he said. Merz, who has been open to sending the long-range missiles, said that 'we don't need any lectures on war and peace' from Scholz's party. He said, however, that the political rivals in Berlin are united in an 'absolute will to do everything so that this war in Ukraine ends as quickly as possible.' What are their chances? Polls show Scholz's party trailing well behind Merz's main opposition Union bloc, which is in the lead. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens, the remaining partner in Scholz's government, is also bidding for the top job — though his party is further back. The far-right Alternative for Germany, which is polling strongly, has nominated Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor but has no chance of taking the job because other parties refuse to work with it. Germany's electoral system traditionally produces coalitions, and polls show no party anywhere near an absolute majority on its own. The election is expected to be followed by weeks of negotiations to form a new government. Confidence votes are rare in Germany, a country of 83 million people that prizes stability. This was only the sixth time in its postwar history that a chancellor had called one. The last was in 2005, when then-Chancellor Gerhard Schroder engineered an early election that was narrowly won by center-right challenger Angela Merkel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-s-scholz-loses-confidence-vote-setting-up-early-election-in-february/7903114.html	2024-12-16T10:03:09-08:00	
Lebanon again flashpoint of Mideast turmoil in 2024	2024 saw a major re-ordering of the balance of power in the Middle East. Lebanon yet again was at the center of this upheaval as Israel launched raids and heavy airstrikes in response to attacks from Hezbollah, destroying swathes of the country in the process. A fragile ceasefire in November silenced the bombing at least temporarily but the regime change in Syria threatens more instability in 2025.

Attacks on Pakistan polio teams kill vaccinator, 2 police officers	Islamabad — Authorities in Pakistan reported Monday that gunmen targeted vaccination teams in northwestern districts during a nationwide campaign against the paralytic poliovirus, resulting in the deaths of at least one health worker and two police officers. The violence in the militancy-hit Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan, also injured several polio workers and police force members escorting them. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the attacks. Pakistan has reported a significant surge in poliovirus infections in 2024, confirming 63 cases so far, compared to only six cases in 2023. On Monday, the country launched a weeklong house-to-house vaccination campaign, culminating the year’s anti-polio efforts. Officials said the campaign aims to inoculate more than 44 million children under five to protect them against polio. Ayesha Raza Farooq, the prime minister’s adviser for the polio eradication program, emphasized parental cooperation to help achieve a polio-free Pakistan. 'We strongly encourage all parents to welcome our dedicated polio workers when they visit your residence and ensure that your children under the age of five receive the necessary two doses of the polio vaccine,' she said. The World Health Organization lists Pakistan and Afghanistan as the only two countries where the potentially fatal poliovirus continues to cripple children. WHO officials have cited multiple factors for the resurgence of polio cases in Pakistan. They noted that false propaganda that anti-polio campaigns are a Western plot to sterilize Muslim children has led to vaccine boycotts in some Pakistani districts. Additionally, insurgents in violence-hit regions occasionally stage deadly attacks on polio teams, suspecting them of spying for the Pakistani security forces, routinely disrupting vaccination drives. 'There are concerning numbers of missed children during the recent campaigns (ranging from 5,000 to 700,000) due to insecurity, boycotts, and program quality issues,' the WHO reported in a statement in August after an emergency committee meeting under the International Health Regulations. Pakistani authorities have reported the killings of more than 200 polio workers and police personnel escorting them since the country launched vaccination campaigns in the 1990s to control infections. WHO and officials in Afghanistan have reported at least 23 polio cases in 2024, up from six last year. In September, the de facto Taliban government abruptly banned the house-to-house vaccination campaign in parts of the war-torn country, permitting only site-to-site and mosque-to-mosque vaccinations of Afghan children. The WHO committee meeting lamented in its December 3 statement that the Taliban’s ban dealt a setback to the 'very encouraging progress' made in Afghanistan during the first half of 2024. 'The committee was concerned about this recent development since site-to-site campaigns are not able to reach all the children in Afghanistan, especially those of younger age and girls,' said the statement. It warned that the restriction poses a substantial risk of a further resurgence of paralytic poliovirus in Afghanistan and beyond.	https://www.voanews.com/a/attacks-on-pakistan-polio-teams-kill-vaccinator-2-police-officers-/7903073.html	2024-12-16T08:58:29-08:00	
Ghana’s president-elect John Mahama outlines plans for new term	ACCRA, GHANA — In an exclusive interview with VOA, Ghana's President-elect John Mahama has outlined his vision for improving life for the average Ghanaian following his victory in last week’s general elections. Mahama, who campaigned on reviving Ghana’s struggling economy and tackling unemployment, discussed his plans for job creation, school reform and preserving the environment while allowing small scale miners to make a living. VOA English to Africa’s Paul Ndiho sat down with Mahama on December 13 in Ghana’s capital, Accra. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. VOA’s Paul Ndiho: Let’s start with the economy. Everyone talked about how the economy was not doing very well for an ordinary Ghanaian. You promised to revive and reset the economy. Let’s start there, Mr. President-elect. President-Elect John Mahama: I said during the campaign, 'It’s the economy, stupid,' quoting from Bill Clinton’s campaign. People thought I was being offensive, but it did come down to the economy. All the opinion polls showed the economy and employment were the most critical issues. So, we focused our message on job creation and economic recovery, and eventually, it paid off. If the economy is in a bad way, it affects education, agriculture, sports, it affects every sector of the country. So, we’re going to have to be dealing with stabilizing the economy. Unfortunately, in this circumstance, we have two significant issues.... Reducing inflation is our number one priority. Stabilizing the currency is number two. We also need to bring the deficit down, cut expenditures, and increase revenues. Those are the things that we need to be looking at. Paul Ndiho: Let’s talk about unemployment. Young people say there are no jobs. What will you do in your first 100 days to reassure them that Ghana can provide opportunities? Mahama: Job creation is not any event; it is a process. And so, you’ll need more than one stroke of the pen to create the number of jobs you want. The first step is restoring the economy to health and on the path of growth. That in itself will begin to drive jobs. Businesses are suffering. Many businesses have laid off people just because of the economic crisis. And so, it is just bringing the economy back and letting companies grow again. And rejigging the construction sector and investing in infrastructure. Carpenters, masons, and steel builders will begin to get work again. And so, that is our number one priority. We are not interested in the artificial job creation measures that have been done in the past, like NABCO, Nation Builders Corps, where young people were taken through three years of building their allowance and promised that they would graduate into jobs. And at the end of the process, they’ve been abandoned. We already have the youth employment agency that is creating those opportunities for training and job orientation. If you look at the government sector, the government sector employees are less than a million people out of a population of 33 million. The best place to get a job will be for the private sector to grow. Now that we have the African Continental Free Trade Area, it should be possible for us to encourage Ghanaian businesses to take advantage of it and increase production so that we can export to those African countries. Paul Ndiho: Let’s move on to education. Many young people fear your administration might cut the free high school education program. Will you keep it? Mahama: Free SHS [Free Senior High School] has come to stay, and it is not going anywhere. Nobody is going to scrap it. We will help make it more efficient so that the teachers, the parents, and the students get the best out of the free access. We’re going to look at the basic school level, too... The basic level is becoming a significant problem. 1.3 million pupils at a basic level need furniture. They don’t have tables and chairs to sit on. They lie on their stomachs in the classroom or sit on cement blocks. And that’s because all our focus has been on the secondary school level. So, we’re going to hold a national education forum, which will bring all the stakeholders together. And we’re going to look at the whole education value chain. And we're going to come in by consensus. All of us are nonpartisan. Everybody from every walk of life who has a stake in education will attend that conference. We’re going to make important decisions on how to reform our education so that the children get better quality and better value for money. We’re going to improve the quality of the food for the children. We’re going to expand the infrastructure so that they have dormitories, classrooms, and dining halls so that they can get the most out of secondary education. Paul Ndiho: There is this issue of Galamsey [term for illegal small-scale gold mining in Ghana] that has caused a lot of tension and agitation. What can you say about it? How are you going to put an end to it? Mahama: One of the first things is to pass the law to ban mining in forest reserves. When this government came to pass, an airline that allowed forest entry was possessed. And since the last eight years, seven forest reserves have seen incursions into 37 forest reserves. Some have been almost destroyed. The first thing to do is stop mining in forest reserves because that’s where all the rivers get their catchment area. That’s where the water comes into the rivers. The next thing is to clean up the rivers and stop mining and pouring the effluent into the rivers. And so, we’re good to work with the Minerals Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to see how we implement the law. But let me explain. People need to distinguish between small-scale mining and illegal mining. Small-scale mining is legal. There are ways of doing it without destroying the environment in Canada, Australia, and the United States. Technology exists. So why don’t we reduce that technology and train our people to do mining in a way that is safe for the environment? We’re willing to consider those things.

Taiwan receives first batch of US-made Abrams tanks	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan has received 38 advanced Abrams battle tanks from the United States, the defense ministry said Monday, reportedly the island's first new tanks in 30 years. Washington has long been Taipei's most important ally and biggest arms supplier — angering Beijing, which claims Taiwan as part of its own territory. The M1A2 tanks — the first batch of 108 ordered in 2019 — arrived in Taiwan late Sunday and were transferred to an army training base in Hsinchu, south of the capital Taipei, the defense ministry said. The M1A2s are the first new tanks to be delivered to Taiwan in 30 years, the semi-official Central News Agency said. Taiwan's current tank force consists of around 1,000 Taiwan-made CM 11 Brave Tiger and U.S.-made M60A3 tanks, technology that is increasingly obsolete. Abrams tanks, which are among the heaviest in the world, are a mainstay of the U.S. military. Taiwan faces the constant threat of an invasion by China, which has refused to rule out using force to bring the self-ruled island under its control. China's foreign ministry on Monday urged the United States to 'stop arming Taiwan... and supporting Taiwan independence forces.' 'The Taiwan authorities' attempt to seek independence through force and foreign help is doomed to fail,' ministry spokesman Lin Jian said. 'China will firmly defend its national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity.' While it has a home-grown defense industry and has been upgrading its equipment, Taiwan relies heavily on U.S. arms sales to bolster its security capabilities. Taiwan requested the state-of-the-art M1A2 tanks in 2019, allocating the equivalent of more than $1.2 billion for them. The rest of the order is expected to be delivered in 2025 and 2026, an army official told AFP. While U.S. arms supplies to Taiwan are enshrined into law, a massive backlog caused by Covid-19 supply chain disruptions and U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine and Israel have slowed deliveries to Taiwan. The backlog now exceeds $21 billion, according to Washington think tank Cato Institute. Taiwan would be massively outgunned in terms of troop numbers and firepower in any war with China and in recent years has increased spending on its military. Taipei allocated a record $19 billion for 2024 and next year's budget is set to hit a new high as it seeks to bolster its defense approach. China has increased military pressure on Taiwan in recent years, regularly deploying fighter jets and warships around the island. Taiwanese authorities said last week that China had held its biggest maritime drills in years, with around 90 ships deployed from near the southern islands of Japan to the South China Sea. The vessels simulated attacks on foreign ships and practiced blockading sea routes, a Taiwan security official said previously. Beijing did not confirm the drills and its defense ministry did not say whether the maneuvers had taken place when asked at a press conference on Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-receives-first-batch-of-us-made-abrams-tanks/7902881.html	2024-12-16T07:05:36-08:00	
Sri Lanka and India shore up ties in Sri Lankan President’s first overseas visit	New Delhi — India and Sri Lanka vowed to bolster ties during a visit to New Delhi by Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, whose left-leaning coalition won a landslide majority in parliamentary elections last month. After the two leaders held talks on Monday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that he had assured Dissanayake that New Delhi will be a reliable partner for Sri Lanka’s development. He outlined several areas in which they plan to boost cooperation such as establishing a petroleum pipeline between the two countries and connecting their power grids. 'We are honored that Dissanayake picked India for his first official visit,' Modi said at a joint press conference. 'This will give new speed and energy in our relations.' Dissanayake's party’s roots in Marxist ideology had raised some concerns in New Delhi that he would lean towards China. But by making New Delhi his first overseas stop, he signaled that 'India will indeed be our closest ally' according to Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Center for Policy Alternatives in Colombo. 'That is the symbolic dimension of this visit.' Both rivals India and China have vied for influence in the island country that sits strategically along shipping routes in the Indian Ocean. Before Sri Lanka’s economy collapsed in 2022, Beijing poured in billions of dollars to build infrastructure projects that included a port which India feared could affect its security. However, New Delhi and Colombo reset ties as India helped the country tide over its economic woes by extending aid worth $ 4 billion as the cash-strapped country struggled to buy food, fuel and medicines. 'We faced an unprecedented economic crisis two years ago and India supported us immensely to come out of that quagmire,' Dissanayake said. Addressing New Delhi’s security concerns, he said 'we will not let our land be used in any way that is detrimental to the interest of India.' Analysts say Dissanayake will build ties with India as he tries to revive the economy. 'The cooperation with India will certainly flourish and I want to reassure our continued support for India,' the Sri Lankan president said. 'Sri Lanka has to balance between India and China but Dissanayake is very much a pragmatist and not an idealogue. He knows that at the end of the day he cannot do anything to get on the wrong side of India, because India as its closest neighbor, is going to be there always,' according to Saravanamuttu. 'China will also be in Sri Lanka but on the question whether China will get a larger stake, I don’t think that will necessarily be the case.' In New Delhi, the Sri Lankan leader also met other top Indian diplomats — foreign minister Jaishankar Subramanian, and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. 'Our conversations focused on strengthening Indo-Sri Lanka economic cooperation, enhancing investment opportunities, fostering regional security, and advancing key sectors such as tourism and energy,' Dissanayake said in a statement. Ahead of the president’s visit, Colombo said it will go ahead with a port project being developed by Indian conglomerate Adani Group in Colombo. The government had earlier said it would review the project after the United States filed an indictment against the group’s founder and top officials charging them with duping investors by concealing that a huge solar energy project in India was being facilitated by an alleged $250 million bribery scheme.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-and-india-shore-up-ties-in-sri-lankan-president-s-first-overseas-visit-/7902875.html	2024-12-16T07:04:04-08:00	
North Korea involvement in Ukraine marks 'dangerous expansion' of conflict, US and allies say	Washington — Ten countries and the EU called North Korea's growing involvement in Russia's war in Ukraine a 'dangerous expansion' on Monday, in a joint statement released by the United States. Pyongyang has sent thousands of troops to reinforce Russia's war effort, including to the Kursk border region where Ukraine reported Monday that its fighters had killed or wounded at least 30 North Korean soldiers. 'Direct DPRK support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine marks a dangerous expansion of the conflict, with serious consequences for European and Indo-Pacific security,' the statement said, referring to North Korea by its official acronym. The foreign ministers of Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States and the high representative of the European Union signed the release. They also said that they were 'deeply concerned about any political, military, or economic support that Russia may be providing to the DPRK's illegal weapons programs, including weapons of mass destruction.' North Korea and Russia have strengthened their military ties since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Experts say the nuclear-armed North's leader, Kim Jong Un, is keen to acquire advanced technology from Moscow and battle experience for his troops. The statement signatories said they 'condemn in the strongest possible terms the increasing military cooperation' including the 'deployment of DPRK troops to Russia for use on the battlefield against Ukraine.' They added that the export of ballistic missiles, artillery shells and other military materiel by Pyongyang to Russia as well as Moscow's training of North Korean soldiers involving arms 'represent flagrant violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions.' 'We urge the DPRK to cease immediately all assistance for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, including by withdrawing its troops,' the statement said. The United States and South Korea have accused the North of sending more than 10,000 soldiers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-involvement-in-ukraine-marks-dangerous-expansion-of-conflict-us-and-allies-say/7902870.html	2024-12-16T06:50:42-08:00	
France’s new prime minister begins work amid a mountain of challenges	France’s latest prime minister, Francois Bayrou, gets to work this week to form a new cabinet, push a stopgap budget bill and — more precariously — scout for support for longer-term budget legislation to tackle the country’s fiscal woes — a move that led to his predecessor’s downfall. The task and stakes are enormous for the 73-year-old centrist, a veteran politician and longtime mayor of the southwestern town of Pau. Picked by French President Emmanuel Macron Friday, Bayrou is the country’s fourth prime minister this year — and he faces a squabbling, deeply divided lower house anchored by powerful leftist and far right blocks. Farmers, teachers, hospital staff and rail workers count among thousands who have taken to the streets in recent months over agricultural imports, labor issues, and other grievances. France’s disarray is also a worry for the European Union, facing Russian gains in Ukraine, and the risk of a more fractious transatlantic relationship with the incoming Trump administration. 'Nothing suggests he’ll last longer or fare better than the others,' France’s leading Le Monde newspaper said in editorial of Bayrou. The most immediate emergency lies in France’s Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte, where Cyclone Chido has wreaked widespread devastation, causing hundreds and possibly thousands of deaths, French authorities say. The acting interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, was heading to Mayotte on Monday. Head of the small MoDem or Democratic Freedom party that is part of Macron’s centrist alliance, Bayrou acknowledges he faces a 'Himalaya' of difficulties ahead. France’s budget deficit is estimated at more than six percent of its GDP — double the EU limit — and the country shoulders a sizable debt. Hours after Bayrou’s nomination, Moody’s rating agency downgraded France’s credit rating to Aa3, citing 'political fragmentation' as a reason. 'My first mission is to be a builder or, failing that, a repairer,' Bayrou told La Tribune Dimanche weekly, in an interview published Sunday. The stakes are also high for Macron, who emerges severely weakened after a catastrophic political year. The French president gambled on snap legislative elections earlier this year, after the far-right National Rally party topped a June European Parliament vote. He saw his centrist coalition emerging as the weakest bloc in France’s National Assembly, behind a leftist alliance and the National Rally. Risk for Europe So far, Macron has resisted calls to step down, insisting he will serve out his term that ends in 2027. But analysts suggest he could become a lame-duck president — leading the EU’s second-biggest power, at a difficult time for the bloc. A strong champion of Ukraine, Macron has also long pushed the bloc to beef up its defense in what he calls 'strategic autonomy.' Fellow EU heavyweight Germany is also dealing with political uncertainty, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz facing a no-confidence vote in parliament Monday and the possibility of early elections in February. Prolonged turmoil in France could affect the EU’s 'capacity to demonstrate unity and leadership,' wrote analysts Camille Grand, Camille Lons and Pawel Zerka of the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank. 'Especially,' they added, 'in the face of heightened threats to EU security policy posed by Russian president Vladimir Putin and America’s president-elect, Donald Trump.' With France 'mired in domestic issues,' the analysts added, 'other European countries will need to show political creativity and readiness to take ambitious action,' including developing a plan to support Ukraine in the weeks remaining before Trump takes office. A three-time presidential candidate, who served as education minister in the 1990s, Bayrou succeeds conservative Michel Barnier. Barnier was ousted earlier this month in a no-confidence motion in France’s lower house, after ramming through a budget bill without a vote. The move — by an unlikely front of leftist and far right lawmakers — made Barnier the country’s shortest-serving prime minister in modern history, lasting only three months. Bayrou begins meeting Monday with political parties, starting with the powerful far right National Rally, which has the most seats in parliament. So far, the Rally counts among several key parties taking a ‘wait-and-see’ approach, albeit setting out red lines that will make it difficult for Bayrou to find compromise. New polls found most French are underwhelmed by the latest political transition. More than two-thirds said they lack confidence in Bayrou’s ability to bring stability to the country, according to an Elabe survey.

Despite ceasefire with Hezbollah, residents of northern Israel are hesitant to return home	More than 60,000 residents of northern Israel were evacuated 14 months ago when Hezbollah began bombing the area in support of Hamas and its war against Israel. Now, as a tenuous ceasefire with Hezbollah takes hold, some Israeli residents are returning, although many say they are choosing to wait and see what happens.

Gaza ministry says death toll tops 45,000 people	Gaza’s health ministry said Monday that Israel’s offensive against Hamas militants in the Palestinian enclave has killed more than 45,000 people. The conflict has also wounded nearly 107,000 people, the ministry said. It does not distinguish between civilians and fighters in its count, but has previously said more than half of those killed have been women and children. The Gaza health ministry said in its daily update that 52 people were killed during the past day. Civil defense and hospital officials said deadly Israeli strikes Sunday included attacks on Gaza City in the north, Khan Younis in southern Gaza, and the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. Israel’s military said its operations Sunday including striking a Hamas command and control complex in Nuseirat. Israel has repeatedly blamed Hamas militants for operating within areas occupied by Palestinian civilians, while Palestinians and rights groups say the Israeli military is not doing enough to prevent civilian deaths. The war began in October 2023 with the Hamas attack on southern Israel, during which the militants killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. About 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, with at least one-third believed to be dead. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and others.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-ministry-says-death-toll-tops-45-000-people-/7902662.html	2024-12-16T03:24:56-08:00	
Race against time for rescuers as hundreds feared dead in Mayotte	Saint-Denis de la Reunion, France — Rescuers raced against time Monday to reach survivors after a devastating cyclone ripped through the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte, destroying homes across the islands, with hundreds feared dead. Images from Mayotte, which like other French overseas territories is an integral part of France and ruled from Paris, showed scenes of devastation, with homes reduced to piles of rubble. The crisis, which erupted at the weekend the day after President Emmanuel Macron appointed Francois Bayrou as the sixth prime minister of his mandate, poses a major challenge for a government still only operating in a caretaker capacity. The cyclone has left health services in tatters, with the hospital extremely damaged and health centers knocked out of operation, Health Minister Genevieve Darrieussecq told France 2. 'The hospital has suffered major water damage and destruction, notably in the surgical, intensive care, maternity and emergency units,' she said, adding that 'medical centres were also non-operational'. Macron was due to chair a crisis meeting in Paris, the Elysee said. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, whose super ministry is responsible for Mayotte, arrived on the island. Cyclone Chido caused major damage to Mayotte's airport and cut off electricity, water and communication links when it barreled down Saturday on France's poorest territory. Asked about the eventual death toll, Prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville, the top Paris-appointed official on the territory, told broadcaster Mayotte la Premiere 'I think there will definitely be several hundred, perhaps we will come close to a thousand or even several thousand.' With roads closed, officials fear that many could still be trapped under rubble in the inaccessible areas. The mayor of Mayotte's capital Mamoudzou, Ambdilwahedou Soumaila, told AFP the storm 'spared nothing'. 'The hospital is hit. The schools are hit. Houses are totally devastated,' he said. Some 160 additional soldiers and firefighters arrived, to reinforce the 110 already deployed. The nearby French island of La Reunion was serving as a hub for the rescue operations. 'Apocalyptic scenes' Chido was packing winds of at least 226 kilometers per hour when it slammed into Mayotte, which lies to the east of Mozambique. At least a third of the territory's 320,000 residents live in shantytowns, where homes with sheet-metal roofs were flattened by the storm. One resident, Ibrahim, told AFP of 'apocalyptic scenes' as he made his way through the main island, having to clear blocked roads himself. As authorities assessed the scale of the disaster, a first aid plane reached Mayotte on Sunday. It carried three tons of medical supplies, blood for transfusions and 17 medical staff, according to authorities in La Reunion. Patrice Latron, prefect of Reunion, said residents of Mayotte were facing 'an extremely chaotic situation, immense destruction.' Two military aircraft are expected to follow the initial aid flight, while a navy patrol ship was also due to depart La Reunion. There have been international pledges to help Mayotte, including from the regional Red Cross organization, PIROI. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc is 'ready to provide support in the days to come.' The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the WHO 'stands ready to support communities in need of essential health care.' With around 100,000 people estimated to live clandestinely on Mayotte, according to France's interior ministry, establishing how many people have been affected by the cyclone is proving difficult. Ousseni Balahachi, a former nurse, said some people did not dare venture out to seek assistance, 'fearing it would be a trap' designed to remove them from Mayotte. Many had stayed put 'until the last minute' when it proved too late to escape the cyclone, she added. Chido is the latest in a string of storms worldwide fueled by climate change, according to experts. The 'exceptional' cyclone was super-charged by particularly warm Indian Ocean waters, meteorologist Francois Gourand of the Meteo France weather service told AFP. Chido blasted across the Indian Ocean and made landfall in Mozambique on Sunday, where officials said the death toll stood at three. The UN humanitarian agency, OCHA, warned 1.7 million people were in danger and the remnants of the cyclone could also dump 'significant rainfall' on Malawi through Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/race-against-time-for-rescuers-as-hundreds-feared-dead-in-mayotte/7902621.html	2024-12-16T01:47:06-08:00	
Norway announces $242 million in Ukraine aid	Norway announced Monday $242 million in new military aid for Ukraine, including help securing access to the country’s vital Black Sea ports. 'It is essential to protect the Ukrainian population and Ukrainian infrastructure from attacks by Russia’s Black Sea Fleet,' Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said in a statement. 'It is also important to protect exports by sea of grain and other products, which generate crucial revenues for Ukraine.' The aid includes funding for training Ukrainian soldiers as well as mine clearance operations. Norway’s Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram said mines are a 'significant threat' in the Black Sea and that the aid will help Ukrainian forces detect and defuse mines near the coast. Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 27 of the 49 drones that Russian forces deployed in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi and Sumy regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said debris from a destroyed drone damaged power lines, but caused no casualties. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday its forces destroyed three Ukrainian aerial drones over the Kursk region.

Russian tankers damaged in Kerch Strait were carrying 62,000 barrels of oil products, TASS says	Moscow — Two Russian tankers that spilled oil into the Kerch Strait after sustaining serious damage during a heavy storm on Sunday were carrying 9,200 metric tons (62,000 barrels) of oil products at the time, the state TASS news agency reported. How much of the fuel leaked is being determined, TASS said. It said the Volgoneft 212 was carrying roughly 4,900 tons of fuel oil at the time, and the Volgoneft 239 held 4,300 tons. Russia's emergencies ministry said on Monday that all 14 crew members from the Volgoneft 239 had been rescued. The vessel ran aground 80 meters from the shore near the port of Taman. The Kerch Strait, which separates mainland Russia from Moscow-annexed Crimea, is a key route for exports of Russian grain and fuel products. The spill has the potential to be one of the largest environmental disasters to affect the region in recent years. On Sunday, one crew member was killed after the Volgoneft 212 split in half with its bow sinking. Eleven others were taken to a local hospital. President Vladimir Putin on Sunday ordered the government to set up a working group to deal with the rescue operation and mitigate the impact of the spill, Russian news agencies cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-tankers-damaged-in-kerch-strait-were-carrying-62-000-barrels-of-oil-products-tass-says/7902605.html	2024-12-16T01:13:34-08:00	
UN envoy advocates Syrian-led transition process in talks with rebel leader	The office of the U.N.’s Syria envoy said Monday that he stressed the need for a Syria-led political transition as he met in Damascus with the head of the rebel group that led the ouster of longtime President Bashar al-Assad. The transition should be based on the principles of a 2015 U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for 'credible, inclusive and non-sectarian governance,' within six months, as well as establishing a process for drafting a new constitution with elections to follow, envoy Geir Pederson’s office said in its statement. Pederson, in his talks with rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, also 'stressed the intention of the United Nations to render all assistance to the Syrian people.' A rebel statement said al-Sharaa discussed the need to update the resolution to reflect the current situation in Syria. Pederson’s visit is one piece of a widespread international engagement with the rebels since Assad’s ouster, as Syria faces political upheaval following more than 50 years of Assad family rule and the need for massive reconstruction after bloody civil war. U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said Monday he arrived in Beirut and would be making his way to Damascus. 'A week of change in five decades, and then five decades of change in a week,' Fletcher said on X. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the EU’s envoy to Syria was heading to Damascus on Monday for talks. Al-Sharaa’s group, Haya Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), is designated a terror group by the United States and others. As governments engage with the rebels, officials have signaled a willingness to reconsider that status, but have cautioned that it will be the group’s actions that will be judged in any reconsideration process. 'For us, it's not only the words, but we want to see the deeds going in the right direction,' Kallas told reporters in Brussels. 'Syria faces optimistic, positive, but rather uncertain future and we have to make sure that this goes to the right direction,' Kallas added. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-envoy-advocates-syrian-led-transition-process-in-talks-with-rebel-leader/7902604.html	2024-12-16T01:06:26-08:00	
Australia reels from hate crimes enflamed by Middle East tensions	SYDNEY — Australian authorities are responding to a surge in antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crimes. Australian police said offensive graffiti that demeaned Islam was found under a bridge in the Sydney suburb of Sefton on Sunday. The New South Wales state Premier Chris Minns said 'this racism and Islamophobia is disgusting and corrosive to the very fabric' of multiculturalism. Sefton is a majority-Muslim district. Official data shows that a third of residents follow Islam. Jason Clare, the federal education minister, told reporters Monday that all racism needed to be confronted. 'We need to condemn this and all forms of racism right across the country,' Clare said. 'We are the best country in the world and one of the reasons for that is because we are made up of people from all around the world, all different religions living here in harmony, and this is just the absolute opposite of that.' Jewish groups have also condemned the anti-Islamic graffiti, insisting that the 'hateful' incident would be distressing for the whole community. Muslim leaders, though, have said similar hate crimes targeting the Islamic community have not been taken seriously by Australia’s politicians. Gamal Kheir, secretary of the Lebanese Muslim Association, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. on Monday that the authorities had to do more. 'There is an underlying racist element, whether that be antisemitic, Islamophobic or any other form of racism, that is not being addressed and we (are) calling on government to stop making this a political football where politicians (are) trying to politically point-score, and resolve the problem,' Kheir said. Australian police are also investigating another antisemitic hate attack. Earlier this month, a vehicle was set alight and properties were vandalized with anti-Israel graffiti in Sydney. The Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has set up a new task force to tackle antisemitic crimes following a recent arson attack on a synagogue in Melbourne. Police are treating the firebombing as a likely terror attack. Earlier this year, the Canberra government created special antisemitic and Islamophobia community envoys to help curb a rise in hate crimes linked to conflict in the Middle East. Community groups have reported an increase in Islamophobic and antisemitic abuse in Australia since Israel’s war in Gaza began in October 2023. A police investigation into anti-Islamic graffiti in Sydney is continuing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-reels-from-hate-crimes-enflamed-by-middle-east-tensions/7902596.html	2024-12-16T00:43:52-08:00	
Thailand to host two regional meetings focused on Myanmar this week	Bangkok — Thailand said on Monday it will host two regional meetings on Myanmar this week, with at least one to have representatives of the junta, as the Malaysian Prime Minister said efforts were being made to bring Myanmar back to the fore of ASEAN. Thai foreign minister Maris Sangiampongsa will hold the separate consultations on Dec 19 and 20, after Thailand in October offered to host informal talks to try to find a way out of the crisis that has gripped Myanmar since a 2021 military coup. Representatives from Myanmar will take part in Thursday's meeting, which Thai foreign ministry spokesman Nikorndej Balankura said would be an informal consultation on border security and transnational crime. Representatives from China, India, Bangladesh, Laos and Thailand, which all share borders with Myanmar, will also attend. On Friday, there will be a foreign minister-level meeting on Myanmar for 'interested members' of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including discussing ASEAN's 'Five Point Consensus' plan for peace in the country, Nikorndej said. It is not clear if Myanmar will have any representatives at Friday's meeting, and if so at what level. Since the coup, ASEAN has snubbed Myanmar's military leaders by only inviting non-political representatives from the country to regional meetings of leaders and foreign ministers. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who will chair ASEAN in 2025, said on Monday that he was committed to implementing ASEAN's peace plan, which has made scant progress since its unveiling in April 2021 soon after the coup. 'We are taking measures through dialogues informally at different levels to ensure Myanmar participates, and bring back Myanmar to the fore of ASEAN,' Anwar said at a joint press conference in Kuala Lumpur with Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, without elaborating further. Indonesia has said its foreign minister will attend the Dec 20 meeting. Chaos has prevailed in Myanmar since the 2021 military coup sparked a nationwide rebellion and a civil war that has ravaged the nation of 55 million. At a summit in October, ASEAN called for 'an immediate cessation' of violence and the creation of a 'conducive environment for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and inclusive national dialogue' that is 'Myanmar-owned and –led.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-to-host-two-regional-meetings-focused-on-myanmar-this-week/7902565.html	2024-12-15T22:36:23-08:00	
China's Xi calls on party to 'turn knife inward' to end corruption	BEIJING — China's Communist Party must 'turn the knife inward' to eliminate problems of discipline, including corruption, President Xi Jinping said, a new call to hunt down corrupt officials and those who corrupt them. Since coming to power over a decade ago, Xi has cracked down on corruption involving party members, whether they were corrupt high-ranking 'tigers' or lowly 'flies' who failed to implement government policies. But despite the sweeping crackdown, the party continues to be plagued by graft, particularly within the armed forces. Two former defense ministers have been purged from the party in the past two years for 'serious violations of discipline,' a euphemism for corruption. The party must take counter-measures against any interest group, organization of power, or privileged class from preying on or corrupting party members, Xi warned in a speech published on Monday by Qiushi Journal, a flagship party magazine. 'As the situation and tasks facing the party change, there will inevitably be all kinds of conflicts and problems within the party,' he said. 'We must have the courage to turn the knife inward and eliminate their negative impact in a timely manner to ensure that the party is always full of vigor and vitality.' Xi's call to 'turn the knife inward' was part of a speech he gave at a major meeting with the party's anti-graft watchdog on Jan. 8, but had not been disclosed previously. The excerpts published on Monday suggest a renewed and wider push to instill discipline and hunt down officials seeking personal gain and those who lead them astray. Last month, the defense ministry disclosed that an admiral who had served on the Central Military Commission, the country's highest-level military command body, was under investigation for 'serious violations of discipline.' Last year, about 610,000 party officials were punished for violating party discipline, of which 49 were officials above the vice minister or governor level, according to statistics from the party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-calls-on-party-to-turn-knife-inward-to-end-corruption/7902564.html	2024-12-15T22:33:47-08:00	
Five years on from the pandemic, long COVID keeps lives on hold	VIENNA — Three years ago, Andrea Vanek was studying to be an arts and crafts teacher when spells of dizziness and heart palpitations suddenly started to make it impossible for her to even take short walks. After seeing a succession of doctors she was diagnosed with long COVID and even now spends most of her days in the small living room of her third-floor Vienna apartment, sitting on the windowsill to observe the world outside. 'I can't plan anything because I just don't know how long this illness will last,' the 33-year-old Austrian told AFP. The first cases of COVID-19 were detected in China in December 2019, sparking a global pandemic and more than seven million reported deaths to date, according to the World Health Organization. But millions more have been affected by long COVID, in which some people struggle to recover from the acute phase of COVID-19, suffering symptoms including tiredness, brain fog and shortness of breath. Vanek tries to be careful not to exert herself to avoid another 'crash', which for her is marked by debilitating muscle weakness and can last for months, making it hard to even open a bottle of water. 'We know that long COVID is a big problem,' said Anita Jain, from the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme. About six percent of people infected by coronavirus develop long COVID, according to the global health body, which has recorded some 777 million COVID cases to date. Whereas the rates of long COVID after an initial infection are declining, reinfection increases the risk, Jain added. 'Everything hurts' Chantal Britt, who lives in Bern, Switzerland, contracted COVID in March 2020. Long COVID, she said, has turned her 'life upside down' and forced her to 'reinvent' herself. 'I was really an early bird.... Now I take two hours to get up in the morning at least because everything hurts,' the 56-year-old former marathon runner explained. 'I'm not even hoping anymore that I'm well in the morning but I'm still kind of surprised how old and how broken I feel.' About 15 percent of those who have long COVID have persistent symptoms for more than one year, according to the WHO, while women tend to have a higher risk than men of developing the condition. Britt, who says she used to be a 'workaholic', now works part-time as a university researcher on long COVID and other topics. She lost her job in communications in 2022 after she asked to reduce her work hours. She misses doing sports, which used to be like 'therapy' for her, and now has to plan her daily activities more, such as thinking of places where she can sit down and rest when she goes shopping. A lack of understanding by those around her also make it more difficult. 'It's an invisible disease.... which connects to all the stigma surrounding it,' she said. 'Even the people who are really severely affected, who are at home, in a dark room, who can't be touched anymore, any noise will drive them into a crash, they don't look sick,' she said. Fall 'through the cracks' The WHO's Jain said it can be difficult for healthcare providers to give a diagnosis and wider recognition of the condition is crucial. More than 200 symptoms have been listed alongside common ones such as fatigue, shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction. 'Now a lot of the focus is on helping patients, helping clinicians with the tools to accurately diagnose long COVID, detect it early,' she said. Patients like Vanek also struggle financially. She has filed two court cases to get more support but both are yet to be heard. She said the less than $840 she gets in support cannot cover her expenses, which include high medical bills for the host of pills she needs to keep her symptoms in check. 'It's very difficult for students who get long COVID. We fall right through the cracks' of the social system, unable to start working, she said. Britt also wants more targeted research into post-infectious conditions like long COVID. 'We have to understand them better because there will be another pandemic and we will be as clueless as ever,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/five-years-on-from-the-pandemic-long-covid-keeps-lives-on-hold/7902549.html	2024-12-15T21:33:35-08:00	
China's weak consumption drags on economy as Trump tariff threat looms	BEIJING — China's industrial output growth quickened slightly in November, while retail sales disappointed, keeping pressure on Beijing to ramp up stimulus for a fragile economy as it braces for more U.S. trade tariffs under a second Trump administration. The mixed set of data underlines the challenges facing Chinese leaders heading into 2025 when trade relations with the United States could worsen at a time when domestic consumption also remains weak. 'China's economy appears to have slowed last month, despite tailwinds from recent policy easing,' said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics. 'But we doubt that stimulus can deliver anything more than a short-lived improvement, not least because the current strength of export demand is unlikely to last once President Trump starts to put some of his tariff threats into action.' China's industrial output grew 5.4% in November year-on-year, up from the 5.3% pace seen in October, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday, beating expectations for a 5.3% increase in a Reuters poll. However, retail sales, a gauge of consumption, grew just 3.3% last month, much slower than a 4.8% rise seen in October. Analysts had predicted a 4.6% expansion. The weaker retail figures come despite a boost from major online shopping promotions and government-subsidized trade-in programs that have boosted sales in sectors including automobiles. Fixed asset investment also increased at a slower 3.3% pace in January-November from the same period a year earlier, compared with an expected 3.4% rise. It grew 3.4% in the January to October period. NBS spokesperson Fu Linghui told a media briefing that the trend of recovery in consumption has not changed and that more efforts would be needed to ensure the economic recovery continues into 2025. At last week's Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), a closely-watched agenda-setting meeting, China's top leaders pledged to raise the budget deficit, issue more debt, and make boosting consumption a top priority. The remarks echoed commitments made by a meeting of top Communist Party officials, the Politburo, earlier this month, which endorsed an 'appropriately loose' monetary policy in the first easing of its stance in 14 years. Policymakers continue to grapple with a years-long property crisis that is dragging on consumer confidence and the broader economy, with some 70% of household savings parked in real estate. There was some encouraging signs on China's new home prices, which fell at the slowest pace in 17 months in November. Officials in recent months have doubled down on efforts to encourage homebuying, including cutting mortgage rates and minimum down-payment ratios, as well as tax incentives to lower the cost of housing transactions. However, most analysts say a sure-footed recovery in the real estate sector appears to be some way off. Reuters has reported that policy advisers have recommended that Beijing maintain a growth target of around 5.0% for next year, with one government economist saying that China can offset the impact of expected U.S. tariffs on its exports by further boosting domestic demand. Trump, who is set to start his second term as the U.S. president in January, has threatened tariffs in excess of 60% on imports of Chinese goods. Reuters also reported last week that China was considering allowing the yuan to weaken in response to punitive trade measures, but a readout from state media Xinhua after the CEWC reiterated a commitment to maintain the yuan's basic stability. A recent Reuters poll predicted China will grow 4.5% next year, with new U.S. tariffs potentially shaving up to 1 parentage point off growth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-weak-consumption-drags-on-economy-as-trump-tariff-threat-looms/7902544.html	2024-12-15T21:24:35-08:00	
Biden, Harris thank donors, urge them to stay engaged after tough loss to Trump	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday thanked deep-pocketed Democratic donors who raised record sums in last month's election loss to President-elect Donald Trump and urged them not to lose hope and to remain politically engaged. Biden and Harris, along with their spouses, in remarks at the Democratic National Committee holiday reception sought to buck up key donors who the Democratic Party needs to stay committed as it tries to pick up the pieces. Republicans scored a decisive victory taking the White House and Senate while maintaining control of the House in an election where donors of all political stripes spent about $4.7 billion. 'We all get knocked down. My dad would say when you get knocked down, you just got to get up,' Biden said. 'The measure of a person or a party is how fast they get back up.' Harris, who stepped in as the party's presidential nominee after Biden ended his campaign in July following his disastrous debate performance, praised donors for putting their time — and checkbooks — into backing her and Democrats that they believed in. Democrats, their allied super PACs and other groups raised about $2.9 billion, compared to about $1.8 billion for the Republicans. Harris noted that Democrats raised a whopping $700 million over just 700 events organized by the Democratic finance committee. 'You rallied, you opened your homes, you reached out to your friends and your family,' said Harris, who will soon begin weighing in earnest her own future and whether to make another White House run. 'You put your personal capital — and by that I mean your relationships — at stake to talk with people because you care so deeply, and you connected with people and took the time to remind them of what is at stake and what was at stake.' While Biden acknowledged the sting that Democrats continue to feel about last month's loss, he said they should take pride in what they accomplished. The administration's signature achievements include a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S., and a surge in federal environmental spending through the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022 after it cleared Congress solely with Democratic votes. 'We could never have gotten as much done as we did without you,' Biden said. 'You not only contributed to the campaign, but you did something, I think, even more important. You were willing to lend your names, your reputation, your character to the effort.' Biden said that he intended to remain engaged with party politics once he leaves office on Jan. 20. He also predicted that he expected Harris would remain a central character in the party's future. 'You're not going anywhere kid. We aren't letting you,' Biden said to Harris.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-harris-thank-donors-urge-them-to-stay-engaged-after-tough-loss-to-trump/7902540.html	2024-12-15T21:20:36-08:00	
In Damascus, students and schoolchildren resume classes without Assad	Damascus, Syria — In the large courtyard of the Faculty of Letters at Damascus University, hundreds of jubilant students trampled on Sunday a statue, symbol of the former power, a week after the fall of the capital. 'The atmosphere is extraordinary, everyone is happy, look at the joy of the people,' exclaims Rinad Abdallah, an 18-year-old medical student. In front of her, the several-meter-high statue of Hafez al-Assad, who ruled Syria unchallenged from 1971 to 2000 before his son succeeded him, was thrown to the ground. 'I have an old photo where I'm posing in front of the statue, now I'm going to pose in the same place, without the statue!' the young woman says, laughing. The faculty's dean, Dr. Ali Allaham, told AFP that classes resumed on Sunday with around 80% of staff and a 'large number' of students present. In the courtyard, hundreds of students are cheering, chanting revolutionary slogans and waving the three-star flag, a symbol of the 2011 pro-democracy uprising. 'This is a moment we have been waiting for for so long. And then, there is no longer this statue that oppressed us with its presence,' says Yasmine Chehab, a 29-year-old English literature student. 'We finally feel free! We can finally say what we think without fear,' continues the student, who says she is confident in the future of Syria. 'There will be a place for all communities, who will move forward hand in hand,' she adds. Thousands of students marched in a spontaneous demonstration towards the central Umayyad Square, where Syrians have been celebrating the fall of Bashar al-Assad for a week. Prime Minister Mohammad al-Bashir, in charge of the transition in Syria, assured on Wednesday that the coalition led by the Islamists of Hayaat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) would guarantee the rights of all, in a multi-ethnic and multi-confessional country. Flags everywhere Schoolchildren, some in uniform, also returned to class in Damascus on Sunday for the first time since the fall of Bashar al-Assad on December 8, according to AFP journalists. On their way to school, girls make the victory sign. One of them has drawn the three-star flag on her cheek. Others proudly wave flags that flutter in the wind. 'The school has asked us (...) to send middle and high school students to class. The youngest will return in two days,' Raghida Ghosn, 56, a mother of three, told AFP. Inside a classroom, little has changed, or almost nothing. A large flag, symbol of the revolution, has been hung on the wall. According to a public school employee, attendance on Sunday 'does not exceed 30%,' but 'the numbers should gradually increase.' A Sunday Mass was also celebrated at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Dormition in Damascus. Life has also resumed in shops and businesses and residents have been going to their offices since the early hours of the day. In front of a bakery in the residential and popular district of Rokn-Eddine, around 10 people were queuing, in peace, noted an AFP journalist. On the sidewalks, street vendors offer cans of gasoline to residents, who are suffering from the fuel shortage. In Damascus, as everywhere in Syria, repeated power cuts are frequent. They deprive residents of long hours of electricity, sometimes up to 20 hours a day in some neighborhoods.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-damascus-students-and-schoolchildren-resume-classes-without-assad/7902524.html	2024-12-15T20:16:14-08:00	
South Korean investigators request that impeached president appear for questioning	Seoul, South Korea — South Korean law enforcement authorities will request that impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol appear for questioning this week over his short-lived martial law decree as they expand a probe into whether his ill-conceived power grab amounted to rebellion. A joint investigative team involving police, an anti-corruption agency and the Defense Ministry plans to convey a request to Yoon's office that he appears for questioning on Wednesday, the police said Monday. Yoon was impeached by the opposition-controlled National Assembly on Saturday over his Dec. 3 martial law decree. His presidential powers will be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him. If Yoon is dismissed, an election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days. Yoon has justified his martial law enforcement as a necessary act of governance against an opposition he described as 'anti-state forces' bogging down his agendas and vowed to 'fight to the end' against efforts to remove him from office. Hundreds of thousands of protesters have poured onto the streets of the country's capital, Seoul, in recent days, calling for Yoon's ouster and arrest. It remains unclear whether Yoon will grant the request by investigators for an interview. South Korean prosecutors, who are pushing a separate investigation into the incident, also reportedly asked Yoon to appear at a prosecution office for questioning on Sunday but he refused to do so. Repeated calls to a prosecutors' office in Seoul were unanswered. Yoon's office has also resisted a police attempt to search the compound for evidence. The request came before the Constitutional Court meets to discuss the case later Monday. The court has up to 180 days to rule. But observers say that a court ruling could come faster. In the case of parliamentary impeachments of past presidents — Roh Moo-hyun in 2004 and Park Geun-hye in 2016 — the court spent 63 days and 91 days respectively before determining to reinstate Roh and dismiss Park. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who will serve as the country's acting leader while Yoon's powers are suspended, and other government officials have sought to reassure allies and markets after Yoon's surprise stunt paralyzed politics, halted high-level diplomacy and complicated efforts to revive a faltering economy. Liberal opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, whose Democratic Party holds a majority in the National Assembly, urged the Constitutional Court to rule swiftly on Yoon's impeachment and proposed a special council for policy cooperation between the government and parliament. Lee, a firebrand lawmaker who for years drove a political offensive against Yoon's government, is seen as the frontrunner to replace him. He lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon by a razor-thin margin. Kweon Seong-dong, floor leader of Yoon's conservative People Power Party, separately criticized Lee's proposal, saying that it's 'not right' for the opposition party to act like the ruling party. Kweon, a Yoon loyalist, said his party will use existing PPP-government dialogue channels 'to continue to assume responsibility as the governing party until the end of President Yoon's term.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-investigators-request-that-impeached-president-appear-for-questioning-/7902508.html	2024-12-15T17:41:05-08:00	
One of Libya's main refineries shut down after fighting	Tripoli, Libya — One of Libya's main refineries in the west has been shut down after clashes between local armed groups erupted early Sunday and caused fires on infrastructure, state oil company NOC said. Several tanks at the Zawiya refinery, a town 45 km west of Tripoli and the only one in western Libya that supplies the local market with fuel, caught fire, according to videos posted on social media, before being brought under control. Built in 1974, the Zawiya refinery, which is also a port terminal for importing and exporting fuels, is the largest in the country after that of Ras Lanouf (north), with a refining capacity exceeding 120,000 barrels per day. The NOC announced in a statement the suspension of production, declaring 'a state of force majeure and a state of emergency level three (maximum degree) following the damage caused to several tanks at the Zawiya refinery in the early hours of December 15.' 'Clashes with heavy and medium weapons broke out between armed groups in the perimeter of the refinery, causing serious fires, brought under control by civil defense personnel,' according to the statement. Libyan news sites reported a death toll of one dead and 10 injured among the armed groups, without official confirmation. 'All the fires that broke out in the refinery's tanks, which were hit by gunfire, have been brought under control,' NOC spokesperson Khaled Ghulam told Libya al-Ahrar TV. 'We reassure the residents of Zawiya and Tripoli that the fuel supply to the tanks of the Brega Oil distribution company is secure and that the distribution of gasoline to gas stations continues without interruption,' the official added. Zawiya, the third largest city in Tripolitania after Tripoli and Misrata, is the scene of violent and recurring fighting between armed groups. In May, clashes between rival gangs left one dead and a dozen injured before the intervention of notables and tribal leaders. Classes have been suspended in all schools and at the university in Zawiya, according to the Libyan news agency Lana. The coastal road linking the city to Tripoli has been reopened after a closure that lasted until early morning. Invoked in exceptional circumstances, the 'state of force majeure' allows an exemption from the NOC's liability in the event of non-compliance with oil delivery contracts. Since the fall and death of leader Muammar Gadhafi in 2011, Libya, which has the most abundant hydrocarbon reserves in Africa, has struggled to extricate itself from more than a decade of chaos and division, with two rival governments vying for power. Blockades of oil and gas sites have been frequent in recent years in Libya, linked either to social grievances, security threats or political disputes. Thanks to a lull and new investments in infrastructure, production, which has been around 1.2 million barrels per day for the past ten years, rose to 1.4 million barrels per day at the beginning of December (compared to 1.5 to 1.6 million before the 2011 Revolt).	https://www.voanews.com/a/one-of-libya-main-refineries-shut-down-after-fighting/7902249.html	2024-12-15T15:51:33-08:00	
UN launches fresh attempt to resolve Libya's election impasse	The United Nations will convene a technical committee of Libya experts to resolve contentious issues and put the country on the path to long-awaited national elections, the acting head of the U.N. mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said Sunday. A political process to resolve more than a decade of conflict in Libya has been stalled since an election scheduled for December 2021 collapsed amid disputes over the eligibility of the main candidates. The new committee of Libya experts will look for ways to overcome outstanding issues in electoral laws, the U.N. mission's (UNSMIL) acting head, Stephanie Koury, said in a video statement. They will also look for options to 'reach elections in the shortest possible time including with proposed guarantees, assurances and a timeframe,' she added. A Government of National Unity (GNU) under Prime Minister Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah was installed through a U.N.-backed process in 2021 but the parliament no longer recognizes its legitimacy. Dbeibah has vowed not to cede power to a new government without national elections. Libya has had little peace since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising, and it split in 2014 between eastern and western factions, with rival administrations governing in each area. While all major political players in the country have repeatedly called for elections, many Libyans have voiced skepticism that they genuinely seek a vote that could push most of them from positions of authority. 'UNSMIL will also continue to work to help advance the unification of military and security institutions and, with partners, advancing national reconciliation,' Koury said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-launches-fresh-attempt-to-resolve-libya-election-impasse/7902243.html	2024-12-15T15:33:55-08:00	
Qatar announces embassy in Syria will reopen Tuesday	Doha, Qatar — Qatar's embassy to Syria is to resume operations Tuesday, the Gulf emirate announced Sunday as its diplomats visited the country and met with its transitional government following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad. 'Qatar announces the resumption of the work of its embassy in the sisterly Syrian Arab Republic starting the day after tomorrow, Tuesday,' the foreign ministry said in a statement. It also named a new head of mission to Syria, Khalifa Abdullah Al Mahmoud Al-Sharif. Doha closed its embassy in Damascus and recalled its ambassador in July 2011, early in the uprising against the Assad government that turned into a civil war. Unlike other Arab countries, Qatar never restored diplomatic ties with Syria under Assad, who was topped by the 11-day rebel advance that swept through major cities and then the capital Damascus. Doha said the return after the 13-year hiatus was 'an expression of the State of Qatar's principled stand with the Syrian people's revolution' as well as a 'categorical rejection of all the repressive policies of the regime' of Assad. Earlier, foreign minister spokesperson Majed al-Ansari told the official Qatar News Agency that a Qatari delegation was in Syria and had met with officials in the transitional government. The delegation 'arrived in Damascus to complete the necessary procedures for the opening of the State of Qatar's embassy,' Ansari said. In its meetings, 'the delegation reaffirmed the State of Qatar's full commitment to supporting the Syrian people... following the success of their revolution,' the spokesperson added. Ansari said the Qatari delegation had also 'discussed with the Syrian side, ways to facilitate the flow of Qatari humanitarian aid and assessed the needs of the Syrian brothers during this important phase.' This week, an official briefed on developments said Qatar had 'established the first channel of communication' with the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which spearheaded the ouster of the former government. The official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions, added the 'focus of the communication with HTS and others is on the need... to maintain calm and preserve Syria's public institutions during the transition period.' Other governments that opposed Assad's rule, including Turkey and the United States, have said they too had established contacts with HTS.	https://www.voanews.com/a/qatar-announces-embassy-in-syria-will-reopen-tuesday-/7902238.html	2024-12-15T15:16:21-08:00	
Erdogan to visit Ethiopia, Somalia in early 2025 after brokering deal	Istanbul — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will visit Ethiopia and Somalia early next year after brokering a deal to end tensions between the two Horn of Africa neighbors, he said on X Sunday. 'I will visit Ethiopia and Somalia in the first two months of the New Year,' he wrote in a message that referred to the deal between Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud in Ankara on December 11. The pair agreed to end their nearly yearlong bitter dispute after hours of talks brokered by Erdogan, who hailed the breakthrough as 'historic.' The dispute began in January when landlocked Ethiopia struck a deal in with Somalia's breakaway region Somaliland to lease a stretch of coastline for a port and military base. In return, Somaliland — which declared independence from Somalia in 1991 in a move not recognized by Mogadishu — said Ethiopia would give it formal recognition, although this was never confirmed by Addis Ababa. Somalia branded the deal a violation of its sovereignty, setting international alarm bells ringing over the risk of renewed conflict in the volatile Horn of Africa region. Turkey stepped in to mediate in July, holding three previous rounds of talks — two in Ankara and one in New York — before last week's breakthrough, which won praise from the African Union, Washington and Brussels. Fresh from his latest diplomatic success, Erdogan on Friday telephoned Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and he offered 'to step in to resolve the disputes between Sudan and the United Arab Emirates,' his office said. Since April 2023, Sudan has been mired in a brutal conflict between army chief Burhan and his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo who leads the RSF. Sudan's army-backed government has repeatedly accused the UAE of supporting the RSF — a claim which the UAE has consistently denied. The war has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced over 11 million more.	https://www.voanews.com/a/erdogan-to-visit-ethiopia-somalia-in-early-2025-after-brokering-deal/7902234.html	2024-12-15T15:04:43-08:00	
Zelenskyy offers Syria humanitarian grain deliveries	Kyiv, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced Sunday that he would provide Syria with grain and other agricultural products on a humanitarian basis, a week after the fall of Moscow's ally, President Bashar al-Assad. 'Now we can help the Syrians with our wheat, flour and oil: our products that are used globally to ensure food security,' he said in his daily address. 'We are coordinating with our partners and the Syrian side to resolve logistical issues. We will support this region so that stability there becomes a foundation for our movement towards real peace,' Zelenskyy added. According to him, these possible deliveries will be part of the 'Grain of Ukraine' program, launched in 2022 to provide food aid to the poorest countries. Even at war, Ukraine, one of the world's largest producers of grain, retains immense production capacities. And despite Moscow's threats to shoot ships sailing in the Black Sea, Kyiv has set up a corridor there to export its agricultural products from the summer of 2023. After an 11-day offensive, the rebel coalition dominated by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) on Dec. 8 overthrew Assad, who took refuge in Russia. The fall was a serious setback for Moscow, which, along with Iran, was the former Syrian president's main ally and had been intervening militarily in Syria since 2015.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-offers-syria-humanitarian-grain-deliveries/7902231.html	2024-12-15T14:56:54-08:00	
North Korean media report South Korean President Yoon's impeachment	Seoul, South Korea — North Korean state media KCNA on Monday reported on the South Korean parliament passing President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment vote Saturday. Yoon was impeached in a second vote by South Korea's opposition-led parliament over his short-lived attempt to impose martial law, which shocked the nation. KCNA had reported for the first time on Dec. 11 South Korea's martial law crisis which was sparked on Dec. 3. On Monday, KCNA did not offer much commentary, but called Yoon's defiant televised remarks on Dec. 12 'a press statement spliced with lies and obstinacy' and noted the rally in front of South Korean parliament that called for Yoon's impeachment. It also noted media reports on various South Korean military and police officials' suspension from duties and ongoing investigation into Yoon. After the impeachment vote passed Saturday, South Korea's acting defense minister, Kim Seon-ho, called on the military to maintain preparedness and ordered commanding officers to work promptly to stabilize their troop commands. On Saturday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia has begun using North Korean troops in significant numbers for the first time to conduct assaults on Ukrainian forces battling to hold an enclave in Russia's Kursk region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korean-media-report-south-korean-president-yoon-s-impeachment/7902225.html	2024-12-15T14:38:27-08:00	
Storms across US bring heavy snow, dangerous ice, tornado in California	Omaha, Nebraska — A tornado near a mall in central California swept up cars, uprooted trees and sent several people to the hospital. In San Francisco, authorities issued the first-ever tornado warning. Elsewhere, inclement weather plagued areas of the U.S., with dangerous conditions including heavy snow in upstate New York, a major ice storm in Midwest states and severe weather warnings around Lake Tahoe. The ice storm beginning Friday evening created treacherous driving conditions across Iowa and eastern Nebraska Friday and into Saturday and prompted temporary closures of Interstate 80 after numerous cars and trucks slid off the road. In upstate New York, more than 33 inches (84 centimeters) was reported near Orchard Park, which is often a landing point for lake-effect snow. On Saturday, a tornado touched down near a shopping mall in Scotts Valley, California, about 110 kilometers south of San Francisco, around 1:40 p.m. The tornado overturned cars and toppled trees and utility poles, the National Weather Service said. The Scotts Valley Police Department said several people were injured and taken to hospitals. In San Francisco, some trees toppled onto cars and streets and damaged roofs. The damage was due to 129-kph straight-line winds, not a tornado, weather service meteorologist Dalton Behringer said Sunday. Roger Gass, a meteorologist in the weather service’s office in Monterey, California, said the warning of a possible tornado in San Francisco was a first for the city, noting an advanced alert did not go out before the last tornado struck nearly 20 years ago. 'I would guess there wasn’t a clear signature on radar for a warning in 2005,' said Gass, who was not there at the time. The fast-moving storm prompted warnings for residents to take shelter, but few people have basements in the area. More than 30 centimeters of snow fell at some Lake Tahoe ski resorts, and 181-kph gust of wind was recorded at the Mammoth Mountain resort south of Yosemite National Park, according to the weather service’s office in Reno, Nevada. Up to 90 centimeters of snow was forecast for the Sierra Nevada mountaintops. The weekend Tahoe Live music festival at Palisades Tahoe ski resort in California went ahead as planned in spite of a snowstorm Saturday. Lil Wayne and Diplo were scheduled to perform Sunday, the festival’s website said. An avalanche warning was in effect at least until Monday morning in the area. Interstate 80 was closed along a 130-kilometer stretch from Applegate, California, to the Nevada line just west of Reno on Saturday. The California Highway Patrol reopened the road in the afternoon for passenger vehicles with chains or four-wheel drive and snow tires. The severe weather in the Midwest resulted in at least one death. The Washington County Sheriff’s office in Nebraska said a 57-year-old woman died after she lost control of her pickup on Highway 30 near Arlington and hit an oncoming truck. The other driver sustained minor injuries. Businesses announced plans to open late Saturday as temperatures rose high enough in the afternoon to melt the ice in most places. 'Luckily some warmer air is moving in behind this to make it temporary,' said Dave Cousins, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s office in Davenport, Iowa. Tens of thousands of people in western Washington state lost electricity Saturday as the system delivered rain and gusty winds, local news outlets reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/storms-across-us-bring-heavy-snow-dangerous-ice-tornado-in-california/7902218.html	2024-12-15T14:19:43-08:00	
North Pole' flight takes kids to Santa in transformed Denver airport hangar	Denver, Colorado — Dozens of kids cheered on a festively decked-out plane in Denver on Saturday when the pilot announced their destination for the day: the North Pole. More than 100 children, some of whom have serious health issues, were then taken on a roughly 45-minute flight near the city before landing back at Denver International Airport and being towed to a hangar transformed by United Airlines employees and volunteers into the North Pole. Streamers, paper snowflakes and tufts of cotton resembling feathery snow dotted the plane and seats. Flight personnel paraded a bubble machine up and down the aisle to shouts of 'bubbles, bubbles, bubbles' from the excited children. Holiday songs played in the background and there were apple snacks and juice for all. Before landing, the children were asked to close their window shades. When they opened, the kids were met by the sight of a waiting Santa and Mrs. Claus and a host of elves. An ice cream truck was on hand and the children received gifts. Bryce Bosley, 6, was tickled to see Santa and all the North Pole had to offer. 'The North Pole is fun because there's games, food, and all the activities are really fun,' he said. United Capt. Bob Zimmermann, the holiday flight's pilot, was struck by the joy and wonder of the youngsters. 'Throughout the year I'll think of the fantasy flight,' he said. 'When life seems to get tough or I want to complain about something, I remember these kids and the joy and the love and what this feels like, and it just keeps my life in perspective.' United partnered with Make-A-Wish Colorado, Girls Inc., Children's Hospital Colorado and Rocky Mountain Down Syndrome Association to invite Denver-area kids ages 3 to 10 years on the flight. For more than 30 years, United has staged its annual 'fantasy flights' to fictional North Poles at airports around the world to bring holiday cheer to children and their families. This year they took place in 13 cities, starting Dec. 5 in Honolulu and then in Washington, Houston, Los Angeles, London, Chicago, San Francisco, Tokyo, Cleveland and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and on the island of Guam. Newark, New Jersey, also had a flight Saturday. Jonna McGrath, United's vice president for operations at its Denver hub, has participated in 29 flights and said it is one of her favorite days of the year. 'It gives them a day where they are away from some of the challenges they face in their day-to-day life,' said McGrath, who was dressed as an elf. 'Bringing a little magic and some gifts to their holiday season is something they'll never forget.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-pole-flight-takes-kids-to-santa-in-transformed-denver-airport-hangar/7902213.html	2024-12-15T14:05:06-08:00	
Israel will close its Ireland embassy over Gaza tensions	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israel said Sunday it will close its embassy in Ireland as relations deteriorated over the war in Gaza, where Palestinian medical officials said new Israeli airstrikes killed over 30 people including several children. The decision to close the embassy came in response to what Israel's foreign minister has described as Ireland's 'extreme anti-Israel policies.' In May, Israel recalled its ambassador to Dublin after Ireland announced, along with Norway, Spain and Slovenia, it would recognize a Palestinian state. The Irish Cabinet last week decided to formally intervene in South Africa's case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, which accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. Israel denies it. 'We are concerned that a very narrow interpretation of what constitutes genocide leads to a culture of impunity in which the protection of civilians is minimized,' Ireland's deputy premier and foreign affairs minister, Micheal Martin, said in a statement. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar's statement on the embassy closure said that 'Ireland has crossed every red line in its relations with Israel.' Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris called the decision to close the embassy 'deeply regrettable.' He added on X: 'I utterly reject the assertion that Ireland is anti-Israel. Ireland is pro-peace, pro-human rights and pro-international law.' Israeli strikes in Gaza kill a journalist and children Israeli forces continued Sunday to pound largely isolated northern Gaza, as the Palestinian death toll in the war approached 45,000. One airstrike hit the Khalil Aweida school in the town of Beit Hanoun and killed at least 15 people, according to nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital where casualties were taken. The dead included two parents and their daughter and a father and his son, the hospital said. In Gaza City, at least 17 people including six women and five children were killed in three airstrikes that hit houses sheltering displaced people, according to Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital. 'We woke up to the strike. I woke up with the rubble on top of me,' said a bandaged Yahia al-Yazji, who grieved for his wife and daughter. 'I found my wife with her head and skull visible, and my daughter's intestines were gone. My wife was three months pregnant.' His hand rested on a body wrapped in a blanket on the floor. Israel's military in a statement said it struck a 'terrorist cell' in Gaza City and a 'terrorist meeting point' in the Beit Hanoun area. Another Israeli airstrike killed a Palestinian journalist working for Al Jazeera, Ahmed al-Lawh, in central Gaza, a hospital and the Qatari-based TV station said. The strike hit a point for Gaza's civil defense agency in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp, Al-Awda Hospital said. Also killed were three civil defense workers including the head of the agency in Nuseirat, according to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital. The civil defense is Gaza's main rescue agency and operates under the Hamas-run government. The war in Gaza began after Hamas and other militants from Gaza stormed southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking well over 200 hostage. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed almost 45,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry's count does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but it says over half of the dead have been women and children. Also Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he spoke with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump about developments in Syria and a recent push to secure the release of Israeli and foreign hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Netanyahu said he spoke with Trump on Saturday night about the issue. Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, warned last week during a visit to the region that it would 'not be a pretty day' if the hostages held in Gaza were not released before Trump's inauguration on January 20. A Trump spokesperson on Sunday declined to give further details about the call.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-will-close-its-ireland-embassy-over-gaza-tensions/7902215.html	2024-12-15T14:02:14-08:00	
2024 African elections: Some ruling parties retain power, some suffer defeats	Nairobi, Kenya — Voters were busy across the globe in 2024 and more than a dozen countries in Africa staged presidential, parliamentary or local elections. While some of Africa’s longtime dominant ruling parties retained power, in others, incumbents went down in surprising and crushing defeats. Southern Africa The small archipelago of Comoros — off Africa’s east coast — was the first to host presidential elections in 2024. Incumbent President Azali Assoumani, a former military officer who first came to power in a coup in 1999, won a fourth term. Election results were immediately rejected by the opposition, triggering violent protests that killed one and injured 25. In Mozambique, the Frelimo party won general elections again, extending its nearly 50 years in power. The official results were immediately rejected by opposition leader and runner-up Venancio Mondlane, triggering violent protests in the southern African country. Many analysts, including Maputo’s Center for Democracy and Human Rights’ Director Adriano Nuvunga, predicted a Frelimo win despite heavy youth support for Mondlane. 'The terrain is already prepared, regardless of what we see — the enthusiasm, dynamism of the young people that are rallying behind this opposition candidate,' Nuvunga told VOA. American University’s Kwaku Nuamah hopes President Daniel Chapo of Frelimo can extend an olive branch to the opposition to avoid a prolonged conflict in Mozambique. 'When you win, you have the responsibility to unite the country. Hopefully, he’s able to do that... We don’t need another African country going down in flames,' Nuamah told VOA. Similarly, Namibia’s ruling party SWAPO retained power after many decades of governance but made history by electing its first female president, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah. Her main challenger, however, called the elections flawed, after multiple examples of election day technical difficulties and ballot paper shortages were documented. Unlike Mozambique, Comoros, and Namibia, Botswana ushered in a new era by electing a leader from the opposition for the first time in nearly 60 years, following decades of rule by one party. 'Let’s carry those who came before us, those we have today and those who will come after us, to greater heights,' Duma Gideon Boko addressing supporters at his swearing-in ceremony. Elections were peaceful in neighboring South Africa, but the outcome predicted by some surprised many. The African National Congress, in power since 1994 — when Nelson Mandela was elected president following the end of apartheid — failed to win the elections with an outright majority, forcing it for the first time to form a coalition government. Simphiwe Malambo, an architect in South Africa. welcomed the change telling VOA 'The ANC is finally going to be in a position where they have to reconsider how they’ve been approaching running the country.' While ANC leaders asserted the country made progress under its stewardship, many voters expressed dissatisfaction with the government's failure to deliver reliable electricity and other services. Allegations of corruption and disunity within the party played a role in the ANC’s ability to win a majority. '[Former President] Jacob Zuma’s party Mkhonto We Sizwe or MK has been completely unexpected. It arrived on the scene quite late in the run up to the elections and completely scrambled everything,' Daryl Glaser, University of Witwatersrand in South Africa told VOA a few days before the vote took place. East Africa In Rwanda’s elections, President Paul Kagame, in power for 30 years, won almost 100% of the vote. Some analysts credit Kagame for bringing peace, unity, and economic development to Rwanda after the country’s 1994 genocide. 'Voters want a leader who provides solutions for them… The achievement is tangible. You can see it,' analyst Teddy Kaberuka tells VOA. But others like Strathmore University professor Edgar Githua question his popularity within the country. 'If you have a vote where 98% of a population vote for one candidate, that is a red flag. Nobody is that popular in this world,' he said. A 2022 Human Rights Watch report said the space for political opposition and free media remained closed in the east African country. West Africa In West Africa, where a wave of coups recently dominated the political landscape, two countries seen as beacons of democracy didn’t disappoint. In Ghana, after serving only one term about a decade ago, President John Mahama made a stunning comeback in 2024 and beat the country’s ruling party candidate and Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia. University of Ghana’s senior lecturer Kwame Asah-Asante told VOA that many voters in the country were thinking about the economy and their financial situations when they cast ballots because 'it’s a bread-and-butter issue. We’ve seen time and again that anytime you have a very difficult economy, campaigning becomes difficult for the government of the day,' he said. Ghana is the second largest cocoa producer in the world, but the country defaulted on most of its $30 billion external debt in 2022 after the effects of years of borrowing were made worse by the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mahama vows to cultivate a 24-hour business environment — enabling businesses and public institutions to operate 24/7, in three shifts of eight hours each — to bolster job creation and improve the economy. In Senegal, little-known opposition leader Bassirou Diomaye Faye, 44, became Africa’s youngest president. Faye promised to fight corruption, rebuild institutions, and unite the country. His election victory — just a few weeks after getting out of prison — followed a failed attempt by outgoing President Macky Sall to postpone the election process, plunging the country into a brief political crisis. 'It was very interesting, very educational scenario for those who are learning about democracy,' analyst Kaberuka told VOA about the Senegal vote. Sahel region While elections went on as planned in most African nations, they’ve been postponed in others including the ones plagued by coups in the Sahel, signaling military juntas’ intention to stay in power, analysts warn. Elections were officially postponed in Mali and Burkina Faso and Niger’s junta spoke of a three-year transition. According to the 2024 rankings on media freedom by Reporters Without Borders, already-high restrictions on access to information increased in the Sahel, where several countries suspended local retransmissions of foreign broadcast media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-elections-some-ruling-parties-retain-power-some-suffer-defeats/7902194.html	2024-12-15T13:00:35-08:00	
Tis the season for roasting chestnuts. But in US, native ones are almost gone	It's been a very long time since vendors sold the American chestnut on city sidewalks. It's no longer the variety whose smell some people associate with Christmastime as it wafts from street carts. Because it's virtually extinct. But memories of the American chestnut's legacy keep resurfacing for the researchers who want to bring it back. They describe its wood that paneled the homes and schoolrooms of their grandparents, or the photographs of men on the street corners of old Baltimore, with hot bags of nuts cooked on charcoal. 'You can feel that connection to a place, and that connection to utility, and the connection to the importance that this tree played in virtually every aspect of the lives of people,' said Sara Fern Fitzsimmons, chief conservation officer with The American Chestnut Foundation, which is working to restore the tree to flourish as it once did. Fitzsimmons said that will likely take a lot longer than many chestnut enthusiasts had hoped. Researchers have hit roadblocks with attempts to breed or genetically modify a version that can withstand the invasive blight that has hammered the species since the early 1900s. If and when they do find the right variety, they'll need to figure out how to plant it and help it thrive in forests that are under pressure from climate change, globalization and development. Once a hallmark of forests from Georgia to New England, American chestnuts now exist mostly as a vast network of root systems underground, sending up shoots. They grow for a time, but the fungal blight takes hold when the trees start maturing. East Asian varieties, like those that introduced the blight in the first place, are immune to the blight, and produce most of the edible chestnuts for fall and winter snacking. Still, American chestnut trees are better-suited for timber, they're culturally loved by people all over North America and they used to be an important species for the ecological health of forests, providing a reliable source of nutritious food and shelter for wildlife and humans alike. 'It was really a pretty significant species to lose,' said Amy Brunner, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who works on the tree's genetics. 'The more diversity you lose, the less resilient that forest ecosystem is.' The American Chestnut Foundation, among others, has been trying for decades to breed a hybrid that is mostly American in genetics but with the fungus-fighting traits of the Chinese type. Fitzsimmons said breeders have learned just how difficult that is — blight resistance involves several different genes, and it has proven hard to separate them from the traits that distinguish Chinese chestnuts. To speed the process, some scientists have been working on genetically modifying American chestnuts to see if they can boost their immunity that way instead. But progress was delayed by a recent mix-up involving two versions of a genetically modified American chestnut that scientists at State University of New York had hoped could get through the regulatory process as soon as this year. 'It kind of stinks that it happened because now it's taking a little bit longer than we had hoped,' said Linda McGuigan, a research support specialist at the university. But scientists there and elsewhere are continuing to pursue many avenues. 'I don't think you will get there, to all you desire, without both,' Brunner said, referring to the two main methods of breeding and genetic modification. Breeding is vital for achieving enough genetic diversity for trees to adapt to a changing world, she said, but added that she thinks some genetic manipulation will be needed to get to enough blight resistance for American chestnuts to stand a chance. Meanwhile, other scientists are working on projects to tackle another big challenge ahead for chestnuts: where to plant them. If a successful tree is cobbled together with genes taken from trees from Tennessee to New York, where would it have the best chance at surviving, given how a warming planet is changing habitat around the world? A team at Virginia Tech published a paper this summer to try to answer that question. They looked at 32 climate variables and compared them to projected future climates, then calculated the shortest distance that regionally specific American chestnuts would have to move to offset warming. The idea was to one day help them survive a new climate while keeping them as close as possible to where they once thrived. 'I don't think it's hyperbolic to say it's revolutionary' for teams at The American Chestnut Foundation, said Fitzsimmons, who contributed data to the project. She said the project will help them better figure out where to collect genes from the immature trees that remain across the country. Tom Kimmerer, a forest scientist who taught at the University of Kentucky, is working on a book about trees including the American chestnut. Kimmerer, who was not involved in the research, called it 'robust and well supported' and 'critically important to the success of the chestnut.' Stacy Clark, a research forester at the U.S. Forest Service, said the findings are useful, but added that they need to be backed up with real-world experiments. 'I think with advancements in genetics, they can probably get pretty fast data off of those field trials. But still, all of that takes time and effort, right?' For now, forest scientists know their work might not pay off in their lifetimes. It's a lesson that became clear for the community when pioneering chestnut restoration experts Bill Powell and Chuck Maynard both died in the past 13 months. McGuigan supported both of their research for years as lab manager at SUNY's college of environmental science and forestry. 'The project moves on, lives on. And we honor their memory,' McGuigan said. 'I want to do something good for the future, for my children.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tis-the-season-for-roasting-chestnuts-but-in-us-native-ones-are-almost-gone/7902197.html	2024-12-15T12:52:12-08:00	
Kraven the Hunter' flops while 'Moana 2' tops the box office again	The Spider-Man spinoff 'Kraven the Hunter' got off to a disastrous start in North American theaters this weekend. The movie starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson earned only $11 million, according to studio estimates Sunday, making it one of the worst openings for a Marvel-adjacent property. Its box office take was even less than the film 'Madame Web.' The weekend's other major studio release was Warner Bros.' animated 'The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,' which made $4.6 million. Made for about $30 million, the movie is set 183 years before the events of 'The Lord of the Rings' films and was fast-tracked to ensure New Line did not lose the rights to Tolkien's novels. Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have been working on future live-action films for the franchise. Meanwhile, the top of the charts again belonged to 'Moana 2' and 'Wicked.' 'Moana' added $26.6 million to its domestic total in its third weekend and $57.2 million internationally, bringing its global tally to $717 million. It's now the fourth highest grossing film of the year, surpassing 'Dune: Part Two.' 'Wicked,' which is in its fourth weekend, brought in another $22.5 million to take second place. The Universal musical has made over $359 million domestically and over $500 million worldwide. 'Gladiator II' also made $7.8 million, bringing its domestic total to $145.9 million in four weeks. 'Kraven the Hunter' is the latest misfire from Sony in its attempt to mine the Spider-Man universe for spin-off franchises without the lucrative web slinger himself. 'Kraven' joins 'Madame Web' and 'Morbius' in franchise additions that fell flat with both audiences and critics. The one exception on this rollercoaster journey has been the 'Venom' trilogy, which has made over $1.8 billion worldwide. The R-rated 'Kraven the Hunter' was directed by J.C. Chandor and faced a number of delays, partly due to the Hollywood strikes. It was shot nearly three years ago and originally slated to hit theaters in January 2023. The film cost a reported $110 million to produce and was co-financed by TSG. Internationally, it made $15 million, but its potential for longevity appears limited: It currently carries a 15% 'fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes and got a C grade on CinemaScore from opening weekend audiences. 'It's not always a guarantee that you'll be able to connect with audiences when you have a spinoff character,' said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. 'General audiences seem to want to know exactly what they're getting.' Several awards contenders opened in limited release over the weekend, including Paramount's 'September 5' about ABC's coverage of the Munich Olympics hostage crisis. Amazon MGM and Orion's 'Nickel Boys,' based on Colson Whitehead's Pulitzer-winner about an abusive reform school in Florida, opened in two theaters in New York. It averaged $30,422 per screen and will be expanding to Los Angeles before going nationwide in the coming weeks. Some big hitters are on the way in the home stretch of the 2024 box office. 'Mufasa' and 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' will hit in the coming weeks along with a bevy of arthouse and adult releases like 'Babygirl,' 'Nosferatu' and 'A Complete Unknown.' The box office has seen a dramatic recovery since June, when it was down nearly 28% from the previous year. The deficit now stands at 4.8%. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. 'Moana 2,' $26.6 million. 2. 'Wicked,' $22.5 million. 3. 'Kraven the Hunter,' $11 million. 4. 'Gladiator II,' $7.8 million. 5. 'Red One,' $4.6 million. 6. 'Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,' $4.5 million. 7. 'Interstellar' (rerelease), $3.3 million. 8. 'Pushpa: The Rule — Part 2,' $1.6 million. 9. 'The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,' $1.4 million. 10. 'Queer,' $790,954.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kraven-the-hunter-flops-while-moana-2-tops-the-box-office-again/7902189.html	2024-12-15T12:37:10-08:00	
In Africa, 2024 saw long-time dominant parties retain power in some countries, suffering crushing defeats in others	Voters were busy across the globe in 2024 and more than a dozen countries in Africa were among those holding presidential, parliamentary or local elections.

Israeli airstrikes target Syrian military depots	Israel launched dozens more airstrikes into neighboring Syria over the weekend, claiming ongoing threats to its security. Syria’s new leadership calls those threats a false pretext, adding it has no desire for a new conflict.

Incoming national security adviser calls for explanation of US drone sightings	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming national security adviser says it’s time to figure out where dozens of unexplained drones flying over eastern U.S. states are coming from and whether any ill intent is involved. Republican Representative Michael Waltz, from Florida and set to join Trump’s White House team when the president-elect takes office January 20, told CBS’s 'Face the Nation' on Sunday, 'We need to get to the bottom of it.' For weeks now, residents in the state of New Jersey, which borders New York City, and other states to the north and south along the Atlantic Ocean coastline have reported seeing more than 5,000 supposed drones, a figure U.S. officials have concluded is wildly inflated. All manner of conspiracy theories has been offered for the unexplained sightings, including U.S. government spying and the deployment of Iran-launched drones from a mothership off U.S. eastern coastal waters. Waltz called them 'long-loitering, could-be dangerous' drones. He credited the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden for trying to allay fears and resolve any mystery about the drones but offered no explanation himself. 'We need more transparency,' Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, told the CBS show. 'This can’t be the future.' On Saturday, officials from the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation stressed that most of the recent purported drone sightings in New Jersey — the state with the most reports — and elsewhere have been manned aircraft and posed no national security threat. An FBI official told reporters that the agency was working with 50 local, state and federal partners and had determined that fewer than 100 of the more than 5,000 reported sightings had turned out to merit further investigation. 'The combination of efforts so far ... to include technical equipment, tip line information and noted consults has ... not found any evidence to support large-scale [unmanned aerial system] activities,' the official said, adding that many of the sightings occurred along regular flight paths. The official said more investigations are under way to look at the remaining cases, including analysis of radar and intelligence. 'We can't ignore the sightings that have been there,' the official said. 'We're doing our best to find the origin of those drone activities, but I think there has been a slight over-reaction' in the number of claimed drone sightings. U.S. officials say they have confirmed drone sightings over military bases in New Jersey, including Picatinny Arsenal, but found no evidence that a foreign government had launched the drones. National security officials, however, have not been able to figure out who has been operating the unexplained drones. State and local officials in eastern seaboard states have expressed concern. Larry Hogan, a former Maryland governor, posted on social media Friday that he had seen 'what appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky' above his residence in the state. 'The public is growing increasingly concerned and frustrated with the complete lack of transparency and the dismissive attitude of the federal government.' President-elect Trump suggested Saturday that the Biden administration was withholding information about the drone sightings and that the devices should be shot down. Republican Representative Christopher Smith of New Jersey said Friday in a statement that the White House’s attitude toward the sightings had been 'dismissive.' U.S. officials said Saturday the administration had sent New Jersey officials radar technology with an 'electro-optical infrared camera system' to track the devices. Last week, White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby said an investigation of the drone sightings had not turned up any illegal activity. 'To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully,' Kirby said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/incoming-national-security-adviser-calls-for-explanation-of-us-drone-sightings/7902167.html	2024-12-15T11:54:55-08:00	
Bolivia holds divisive popular vote for its top judges	La Paz, Bolivia — Campaigning for Sunday's judicial election may be strictly forbidden, but look closer on the streets of Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, and you’ll find that some candidates have sneakily plastered their faces on packs of corn puffs and others have slipped subtle slogans into official voting manuals. After all, it’s a popular vote, and even a bit of PR can work wonders when voters know nothing about the dozens of names on their sprawling ballot papers. Bolivia is the only country in the world that holds elections for top judicial posts. Soon Mexico will, too, after former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pushed through a highly contentious overhaul of the justice system in the face of mass protests. As Bolivia's ex-President Evo Morales did when remaking the judiciary in 2009, Lopez Obrador has championed the overhaul to purge the corrupt elite and boost democracy. But apathetic Bolivian voters say the elections have had the opposite effect, turning their courts from neutral arbiters into political prizes. 'I’ll flip a coin,' said 25-year-old architecture student Marisol Nogales when asked how she would vote Sunday. It’s never easy to find supporters of Bolivia’s system of electing judges, which, over a decade ago, replaced a nomination system rooted in qualifications and training. Across the world, academics, investors and judges have warned that judicial elections can cement the dominance of the ruling party and reduce checks and balances. And across Latin America, from El Salvador to Honduras, experts have characterized politicized judiciaries as profound threats to democracy. In Bolivia, even senior judicial officials struggle to sound positive when asked to defend the election. 'It should be a calm, easy and simple process, but it has become very litigious, very controversial,' Francisco Vargas, the vice president of Bolivia’s electoral tribunal, told The Associated Press from the court in central La Paz. This year in Bolivia, experts find it even harder than usual to praise the system. With the posts up for grabs every six years, Sunday’s vote was supposed to take place in late 2023. But as the deadline approached last year, the Constitutional Court — packed with allies of President Luis Arce — suddenly intervened to push the vote back a year, escalating his power struggle with his former mentor and current rival, Morales, over who will lead their long-dominant leftist party into Bolivia’s 2025 presidential election. Both understand that whoever wins over the Constitutional Court ensures their own political survival. Arce cited the paralysis of their divided party in justifying the vote's delay. Morales' loyalists, who hold a majority in Congress and would have determined the shortlist of judicial candidates, accused Arce of illegally extending the mandates of friendly judges for fear of losing influence over the courts. 'What happened was disorder, the kind that can lead us to a greater conflict,' said Ivan Lima, the former Minister of Justice. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights criticized the postponement of elections, raising alarm about its 'potential to undermine the effective functioning of the Bolivian justice system.' Now, after many attempts to derail and further delay the vote, it is finally moving ahead Sunday. But there’s a wrinkle: It's a partial election. Only four out of nine seats on the powerful Constitutional Court are up for grabs. The other five — the majority of sitting judges, as it happens — will stay in their posts. 'The judges have turned the Constitutional Court into a sort of superpower,' said Bolivian political analyst Paul Coca. Sunday marks the third time that Bolivia has held judicial elections. If the past two rounds under then-President Morales, in 2011 and 2017, are any indication, turnout will be low. Both times, most Bolivians, outraged or simply baffled by the notion of endorsing unknown judges pre-selected by Morales’ allies with little transparency, voted null or blank. Critics questioned the legitimacy of the elected judges. But they nonetheless shaped the evolution of Bolivian democracy. In 2016, Morales asked Bolivians in a legally binding referendum to decide whether to let him run for a fourth term, in defiance of a two-term limit established in the 2009 Constitution he had backed. When he didn’t get the answer he wanted — a slim majority voted 'no' — his party found a workaround through the pliant Constitutional Court, where judges ruled that to deny Morales another term as president would be to violate his human rights. 'This was his major mistake,' said Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a former chief justice of the Supreme Court. It was Morales’ decision to run again in 2019 that brought a precipitous end to his remarkable 14-year tenure and ushered in a surreal parade of crises. As allegations of electoral fraud sent angry crowds into the streets, Morales resigned under pressure from the military and went into exile. Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, bracing for fallout from the overhaul she inherited, is keen to see how Bolivia’s vote plays out. The National Electoral Institute, the Mexican voting authority, sent a delegation to observe the process in La Paz this weekend, Vargas said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bolivia-holds-divisive-popular-vote-for-its-top-judges/7902157.html	2024-12-15T11:28:30-08:00	
Pope Francis makes 1st papal visit to France's Corsica	AJACCIO, Corsica — Pope Francis on the first papal visit ever to the French island of Corsica on Sunday called for a dynamic form of laicism, promoting the kind of popular piety that distinguishes the Mediterranean island from secular France as a bridge between religious and civic society. Francis appeared relaxed and energized during the one-day visit, just two days before his 88th birthday, still displaying a faded bruise from a fall a week ago. He frequently deviated from his prepared homily during Mass at the outdoor La Place d’Austerlitz, remarking at one point that he had never seen so many children as in Corsica — except, he added, in East Timor on his recent Asian tour. 'Make children,' he implored. 'They will be your joy and your consolation in the future.' Earlier, at the close of a Mediterranean conference on popular piety, Papa Francescu, as he is called in Corsican, described a concept of secularity 'that is not static and fixed, but evolving and dynamic,' that can adapt to 'unforeseen situations' and promote cooperation 'between civil and ecclesial authorities.' The pontiff said that expressions of popular piety, including processions and communal prayer of the Holy Rosary 'can nurture constructive citizenship' on the part of Christians. At the same time, he warned against such manifestations being seen only in terms of folklore, or even superstition. The visit to Corsica’s capital Ajaccio, the birthplace of Napoleon, is one of the briefest of his papacy beyond Italy’s borders, just about nine hours on the ground, including a 40-minute visit with French President Emmanuel Macron. Francis was joined on the dais by the bishop of Ajaccio, Cardinal Francois-Xavier Bustillo, who organized the conference that brought together some 400 participants from Spain, Sicily, Sardinia and southern France. The two-day meeting examined expressions of faith that often occur outside formal liturgies, such as processions and pilgrimages. Often specific to the places where they are practiced, popular piety in Corsica includes the cult of the Virgin Mary, known locally as the 'Madunnuccia,' which protected the island from the plague in 1656 when it was still under Genoa control. Corsica stands out from the rest of secularized France as a particularly devout region, with 92 confraternities, or lay associations dedicated to works of charity or piety, with over 4,000 members. 'It means that there is a beautiful, mature, adult and responsible collaboration between civil authorities, mayors, deputies, senators, officials and religious authorities,' Bustillo told The Associated Press ahead of the visit. 'There is no hostility between the two. And that is a very positive aspect because in Corsica there is no ideological hostility.' The visit was awash in signs of popular piety. The pope was greeted by children in traditional garb and was continually serenaded by bands, choruses and singing troupes that are central to Corsican culture from the airport to the motorcade route, convention center and cathedral. Thousands stood along the roadside to greet the pontiff and more waved from windows. Renè Colombani traveled with 2,000 others by ship from northern Corsica to Ajaccio, on the western coast, to see the pope. 'It is an event that we will not see again in several years. It may be the only time that the pope will come to Corsica. And since we wanted to be a part of it, we have come a long way,' Colombani said. The island, which Genoa ceded to France in 1768, is located closer to the Italian mainland than France. From the conference, the pope traveled to the 17th-century cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta to meet with clergy, stopping along the way at the statue of the Madunnuccia where he lit a devotional candle. The pope celebrated Mass beneath a looming statue of Napoleon Bonaparte, the French emperor whose armies in 1808 annexed the papal states and imprisoned two of Francis’ predecessors — Popes Pius VI and VII — before being excommunicated and eventually defeated on the battlefield. Thousands packed the esplanade where Napoleon is said to have played as a child. Francis will meet privately with Macron at the airport before departing for the 50-minute flight back to Rome. They are expected to talk about the world’s crises, including wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, and environment and climate-related issues, Macron's office said. The pontiff pointedly did not make the trip to Paris earlier this month for the pomp surrounding the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral following the devastating 2019 fire. The visit to Corsica seems far more suited to Francis’ priorities than a grand cathedral reopening, emphasizing the 'church of the peripheries.' It is Francis’ third trip to France, each time avoiding Paris and the protocols that a state visit entails. He visited the port of Marseille in 2023, on an overnight visit to participate in an annual summit of Mediterranean bishops and went to Strasbourg in 2014 to address the European Parliament and Council of Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-makes-1st-papal-visit-to-france-s-corsica-/7902100.html	2024-12-15T09:40:38-08:00	
Ukrainian drones strike Russia as Kyiv reels from consecutive massive air attacks	KYIV — Ukrainian drone strikes on southern Russia killed a 9-year-old boy and set fire to a major oil terminal, officials said Saturday, the day after Moscow launched a massive aerial attack on its neighbor that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said was one of the heaviest bombardments of the country’s energy sector in the nearly three-year war. The boy died when a drone struck his family’s home outside Belgorod, a Russian city near the border with Ukraine, local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported on Saturday morning on the Telegram messaging app. His mother and 7-month-old sister were hospitalized with injuries, Gladkov said. He posted photos of what he said was the aftermath of the attack, showing a low-rise house with gaping holes in its roof and front wall flanked by mounds of rubble. Elsewhere in southern Russia, Ukrainian drones overnight hit a major oil terminal in the Oryol region, sparking a blaze, Ukraine’s General Staff reported. Photos published by the General Staff and on Russian Telegram news channels showed huge plumes of smoke engulfing the facility, backlit by an orange glow. Oryol Gov. Andrey Klychkov confirmed that a Ukrainian drone strike set fire to a fuel depot. He said later the blaze had been contained and that there were no casualties. Russia’s Defense Ministry on Saturday claimed its forces shot down 37 Ukrainian drones over the country’s south and west the previous night. Russia pummels Ukrainian energy targets The Ukrainian strikes came a day after Russia fired 93 cruise and ballistic missiles and almost 200 drones at its neighbor, further battering Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, around half of which has been destroyed during the war. Rolling electricity blackouts are common and widespread, and Zelenskyy charged Friday that Moscow is 'terrorizing millions of people' with such assaults. According to Ukraine’s air force, Russia kept up its drone attacks on Saturday, launching 132 across Ukrainian territory. Fifty-eight drones were shot down and a further 72 veered off course, likely due to electronic jamming, it said. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces used long-range precision missiles and drones on 'critically important fuel and energy facilities in Ukraine that ensure the functioning of the military industrial complex.' The strike was in retaliation for Wednesday’s Ukrainian attack using U.S.-supplied the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, on a Russian air base, it said. Kyiv’s Western allies have provided Ukraine with air defense systems to help it protect critical infrastructure, but Russia has sought to overwhelm the air defenses with combined strikes involving large numbers of missiles and drones called 'swarms.' Russia has held the initiative this year as its military has steadily rammed through Ukrainian defenses in the east in a series of slow but steady offensives. But uncertainty surrounds how the war might unfold next year. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has vowed to end the war and has thrown into doubt whether vital U.S. military support for Kyiv will continue. North Koreans reportedly in combat in Kursk Zelenskyy said Saturday that a 'significant number' of North Korean troops were being deployed by Moscow in assaults in Russia’s southern Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops have held on following a stunning cross-border incursion this summer. In a televised address, Zelenskyy said that North Korean soldiers have so far not entered the fight on Ukrainian soil, but claimed they are already taking 'noticeable' losses. Elsewhere, Ukrainian officials reported that Russian shelling on Friday and overnight killed at least two civilians and wounded 14 others in front-line areas Ukraine’s south and northeast.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-drones-strike-russia-as-kyiv-reels-from-consecutive-massive-air-attacks/7902088.html	2024-12-15T09:19:46-08:00	
Brazilian President Lula discharged from hospital after brain surgery	SAO PAULO — Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was discharged from the hospital Sunday after undergoing surgery to stop a brain bleed. The 79-year-old president spoke alongside doctors in a news conference Sunday morning in a show that he was doing well following the head surgery. 'I’m here alive, well, with the urge to work. And I’ll tell you something I used to say during the campaign. I’m 79 years old; I have the energy of 30 and the enthusiasm of 20 to build this country,' Lula said. Lula's medical team said the surgery went well and that Lula would be able to walk and hold meetings as he rests in his home in the city of Sao Paulo until Thursday. The leader's doctors said international travel would be out of the question until further notice, but that he'd be able to travel to the country's capital, Brasilia, if all goes well in a medical exam. The president also offered his first comments about Saturday's arrest of Gen. Walter Braga Netto, a former member of President Jair Bolsonaro’s government and his 2022 running mate, in connection with investigations into an alleged coup plot. Lula has largely avoided commenting on the case because of ongoing investigations. 'It is not possible for us to accept disrespect for democracy, disrespect for the constitution. And it is not possible for us to accept that in a generous country like Brazil we have people of high military rank plotting the death of a president, his vice president and a presiding judge of the supreme electoral court,' said Lula. Braga Netto was indicted in November, along with Bolsonaro and 35 others, on charges of plotting a coup to keep Bolsonaro in office after his failed 2022 reelection bid. Prosecutors have not yet filed formal charges against Braga Netto. His arrest was related to allegations of obstructing the collection of evidence, the Federal Police said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazilian-president-lula-discharged-from-hospital-after-brain-surgery/7902083.html	2024-12-15T08:54:35-08:00

Mystery drone sightings keep happening in New Jersey - What we know... and don't know	A large number of mysterious drones have been reported flying over parts of New Jersey and the East Coast in recent weeks, sparking speculation and concern over who sent them and why. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X. Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft. The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones. What's the deal with the drones in New Jersey? Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing them in the state starting in November. At first they were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, which feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state's largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City. But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster. The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas. Republican U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend. Federal officials offer assurances that drones don't pose a threat The growing anxiety among some residents is not lost on the Biden administration, which has faced criticism from Trump for not dealing with the matter more aggressively. In a call with reporters Saturday that was organized by the White House, senior officials from the FBI, Pentagon, FAA and other agencies sought to assure people that the drones are not a national security or public safety threat or the handywork of a malicious foreign actor. An FBI official, who spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said the public concern is understandable but added, 'I think there has been a slight overreaction.' Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remained unchanged. New Jersey congressman wants the military to take action A New Jersey congressman has urged the Pentagon to authorize the use of force to bring down one or more drones to try to figure out who deployed them. The objects could be downed over the ocean or in an unpopulated area on land, Smith said Saturday at a news conference. 'Why can't we bag at least one of these drones and get to the bottom of it?' Smith said. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, another Republican Jersey Shore-area congressman, has also called for the military to shoot down the drones. Monmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden said people should not take it into their own hands to shoot down drones, which would break state and federal laws. Drones have been spotted over New York City Drone sightings have now been reported in New York, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams said the city was investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials. The runways at Stewart International Airport — about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of the city — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, Gov. Kathy Hochul said. 'This has gone too far,' she said in a statement. The governor called on Congress to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more investigative authority to state and local law enforcement. 'Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,' she said. 'Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.' Are these drones dangerous? The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose 'a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.' Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists, and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio. Who sent the drones? Authorities say they do not know. The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort. Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents. Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those concerns, but Rep. Smith on Saturday echoed such speculation. 'The elusive maneuvering of these drones suggests a major military power sophistication that begs the question whether they have been deployed to test our defense capabilities — or worse — by violent dictatorships, perhaps maybe Russia, or China, or Iran, or North Korea,' he said. Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones. What have officials said about the sightings? Trump has said he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. 'Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!' he posted on his social media site. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Thursday that the drones should be 'shot down, if necessary.' 'We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,' Blumenthal said. Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky. Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn't believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. 'How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?' she said. 'I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.' Are drones allowed in New Jersey? The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in the state, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft. Operators must be FAA-certified. Have drones been spotted anywhere else? Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere. Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen. The object was over the ocean, and they watched as it slowly moved over an Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot. 'It was definitely different,' said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck. 'It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,' he added. The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. 'Cotton' Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation. Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said Friday by email. Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line. In Massachusetts, 10 to 15 drones were reported hovering over a home Thursday night in Harwich on Cape Cod. A resident told police they were bright and she observed them for more than an hour. Earlier that evening, an off-duty police officer in the same town noticed similar activity near a public safety complex, police said. The information was forwarded to the FBI and Massachusetts State Police. Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mystery-drone-sightings-keep-happening-in-new-jersey---what-we-know-and-don-t-know/7902064.html	2024-12-15T08:37:38-08:00	
UN envoy calls for sanctions relief to help rebuild Syria	DAMASCUS, Syria — A U.N. envoy called Sunday for a quick end to Western sanctions against Syria as the country’s new leaders and regional and global powers begin to chart a path forward following the fall of President Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian government has been under strict sanctions by the United States, the European Union and others for years as a result of Assad’s brutal response to what began as peaceful anti-government protests in 2011 and later spiraled into a civil war. The rebel alliance that ousted Assad and broke his iron grip on the country just days ago faces a nation wracked and deeply isolated by tough international sanctions, which compounded Syria’s previous economic troubles. But other challenges also complicate Syria's rebuilding: the new transitional leadership has not laid out a clear vision how the country will be governed, and the main group behind the offensive is saddled with a terrorist designation by the U.S. The U.N. envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, told reporters in Damascus that setting Syria back on track after the past few tumultuous weeks will be helped by a speedy relief of sanctions. 'We can hopefully see a quick end to the sanctions so that we can see really a rallying around [re]building of Syria,' he said. Parts of Syria’s biggest cities remain damaged or destroyed by years of fighting. Reconstruction has been stymied largely by sanctions that aimed to prevent rebuilding damaged infrastructure and property in government-held areas in the absence of a political solution. Pedersen traveled to Damascus to meet with officials from the new interim government set up by the former opposition forces who toppled Assad, led by the Islamic militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Officials in Washington have indicated that the Biden administration is considering removing the group's terror designation. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday that officials have been in direct contact with the group. Over the weekend, Blinken attended an emergency meeting in Jordan where he said he secured the backing of the 12 foreign ministers from the Arab League, Turkey and top officials from the European Union and United Nations on how Syria should be run after decades of Assad family rule. They agreed that the new government should respect the rights of minorities and women, prevent terror groups from taking hold, ensure humanitarian aid reaches those in need, and secure and destroy any remaining Assad-era chemical weapons. Blinken has promised that the United States would recognize and support a new government that met those principles. With the clock on the Biden administration running out, it isn’t clear what approach President-elect Donald Trump will take on Syria. Syria's interim government is set to rule until March, but it has not yet made clear the process under which a new permanent administration would replace it. 'We need to get the political process underway that is inclusive of all Syrians,' Pedersen said. 'That process obviously needs to be led by the Syrians themselves.' He called for 'justice and accountability for crimes' committed during the war and for the international community to step up humanitarian aid. In a sign of Syrians’ yearning for a return to normalcy, even after the whirlwind rebel offensive of the past weeks, schools in Damascus reopened Sunday for the first time since the insurgents marched in the capital. At Nahla Zaidan school in the capital’s Mezzah neighborhood, teachers hoisted the three-starred revolutionary flag in place of the former government’s two-starred Syrian flag. 'Syria is trying to build up this country with these children who came. Although I think some of them are afraid, they came to build Syria and to live the victories of this country,' said Maysoun Al-Ali, director of the school. 'God willing, there will be more development, more security and more construction in this beloved country.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-envoy-calls-for-sanctions-relief-to-help-rebuild-syria/7902062.html	2024-12-15T08:32:21-08:00	
11 dead in French territory of Mayotte from Cyclone Chido	CAPE TOWN, South Africa — At least 11 people have died after Cyclone Chido caused devastating damage in the French territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, France's Interior Ministry said Sunday. The intense tropical cyclone has now made landfall on the east coast of Africa, where aid agencies are warning of more loss of life and severe damage in northern Mozambique. The ministry said it was proving difficult to get a precise tally of the dead and injured in Mayotte amid fears the death toll will increase. A local hospital reported that nine people were in critical condition there and 246 others were injured. The tropical cyclone blew through the southeastern Indian Ocean, also affecting the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. Mayotte was directly in its path and suffered extensive damage Saturday, officials said. The local prefect said it was the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte in 90 years. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said Saturday night after an emergency meeting in Paris that there were fears that the death toll in Mayotte 'will be high' and the island had been largely devastated. Prime Minister François Bayrou, who took office Friday, said public infrastructure on Mayotte had been severely damaged or destroyed, including the main hospital and the airport. He said many people living in precarious shacks in slum areas have faced very serious risks. Chido brought winds more than 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, making it a category 4 cyclone, the second strongest on the scale. Mayotte has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands about 800 kilometers (500 miles) off Africa’s east coast. It is France's poorest island and the European Union's poorest territory. In some parts, entire neighborhoods were flattened, while residents reported many trees had been uprooted and boats had been flipped or sunk. The French Interior Ministry said 1,600 police and gendarmerie officers have been deployed to 'help the population and prevent potential looting.' More than 100 rescuers and firefighters have been deployed in Mayotte from France and the nearby territory of Reunion, and an additional reinforcement of 140 people was due to be sent Sunday. Supplies were being rushed in on military aircraft and ships. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was closely monitoring the situation, while Pope Francis offered prayers for the victims of the cyclone while on a visit Sunday to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica. Chido continued its eastern trajectory and made landfall early Sunday in Mozambique on the African mainland, where emergency officials had warned that 2.5 million people could be impacted in two northern provinces, Cabo Delgado and Nampula. Landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe are also preparing to be affected, with both countries warning they might have to evacuate people from low-lying areas because of flooding. In Mozambique, the United Nations Children's Fund said Cabo Delgado province, home to around 2 million people, had been hit hard. 'Many homes, schools and health facilities have been partially or completely destroyed, and we are working closely with [the] government to ensure continuity of essential basic services,' UNICEF said. 'While we are doing everything we can, additional support is urgently needed.' UNICEF Mozambique spokesperson Guy Taylor said in a video posted by the group from Cabo Delgado's regional capital that alongside the immediate impact of the cyclone, communities now face the prospect of being cut off from schools and health facilities for weeks. December through to March is cyclone season in the southeastern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries last year. Cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne disease cholera as well as dengue fever and malaria. Studies say cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in southern Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to global warming, having to deal with large humanitarian crises, underlining their call for more help from rich nations to deal with the impact of climate change.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-french-territory-of-mayotte-from-cyclone-chido-/7902003.html	2024-12-15T07:31:50-08:00	
Rescue underway for damaged Russian oil tankers in Kerch Strait	MOSCOW — A Russian oil tanker carrying thousands of tons of oil products split apart during a heavy storm Sunday, spilling oil into the Kerch Strait, while another tanker was also in distress after sustaining damage, Russian officials said. An emergency rescue operation is now underway, Russian officials told state news outlets Sunday. The Volgoneft-212 tanker, which was carrying a crew of 13 and a cargo of fuel oil, ran aground and had its bow torn away, said Russian state news agency TASS, citing the country’s Emergency Situations Ministry. The damage was caused by severe weather conditions, officials said. A second tanker, the Volgoneft-239, was also damaged in the storm and left drifting in the same area with 14 crewmembers on board, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. The 132-meter, Russian-flagged ship was built in 1973. Russian investigators opened two criminal cases to investigate possible safety violations after at least one person was killed when the 136-meter Volgoneft-212 tanker, split in half with its bow sinking, footage published by state media showed, with waves washing over its deck. The Russian-flagged vessel was built in 1969. 'There was a spill of petroleum products,' said Russia's water transport agency, Rosmorrechflot. Both tankers have a loading capacity of about 4,200 tons of oil products. Official statements did not provide details on the extent of the spill or why one of the tankers sustained such serious damage. President Vladimir Putin ordered the government to set up a working group to deal with the rescue operation and mitigate the impact of the fuel spill, news agencies cited Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying, after Putin met with the ministers for emergencies and environment. Russia said more than 50 people and equipment, including Mi-8 helicopters and rescue tugboats, had been deployed to the area. Svetlana Radionova, head of Russia's natural resources watchdog Rosprirodnadzor, said specialists were assessing the damage at the site of the incident. Russia's Kommersant newspaper reported that the Volgoneft-212 tanker was carrying about 4,300 tons of fuel oil. Unverified video posted on Telegram showed some blackened water on stormy seas and a half-submerged tanker. The vessels were in the Kerch Strait between mainland Russia and Crimea when they issued distress signals. The Kerch Strait separates the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula from Russia and is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to illegally seize control of the area. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rescue-underway-for-damaged-russian-oil-tankers-in-kerch-strait-/7901948.html	2024-12-15T06:08:21-08:00	
Fiji says 7 foreigners hospitalized after drinking cocktails	Suva, Fiji — Seven foreigners including four Australians and an American have been hospitalized after drinking cocktails at a five-star Fiji hotel resort, health officials said Sunday. The hotel guests were taken to hospital on Saturday night suffering 'nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms,' Fiji's health ministry said in a statement. They fell ill after drinking a cocktail prepared at a bar in the luxury Warwick Fiji resort on the Coral Coast, about 60 kilometers west of the capital Suva, it said. A ministry spokesperson said the guests, aged from 18 to 56, included four Australians, one American and two foreigners who live in Fiji, whose nationalities were not given. All seven were initially taken to the nearby Sigatoka hospital. Due to the severity of their conditions, they were later transferred to the larger Lautoka Hospital on the island's west coast, the ministry spokesperson said. Fiji police are investigating the incident. Australia's foreign ministry said it was providing consular assistance to two families but declined further comment citing 'privacy obligations.' Australian public broadcaster ABC said it understood a 56-year-old Australian woman was under constant surveillance in hospital and a 19-year-old female compatriot was suffering 'serious medical episodes.' Two other Australian women aged 49 and 18 were in a critical but less serious condition, the ABC said. Fiji's health ministry did not specify the cause of the illness but warned people to ensure drinks and food consumed during the holiday period were safe. In a separate incident in Laos last month, two Danish citizens, an American, a Briton and two Australians died of suspected methanol poisoning following what local media said was a night out in the town of Vang Vieng.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fiji-says-7-foreigners-hospitalized-after-drinking-cocktails-/7901944.html	2024-12-15T05:48:40-08:00	
Israel sees increased threat from Syria despite moderate tone of rebel leaders	JERUSALEM — The threats to Israel from Syria remain despite the moderate tone of rebel leaders who ousted President Bashar al-Assad a week ago, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Sunday, amid military moves by his country to counter such threats. 'The immediate risks to the country have not disappeared and the latest developments in Syria increase the strength of the threat — despite the moderate image that the rebel leaders claim to present,' Katz told officials examining the country's defense budget, according to a statement. Syria's de facto leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, said on Saturday that Israel was using false pretexts to justify its attacks on Syria, but that he was not interested in engaging in new conflicts as the country focuses on rebuilding. Sharaa — better known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani — leads the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that swept Assad from power last Sunday, ending the family's five-decade iron-fisted rule. Since then Israel has moved into a demilitarized zone inside Syria that was created after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, including the Syrian side of the strategic Mount Hermon that overlooks Damascus, where its forces took over an abandoned Syrian military post. Israel, which has said that it does not intend to stay there and calls the incursion into Syrian territory a limited and temporary measure to ensure border security, has also carried out hundreds of strikes on Syria's strategic weapons stockpiles. It has said it is destroying strategic weapons and military infrastructure to prevent them from being used by rebel groups that drove Assad from power, some of which grew from movements linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. Several Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan, have condemned what they called Israel's seizure of a buffer zone in the Golan Heights. 'Syria's war-weary condition, after years of conflict and war, does not allow for new confrontations. The priority at this stage is reconstruction and stability, not being drawn into disputes that could lead to further destruction,' Sharaa said in an interview published on the website of Syria TV, a channel that sides with the rebels. He also said diplomatic solutions were the only way to ensure security and stability and that 'uncalculated military adventures' were not wanted.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-sees-increased-threat-from-syria-despite-moderate-tone-of-rebel-leaders-/7901929.html	2024-12-15T05:27:58-08:00	
Syrian authorities reopen schools, a week after upheaval that overthrew Assad	Damascus — Students returned to classrooms in Syria on Sunday after the country's new rulers ordered schools reopened in a potent sign of some normalcy a week after rebels swept into the capital in the dramatic overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad. The country's new de facto leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, faces a massive challenge to rebuild Syria after 13 years of civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people. Cities were bombed to ruins, the economy was gutted by international sanctions and millions of refugees still live in camps outside Syria. Officials said most schools were opening around the country on Sunday, which is the first day of the working week in most Arab countries. However, some parents were not sending their children to class due to uncertainty over the situation. Pupils waited cheerfully in the courtyard of a boys' high school in Damascus on Sunday morning and applauded as the school secretary, Raed Nasser, hung the flag adopted by the new authorities. 'Everything is good. We are fully equipped. We worked two, three days in order to equip the school with the needed services for the students' safe return to school,' Nasser said, adding the Jawdat al-Hashemi school had not been damaged. In one classroom, a student pasted the new flag on a wall. 'I am optimistic and very happy,' said student Salah al-Din Diab. 'I used to walk in the street scared that I would get drafted to military service. I used to be afraid when I reach a checkpoint.' As Syria starts trying to rebuild, its neighbors and other foreign powers are still working out a new stance on the country, a week after the collapse of the Assad government that was backed by Iran and Russia. Ending sanctions? Sharaa - better known by his rebel nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani - leads the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the Islamist group that swept Assad from power last week. HTS is a group formerly allied with al-Qaida that is designated a terrorist organization by many governments and is under United Nations sanctions. U.N. Syria envoy Geir Pedersen said on Sunday he hoped for a swift end to the sanctions to help facilitate economic recovery. 'We will hopefully see a quick end to sanctions so that we can see really rallying around building up Syria,' Pedersen said as he arrived in Damascus to meet Syria's caretaker government and other officials. Top diplomats from the United States, Turkey, the European Union and Arab nations met in Jordan on Saturday and agreed that a new government in Syria should respect minority rights, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-authorities-reopen-schools-a-week-after-upheaval-that-overthrew-assad-/7901916.html	2024-12-15T05:13:29-08:00	
DR Congo, Rwanda peace talks canceled	Luanda — Talks due Sunday between the leaders of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo to end conflict in the eastern DRC were called off after negotiations deadlocked, officials said. Since 2021 a Rwanda-backed rebel militia has seized swathes of the eastern DRC, displacing thousands and triggering a humanitarian crisis. There had been high hopes that the summit hosted by Angola's President Joao Lourenco — the African Union mediator to end the conflict — would end with a deal to end the conflict. But around midday Sunday the head of the Angolan presidency's media office said it would not go ahead. 'Contrary to what we expected, the summit will no longer be held today,' media officer Mario Jorge told journalists. Lourenco was meeting with DRC leader Felix Tshisekedi and without Rwandan President Paul Kagame, he said. The Congolese presidency said that negotiations had hit deadlock over a Rwandan demand that the DRC hold direct dialogue with the Kigali-backed and largely ethnic Tutsi M23 rebels who have since 2021 seized swathes of the eastern DRC. 'There is a stalemate because the Rwandans have set as a precondition for the signing of an agreement that the DRC hold a direct dialogue with the M23,' Giscard Kusema, the Congolese presidency spokesman present in Luanda, told AFP. Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe said Friday that his country wanted 'a firm commitment from the DRC to resume direct talks with the M23 within a well-defined framework and timeframe.' The Congolese government says, however, that the M23 only exists because of Rwandan military support. 'If Kigali is in good faith in the negotiations and on its promise to withdraw ... its troops from Congolese soil, the conflict will end with the M23, and at the same time it will stop with Rwanda,' a Congolese government source said. Fragile truce Kagame and Tshisekedi last saw each other in October in Paris but did not speak, though they have maintained dialogue through the mediation of Luanda. In early August, Angola mediated a fragile truce that stabilized the situation at the front line, but both sides continued to exchange fire and clashes have intensified since late October. Home to a string of rival armed groups, the mineral-rich eastern DRC has been plagued by internal and cross-border violence for the past three decades. 'Our country continues to face persistent rebellions, including the aggression by the Rwandan army and the M23 terrorists,' Tshisekedi said in parliament Wednesday, calling the militants and Rwanda 'enemies of the Republic.' The capital of DRC's North Kivu province, Goma, home to about 1 million people and another million displaced by war, is now nearly surrounded by M23 rebels and the Rwandan army. Early in November, the two central African neighbours launched a committee to monitor ceasefire violations, led by Angola and including representatives from both the DRC and Rwanda. Kinshasa and Kigali a few weeks later approved a document setting out the terms by which Rwandan troops will disengage from Congolese territory. A previous draft dated in August listed the dismantling of the FDLR militia, created by ethnic Hutus involved in the Rwandan genocide in 1994, as a precondition for Rwanda's withdrawal. Often portrayed by Kigali as a threat to its security, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) is one of various disparate militias fighting alongside the Congolese army against the M23. The August draft was rejected by the DRC, which demanded that the withdrawal occur at the same time as the FDLR's dismantling. The final strategic document, seen by AFP, planned for a period of 90 days to 'conclude the neutralization of the FDLR and the lifting of Rwanda's defensive measures.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dr-congo-rwanda-peace-talks-canceled-/7901906.html	2024-12-15T04:59:23-08:00	
German far-right leader questions NATO membership	Berlin — The co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party on Sunday said Germany should reconsider its membership of NATO if the U.S.-led military alliance did not consider the interests of all European countries, including Russia. 'Europe has been forced to implement America's interests. We reject that,' the AfD's Tino Chrupalla told German daily Welt. 'NATO is currently not a defense alliance. A defense community must accept and respect the interests of all European countries — including Russia's interests,' Chrupalla said. 'If NATO cannot ensure that, Germany must consider to what extent this alliance is still useful for us,' he added. The far-right AfD is polling at around 18-19% ahead of snap elections on February 23, following the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition government last month. The score puts the party ahead of Scholz's Social Democrats at 16-17% and behind only the conservative CDU-CSU bloc, which is polling around 31-32%. The AfD has little chance of forming a government because other parties have ruled out cooperation with the far-right group. But it could continue a streak of strong electoral showings, after a landmark win in Thuringia, one of the regions in Germany's formerly communist east. The far-right party has been a vocal critic of Germany's military support for Ukraine and has argued for a swift end to the war prompted by Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. 'The German government must finally get to the point of wanting to end the war,' said Chrupalla, whose colleague, Alice Weidel, will lead the AfD into the election as the party's candidate for chancellor. 'Russia has won this war. Reality has caught up with those who claim to want to enable Ukraine to win the war,' he said. The conflict in Ukraine is set to be one of the major themes of the campaign, which will culminate on the eve of the third anniversary of the invasion. Scholz has pledged sustained support for Ukraine but has counseled prudence, as he hopes to tap into pacifist currents among voters, which are particularly strong in the east. The chancellor has resisted calls to send long-range missiles that Kyiv could use to strike Russian territory for fear of being drawn into the conflict, and recently reinitiated direct contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-far-right-leader-questions-nato-membership-/7901894.html	2024-12-15T04:13:46-08:00	
Estonia sanctions Georgian premier over protest crackdown	Warsaw — Estonia has sanctioned more than a dozen top Georgian officials including its prime minister over Tbilisi's 'criminal' crackdown on pro-European protesters, Tallinn's foreign minister said on Sunday. Georgia's authorities have drawn widespread criticism for their handling of demonstrators, who accuse the ruling party of eroding democracy and seeking to bring the ex-Soviet country back into the embrace of former master Russia. Police have deployed water cannons and tear gas to break up demonstrations while security agents have raided the offices of opposition parties and beaten dissenting lawmakers and journalists. 'The violence perpetrated by the authorities against protesters, journalists and opposition leaders is criminal and against human rights,' said Estonia's top diplomat Margus Tsahkna. 'I call on all EU countries to react and to take actions,' he added on X. The fresh sanctions announcement comes a day after the ruling Georgian Dream party installed a hard-right loyalist former Manchester City striker as president. That election process was boycotted by the pro-European opposition amid a growing constitutional crisis. Along with its fellow Baltic states, Estonia had already banned several Georgian officials from setting foot on their territory. Those included Georgia's Interior Minister Vakhtang Gomelauri as well as Georgia's richest man, Bidzina Ivanishvili, widely considered the puppet master pulling the strings of Georgian politics. Since Georgian Dream claimed victory in October's elections — which the opposition has criticized as rigged — tens of thousands have taken to the streets. Those protests have become nightly after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's shock decision in late November to shelve the Black Sea nation's talks to join the European Union. Joining the bloc is an ambition mandated in Georgia's constitution which polls indicate has the support of some 80% of the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/estonia-sanctions-georgian-premier-over-protest-crackdown-/7901880.html	2024-12-15T03:28:55-08:00	
West Africa bloc meets as military rulers vow to quit	ABUJA, NIGERIA — West African leaders from the regional group ECOWAS were meeting on Sunday for a summit with security and the departure from the bloc of three military-led governments high on the agenda. Before the Economic Community of West Africa States meeting, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger reaffirmed as 'irreversible' their decision to quit the bloc, which they condemned as subservient to ex-colonial ruler France. The departure of the three could have a major impact on free trade and movement as well as on security cooperation in a region where jihadist groups are gaining ground across the Sahel. Among those attending the summit in the Nigerian capital Abuja will be Senegal's President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who was appointed as a mediator with the breakaway states by the 15-member ECOWAS in July. Faye said last week he was 'making progress' in talks with the three and said there was no reason for them not to maintain relations, especially given the security situation. The departure of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger will become effective one year after the announcement, in January, according to the bloc's regulations. The three states have also formed their own confederation, the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), after severing ties with France and pivoting towards Russia. The three breakaways have not announced plans to attend the Abuja summit, but they held a separate ministerial-level meeting Friday in Niger's capital, Niamey. 'The ministers reiterate the irreversible decision to withdraw from ECOWAS and are committed to pursuing a process of reflection on the means of exiting in the best interests of their peoples,' they said in a joint statement. The three states have all gone through military coups and jihadist insurgencies in recent years. ECOWAS member state Guinea is also run by a military government after a 2021 coup. Army intervention threat Tensions with ECOWAS spiked after the group threatened a military intervention over a July 2023 coup in Niger -- the region's sixth in three years -- and imposed heavy sanctions on the country. Togo's President Faure Gnassingbe has also been mediating with the Sahel states. In March, ECOWAS lifted some of the sanctions imposed on Niger in a bid to restart dialogue, especially over the fate of deposed President Mohamed Bazoum who has been detained since the coup. Earlier this year, Nigeria's top military commander met Niger's army chief to strengthen security cooperation, especially communication between the two militaries and participation in a multinational task force along the border area. Since a coup in 2021, ECOWAS member Guinea has also been led by a military chief, General Mamady Doumbouya, who has since been sworn in as president. Under pressure from ECOWAS, Guinea's military-led leaders had agreed to organize elections by the end of 2024. But they have since admitted they will not live up to that commitment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/west-africa-bloc-meets-as-military-rulers-vow-to-quit/7901872.html	2024-12-15T03:00:41-08:00	
A week into a new Syria, rebels aim for normalcy and Syrians vow not to be silent again	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — At Damascus' international airport, the new head of security — one of the rebels who marched across Syria to the capital — arrived with his team. The few maintenance workers who showed up for work huddled around Maj Hamza al-Ahmed, eager to learn what will happen next. They quickly unloaded all the complaints they had been too afraid to express during the rule of President Bashar Assad, which now, inconceivably, is over. They told the bearded fighter they were denied promotions and perks in favor of pro-Assad favorites, and that bosses threatened them with prison for working too slowly. They warned of hardcore Assad supporters among airport staff, ready to return whenever the facility reopens. As Al-Ahmed tried to reassure them, Osama Najm, an engineer, announced: 'This is the first time we talk.' This was the first week of Syria's transformation after Assad's unexpected fall. Rebels, suddenly in charge, met a population bursting with emotions: excitement at new freedoms; grief over years of repression; and hopes, expectations and worries about the future. Some were overwhelmed to the point of tears. The transition has been surprisingly smooth. Reports of reprisals, revenge killings and sectarian violence have been minimal. Looting and destruction have been quickly contained, insurgent fighters disciplined. On Saturday, people went about their lives as usual in the capital, Damascus. Only a single van of fighters was seen. There are a million ways it could go wrong. The country is broken and isolated after five decades of Assad family rule. Families have been torn apart by war, former prisoners are traumatized by the brutalities they suffered, tens of thousands of detainees remain missing. The economy is wrecked, poverty is widespread, inflation and unemployment are high. Corruption seeps through daily life. But in this moment of flux, many are ready to feel out the way ahead. At the airport, al-Ahmed told the staffers: 'The new path will have challenges, but that is why we have said Syria is for all and we all have to cooperate.' The rebels have so far said all the right things, Najm said. 'But we will not be silent about anything wrong again.' Idlib comes to Damascus At a torched police station, pictures of Assad were torn down and files destroyed after insurgents entered the city December 8. All Assad-era police and security personnel have vanished. On Saturday, the building was staffed by 10 men serving in the police force of the rebels' de facto 'salvation government,' which for years governed the rebel enclave of Idlib in Syria's northwest. The rebel policemen watch over the station, dealing with reports of petty thefts and street scuffles. One woman complains that her neighbors sabotaged her power supply. A policeman tells her to wait for courts to start operating again. 'It will take a year to solve problems' he mumbled. The rebels sought to bring order in Damascus by replicating the structure of its governance in Idlib. But there is a problem of scale. One of the policemen estimates the number of rebel police at only around 4,000; half are based in Idlib and the rest are tasked with maintaining security in Damascus and elsewhere. Some experts estimate the insurgents' total fighting force at around 20,000. Right now, the fighters and the public are learning about each other. The fighters drive large SUVs and newer models of vehicles that are out of reach for most residents in Damascus, where they cost 10 times as much because of customs duties and bribes. The fighters carry Turkish lira, long forbidden in government-held areas, rather than the plunging Syrian pound. Most of the bearded fighters hail from conservative, provincial areas. Many are hardline Islamists. The main insurgent force, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has renounced its al-Qaida past, and its leaders are working to reassure Syria's religious and ethnic communities that the future will be pluralist and tolerant. But many Syrians remain suspicious. Some fighters sport ribbons with Islamist slogans on their uniforms and not all of them belong to HTS, the most organized group. 'The people we see on the streets, they don't represent us,' said Hani Zia, a Damascus resident from the southern city of Daraa, where the 2011 anti-Assad uprising began. He was concerned by reports of attacks on minorities and revenge killings. 'We should be fearful,' he said, adding that he worries some insurgents feel superior to other Syrians because of their years of fighting. 'With all due respect to those who sacrificed, we all sacrificed.' Still, fear is not prevalent in Damascus, where many insist they will no longer let themselves be oppressed. Some restaurants have resumed openly serving alcohol, others more discretely to test the mood. At a sidewalk café in the historic Old City's Christian quarter, men were drinking beer when a fighter patrol passed by. The men turned to each other, uncertain, but the fighters did nothing. When a man waving a gun harassed a liquor store elsewhere in the Old City, the rebel police arrested him, one policeman said. Salem Hajjo, a theater teacher who participated in the 2011 protests, said he doesn't agree with the rebels' Islamist views, but is impressed at their experience in running their own affairs. And he expects to have a voice in the new Syria. 'We have never been this at ease,' he said. 'The fear is gone. The rest is up to us.' Fighters make a concerted effort to reassure On the night after Assad's fall, gunmen roamed the streets, celebrating victory with deafening gunfire. Some security agency buildings were torched. People ransacked the airport's duty-free, smashing all the bottles of liquor. The rebels blamed some of this on fleeing government loyalists. The public stayed indoors, peeking out at the newcomers. Shops shut down. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham moved to impose order, ordering a nighttime curfew for three days. It banned celebratory gunfire and moved fighters to protect properties. After a day, people began to emerge. For tens of thousands, their first destination was Assad's prisons, particularly Saydnaya on the capital's outskirts, to search for loved ones who disappeared years ago. Few have found any traces. It was wrenching but also unifying. Rebels, some of them also searching, mingled with relatives of the missing in the dark halls of prisons that all had feared for years. During celebrations in the street, gunmen invited children to hop up on their armored vehicles. Insurgents posed for photos with women, some with their hair uncovered. Pro-revolution songs blared from cars. Suddenly shops and walls everywhere are plastered with revolutionary flags and posters of activists killed by Assad's state. TV stations didn't miss a beat, flipping from praising Assad to playing revolutionary songs. State media aired the flurry of declarations issued by the new insurgent-led transitional government. The new administration called on people to go back to work and urged Syrian refugees around the world to return to help rebuild. It announced plans to rehabilitate and vet the security forces to prevent the return of 'those with blood on their hands.' Fighters reassured airport staffers — many of them government loyalists — that their homes won't be attacked, one employee said. But Syria's woes are far from being resolved. While produce prices plunged after Assad's fall, because merchants no longer needed to pay hefty customs fees and bribes, fuel distribution was badly disrupted, jacking up transportation costs and causing widespread and lengthy blackouts. Officials say they want to reopen the airport as soon as possible and this week maintenance crews inspected a handful of planes on the tarmac. Cleaners removed trash, wrecked furniture and merchandise. One cleaner, who identified himself only as Murad, said he earns the equivalent of $15 a month and has six children to feed, including one with a disability. He dreams of getting a mobile phone. 'We need a long time to clean this up,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-week-into-a-new-syria-rebels-aim-for-normalcy-and-syrians-vow-not-to-be-silent-again/7901858.html	2024-12-15T01:41:29-08:00	
Bali Nine’ drug ring prisoners fly home to Australia	SYDNEY — The five remaining members of the Australian 'Bali Nine' drug ring flew home Sunday after 19 years in jail in Indonesia, ending a saga that had frayed relations between the two countries. Indonesian police arrested the nine Australians in 2005, convicting them of attempting to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin off the holiday island of Bali. In a case that drew global attention to Indonesia's unforgiving drug laws, two of the gang would eventually be executed by firing squad, while others served hefty prison sentences. 'The Australian Government can confirm that Australian citizens, Matthew Norman, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens, Si Yi Chen, and Michael Czugaj have returned to Australia,' Canberra said in a statement. 'The men will have the opportunity to continue their personal rehabilitation and reintegration in Australia.' Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the men returned in the afternoon, and he had thanked Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto for his 'compassion.' 'Australia shares Indonesia's concern about the serious problem illicit drugs represents,' Albanese said. 'The government will continue to cooperate with Indonesia to counter narcotics trafficking and transnational crime,' he told reporters. 'These Australians spent more than 19 years in prison in Indonesia. It was time for them to come home.' The Australian government did not give further details on the agreement with Jakarta. Firing squad An Indonesian minister told AFP the five men had left the country as prisoners but 'all the responsibilities for them' had now passed to Australia. The men were accompanied on their flight home by three officials from the Australian Embassy, another Indonesian official said. The Australian government said it had consistently advocated for the men and provided consular support to them and their families during their incarceration. It asked the media to respect their privacy. Australia's national broadcaster, ABC, said the men were now free, and would not have to serve further prison time at home. The men had been given temporary accommodation and had made voluntary undertakings to continue their rehabilitation, it said. It is not uncommon for foreigners to be arrested for drug offences in Bali, which attracts millions of visitors to its palm-fringed beaches every year. Muslim-majority Indonesia has some of the world's toughest drug laws, including the death penalty for traffickers. Accused 'Bali Nine' ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were executed by firing squad in 2015 despite repeated pleas from the Australian government, which recalled its ambassador at the time. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen died of cancer in 2018, months before Renae Lawrence was released after her sentence was commuted. Heroin-lined suitcase Australian police came under criticism after the Bali Nine's arrests for alerting Indonesian authorities to the drug-smuggling ring despite the death penalty risk. The release of the Australians followed weeks of speculation that a deal for their return was in the works. In November, a senior Indonesian minister said Jakarta aimed to return prisoners from Australia, France and the Philippines by the end of this year. France last month requested the return of its citizen, Serge Atlaoui, a welder arrested in 2005 in a drugs factory outside Jakarta, according to a senior Indonesian minister. Earlier this month, Indonesia signed an agreement with the Philippines for the return of mother of two Mary Jane Veloso, who was arrested in 2010 after the suitcase she was carrying was found to be lined with 2.6 kilograms of heroin.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bali-nine-drug-ring-prisoners-fly-home-to-australia/7901855.html	2024-12-15T01:21:29-08:00	
Greece's only miniature therapy horses bring joy to many, but the charity is struggling	ATHENS, GREECE — Slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, a smile spreads across the little girl's face. Blinking behind her glasses, she inches her wheelchair forward and gently reaches out to stroke the tiny gray horse. Soon, 9-year-old Josifina Topa Mazuch is beaming as she leads Ivi, a specially trained miniature horse, standing no taller than her pink wheelchair, through the school hallway. 'I really want them to come again,' Josifina said of Ivi and a second miniature horse, Calypso, after a November morning visit to her Athens primary school for children with special needs. 'They made me feel really happy.' Ivi and Calypso are two of eight miniature horses from Gentle Carousel Greece, a Greek offshoot of Florida-based charity Gentle Carousel Miniature Therapy Horses offering visits to hospitals, rehabilitation centers and care homes. Trained over two years to work comfortably in confined environments and with vulnerable children and adults, the tiny equines, which stand about 75 centimeters tall, provide a form of pet therapy that carers say offers valuable interactions and learning experiences, particularly to people confined to hospitals or care homes. But the charity they are part of is struggling to make ends meet — run by one woman who funds the entire operation herself, with one assistant and no support team. How it all began Started in 2014 by Mina Karagianni, an interior architect and designer, the Athens operation is the only one affiliated with the Florida-based charity outside the United States. Karagianni came across Gentle Carousel while scouring the internet for information on caring for an abandoned Shetland pony she had rescued. When she saw photos of the charity's work in pediatric oncology wards, 'I was touched and I was moved, and I said: 'OK, we have to bring this to Greece,'' she said. It took months to track down and persuade the U.S. charity to work with her, and even longer to obtain the requisite permits and arrange transport to bring the horses over. But after incessant efforts, six already trained miniature horses stepped off a flight from Florida via Frankfurt in November 2013. Entirely self-funded through her day job, Karagianni now has a total of eight horses — the American six, one that was later born in Greece, and Billy, the rescued pony. Karagianni transformed her family land in Rafina, a seaside area east of Athens, into Magic Garden, complete with stables, a paddock for the horses to run free every day, a small café and an area to host children's parties and baptisms. At the time, she was open for visits every weekend, charging a small entrance fee to help cover running costs – specialized food for the horses, wood shavings for their bedding, grooming material, veterinarian visits and transportation to and from hospitals and care homes. She also began visiting schools and setting up an education program. From 2014 when Gentle Carousel Greece first opened until the first COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020, Karagianni said her little equine team saw roughly 12,000 children. Hard times But the lockdowns took their toll. Karagianni had to shut down the café and hasn't been able to reopen since. With even the tiny income from the café drying up, and Karagianni herself facing a health issue that took her out for 1 ½ years, 'we fell apart,' she said. Unable to meet utility bills, both the electricity and water companies cut off her supply, leaving her relying on neighbors for water for the horses. 'I'm just starting to get myself back together again now,' she said. 'With a lot of financial difficulties. But what can I do? I'm trying.' She's got the utilities running again, but still owes thousands of euros. Approaches to companies and institutions for funding have been unsuccessful so far. 'Maybe I just don't know how to ask properly,' Karagianni said. Running Gentle Carousel single-handedly is taking its toll. 'I'm making super-human efforts,' said Karagianni, who at 68 wonders for how long she can go on and is searching for someone to ensure the program's continuity. 'I'm doing what I can. But I can't do it alone,' she said. 'I can't do it without a team.' The joy they bring to children Despite her financial struggles, Karagianni said seeing the horses' effect, particularly on children, makes her determined to continue for as long as she can. During a visit to the Athens special needs primary school, staff lined up children in wheelchairs so each could spend a few moments with the horses. Some reached out to stroke them; others bent their heads forward over the miniature horses for a kiss. 'It's incredible, the reactions. It's like something awakens their senses,' said special needs teacher Eleni Volikaki. The state-run school, which shares facilities with a private charity for disabled children, ELEPAP, caters to children aged 6-14 with cognitive or mobility problems, or both. Anything that encourages the children to make even small hand gestures, such as reaching out to stroke a horse, 'is very important for us. Especially when it's spontaneous and comes directly from the child and isn't instigated by us,' Volikaki said. 'We saw things we didn't expect. We saw children with autism, or children who are generally afraid of animals, coming very close, letting the ponies get close to them,' Volikaki said. 'And we saw … spontaneous contact that under other circumstances we wouldn't see.' Equines also help adults The tiny horses don't just enchant children. In the seaside area of Nea Makri northeast of Athens, residents of an adult psychiatric care home gather to greet Omiros – Homer in Greek – a 12-year-old miniature gray and white stallion with a flowing mane and blue eyes. Some show their excitement at the long-anticipated visit. Others are shyer at first, but nearly all eventually approach Omiros, leading him around the home's recreation room or simply whispering to him. The interaction is invaluable, said social worker Alex Krokidas, who heads the staff at the Iasis home. 'It offers, even if only briefly, the chance to create a bond that isn't threatening, that has tenderness, quietness,' Krokidas said. 'Let's not forget, these people have faced many difficulties in their lives.' Meeting Omiros and having a few moments each with him 'gives them the opportunity to be a bit calmer, to not feel threatened, to stroke the animal,' Krokidas said. 'All of that is very therapeutic, it is deeply therapeutic.' Giorgos, one of the residents, initially kept his distance before letting Omiros come close. He leaned his head near the flowing mane. 'He gave me a beautiful feeling when he was here,' he said after Omiros headed back into the recreation room. 'Now that it's gone, I feel an absence.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/greece-s-only-miniature-therapy-horses-bring-joy-to-many-but-the-charity-is-struggling-/7899933.html	2024-12-14T23:37:02-08:00	
Chinese gold mining threatens a protected UN heritage site in Congo	OKAPI WILDLIFE RESERVE, Democratic Republic of Congo — Scattered along the banks of the Ituri River, buildings cram together, cranes transport dirt and debris scatters the soil. The patches of trees are a scant reminder that a forest once grew there. Nestled in eastern Congo's Ituri province, the Chinese-run gold mine is rapidly encroaching on an area that many say it shouldn't be operating in at all - the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, an endangered World Heritage site. The original boundaries of the reserve were established three decades ago, by Congo's government and encompassed the area where the Chinese company now mines. But over the years under opaque circumstances, the boundaries shrunk, allowing the company to operate inside the plush forest. The reserve was already on the endangered list, amid threats of conflict and wildlife trafficking. Now the rapid expansion of the Chinese mines threatens to further degrade the forest and the communities living within. Residents and wildlife experts say the mining's polluting the rivers and soil, decimating trees and swelling the population, increasing poaching, with little accountability. 'It is alarming that a semi-industrial mining operation is being given free rein in what's supposed to be a protected World Heritage Site, that was already on the danger list,' said Joe Eisen, executive director, of Rainforest Foundation UK. Spanning more than 13,000 square kilometers (5,000 square miles), the reserve became a protected site in 1996, due to its unique biodiversity and large number of threatened species, including its namesake, the okapi, a forest giraffe, of which it holds some 15% of the world's remaining 30,000. It's part of the the Congo Basin rainforest — the world's second-biggest — and a vital carbon sink that helps mitigate climate change. It also has vast mineral wealth such as gold and diamonds. Mining is prohibited in protected areas, which includes the reserve, according to Congo's mining code. Issa Aboubacar, a spokesperson for the Chinese company, Kimia Mining Investment, said the group is operating legally. It recently renewed its permits until 2048, according to government records. Congo's mining registry said the map they're using came from files from the ICCN, the body responsible for managing Congo's protected areas, and it's currently working with the ICCN on updating the boundaries and protecting the park. The ICCN told The Associated Press that in meetings this year with the mining registry the misunderstandings around the boundaries were clarified and the original ones should be used. An internal government memo from August, seen by AP, said all companies in the Reserve will be closed down, including Kimia Mining. However, it was unclear when that would happen or how. The document has not previously been reported and is the first acknowledging that the current boundaries are wrong, according to environmentalists working in Congo. Rights groups in Congo have long said the permits were illegally awarded by the mining ministry based on inaccurate maps. Shifting boundaries and rules Eastern Congo's been beset by violence for decades and the Okapi Reserve's endured years of unrest by local militia. In 2012, in Epulu town, a local rebel group slaughtered several residents including two rangers, as well as 14 okapis, the latter were part of a captive breeding program. The reserve's also been threatened by artisanal — small scale — mining, by thousands of Indigenous peoples who live in and around the forest. The Muchacha mine — the biggest in the reserve and one of the largest small and medium scale gold mines in the country — spans approximately 12 miles (19 kilometers) along the Ituri River and consists of several semi-industrial sites. Satellite images analyzed by AP show consistent development along the southwestern section of the Reserve, since it began operating in 2016, with a boom in recent years. Joel Masselink, a geographer specializing in satellite imagery, who previously worked on conservation projects in the forest, said the mining cadastral — the agency responsible for allocating mineral licenses — is using a version of the reserve's maps in which the area's been shrunk by nearly a third. This has allowed it to award and renew exploration and extraction concessions, he said. The mining cadastral told the U.N. that the boundaries were changed due to a letter from the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature, the body in charge of protected areas in Congo, but didn't provide a copy, said a report from U.N. experts. The ICCN told the AP it's never seen the letter and the boundaries used should be the original ones. Changing World Heritage Site boundaries needs to be approved by UNESCO experts and the World Heritage Committee, which analyze the impact of the modification, a spokesperson for the World Heritage Center told AP. The Center said no request to modify the Reserve's boundaries had been made and that cases of boundary modifications to facilitate development were rare. Civil society groups in Congo accuse some government officials of intentionally moving the boundaries for personal gain. 'We all knew that Muchacha was within the reserve,' said Alexis Muhima, executive director of the Congolese Civil Society Observatory for Peace Minerals. He said the discrepancy over the park's boundaries started when they realized the mine was producing large quantities of gold. The U.N. report said mines are controlled by the military, and some members are under the protection of powerful business and political interests, with soldiers at times denying local officials access to the sites. Residents, who once mined in the reserve, are infuriated by the double standard. 'The community is worried, because the Chinese are mining in a protected area when it's forbidden for the community,' said Jean Kamana, the chief of Epulu, a village inside the Reserve. Despite being a protected forest, people still mined there until authorities cracked down, largely after the Chinese arrived. Kimia Mining grants limited access to locals to mine areas for leftovers, but for a fee that many can't afford, say locals. Muvunga Kakule used to do artisanal mining in the reserve while also selling food from his farm to other miners. The 44-year-old said he's now unable to mine or sell produce as the Chinese don't buy locally. He's lost 95% of his earnings and can no longer send his children to private school. Some residents told the AP there are no other options for work and have been forced to mine secretly and risk being jailed. Losing land, animals and income During a trip to the reserve earlier this year, Kimia Mining wouldn't let AP enter the site and the government wouldn't grant access to patrol the forest with its rangers. But nearly two dozen residents, as well as former and current Kimia Mining employees from villages in and around the Reserve, told the AP the mining was decimating the forests and the wildlife and contaminating the water and land. Five people who had worked inside Kimia's mines, none of whom wanted to be named for fear of reprisal, said when the Chinese finished in one area, they leave exposed, toxic water sources. Sometimes people would fall into uncovered pits and when it rains, water seeps into the soil. Employees and mining experts say the Chinese use mercury in its operations, used to separate gold from ore. Mercury is considered one of the top ten chemicals of major public health concern by the U.N. and can have toxic effects on the nervous and immune systems. One 27-year-old woman who worked as a cook for Kimia for six months and lives in Badengaido town, close to the mine, said the soil has become infertile. '(It's) poisoned by chemicals used by the Chinese,' she said. The AP could not independently verify her claim. However, a report from the University of Antwerp that researched the impact of conflict and mining on the Reserve said chemicals used to purify gold, such as mercury or cyanide, can enter the ecosystems and pollute the soil. In the past, 15 kilograms (33 pounds) of peanut seeds would yield approximately 30 bags, but now it's hard to get three, she said. The loss of income has made it challenging to afford school and medical care for her siblings. Assana, a fisher who also worked in the mines and only wanted to use his first name, said it now takes four days to catch the same amount of fish he used to get in a day. While doing odd jobs for the company last year, the 38-year-old saw the Chinese repeatedly chop swaths of forest, making the heat unbearable, he said. Between last January and May, the reserve lost more than 480 hectares (1,186 acres) of forest cover — the size of nearly 900 American football fields — according to a joint statement from the Wildlife Conservation Society and government agencies, which said it was concerned at the findings. Aboubacar, Kimia's spokesperson in Congo, said the company respects environmental standards and pays tax to the government for reforestation. Mining is a crucial revenue stream for Congo and it 'can't place a higher value on the environment than on mining,' he said. Kimia is supporting the population and has employed more than 2,000 people, said Aboubacar. Conservation is an uphill battle Conservation groups are trying to protect the reserve, but say it's hard to enforce when there's ambiguity on the legalities. 'On the one hand, Congo's law clearly states that mining is illegal in protected areas. On the other hand, if a mine is operating with an official permit, then that creates confusion, and that becomes hard to enforce on the ground,' said Emma Stokes, Vice President of field conservation for The Wildlife Conservation Society. The internal memo, seen by AP, outlines discussions by a joint task force between the ICCN and Congo's mining registry, which was created to try and resolve the boundary issue. The document said it will trigger the process of stopping all mining within the Reserve and integrate the agreed upon map from the joint commission into the mining registry's system. UNESCO's requested a report from Congo by February, to provide clarity on what will be done to resolve the problem. But this comes as little comfort to communities in the reserve. Wendo Olengama, a Pygmy chief, said the influx of thousands of people into the Chinese-run mines has increased poaching, making it hard to earn money. During the authorized hunting season, he could capture up to seven animals a day, eating some and selling others. Now it's hard to get two, he said. Sitting in a small hut beside his wife, as she bounces their 3-year-old granddaughter on her lap, the couple says they want the Chinese company to provide business opportunities, such as cattle raising and teach people responsible hunting. 'If the situation persists, we'll live in misery,' said his wife, Dura Anyainde. 'We wont have food to eat.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-gold-mining-threatens-a-protected-un-heritage-site-in-congo/7898474.html	2024-12-14T23:36:28-08:00	
South Africa warns of people jumping in front of cars in payout scam	CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA — A trend in South Africa of people jumping in front of slow-moving cars to get compensation payouts for injuries drew a warning Tuesday from the government's national Road Accident Fund. In a statement, it said the phenomenon of people intentionally getting hit near intersections and stop streets was becoming a significant problem, while it acknowledged that some cases might have been driven by poverty and desperation at an expensive time of the year. 'We acknowledge road users may be faced with socioeconomic challenges,' the fund said. The RAF allows people to claim compensation from a national fund if they are injured in car crashes. But it warned that it was clamping down on bogus claims after identifying the new trend. It said people were waiting for vehicles to 'slow down enough that they don't get killed' before throwing themselves in front of or against the cars to fake an accident. 'The RAF does not compensate someone who intentionally causes a motor vehicle accident, even if this results in serious injuries,' it said. The fund didn't say how many cases of people intentionally getting hit by cars it had recorded but said it had rejected nearly 50,000 claims in the period between February 2022 and February this year, some of them because they were fraudulent. The warning comes ahead of South Africa's notoriously dangerous holiday season on the roads. The RAF said that on average more than 1,500 people are killed in road accidents in South Africa during the holiday period between the start of December and January 11. Around 40% of those fatalities are pedestrians, it said. 'Road users are urged to also remember that the fund does not compensate for the death itself but only pays for the actual costs to cremate the deceased or bury them in a grave,' the fund said in a grim holiday message. The RAF said it paid out $2.5 billion in claims in the 2023-24 financial year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-africa-warns-of-people-jumping-in-front-of-cars-in-payout-scam/7898423.html	2024-12-14T23:35:51-08:00	
Parents in Africa struggle with unpredictable school fees that force children to drop out	KAMPALA, UGANDA — The day Shalom Mirembe was sent home from school last month over unpaid tuition, her father lay dying in a hospital. Even as her mother sat by his bedside, school officials were calling and demanding payment. For Mirembe's mother, a shoe vendor who looks after four children, it was a heartbreaking moment in the daily struggle to pay often unpredictable and unregulated school fees. Constant threats demanding payment can leave her feeling helpless. Some officials are more tolerant, but eventually they all grow tired of her pleas. 'You have to care for this one, you have to care for the other one,' Justine Nangero said, describing a delicate balancing act to keep Mirembe and the others enrolled. 'I try to fight to see that I pay to all these schools.' It is a crushing issue for many across sub-Saharan Africa, where the lack of a few hundred dollars can determine a child's future. The region has long had the world's highest dropout rates. Reasons vary, but financial pain is the biggest. Last year, the World Bank said 54% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa rank the issue of paying school fees higher than medical bills and other expenses. It said school fees were the biggest source of financial worry for 40% of people in Uganda, where top government-funded schools now charge nearly $700 in tuition per three-month term. That's a significant amount in this East African country where annual GDP per capita was $864 in 2023. More than anything, it's the unpredictable tuition hikes — for sometimes questionable reasons — that haunt parents across the country of more than 45 million people. Some critics, including Uganda's parliament speaker, have called for regulation to protect parents from exploitation. The Equal Opportunities Commission, a government agency that tracks inequality and discrimination, released a report in September calling for punitive measures against government-supported schools that appear to set excessive fees. It warned that arbitrarily raising fees can force children to drop out. Attendance falls from 68% in grade school to 22% in secondary school, with financial difficulty the main reason for failure to continue studies, according to new figures from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics. Uganda does have a program for universal secondary education, introduced in 2007 and similar to one for primary education, but such schools are often rundown and undesirable for many families. They are generally tuition-free, but parents must pay sometimes burdensome fees for uniforms, textbooks and other items. When it comes to more popular, and more expensive, private schools, the government is not interested in price intervention, said Dennis Mugimba, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education. Setting fees for private schools is 'purely administrative and it is adjusted according to the business environment,' he said. But certain charges such as those including 'capital development' should not be the responsibility of parents, he said. Such private schools have mushroomed across Uganda and now make up the majority of the country's schools, addressing growing demand but also emphasizing the profitability of education as a business. That worries some experts. 'We can't let education be treated like a market stall,' said Fagil Mandy, a former inspector of schools. Education authorities should standardize regulations to make school fees universally predictable, he said. Routine school expenses, for both private and some top government-funded schools, can include everything from a contribution towards the purchase of a bus to the procurement of laboratory equipment. But when the list of fees includes a ream of photocopying paper or a bag of cement from each student, questions emerge about where they end up. The school that Mirembe attends outside the capital, Kampala, charges the equivalent of $300 per term. Its officials expect 70% of fees to be paid at the beginning of a term, but many parents fail to meet that threshold. Some, like Nangero, send their children to school having paid nothing, counting on the mercy of officials. But measures to track payments include gate passes that show how much is owed and when, and a student may be denied entry, said Joanita Seguya, a deputy head teacher at the school, Wampewo Ntakke Secondary. In the school of more than 2,100 students, roughly 400 are from working-class families that routinely struggle to pay fees, according to Seguya, who said the system can seem harsh. To accommodate some parents, the school accepts in-kind payments such as vegetables and fruit, she said. But Nangero, whose family shares a single room, has nothing of the sort to offer. Her shoe business, long drained of cash by school fees, has collapsed. The death of her husband, whose carpentry once supplemented the family income, has increased the pain. She said anxiety over school fees is more damaging for her children, who spend days at home whenever school officials lose patience. She's grateful that two of her sons in secondary school are now supported by an evangelical cleric — rare support made possible via contact through their religious fellowship. The 20-year-old Mirembe, who is taking her final exams this year, was able to start the school term in September because of a bursar's sympathy, she said, but other officials were not so lenient weeks later as her father was near death. 'At least maybe I will come and pay something tomorrow,' her mother recalled pleading with one official. 'And she told me, 'No, we are not going to allow your daughter to be here.'' Mirembe arrived home hours before her father died. Vincent Odoi, a teacher at her school, recalled the incident as unfortunate, saying administrators didn't know of the family's challenges. Mirembe was allowed to return days after her father's burial, which some of her teachers attended. Other families are not so fortunate. One is a nearby family of seven children who dropped out of school in recent years for lack of tuition. Their jobless father, Moses Serikomawa, described the scramble in vain for school fees as 'like a cancer. It cannot be treated.' Raising a total of over $200 in school fees each term is too much trouble when the family sometimes lacks food, he said. His oldest child, who would be in high school now, dropped out after completing secondary school last year. Now the boy is idle. 'The children still want to go back to school,' Serikomawa said. 'When I look at my children, there is no joy, no joy at all.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/parents-in-africa-struggle-with-unpredictable-school-fees-that-force-children-to-drop-out/7898409.html	2024-12-14T23:35:15-08:00	
Endless torture': Turkish inmate recalls hell of Syria jails	MAGARACIK, TURKEY — Finally home in Turkey, Mehmet Erturk cannot eat the bread his wife has made him. After 20 years jailed in Syria, half his teeth are missing and the other half are threatening to fall out. 'It was torture after torture,' he told AFP, miming the truncheon blows to the mouth the guards would give him at a notorious Damascus prison known as the Palestine Branch, where he spent part of his time incarcerated. Arrested in 2004 for smuggling, Erturk finally made it back to his home to Magaracik on Monday evening, a village perched at the top of a winding road dotted with olive trees some 10 minutes from the Syrian border. 'My family thought I was dead,' said the 53-year-old, whose face and manner of walking make him look 20 years older. On the night of his release, he heard gunshots and began to pray. 'We didn't know what was happening outside. I thought I was finished,' he said. Then he heard loud hammer blows and within minutes the prison gates were flung open by the rebels who ousted Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad. 'Like being in a coffin' 'We hadn't seen him for 11 years. We had no hope,' admitted his wife, Hatice, sitting cross-legged outside their home preparing bread with their youngest daughter, who was barely 6 months old when her father was arrested. After he was sentenced to 15 years, the prison authorities left this father of four to languish in an underground dungeon, at the mercy of brutal guards. 'Our bones would pop out of the socket when they hit our wrists with hammers,' he said. 'They also poured boiling water down the neck of one prisoner. The flesh from his neck just slid all the way down' to his hips, he said. Pulling up his right trouser leg, he shows his right ankle, the skin darkened by the chain he wore. 'During the day, it was strictly forbidden to talk... there were cockroaches in the food. It was damp, it stank like a toilet,' he said, recalling days 'without clothes or water or food.' 'It was like being in a coffin.' And there was huge overcrowding. 'Threw the dead into skips' 'They put 115, 120 people in a cell for 20 people. Many people died of starvation,' he said. And the guards just 'threw the dead into rubbish skips.' Erturk said he paid the price for the hatred Syria's authorities bore for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who early in the war urged Assad to leave. 'We Turks suffered a lot of torture for that,' he told AFP, saying he was refused medication on grounds of his nationality. He sank so low he even hoped they would hang him. 'They were taking us to a new prison block and I saw a rope hanging from the ceiling and I said, 'Thank God, I'm saved,'' he said. As he recounted the horrors, he often broke off to thank 'our dear president Erdogan' for him being back, alive with his family and not one of the countless victims of Syria's brutal prison system. Those could number more than 105,000 people since the war began in 2011, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH). One of his sisters passes him a handful of old photos. In one, he is pictured with a lifelong friend called Faruk Karga, who ended up in the same prison with him shortly after the picture was taken. But Karga never came home. 'He died of starvation in prison in around 2018,' said Erturk. 'He weighed about 40 kilos.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/endless-torture-turkish-inmate-recalls-hell-of-syria-jails/7901831.html	2024-12-14T23:05:43-08:00	
Ex-Bolsonaro Cabinet minister arrested in Brazil over alleged coup plot	SAO PAULO — Brazil's Federal Police on Saturday arrested a former member of President Jair Bolsonaro's Cabinet and his 2022 running mate in connection with investigations into an alleged coup plot, the Supreme Court said in a statement. Gen. Walter Braga Netto was formally accused in November, along with Bolsonaro and 35 others, of plotting a coup to keep Bolsonaro in office following his failed 2022 reelection bid. Prosecutors have yet to file formal charges against Braga Netto. The arrest made on Saturday stemmed from allegations of obstructing the collection of evidence, the Federal Police said in a statement. The arrest request was authorized by the Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, with a favorable assessment from the prosecutor-general's office. A court statement said police formally requested the general to be preventively detained because its agents identified 'robust evidence' that he sought to discover what a former Bolsonaro aide, who signed a plea bargain, was telling authorities. Authorities also executed search and seizure warrants against Braga Netto and his aide, Col. Flávio Botelho Peregrino. Braga Netto served as Bolsonaro's chief of staff from 2020-21 and as defense minister from 2021-22. His attorney did not respond to a request for comment. Previously, his legal team said they would wait to review police documents before making any statements. In November, Brazil's Federal Police unsealed the final report of its investigation into the plan to keep Bolsonaro in office by overturning the election of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2022. Federal Police portray Braga Netto as one of the plot's leaders, also involved in pressuring military leaders to sign onto the coup. The 884-page document, substantiated by evidence and testimony, described a multistep scheme. The plan included systematically sowing distrust of the electoral system among the populace, drafting a decree to give the plot a veneer of legal basis, pressuring top military brass to go along with the plan, and inciting a riot in the capital. According to the investigation, the plan included a plot to assassinate Lula, Vice-President-elect Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. Investigators allege Braga Netto greenlit the assassination plan at a meeting with the plotters inside his home. The assassination plan sought to leave Bolsonaro's ticket as the only remaining valid one in the 2022 runoff, police said. De Moraes led a five-year probe into fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices, which has led some far-right allies and supporters being barred from social media and even imprisoned. The police report contains no indication that any attempt to assassinate Lula or Alckmin was put into motion. However, investigators found messages and documents indicating that the plotters were monitoring and following de Moraes at the time. The Supreme Court's statement said the police had new evidence suggesting that Braga Netto was involved in securing and delivering financial resources for the coup plot. Braga Netto, the former president and his main allies have denied any wrongdoing or involvement and accuse the authorities of political persecution. Reactions to the arrest were divided along the same political line that has split the South American nation since Bolsonaro took power. Bolsonaro wrote on social media platform X that the arrest was ordered on a questionable basis, while the ex-president's allies railed at authorities for what they called another case of authorities breaking legal norms. Lula's government and members of his party called it a win for democracy and justice in Brazil. 'The fact that for the first time in Brazil's history, a four-star general has been arrested for attempted coup d'état is in itself a sign that we are making progress as a constitutional democracy. Brazil still has a long way to go as a Republic, but today is a historic day on this journey,' Randolfe Rodrigues, a senator in Lula's party, wrote in a post on X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ex-bolsonaro-cabinet-minister-arrested-in-brazil-over-alleged-coup-plot/7901818.html	2024-12-14T19:51:43-08:00	
Hackers demand ransom from Rhode Islanders after data breach	Hundreds of thousands of Rhode Island residents' personal and bank information, including Social Security numbers, were likely hacked by an international cybercriminal group asking for a ransom, state officials said on Saturday. In what Rhode Island officials described as extortion, the hackers threatened to release the stolen information unless they were paid an undisclosed amount of money. The breached data affects people who use the state's government assistance programs and includes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and healthcare purchased through the state's HealthSource RI, Governor Dan McKee announced on Friday. Hackers gained access to RIBridges, the state's online portal for obtaining social services earlier this month, the governor's office said in a statement, but the breach was not confirmed by its vendor, Deloitte, until Friday. 'Deloitte confirmed that there is a high probability that a cybercriminal has obtained files with personally identifiable information from RIBridges,' the governor's office said in a statement on Saturday. A representative from McKee's office was not immediately available to Reuters for comment. Anyone who has applied for or received benefits through those programs since 2016 could be affected. The state directed Deloitte to shut down RIBridges to remediate the threat, and for the time being, anyone applying for new benefits will have to do so on paper applications until the system is back up. Households believed to have been affected will receive a letter from the state notifying them of the problem and explaining steps to be taken to help protect their data and bank accounts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hackers-demand-ransom-from-rhode-islanders-after-data-breach/7901811.html	2024-12-14T18:18:07-08:00	
Britain joins trans-Pacific pact in biggest post-Brexit trade deal	LONDON — Britain officially became the 12th member of a trans-Pacific trade pact which includes Japan, Australia and Canada on Sunday as it seeks to deepen ties in the region and build its global trade links after leaving the European Union. Britain announced last year it would join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in its biggest trade deal since Brexit. The accession means Britain will be able to apply CPTPP trade rules and lower tariffs with eight of the 11 existing members from Sunday — Brunei, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. The agreement enters into force with Australia on December 24, and will apply with the final two members — Canada and Mexico — 60 days after they ratify it. The pact represents Britain's first free trade deals with Malaysia and Brunei, but while it had agreements with the other countries, CPTPP provisions go further, especially in giving companies choices on how to use 'rules of origin' provisions. The CPTPP does not have a single market for goods or services, and so regulatory harmonization is not required, unlike the EU, whose trading orbit Britain left at the end of 2020. Britain estimates the pact may be worth $2.5 billion a year in the long run — less than 0.1% of GDP. But in a sign of the strategic, rather than purely economic, implications of the pact, Britain can now influence whether applicants China and Taiwan may join the group. The free trade agreement has its roots in the U.S.-backed Trans-Pacific Partnership, developed in part to counter China's growing economic dominance. The U.S. pulled out in 2017 under then-President Donald Trump and the pact was reborn as the CPTPP. Costa Rica is the next applicant country to go through the process of joining, while Indonesia also aims to do so.	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-joins-trans-pacific-pact-in-biggest-post-brexit-trade-deal/7901804.html	2024-12-14T17:15:18-08:00	
Storms encase Iowa, eastern Nebraska in ice; trigger tornado warning in California	OMAHA, NEBRASKA — A major ice storm created treacherous driving conditions across Iowa and eastern Nebraska this weekend and prompted temporary closures of Interstate 80 after numerous cars and trucks slid off the road. Many events were canceled across the region when the storm hit Friday evening, and businesses announced plans to open late Saturday as officials urged people to stay home if possible. Temperatures rose high enough in the afternoon to melt the ice in most places, however. 'Luckily some warmer air is moving in behind this to make it temporary,' said Dave Cousins, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's office in Davenport, Iowa. At least one person died in a crash caused by the icy roads in eastern Nebraska. The Washington County Sheriff's office said a 57-year-old woman died after she lost control of her pickup on Highway 30 near Arlington and hit an oncoming truck. The other driver sustained minor injuries. Trees topple Elsewhere a storm and wind gusts of up to 96 kilometers per hour prompted the first tornado warning in San Francisco, California, and caused some damage. Parts of neighboring San Mateo County were also included in the warning, which went out at 5:51 a.m. to about 1 million people in the area. It was lifted by 6:15 a.m. The storm toppled trees onto cars and streets and damaged some roofs in San Francisco, which has not seen a tornado since 2005, according to the Weather Service. The damage was being assessed to determine if there was indeed a tornado. 'This was the first-ever warning for a possible tornado in San Francisco. I would guess there wasn't a clear signature on radar for a warning in 2005,' said Roger Gass, a meteorologist in the Weather Service's Monterey, California. He said he was not there in 2005. The fast-moving storm prompted warnings for residents to take shelter, but few people have basements in the area. 'The biggest thing that we tell people in the city is to put as many walls between you and the outside as possible,' meteorologist Dalton Behringer said. Snow falls at ski resorts In upstate New York, people were digging out after heavy snow fell. More than 84 centimeters was reported near Orchard Park, where residents are used to dealing with lake-effect snow this time of year. And in Nevada, up to 91 centimeters of snow was forecast for Sierra Nevada mountaintops, with a winter storm warning in effect through 10 p.m. More than one-third of a meter fell at some Lake Tahoe ski resorts, according to the National Weather Service's Reno office. Interstate 80 was closed for about an 130-kilometer stretch from Applegate, California, to the Nevada state line just west of Reno, where rain was falling and a winter weather advisory remained in effect through the afternoon. In western Washington, tens of thousands of people lost electricity Saturday, local news outlets reported, amid a system that brought rain and gusty winds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/storms-encase-iowa-eastern-nebraska-in-ice-trigger-tornado-warning-in-california/7901793.html	2024-12-14T16:36:46-08:00	
Heavy fighting in Congo between army, rebels ahead of peace talks	GOMA, CONGO — Fighting between the Congolese army and the M23 rebel group intensified in eastern Congo in recent days ahead of much anticipated peace talks on Sunday, the army said. In a statement on Friday, Congo's army accused the M23 of killing 12 civilians this week in villages of the Lubero territory in the eastern province of North-Kivu . An M23 spokesperson told The Associated Press it denied the accusation, discrediting it as 'propaganda' from Congo's government. Conflict displaces millions M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda, in a conflict that has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced. Congo and the United Nations accuse Rwanda of backing M23. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. Last month, Congo and Rwanda's foreign ministers agreed on the terms and conditions of the disengagement of Rwandan forces in eastern Congo. In July, Congo signed a ceasefire with M23 that came into effect in August, but fighting has resumed since. Earlier this month, the United States said it was 'gravely concerned' by ceasefire violations by M23 rebels. 'Tired of the war' The intensification of fighting comes as Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwanda's President Paul Kagame are set to meet Sunday in Angola, which has been mediating the conflict. It will be their first official meeting since last year. Aline Kasereka, a mother of six living in Lubero, a town 50 kilometers (30 miles) away from the villages where the fighting took place earlier this week, said the peace talks are urgently needed. 'We are tired of the war, every day we move, we do not know in which country we are anymore,' Kasereka told the AP. 'Our authorities have to sit on the negotiation table and find a solution because we want to return to our normal life.' Henry Pacifique, analyst for the Kivu Security Barometer research project, said he remains pessimistic about the outcome of the summit. 'It seems like Angola is trying to force Congo and Rwanda to participate, while both parties continue to make the other the scapegoat to justify future violations of the agreement,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/heavy-fighting-in-congo-between-army-rebels-ahead-of-peace-talks-/7901629.html	2024-12-14T16:11:37-08:00	
ABC to pay $15M to Trump library to settle lawsuit, court documents show	ABC News has agreed to give $15 million to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's presidential library to settle a lawsuit over comments that anchor George Stephanopoulos made on air involving the civil case brought against Trump by writer E. Jean Carroll, a court document filed on Saturday showed. The lawsuit, filed on March 19 in U.S. District Court in Southern Florida, accused Stephanopoulos of making the statements with malice and a disregard for the truth. It said the statements were distributed widely to third parties and repeated. 'We are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,' an ABC News spokesperson said in a statement. The lawsuit cites a March 10 interview with U.S. Representative Nancy Mace, a Republican who has spoken publicly about being raped as a teenager. During the interview, Stephanopoulos said Trump was found liable for rape and asked her how she could endorse the candidate. According to the settlement, ABC News must publish by Sunday a statement at the bottom of a March 10 online article that accompanied the interview. 'ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J. Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Representative Nancy Mace on ABC's 'This Week on March 10, 2024,' the statement must say, according to the court document.	https://www.voanews.com/a/abc-to-pay-15m-to-trump-library-to-settle-lawsuit-court-documents-show-/7901619.html	2024-12-14T15:13:14-08:00	
Mystery drones still causing concern over US Northeast	New York — Unidentified drones were stoking security and safety fears over the U.S. Northeast at the weekend, prompting New York's governor to seek federal help, as President-elect Donald Trump weighed in to suggest the devices be shot down. 'This has gone too far,' New York Governor Kathy Hochul said Saturday, lamenting in a statement that 'drone activity in the airspace' forced a one-hour shutdown of the runways Friday night at Stewart Airfield, a smaller regional airport in the state. New York's port authority confirmed the temporary closure to AFP, saying the halt was taken at Stewart 'following a report from the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) about a drone sighting at the airport.' Flight traffic was not affected. For weeks now residents of New York and neighboring New Jersey, both on the U.S. East Coast have been reporting flights of large unidentified drones, a phenomenon that has only fueled concerns — especially since local and national authorities have provided no answers as to the origins of the devices. Video footage of mysterious airborne devices has clogged social media platforms, and some elected officials have taken to criticizing President Joe Biden's administration for its supposed inaction. On Thursday a spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council, John Kirby, sought to reassure that there was 'no evidence' of a threat, saying they may be manned aircraft including legally operated small planes or helicopters. Some legislators like Republican Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey have raised the prospect of threats from a foreign state such as Russia or China, without citing evidence to back the claim. On Friday Trump jumped provocatively into the fray. 'Mystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government's knowledge,' he posted on his Truth Social media platform. 'I don't think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!' Governor Hochul for her part is calling on Congress to pass legislation that would bolster the ability to counter so-called unmanned aircraft systems and 'strengthen the FAA's oversight of drones.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mystery-drones-still-causing-concern-over-us-northeast-/7901613.html	2024-12-14T14:48:47-08:00	
Iran currency slips to new lows amid US, Europe tensions	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — The Iranian currency extended its fall Saturday, hitting a new all-time low against the U.S. dollar amid uncertainties about Donald Trump's imminent arrival in the White House and tensions with the West over Tehran's nuclear program. The rial plunged to 756,000 to the dollar on the unofficial market Saturday, compared to 741,500 rials on Friday, according to Bonbast.com, which reports exchange rates. The bazar360.com website said the dollar was being sold for about 755,000 rials. Facing an official inflation rate of about 35%, Iranians seeking safe havens for their savings have been buying dollars, other hard currencies, gold or cryptocurrencies, suggesting further headwinds for the rial. The dollar has been gaining against the rial since trading around 690,000 rials in early November amid concerns that once inaugurated in January, Trump would re-impose his 'maximum pressure' policy against Iran with tougher sanctions and empower Israel to strike Iranian nuclear sites. Iran's currency again declined after the board of governors of the U.N. nuclear agency IAEA passed a European-proposed resolution against Tehran — increasing the risk of new sanctions — and following the downfall of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, a long-time ally of the Islamic Republic. Trump in 2018 reneged on a nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 and re-imposed U.S. economic sanctions on Iran that had been relaxed. The deal had limited Iran's ability to enrich uranium, a process that can yield fissile material for nuclear weapons. Iran's rial has lost more than 90% of its value since the sanctions were re-imposed in 2018.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-currency-slips-to-new-lows-amid-us-europe-tensions-/7901604.html	2024-12-14T14:44:25-08:00	
India's Supreme Court takes note of judge's 'communal' speech	India's Supreme Court has said it would review the controversial speech by a top court judge in which he said that the country would function according to the demands or wishes of the Hindu majority community. Many are demanding the impeachment of the judge, Shekhar Kumar Yadav, who practices at the High Court of Allahabad, the topmost court in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The chief justice of India (CJI), Sanjiv Khanna, said that the Supreme Court would review what Yadav said at a program organized by the right-wing Hindu organization Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and held on December 8. The Supreme Court had seen newspaper reports on Judge Yadav's speech and sought its 'details and particulars' from the Allahabad High Court, a statement by the highest court in India said Tuesday. Supreme Court Bar Association President Kapil Sibal and others have called for the judge's impeachment. Yadav's bias is 'written largely in his expression of views' and his speech was 'unworthy of any judge,' said former Indian supreme court justice Madan Lokur. 'Given his proclivity of making highly controversial statements, this is really the last straw and the proposal to impeach him is justified,' Lokur told VOA in an email. Justice Yadav, who was frequently seen supporting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had courted controversies and polarized public opinion with his judicial orders and past public statements. In 2021, while denying bail to a man accused of cow slaughter, he called for the cow to be declared India's national animal and claimed that 'scientists believe cows are the only animals that inhale and exhale oxygen.' In his order, Yadav noted that ghee or clarified butter made from cow's milk, which is used in yajnas, the Hindu ritual of fire sacrifice, 'provides special energy to sun rays which ultimately causes rain.' A mixture of cow milk, curd, ghee, urine and cow dung 'helps in the treatment of many incurable diseases,' he said in his order. On Sunday, while speaking on the Uniform Civil Code at the VHP program, Yadav said that he had 'no hesitation' in saying that India would function 'according to the wishes of the majority community (Hindus) living in the country.' 'This is the law … the law, in fact, works according to the majority ... Only what benefits the welfare and happiness of the majority (Hindus) will be accepted (by the law),' he said. Yadav targeted Muslims, calling the religious minority a 'kathmulle,' a derogatory term used to stereotype Muslim men as illiterate and stubborn. 'In your (Islamic) culture, from a young age, children are exposed to the slaughtering of animals. How can you expect them to be tolerant and compassionate?' he asked. 'Kathmulles are harmful to this country and hinder our progress. We should stay cautious about such people,' Yadav added. The Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms (CJAR) — an NGO working to ensure a judicial system with increased accountability in India — requested Tuesday in a letter that Chief Justice Khanna set up a committee and conduct an in-house inquiry into the case. 'Such communally charged statements at a public event, by a sitting judge of the High Court, not only hurt religious sentiments but completely erode faith of the general public in the integrity and impartiality of the judicial institution,' the letter from the CJAR said. 'Justice Yadav also used unpardonable and unconscionable slurs against the Muslim community, bringing shame and disrepute to the high office of a judge of the Allahabad High Court and the judiciary as a whole, besides undermining the rule of law.' Supreme Court lawyer Balraj Singh Malik told VOA that Yadav's statement was 'anti-national and anti-constitutional' in a text response on WhatsApp. 'Mr. Yadav's words go against the spirit of the oath he took at the time of his appointment. He should be kept away from hearing any cases. Many such types of judges, having tutored mentality of RSS [a Hindu right-wing paramilitary group], are in the judiciary now,' Malik told VOA. 'There is no place for such judges in India, who have a mindset heavily influenced by the RSS. This has been an issue since the BJP came into power in 2014,' he said. The Hindu nationalist BJP or Bharatiya Janata Party is India's federal ruling party headed by Narendra Modi. Activist Apoorvanand, who goes by one name, said that while it is a 'known fact' that the Indian judiciary is populated by judges who follow the RSS and the BJP's ideology of Hindu majoritarianism, Yadav expressed a sentiment that 'even the top BJP leaders shy away from.' 'He justified the demolition of the Babri Mosque, an act which the Supreme Court has deemed criminal,' Apoorvanand, a Delhi University professor, told VOA. 'Yadav's speech proves that he does not believe in the constitution of India which is secular and is a partisan judge from whom no Muslim or non-Hindu can expect justice from. He is therefore a dangerous person as a judge and should not be allowed to continue in his post,' Apoorvanand added. Rights activist Harsh Mander said that Yadav's comment 'brazenly violates' the Indian constitution, upholding which is the judge's highest duty. 'The constitution, after all, guarantees equal citizenship rights in every way for religious minorities as compared to the Hindu majority,' he told VOA in a text via the Signal Messenger app. 'But even if this assurance was not the soul of the Indian constitution, it lies at the core of any justice process anyway,' he said, adding that Yadav violated not just the Indian constitution but also the core idea of justice. Former chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission Zafarul-Islam Khan said that with his speech, Justice Yadav has exposed his leanings toward Hindutva. Hindutva is a right-wing Hindu nationalist political ideology that seeks to establish Hinduism and Hindu culture as dominant in India and aims to turn India into an overtly Hindu nation-state.

Trump taps Truth Social CEO Nunes to lead intelligence board	WASHINGTON — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday named ally Devin Nunes, a former U.S. lawmaker who now runs Trump's Truth Social platform, to serve as chairman of President's Intelligence Advisory Board. Nunes, a longtime Trump defender who led the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee during part of Trump's first White House term, will remain Truth Social CEO while serving on the advisory panel, Trump said in a post on the platform. As committee chair, Nunes alleged that the FBI had conspired against Trump during its investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections in which Trump defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. 'Devin will draw on his experience as former Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and his key role in exposing the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, to provide me with independent assessments of the effectiveness and propriety of the U.S. Intelligence Community’s activities,' Trump wrote. The President's Intelligence Advisory Board is a White House panel that offers the president independent assessments of intelligence agencies' effectiveness and planning. Trump on Saturday also named IBM executive and former U.S. Department of Homeland Security official Troy Edgar to serve as the department's deputy secretary, and businessman Bill White to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Belgium.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-taps-truth-social-ceo-nunes-to-lead-intelligence-board-/7901587.html	2024-12-14T13:37:40-08:00	
Pelosi gets hip replaced at US military hospital in Germany	WASHINGTON — Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had hip replacement surgery Saturday at a U.S. military hospital in Germany after falling while at an event in Luxembourg with other members of Congress. Pelosi, 84, 'is well on the mend,' said Ian Krager, a Pelosi spokesperson. Krager, said in a statement that she is 'currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals' and is unable to attend the remainder of events on her trip. He did not describe the nature of her injury or give any additional details, but a person familiar with the incident said Pelosi tripped and fell while at an event with the other members of Congress. Another person familiar with the situation said she injured her hip. The people requested anonymity to discuss the fall because they were not authorized to speak about it publicly. Pelosi thanked the staff at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center and the hospital in Luxembourg, where she was also treated, for 'their excellent care and kindness.' She was in Europe with a bipartisan congressional delegation to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in World War II. Among those on the trip was Representative Michael McCaul, who posted on social media Friday that he was 'praying for a speedy recovery' for Pelosi. The two lawmakers were captured holding hands in a group photo that day at the U.S. Embassy in Luxembourg. Pelosi was first elected in 1987 and served as speaker twice. She stepped down from her leadership post two years ago but remained in Congress and was reelected to represent her San Francisco district in November.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pelosi-gets-hip-replaced-at-us-military-hospital-in-germany-/7901563.html	2024-12-14T12:39:55-08:00	
Who is Han Duck-soo, South Korea's acting president after Yoon impeachment?	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who became South Korea's acting president after Saturday's impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol, is a career technocrat whose wide-ranging experience and reputation for rationality could serve him well in his latest role. With parliament's impeachment vote against Yoon passed after his short-lived attempt to impose martial law, Yoon is suspended from exercising presidential powers, and the constitution requires the prime minister to take over in an acting role. In a country sharply divided by partisan rhetoric, Han has been a rare official whose varied career transcended party lines. He faces a challenging task of keeping government functioning through its gravest political crisis in four decades, while also dealing with threats from nuclear-armed neighbor North Korea, and a slowing economy at home. His tenure as acting president could also be threatened by criminal investigations into his role in the martial law decision. Han, 75, has served in leadership positions for more than three decades under five different presidents, both conservative and liberal. His roles have included ambassador to the United States, finance minister, trade minister, presidential secretary for policy coordination, prime minister, ambassador to the OECD, and head of various think-tanks and organizations. With a Harvard doctorate in economics, Han's expertise in the economy, trade and diplomacy as well as a reputation for rationality, moderate demeanor and hard work has made him a regular go-to man in South Korean politics. Han has been prime minister since Yoon's term began in 2022, his second time serving in the role after a stint as prime minister under former President Roh Moo-hyun in 2007-2008. 'He has served in key posts in state affairs solely through recognition of his skills and expertise, unrelated to political factions,' Yoon said when appointing Han in 2022, echoing words used to describe him when previous administrations tapped him for key positions. 'I think Han is the right candidate to carry out national affairs while overseeing and coordinating the Cabinet, with a wealth of experience that encompasses public and private sectors.' Han has experience working with South Korea's key ally the United States, having been deeply involved in the process of signing the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement. Fluent in English, he was appointed South Korea's ambassador to the United States in 2009, working in Washington at a time when current U.S. President Joe Biden was vice president, and contributed to Congress approving the Free Trade Agreement in 2011. Han has also served as board member of S-Oil, a South Korean refining unit of Saudi Aramco. 'He is a civil servant through and through who didn't take on a political color despite working under [five presidents],' said a former high-ranking government official who declined to be identified. Han's role in leadership is expected to last for months until the Constitutional Court decides whether to remove Yoon or restore his powers. If Yoon is removed, a presidential election must be held in 60 days, until which Han will stay at the helm. The main opposition Democratic Party has filed a complaint against Han to be included in the investigations for failing to block Yoon's attempt at martial law. If parliament decides to impeach Han, the finance minister is next in line among cabinet members to serve as acting president. South Korea's Constitution does not specify how much the prime minister is empowered to do in carrying out the leadership role. Most scholars say the prime minister must exercise limited authority to the extent of preventing paralysis of state affairs and no more, although some say he can exercise all the powers of the president, as the constitution puts no restrictions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-is-han-duck-soo-south-korea-s-acting-president-after-yoon-impeachment-/7901535.html	2024-12-14T11:10:40-08:00	
Before ouster, Syria's Assad told Iran Turkey was aiding HTS rebels	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — In the final days leading to his ouster, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad complained to Iran's foreign minister that Turkey was actively supporting Sunni rebels in their offensive to topple him, two Iranian officials told Reuters this week. Five decades of rule by Assad's family ended Sunday when he fled to Moscow, where the government granted him asylum. Iran had backed Assad in Syria's long civil war, and his overthrow was widely seen as a major blow to the Iran-led 'Axis of Resistance,' a political and military alliance that opposes Israeli and U.S. influence in the Middle East. As rebel forces from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, formerly aligned to al-Qaida, seized major cities and advanced toward the capital, Assad met Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Damascus on December 2. At the meeting, Assad voiced anger over what he said was Turkey's intensified efforts to unseat him, according to a senior Iranian official. Araghchi assured Assad of Iran’s continued support and promised to raise the issue with Ankara, the official said. The next day, Araghchi met with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan to express Tehran’s deep concerns over Ankara’s support for rebel advances. 'The meeting was tense. Iran expressed its unhappiness with Turkey's alignment with U.S. and Israeli agendas and conveyed Assad's concerns,' a second Iranian official said, referring to Ankara's support for rebels and cooperation with Western and Israeli interests in targeting Iran's allies in the region. Fidan, the official said, blamed Assad for the crisis, asserting that his failure to engage in genuine peace talks and his years of oppressive rule were the root causes of the conflict. A Turkish Foreign Ministry source familiar with Fidan's talks said that those were not the exact remarks by Fidan and added that Araghchi did not bring and convey any messages from Assad to Turkey, without elaborating. Fidan told reporters in Doha, Qatar, on Sunday that the Assad regime had 'had precious time' to address Syria's existing problems but did not, instead allowing 'a slow decay and collapse of the regime.' Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday that Assad's toppling was the result of a plan by the United States and Israel. He said that one of Syria's neighbors also had a role and continues to do so. He did not name the country but appeared to be referring to Turkey. NATO member Turkey, which controls swathes of land in northern Syria after several cross-border incursions against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, was a main backer of opposition groups aiming to topple Assad since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Assad's downfall stripped Iran and the Lebanese group Hezbollah of a vital ally. Tehran's ties to Damascus had allowed Iran to spread its influence through a land corridor from its western border via Iraq all the way to Lebanon to bring arms supplies to Hezbollah. Iran spent billions of dollars propping up Assad during the war and deployed its Revolutionary Guards to Syria to keep its ally in power. Hezbollah also played a major part, sending fighters to support him, but had to bring them back to Lebanon over the last year to fight in a bruising war with Israel — a redeployment that weakened Syrian government lines.	https://www.voanews.com/a/before-ouster-syria-s-assad-told-iran-turkey-was-aiding-hts-rebels/7901509.html	2024-12-14T10:21:44-08:00	
Zelenskyy: Russia 'using Korean soldiers in Kursk'	KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that Russia has begun deploying North Korean soldiers to storm Ukrainian positions in the Kursk region. Zelenskyy said in his evening address that he had 'preliminary evidence that the Russians have begun to use soldiers from North Korea in assaults — a noticeable number of them.' He said that according to his information, 'the Russians include [North Koreans] in combined units and use them in operations in the Kursk region,' where Ukraine has been mounting an incursion since August. Zelenskyy said he has also heard that the North Koreans 'may be used in other parts of the front line,' and that 'losses among this category are also already noticeable.' Zelenskyy said last month that 11,000 North Korean troops were in Russia's western Kursk region and had already sustained 'losses.' Washington and Seoul have accused Pyongyang of sending more than 10,000 soldiers to help Moscow, after Russia and North Korea signed a landmark defense pact this summer. North Korea and Russia have strengthened their military ties since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Surprised by the Kursk incursion, Russia has since continuously clawed back territory, halting Ukraine's advance and rushing reinforcements to the region. A Ukrainian army source told AFP last month Kyiv still controlled 800 square kilometers of the Kursk region, down from previous claims it controlled almost 1,400 square kilometers. Ukraine hits Russian oil terminal Ukraine said Saturday it attacked an oil terminal in Russia's western Oryol region overnight, sparking a fire. The governor of Oryol said on Telegram that fuel caught fire at 'a facility' in the region after a 'massive drone attack.' The Ukraine military's General Staff said Kyiv's forces attacked a major oil depot in Stal’noi Kon, about 165 kilometers into Russian territory. 'It's one of the largest oil terminals in the suburbs of the city of Oryol' and is part of a 'military industrial complex' that supplies the Russian army, the General Staff said. Russian media showed images, purportedly of the attack, showing clouds of smoke billowing up into the night sky from a fire. Oryol regional Governor Andrey Klychkov said Saturday on Telegram that Russian anti-air defenses shot down Ukrainian drones during the attack and that the fire was brought under control at 5 a.m., although it had not yet been extinguished. He said there were no casualties. Other developments In Russia's Belgorod region, which also borders Ukraine, a drone attack killed a 9-year-old boy and wounded his mother and baby sister, said Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov. He posted photos of the family's home with a huge hole in the facade and the roof partially torn off. Ukraine regularly attacks military and energy infrastructure in Russia, sometimes deep into its invading neighbor's territory, in response to Russian attacks on its own infrastructure. Kyiv's General Staff said Russia attacked overnight with 132 drones, claiming 130 of them were downed or failed to reach targets. Russia's military said Saturday that it shot down 60 Ukrainian drones overnight.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-russia-using-korean-soldiers-in-kursk-/7901486.html	2024-12-14T09:53:19-08:00	
9 dead in attack on Sudan hospital, WHO says	GENEVA — An attack on the main hospital in the western Sudanese town of Al-Fashir on Friday killed nine people and wounded 20, including patients and their families, the head of the World Health Organization said. In a posting on X Saturday, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus added that 'continued attacks on health across Sudan are deplorable.' 'We urge for the protection of all patients and health professionals, and for all attacks on and around health facilities to stop,' he said. Since April 2023, Sudan has been ravaged by a war between two generals, army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. The war has left tens of thousands of civilians dead, displaced more than 11 million people, and plunged the East African country into the worst humanitarian crisis in recent years. Al-Fashir, the capital of North Darfur, has been besieged since May by the RSF, which has blocked trade and aid deliveries to the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-attack-on-sudan-hospital-who-says/7901472.html	2024-12-14T09:37:21-08:00	
Blinken: US in direct contact with Syrian rebels that ousted Assad	AQABA, JORDAN — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday that American officials have been in direct contact with the Syrian rebel group that spearheaded the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad’s government but is designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States and others. Blinken is the first U.S. official to publicly confirm contacts between the Biden administration and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which led a coalition of armed opposition groups that ousted Assad from power last Sunday. Speaking at a news conference in Aqaba, Jordan, Blinken would not discuss details of the contacts but said it was important for the United States to convey messages to the group about its conduct and how it intends to govern in a transition period. 'Yes, we have been in contact with HTS and with other parties,' Blinken said. He added that 'our message to the Syrian people is this: We want them to succeed, and we’re prepared to help them do so.' HTS, which was once an affiliate of al-Qaida, has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department since 2018. That designation carries with it severe sanctions, including a ban on the provision of any 'material support' to the group or its members. The sanctions do not, however, legally bar U.S. officials from communicating with designated groups. HTS has worked to establish security and start a political transition after seizing Damascus and has tried to reassure a public both stunned by Assad’s fall and concerned about extremist jihadis among the rebels. Insurgent leaders say the group has broken with its extremist past. The group's leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, appeared in a video message Friday congratulating 'the great Syrian people for the victory of the blessed revolution.' U.S. officials say Sharaa has been making welcome comments about protecting minority and women’s rights, but they remain skeptical that he will follow through on them in the long run. On Friday, the rebels and Syria’s unarmed opposition worked to safely turn over to U.S. officials an American man who had been imprisoned by Assad. U.S. officials are continuing their search for Austin Tice, an American journalist who disappeared 12 years ago near Damascus. 'We have impressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,' Blinken said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-us-in-direct-contact-with-syrian-rebels-that-ousted-assad/7901462.html	2024-12-14T09:21:25-08:00	
Brazilian police arrest ex-Bolsonaro Cabinet member in alleged coup plot	SAO PAULO — Brazil’s Federal Police on Saturday arrested General Walter Braga Netto, a former member of President Jair Bolsonaro’s Cabinet and his 2022 running mate, in connection with investigations into an alleged coup plot, according to a source close to the process. The source spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. Braga Netto was formally accused in November, along with Bolsonaro and 35 others, of plotting a coup to keep Bolsonaro in office following his failed 2022 reelection bid. Prosecutors have yet to file formal charges against Braga Netto. The arrest made Saturday stemmed from allegations of obstructing the collection of evidence, the Federal Police said in a statement. Local media have reported that Braga Netto sought to discover what a former Bolsonaro aide, who was arrested, was telling authorities and whether he had signed a plea bargain. Authorities also executed two search and seizure warrants. Braga Netto served as Bolsonaro’s chief of staff from 2020 to 2021 and as defense minister from 2021 to 2022. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Previously, his legal team said they would wait to review police documents before making any statements.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazilian-police-arrest-ex-bolsonaro-cabinet-member-in-alleged-coup-plot/7901449.html	2024-12-14T09:00:45-08:00	
Serbia's main gas supplier, controlled by Russia, faces US sanctions	BELGRADE, SERBIA — The United States plans to introduce sanctions against Serbia’s main gas supplier, which is controlled by Russia, Serbia’s president said Saturday. President Aleksandar Vucic told state RTS broadcaster that Serbia has been officially informed that the decision on sanctions will come into force on January 1 but that he has so far not received any related documents from the U.S. There has been no comment from U.S. officials. Serbia almost entirely depends on Russian gas, which it receives through pipelines in neighboring states. The gas is then distributed by Petroleum Industry of Serbia, which is majority-owned by Russia’s state oil monopoly Gazprom Neft. Vucic said that after receiving the official documents, 'we will talk to the Americans first, then we go talk to the Russians' to try to reverse the decision. 'At the same time, we will try to preserve our friendly relations with the Russians and not to spoil relations with those who impose sanctions.' Although formally seeking European Union membership, Serbia has refused to join Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion in Ukraine, in part because of the crucial Russian gas deliveries. Vucic said that despite the embargo threat, 'I’m not ready at this moment to discuss potential sanctions against Moscow.' Asked if the threat of U.S. sanctions against Serbia could change with the arrival of Donald Trump’s administration in January, Vucic said, 'We must first get the [official] documents, and then talk to the current administration, because we are in a hurry.' The Serbian president is facing one of the biggest threats to more than a decade of his increasingly autocratic rule. Protests have been spreading by university students and others following the collapse last month of a concrete canopy at a railway station in the country’s north that killed 15 people on November 1. Many in Serbia believe rampant corruption and nepotism among state officials led to sloppy work on the building reconstruction, which was part of a wider railroad project with Chinese state companies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbia-s-main-gas-supplier-controlled-by-russia-faces-us-sanctions/7901425.html	2024-12-14T08:32:14-08:00	
Cyclone Chido rips through Mayotte as it barrels toward eastern Africa	MORONI, COMOROS — The French territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean suffered extensive damage from Tropical Cyclone Chido, officials said Saturday, as the storm roared toward the east coast of the African continent. Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kilometers per hour, according to the French weather service, ripping metal roofs off houses in Mayotte, which has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands. There were no immediate reports of casualties. 'Our island is being hit by the most violent and destructive cyclone since 1934. Many of us have lost everything,' Mayotte Prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville said in a Facebook post Saturday. He said the highest alert had been lifted so that rescuers can help after the worst of the cyclone had passed. Mayotte is still under red alert for the ordinary population, and people were asked to 'remain confined in a solid shelter,' Bieuville said. Only emergency and security services were allowed to go out. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said Mayotte had been hit hard. 'The damages already appear to be extensive,' he said on X. 'State and local emergency services are fully mobilized.' Local broadcaster Mayotte la 1ere said that thousands of homes were without power, tin huts and other small structures had been blown away and many trees had been blown over. Retailleau said 110 rescuers and firefighters sent to Mayotte from France and the nearby territory of Reunion have been deployed and an additional reinforcement of 140 people will be sent on Sunday. The nation of Comoros, a group of islands north of Mayotte, also was being battered by Chido and the highest red alert had been announced in some areas. Authorities said they were concerned for a group of 11 fishermen who had gone out to sea on Monday and had not been heard from. Comoros authorities have ordered all ships to remain anchored in harbors and have closed the main airport and government offices. Schools were ordered closed on Friday so that people could prepare for the cyclone. Chido was expected to continue its eastern trajectory and hit Mozambique on the African mainland late Saturday or early Sunday, forecasters said. Mozambique's disaster agency has warned that 2.5 million people might be affected in the northern provinces of Cabo Delgado and Nampula. Further inland, landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe were preparing. Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs said it was expecting flooding in some parts and urgently advised some people to move to higher ground. In Zimbabwe, authorities said some people should prepare for evacuation. December through to March is cyclone season in the southeastern Indian Ocean, and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries last year. The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne cholera disease — as happened in the aftermath of Idai — as well as dengue fever and malaria. Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in southern Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to climate change, having to deal with large humanitarian crises.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cyclone-chido-rips-through-mayotte-as-it-barrels-toward-eastern-africa/7901414.html	2024-12-14T08:22:30-08:00

At least 18 killed in Israeli Gaza strikes, Palestinian medics say	At least 18 Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza Saturday, medics said, while the Israeli military said it targeted gunmen operating from shelters and aid storages. At least 10 people were killed in an airstrike near the municipality building in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, where people gathered to receive aid, medics said. Casualties were being carried by foot, on rickshaws and private cars from the site of the attack to the hospital, medics said. The strike killed the head of the Hamas-run administrative committee in central Gaza, a Hamas source said. The Israeli military was looking into the report, a spokesperson said. Earlier, Israeli aircraft struck militants and weapon caches near an aid warehouse, the military said, after gunmen fired rockets into Israel from there. A separate strike in Gaza City on a former shelter housing displaced people targeted Hamas fighters, the military said. At least seven people were killed in that attack, Palestinian medics said, including a woman and her baby. It was unclear whether any of the other people killed were fighters. The military said it had taken precautions to reduce risk of harm to civilians. A separate strike in Gaza City killed a local journalist, medics said. The military was looking into the report, a spokesperson said. The war in Gaza began when the Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed into Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities. Israel then launched an air, sea and land offensive that has killed at least 44,000 people, mostly civilians, according to authorities in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, displaced nearly the entire population and left much of the enclave in ruins. A fresh bid by Egypt, Qatar and the United States to reach a truce has gained momentum in recent weeks. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Saturday discussed with visiting U.S. officials efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and a hostages-for-prisoners deal in the Palestinian enclave, Sisi's office said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-18-killed-in-israeli-gaza-strikes-palestinian-medics-say/7901379.html	2024-12-14T07:52:59-08:00

Top diplomats from US, Arab League, Turkey discuss Syria	Top diplomats from the United States, the Arab League and Turkey are meeting in Jordan to discuss how to assist Syria’s transition after the fall of Bashar Assad's government a week ago. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken joined foreign ministers and senior officials from the European Union and United Nations in Jordan on Saturday to try to find consensus on what Syria's new leadership should prioritize. No Syrian representatives were set to attend. The collapse of the Assad family’s more than half-century of rule has sparked new fears of instability in a region already shaken by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and hostilities between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah despite a tenuous ceasefire. The United States is making a renewed push for a ceasefire in Gaza, where the war has plunged more than 2 million Palestinians into a severe humanitarian crisis. Israel’s war against Hamas has killed over 44,800 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants. The October 2023 Hamas attack that sparked the war killed some 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and around 250 others were taken hostage. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Turkey reopens its embassy in Syria Turkey reopened its embassy in Syria on Saturday, becoming the first country to do so since the end of Bashar Assad’s rule last weekend. The Syrian insurgents who overthrew Assad received vital help from Turkey. The Turkish flag was raised above the compound in Damascus for the first time since diplomatic ties were cut in 2012. The embassy suspended operations 12 years ago due to insecurity during the Syrian civil war. Several countries maintained diplomatic ties with Assad's government during the 13-year conflict, while others reopened their diplomatic missions in recent years as they sought to normalize relations. Blinken wraps up regional tour in Jordan Blinken says broad consensus exists among regional partners that Syria’s new government must be inclusive, must respect women and minority rights, reject terrorism and secure and destroy suspected Assad-era chemical weapons stockpiles. Blinken is wrapping up a three-country regional tour in Aqaba after visiting Iraq, Turkey and Jordan once already this week. Earlier Saturday in a meeting with U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pederson, Blinken said he expected to talk about the challenges ahead for Syria and 'our determination to work together to support a Syrian-led transition where the United Nations plays a critical role, particularly when it comes to the provision of assistance, to the protection of minorities.' Pederson agreed, saying: 'What is so critical in Syria is that we see a credible and inclusive political process that brings together all communities in Syria. And the second point is that we need to make sure that state institutions do not collapse, and that we get in humanitarian assistance as quickly as possible. And if we can achieve that, perhaps there is a new opportunity for the Syrian people.' In announcing Saturday’s meetings, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry said the ministers would 'discuss ways to support a comprehensive political process led by Syrians to achieve a transitional process,' which 'ensures the reconstruction of Syrian state institutions, and preserves Syria’s unity, territorial integrity, sovereignty, security, stability and the rights of all its citizens.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-diplomats-from-us-arab-league-turkey-discuss-syria/7901321.html	2024-12-14T07:00:12-08:00	
Iran sentences Iranian-American journalist to 10 years in prison	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — A court in Iran has sentenced Iranian-American journalist Reza Valizadeh to 10 years in prison after finding him guilty of collaborating with a hostile government, his lawyer said Saturday. Reza Valizadeh is a former journalist for the U.S.-government-funded Voice of America's Farsi language service and has worked for Radio Farda, an outlet under Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that is overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Mohammad Hossein Aghasi, the lawyer of Valizadeh, told The Associated Press that the Tehran Revolutionary Court issued a first-instance verdict for his client on a charge of 'collaborating with the hostile U.S. government.' Aghasi said that the verdict can be appealed within 20 days since it was delivered to them a week ago. He added that he hasn’t been able to meet with Valizadeh since the verdict was issued. In August, Valizadeh apparently posted two messages suggesting he had returned to Iran despite Radio Farda being viewed by Iran’s theocracy as a hostile outlet. 'I arrived in Tehran on March 6, 2024. Before that, I had unfinished negotiations with the [Revolutionary Guard’s] intelligence department,' the message read in part. 'Eventually I came back to my country after 13 years without any security guarantee, even a verbal one.' Aghasi said he was free during the first six months after his arrival and then was arrested. Earlier in November, Kianoosh Sanjari, a former journalist with VOA's Farsi Service, jumped to his death from a building in Iran’s capital in protest of the country’s supreme leader and an ongoing crackdown on dissent in the Islamic Republic. Iranian authorities said that Sanjari, 42, had earlier demanded the release of four prisoners held in the country and threatened to kill himself if they weren’t released. In 2007, a former Radio Farda broadcaster, Parnaz Azima, returned briefly to Iran to visit her ailing mother. Her passport was confiscated at the airport. Authorities banned her from leaving the country and summoned her repeatedly for questioning by security forces. Finally, she was freed on bail and allowed to leave the country eight months later. Iran has faced years of unrest amid wider tensions with the West, most recently with the nationwide protests that followed the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini. Jobs also remain scarce, and the country’s rial currency continues its yearslong collapse against the U.S. dollar, further straining the lives of Iranians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-sentences-iranian-american-journalist-to-10-years-in-prison/7901304.html	2024-12-14T06:17:29-08:00	
US Marines start partial transfer from Japan's Okinawa to Guam	TOKYO — The partial transfer of U.S. Marines from Okinawa to Guam began on Saturday, 12 years after Japan and the United States agreed on their realignment to reduce the heavy burden of American troop presence on the southern Japanese island, officials said. The relocation started with 100 members of III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa moving to the Pacific island for the initial logistical work, the U.S. Marine Corps and Japan's Defense Ministry said in a joint statement. Under the plan agreed between Tokyo and Washington in April 2012, about 9,000 of the 19,000 Marines currently stationed on Okinawa are to be moved out of Okinawa, including about 4,000 of them to be moved to the U.S. territory Guam in phases. Details, including the size and timing of the next transfer, were not immediately released. The Marine Corps is committed to the defense of Japan and meeting operational requirements to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific, and it will maintain presence in the region 'through a combination of stationing and rotating Marines in Japan, Guam and Hawaii,' the joint statement said. Japan has paid up to $2.8 billion for the building of infrastructure at the U.S. bases on Guam, and the United States will fund the remaining costs. The two governments will continue to cooperate on the development of Camp Blaz, which will serve as the main installation for Marines stationed in Guam. The Marines and Japan Self Defense Forces will conduct joint training in Guam, the statement said. Okinawa, which was under U.S. postwar occupation until 1972, is still home to a majority of the more than 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact, while 70% of U.S. military facilities are on Okinawa, which accounts for only 0.6% of Japanese land. Many Okinawans have long complained about the heavy U.S. military presence on the island and say Okinawa faces noise, pollution, aircraft accidents and crime related to American troops. The relocation is likely to be welcomed by residents, but how much improvement they will feel is uncertain because of the rapid Japanese military buildup on Okinawan islands as a deterrence to threats from China. The start of the Marines relocation comes at a time of growing anti-U.S. military sentiment following a series of sexual assault cases involving American servicemembers. On Thursday, a senior Air Force servicemember belonging to the Kadena Air Base was convicted of the kidnapping and sexual assault of a teenage girl last year, a case that triggered outrage on the island. The Naha District Court sentenced him to five years in prison.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-marines-start-partial-transfer-from-japan-s-okinawa-to-guam/7901262.html	2024-12-14T04:19:15-08:00	
A look at the South Korean leader who has been impeached	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's parliament has voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol, a stunning fall from grace for a man who rose from political obscurity to the height of political power. His decades of achievement could be on the verge of crumbling due to a single, baffling decision to send out troops under martial law over vague claims that one of Asia's leading democracies was under threat. The impeachment suspends Yoon's presidential powers until the Constitutional Court determines whether to dismiss him as president or restore his powers. Yoon also faces investigations meant to find whether his December 3 decree amounts to rebellion, a crime that is punished by up to the death penalty in South Korea if convicted. Yoon, a staunch conservative and longtime prosecutor, went from political novice to president of South Korea in 2022, ending five years of liberal rule that saw failed efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis and a slackening economy. His time in office, however, was marked by near-constant friction with an opposition-controlled parliament, threats of annihilation from North Korea and a series of scandals involving him and his wife. Observers said he was impulsive, took criticism personally and relied too much on the advice of hardcore loyalists. No one thing explained his attempt to shut down the mechanisms of a democratic nation over his claim that 'anti-state forces' were acting under the influence of North Korea. But there are strands in Yoon's background, and especially in the intense acrimony with the liberal opposition and his hardline standoff with North Korea, that help illuminate the defining moment of his presidency. A turbulent rise to top prosecutor Despite 2½ years as president, Yoon's career was overwhelmingly about the law, not politics. Yoon, 63, was born in Seoul to two professors, and went to prestigious Seoul National University, where he studied law. A major moment, according to Yoon, happened in 1980 when he played the role of a judge in a mock trial of then-dictator Chun Doo-hwan, who had staged a military coup the previous year, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. In the aftermath, Yoon had to flee to the countryside as Chun's military extended martial law and placed troops and armored vehicles at various places including his university. Yoon returned to the capital and eventually began a career as a state prosecutor that would last nearly three decades, building an image as strong-minded and uncompromising. Prone to confrontation But he also faced criticism that his personality was unsuited to high-level leadership. 'President Yoon isn't well-prepared, and he does things off the cuff,' Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership, said. 'He also tends to express his emotions too directly. The things that he likes and dislikes are easy to see, and he tends to handle things with a small group of his own people, not the majority of people.' During a parliament audit in 2013, Yoon, then a senior prosecutor, said he was under pressure from his boss, who said he opposed Yoon's investigation into an allegation that the country's spy agency had conducted an illicit online campaign to help conservative President Park Geun-hye win the previous year's election. At the time, he famously said, 'I'm not loyal to [high-level] people.' He was demoted, but after Park's government was toppled over a separate corruption scandal in 2017, then-President Moon Jae-in made Yoon head of a Seoul prosecution office, which investigated Park and other conservative leaders. Moon later named Yoon the nation's top prosecutor. A neophyte in politics Yoon only joined party politics about a year before he won the presidency, abandoning the liberal Moon after an impasse over a probe of Moon's allies. Moon's supporters said he was trying to thwart Moon's prosecution reforms and elevate his own political standing. The 2022 presidential race was Yoon's first election campaign. Yoon beat his rival, liberal firebrand Lee Jae-myung, by less than 1 percentage point in South Korea's most closely fought presidential election. Their campaign was one of the nastiest in recent memory. Yoon compared Lee's party to 'Hitler' and 'Mussolini.' Lee's allies called Yoon 'a beast' and 'dictator' and derided his wife's alleged plastic surgery. Domestic political strife Yoon's time as president was dominated by frustration and acrimony, much stemming from his narrow victory and his party's failure to win control of parliament throughout his term. When Yoon declared the state of emergency, he said a goal was to eliminate 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces' in an apparent reference to the opposition Democratic Party. In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon again defended his martial law decree and vowed to 'fight to the end' in the face of attempts to impeach and investigate him. He called the Democratic Party 'a monster' and 'anti-state forces' that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach top officials and undermined the government's budget bill for next year. Claims of corruption also battered his approval ratings. Yoon recently denied wrongdoing in an influence-peddling scandal involving him and his wife. Spy camera footage in a separate scandal also purportedly shows the first lady, Kim Keon Hee, accepting a luxury bag as a gift from a pastor. Choi said he thinks Yoon likely planned the 'clumsy martial law' edict to divert public attention away from the scandals. 'He tried to massively shake up the political world,' Choi said. 'But he failed. He likely believed there was no other option.' North Korea lashed out at his hard line If political squabbles and scandal set the tenor of Yoon's domestic presidency, its foreign policy was characterized by a bitter standoff with North Korea. Yoon early on in his presidency promised 'an audacious plan' to improve the North's economy if it abandoned its nuclear weapons. But things turned sour quickly, as North Korea ramped up its weapons tests and threats to attack the South. North Korea eventually began calling Yoon 'a guy with a trash-like brain' and 'a diplomatic idiot.' North Korea took that trash theme literally, sending thousands of balloons filled with garbage over the border, including some that made it to the presidential compound in Seoul at least twice. Yoon's mention of North Korea as a domestic destabilizing force reminded some of an earlier South Korea, which until the late 1980s was ruled by a series of strongmen who repeatedly invoked the threat from the North to justify effort to suppress domestic dissidents and political opponents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-look-at-the-south-korean-leader-who-has-been-impeached/7901232.html	2024-12-14T02:44:08-08:00	
Former soccer star set to become Georgia's president	TBILISI, GEORGIA — A former soccer star is set to become president of Georgia on Saturday as the ruling party consolidates its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country's European aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia. The ruling Georgian Dream party retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation by winning 89 of 150 seats in an October 26 vote widely seen as a referendum on integration into Europe. The opposition has accused Georgian Dream of rigging the vote with Moscow's help. It has boycotted parliamentary sessions and demanded new elections. In the meantime, former Premier League striker Mikheil Kavelashvili, 53, is expected to easily win Saturday's vote given the ruling party's control of a 300-seat electoral college made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures. That college replaced direct presidential election in a 2017 constitutional reform. Georgian Dream has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to 'reset' ties with Russia. In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow's recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held. Georgian Dream's decision last month to suspend talks on their country's bid to join the European Union added to the opposition's outrage and galvanized protests. Who is the current president? Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia's top diplomat in 2004. Constitutional changes made the president's job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream's support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her. 'I remain your president — there is no legitimate Parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,' she has declared on the social network X. 'My mandate continues.' Speaking to The Associated Press, Zourabichvili rejected government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence. 'We are not demanding a revolution,' Zourabichvili said. 'We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again.' 'Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen,' she said. Who's the ruling party presidential candidate? Georgian Dream nominated Kavelashvili — mocked by the opposition for lacking higher education. He was a striker in the Premier League for Manchester City and in several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People's Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric. Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc's recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the 'foreign influence' law. How did opposition protests unfold? Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on November 28. Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital's central boulevard. Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries. Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies. The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-soccer-star-set-to-become-georgia-s-president/7901222.html	2024-12-14T01:48:14-08:00	
Rights groups urge Zimbabwe’s president to sign bill abolishing death penalty	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — Rights groups are urging Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa to sign into law a bill that would abolish the death penalty, following the bill’s landmark passage Thursday by the country's senate, after earlier passage by the lower house of parliament. In an interview with VOA, Zimbabwe's justice minister, Ziyambi Ziyambi, said passage of the death abolition bill is welcomed by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who, since coming to power in 2017, has refused to sign death warrants for those facing capital punishment. 'He is a man who has not been an advocate of death penalty,' Ziyambi said. 'The passage of the bill by the senate towards Christmas is an early Christmas present to him, as he has been an advocate to say, 'We can't do this.' And that's the reason why I said he is the man who is going to appreciate the work that has been done by both houses.' Human rights groups are now calling for Mnangagwa to sign the bill, among them Lucia Masuka, the head of Amnesty International in Zimbabwe. 'Amnesty International commends the progressive legislative efforts made so far to make the abolition of the death penalty from the country’s statutes a reality,' Masuka said. 'We urge the president to take heed of this historic landmark decision by signing this bill without delay and commuting all death sentences to prison terms. The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment and has no place in our world.' In the past Mnangagwa has refused to sign some bills after parliament had passed them. But Ziyambi said that will not happen this time. 'How would I say it’s an early Christmas present if he does not want to sign it?' Ziyambi said. 'He has lived the trauma of being on death row and was saved by a technicality. He is ready to sign like yesterday.' But not everyone is happy with this latest development. One of them is Zachariah Choga, an attorney in Harare. 'I still believe adequate to search was not properly done on this regard,' he said. 'If you look at the increase in crime in Zimbabwe at the moment, especially violent crimes, robberies, armed robberies to be specific house-breaking, it's only going to escalate further with the death penalty off the table because it appeared with the death penalty on the table. It could have been the only deterrent that we had at this particular point, but now with the death penalty gone, we're going to see a rise in violent crimes of that nature.' According to Amnesty International, 24 countries across sub-Saharan Africa have abolished the death penalty for all crimes, while two additional countries have abolished it for ordinary crimes only. Zimbabwe’s last known execution was in 2005, though courts continue to impose death sentences – for cases of murder committed under aggravating circumstances. In April, all those condemned to death had their sentences commuted to life in prison by President Mnangagwa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rights-groups-urge-zimbabwe-s-president-to-sign-bill-abolishing-death-penalty/7901209.html	2024-12-14T00:39:55-08:00	
South Korea's parliament votes to impeach president over martial law order	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's parliament voted Saturday to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol as authorities investigate allegations of rebellion over his controversial Dec. 3 martial law decree that has caused huge political turmoil in the country. The National Assembly passed the motion 204-85 in a floor vote. Yoon's presidential powers and duties will be suspended after the copies of a document on the impeachment are delivered to him and to the Constitutional Court. The court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he's thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days. It was the second National Assembly vote on Yoon's impeachment motion. Last Saturday, Yoon survived an impeachment vote after most ruling party lawmakers boycotted the floor vote. Some People Power Party lawmakers had since announced their intentions to vote for Yoon's impeachment in a second vote, as public protests against Yoon intensified and his approval rating plummeted. Tens of thousands of people have braved the bitter cold and poured onto the streets of the capital, Seoul, every night for the past two weeks, calling for Yoon's ouster and arrest. They shouted slogans, sang, danced and waved K-pop light sticks. Smaller groups of Yoon's conservative supporters — still in the thousands — have also been rallying in Seoul, denouncing attempts to impeach the president. Both rallies have largely been peaceful. Yoon's martial law imposition, the first of its kind in more than four decades in South Korea, lasted only six hours, but has caused massive political tumult, halted diplomatic activities and rattled financial markets. Yoon was forced to lift his decree after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it. After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree before they withdrew after the parliament rejected it. No major violence occurred. Opposition parties and many experts accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law clause that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that by law a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no rights to suspend parliament's operations even under martial law. The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon 'committed rebellion that hurts peace on the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.' It said Yoon's mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the Constitution. In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon rejected the rebellion charges, calling his martial law order an act of governance. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it 'a monster' and 'anti-state forces' that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach top officials and undermined the government's budget bill for next year. 'I will fight to the end to prevent the forces and criminal groups that have been responsible for paralyzing the country's government and disrupting the nation's constitutional order from threatening the future of the Republic of Korea,' Yoon said. Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoon's speech a 'mad declaration of war' against his own people. The Democratic Party and five other opposition parties control the 300-member unicameral parliament with a combined 192 seats, but they were eight seats shy of the two-thirds majority needed to pass Yoon's impeachment motion and needed support from ruling party lawmakers. Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea, as law enforcement authorities are investigating whether he and others involved in the martial law declaration committed rebellion, abuse of power and other crimes. If convicted, the leader of a rebellion plot can face the death penalty or life imprisonment. Yoon has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesn't extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. Yoon's defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul's metropolitan police agency have been arrested over their roles in the martial law case. Other senior military and government officials also face investigations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-parliament-votes-to-impeach-president-over-martial-law-order-/7901206.html	2024-12-14T00:32:35-08:00	
Nutrition experts weigh in on US dietary guidelines	Americans should eat more beans, peas and lentils and cut back on red and processed meats and starchy vegetables, all while continuing to limit added sugars, sodium and saturated fat. That's the advice released Tuesday by a panel of nutrition experts charged with counseling the U.S. government about the 2025 edition of the dietary guidelines that will form the cornerstone of federal food programs and policy. But the 20-member panel didn't weigh in on the growing role of ultraprocessed foods that have been linked to health problems, saying there's not enough evidence to tell people to avoid them. And the group steered clear of updating controversial guidance on alcohol consumption, leaving that analysis to two outside reports expected to be released soon. Overall, the recommendations for the 2025-30 Dietary Guidelines for Americans sound familiar, said Marion Nestle, a food policy expert. 'This looks like every other set of dietary guidelines since 1980: eat your veggies and reduce consumption of foods high in salt, sugar and saturated fat,' Nestle said in an email. 'This particular statement says nothing about balancing calories, when overconsumption of calories, especially from ultra-processed foods, is the biggest challenge to the health of Americans.' What the scientific panel said about healthy diets The nutrition panel concluded that a healthy diet for people aged 2 years and older is higher in vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish and vegetable oils that are higher in unsaturated fat. It is lower in red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, refined grains and saturated fat. It may also include fat-free or low-fat dairy and foods lower in sodium and may include plant-based foods. The panel, which met for nearly two years, was the first to focus on the dietary needs of Americans through what they called a 'health equity lens,' said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a Massachusetts General Hospital obesity expert who was part of the group. That meant considering factors such as household income, race, ethnicity and culture when recommending healthy diets. It will help ensure that the guidance 'reflects and includes various population groups,' she said in an email. The panel didn't come to conclusions on ultraprocessed foods or alcohol Ultraprocessed foods include the snacks, sugary cereals and frozen meals that make up about 60% of the American diet. The panel considered more than 40 studies, including several that showed links between ultraprocessed foods and becoming overweight or developing obesity. But the nutrition experts had concerns with the quality of the research, leaving them to conclude that the evidence was too limited to make recommendations. That decision is likely to bump up against the views of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nominee to lead the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, who has questioned potential conflicts of interest among members of the dietary guidelines panel and vowed to crack down on ultraprocessed foods that contribute to chronic disease. The panel also didn't revise recommendations that suggest limiting alcohol intake to two drinks or less a day for men and one drink or less a day for women. In 2020, the last time the guidance was updated, the government rejected the advice of scientific advisers to recommend less alcohol consumption. Two groups — the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine and a committee of the government agency that oversees substance abuse — are expected to release reports in the coming months on the effects of moderate alcohol use to inform the guidelines. Do Americans follow dietary guidelines? The advisory panel acknowledged that the diets of most Americans don't meet the current guidelines. More than half of all U.S. adults have one or more diet-related chronic health conditions and 18 million U.S. households have insecure sources of food, according to the report. 'Nutrition-related chronic health conditions and their precursors continue to threaten health through the lifespan,' the report concludes. 'Which does not bode well for the future of health in the United States.' What happens next? The scientific report informs the dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years. Tuesday's recommendations now go to HHS and the Agriculture Department, where officials will draft the final guidance set for release next year. Starting Wednesday, the public will have 60 days to comment on the guidance. HHS and USDA officials will hold a public meeting January 16 to discuss the recommendations. The new guidance, which will be finalized by the incoming Trump administration, is consistent with decades of federal efforts to reduce diet-related disease in the U.S., said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest. 'Broadly, I think these are well-formulated recommendations that the incoming administration would do well to adopt,' Lurie said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nutrition-experts-weigh-in-on-us-dietary-guidelines/7898473.html	2024-12-13T23:43:19-08:00	
New Zealander who doesn’t speak Spanish wins Spanish world Scrabble title	WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND — A New Zealand man playing his first-ever competitive Scrabble game in Spanish, a language he doesn't speak, has won the board game's Spanish-language world title. Nigel Richards, a professional player who holds five English-language world titles, won the Spanish world Scrabble championships in Granada, Spain, in November, losing one game out of 24. Richards started memorizing the language's Scrabble word list a year ago, his friend Liz Fagerlund -– a New Zealand Scrabble official -– told The Associated Press. 'He can't understand why other people can't just do the same thing,' she said. 'He can look at a block of words together, and once they go into his brain as a picture he can just recall that very easily.' In second place was defending champion Benjamín Olaizola of Argentina, who won 18 of his games. Nothing like the New Zealander's feat had ever happened in Spanish Scrabble, said Alejandro Terenzani, a contest organizer. 'It was impossible to react negatively, you can only be amazed,' Terenzani said. 'We certainly expected that he would perform well, but it is perhaps true that he surpassed our expectations.' Richards has done this before. In 2015, he became the French language Scrabble world champion, despite not speaking French, after studying the word list for nine weeks. He took the French title again in 2018. Recognized in international Scrabble over his three-decade career as the greatest player of all time, Richards' Spanish language victory was notable even by his standards, other players said. While compensating for different tile values in English and Spanish Scrabble, Richards also had to contend with thousands of additional seven, eight and nine letter words in the Spanish language -– which demand a different strategy. Richards in 2008 was the first player ever to hold the world, U.S. and British titles simultaneously, despite having to 'forget' 40,000 English words that do not appear in the American Scrabble word list to triumph in the U.S. His victories are legendary in the Scrabble community, and games analyzed in YouTube videos watched by tens of thousands. Scrabble does not require players to know the definitions of words, only what combinations of letters are allowed in a country's version of the game, but native speakers have 'a huge leg up,' American Scrabble player Will Anderson said in a video summarizing Richards' Spanish win. Richards' mother, Adrienne Fischer, told a New Zealand newspaper in 2010 that he did not excel at English in school, never attended university and took a mathematical approach to the game rather than a linguistic one. 'I don't think he's ever read a book, apart from the dictionary,' she said. Fagerlund said Richards impressed her when he arrived at his first Scrabble club meeting at age 28. Two years later, in 1997, he cycled 350 kilometers from Christchurch to the city of Dunedin, won the New Zealand title on his first attempt and cycled home again. At the Spanish event he was shy and modest, organizer Terenzani said, but happily posed for photos and spoke with fans who approached him. 'Although he did so in English, of course,' Terenzani added. What motivates Richards, who now lives in Malaysia, is a mystery. He never speaks to reporters. 'I get lots of requests from journalists wanting to interview him and he's not interested,' Fagerlund said. 'He doesn't understand what all the hoo-ha is about.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealander-who-doesn-t-speak-spanish-wins-spanish-world-scrabble-title-/7898420.html	2024-12-13T23:42:39-08:00	
Popular actor in southern India is freed on bail in stampede case	NEW DELHI — A popular actor in southern India was released from jail on bail on Saturday, a day after he was arrested by police in connection with a stampede that led to the death of a woman at the premiere of his movie earlier this month. A 35-year-old woman died and her 8-year-old son was critically injured in the stampede, which occurred during the screening of Allu Arjun's release for Pushpa 2: The Rule in southern Telangana state's Hyderabad city on December 4. Arjun was arrested after the woman's husband filed a case against him, his security team and the theater's management for not informing police of the actor's plan to attend the screening, which resulted in a larger-than-expected crowd. Police charged the actor, his security team and the theater's management staff with culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Police have already arrested the theater's owner and two of his employees in connection with the case. A local court on Friday ordered the actor to spend 14 days in jail, but within hours the Telangana High Court granted him bail. However, the actor had to spend the night in jail because prison authorities did not receive a copy of the bail until late Friday, the Press Trust of India reported. The accident happened after the 41-year-old actor made a surprise appearance at a local theater where the movie was being screened. As his fans surged toward the venue, the theater's main gate collapsed, resulting in the stampede. The actor did not comment on the police charges or his arrest. But shortly after the accident, Arjun wrote on the social platform X that he was 'heartbroken by the tragic incident.' He later announced financial assistance of $29,000 for the woman's family and promised to take care of the medical expenses for her injured son. Deadly stampedes are relatively common in India, where large crowds gather in small areas with shoddy infrastructure and few crowd safety measures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/popular-actor-in-southern-india-is-freed-on-bail-in-stampede-case/7901191.html	2024-12-13T23:41:19-08:00	
Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup. But when exactly?	ZURICH — Saudi Arabia scored a major win in its campaign to attract major sports events to the kingdom when it was formally appointed as the 2034 World Cup host on Wednesday. Still, many questions remain about the tournament as well as the 2030 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by Spain, Portugal and Morocco, with three games in South America. Here are some of the key issues that need to be answered over the next decade: Where will games be played? Saudi Arabia proposes 15 stadiums — eight still on paper — in five cities: Eight in the capital Riyadh, four in the Red Sea port city Jeddah, and one each in Abha, Al Khobar and Neom, the planned futuristic mega-project. Each would have at least 40,000 seats for World Cup games. The opening game and final are set for a 92,000-seat venue planned in Riyadh. Some designs are vivid. In Neom, the stadium is planned 350 meters above street level and one near Riyadh is designed to be atop a 200-meter cliff with a retractable wall of LED screens. Saudi Arabia aims to host all 104 games, though there has been speculation that some games could be played in neighboring or nearby countries. When will the World Cup be played? Surely not in the traditional World Cup period of June-July, when temperatures in Saudi Arabia routinely exceed 40 Celsius. FIFA moved the Qatar-hosted World Cup to November-December 2022, though those dates were not loved by most European clubs and leagues whose seasons were interrupted. Also, that slot is complicated in 2034 by the holy month of Ramadan through mid-December and Riyadh hosting the multi-sport Asian Games. January 2034 could be a possibility even though that would be just before the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. The International Olympic Committee has signaled it won't be opposed to back-to-back major events. In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Saudi World Cup bid official Hammad Albalawi said the precise dates of the tournament are up the world football body. 'That's a decision by FIFA. We stand ready to be part of this conversation. But ultimately it's a FIFA decision together with the confederations,' Albalawi said. Will stadiums be segregated for men and women? Giving more rights and freedoms to women in a traditionally conservative society is fundamental to Saudi messaging around the modernization program known as Vision 2030. The kingdom decided in 2017 to let women attend sports events, initially in major cities and in family zones separate from men-only sections. By 2034, at the promised pace of social reforms, female fans should not be restricted. Saudi Arabia launched a women's professional football league in 2022 with players joining from clubs in Europe. They face no restrictions playing in shorts and with hair uncovered. Will alcohol be allowed at the venues or hotels? The Saudi prohibition of alcohol is clear and understood before FIFA signs any sponsor deals for 2034. But will there be any exceptions? The alcohol issue was problematic for the World Cup in Qatar because the expectation was created that beer sales would be allowed at stadiums even before Qatar won its bid in 2010. One year later, FIFA extended a long-time deal to have Budweiser as the official World Cup beer through 2022. Qatar then backtracked on that promise three days before the first game, causing confusion and the sense of a promise broken. In Qatar, alcohol was served only at luxury suites at the stadiums. Visitors could also have a drink in some hotel bars. But Saudi Arabia has even stricter rules on alcohol — and there is no indication that will change. Albalawi noted that Saudi Arabia has successfully hosted dozens of sports events where alcohol wasn't served. 'We're creating a safe and secure family environment for fans to bring their families into our stadiums,' he said. How will workers rights be protected? Saudi promises to reform and enforce labor laws, and fully respect migrant workers, have been accepted by FIFA but face broad skepticism from rights groups and trade unions. A formal complaint is being investigated by the U.N.-backed International Labor Organization. Protecting the migrant workers needed to build stadiums and other tournament projects — a decade after it was a defining issue for Qatar — looms as a signature challenge for Saudi Arabia. Would Israel be allowed to play if it qualified for the 2034 World Cup? Saudi-Israeli relations had been improving when FIFA all but gave the 2034 World Cup to the kingdom on October 4 last year. Three days later Hamas attacked Israel and diplomacy got more complicated. Any football federation bidding to host a FIFA tournament accepts a basic principle that whichever team qualifies is welcome. That did not stop Indonesia putting up barriers last year to Israel coming for the men's Under-20 World Cup. Indonesia does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel which had qualified through a European tournament nine months before the issue flared. FIFA moved the entire tournament to Argentina and the Israeli team reached the semifinals. Israel played at the 1970 World Cup but has never advanced through qualifying in Europe, where it has been a member of UEFA for 30 years. Europe should have 16 places in the 48-team World Cup in Saudi Arabia. Where will the final of the 2030 World Cup be played? Most of the attention at the FIFA Congress on Wednesday was on the Saudi decision, but the football body and its members also formally approved the hosts of the 2030 World Cup — the most spread out and longest ever. One game each in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, the original host in 1930, will be played from June 8-9. The tournament resumes four days later for the other 101 games shared between Spain, Portugal and Morocco. Six countries, three continents, multiple languages and currencies. Fans traveling on planes, trains, automobiles and boats across about 14 kilometers of water between Spain and Morocco. The final is due on July 21, 2030, and a decision on where it will be played could cause some tension between the host countries. Morocco wants it in the world's biggest football venue — the planned 115,000-seat King Hassan II Stadium in Casablanca. Spain, meanwhile, has proposed to host the final in either of the remodeled home stadiums of club giants Real Madrid or Barcelona.	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-arabia-will-host-the-2034-world-cup-but-when-exactly-/7901176.html	2024-12-13T21:56:12-08:00	
President Macron names centrist ally Bayrou as France's next prime minister	PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday named centrist ally François Bayrou as prime minister in an effort to address the country's deep political crisis, after a historic parliamentary vote ousted the previous government last week. Bayrou, 73, a crucial partner in Macron’s centrist alliance, has been a well-known figure in French politics for decades. His political experience is seen as key in efforts to restore stability as no single party holds a majority at the National Assembly. Macron’s office said in a statement that Bayrou 'has been charged with forming a new government.' Former Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned last week following a no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes in the National Assembly, leaving France without a functioning government. Macron in an address to the nation vowed to remain in office until his term ends in 2027. Bayrou vows to seek 'needed reconciliation' During the handover ceremony, Bayrou said that 'no one knows the difficulty of the situation better' than he does. 'I’ve taken reckless risks all along my political life to raise the issue of debt and deficits in the most important elections,' he said. France is under pressure from the European Union’s executive body and financial markets to reduce its colossal debt, estimated to reach 6% of its gross domestic product this year. 'I know that the risks of difficulties are much greater than the chances of success,' Bayrou said, adding that he hopes to lead the country towards a 'needed reconciliation.' 'I think this is the only possible path to success,' he said. Bayrou is expected to hold talks with political leaders from various parties in the coming days in order to choose new ministers. Difficult political challenge The task before him is challenging as Macron’s centrist alliance does not have a majority in parliament and Bayrou’s Cabinet will need to rely on moderate lawmakers from both the left and right to be able to stay in power. Some conservatives are expected to be part of the new government. Macron’s strategy aims at preventing far-right leader Marine Le Pen from holding 'make or break' power over the government. Le Pen helped oust Barnier by joining her National Rally party’s forces to the left to pass the no-confidence motion last week. Le Pen said on Friday that her party will adopt a wait-and-see approach for now and called on Bayrou to 'hear' her voters' demands, including preserving their purchasing power. Bayrou’s appointment comes also in line with Macron’s efforts to build a non-aggression pact with the Socialists so that they wouldn't support any future move to topple the new government. The Socialists said Friday they would not take part in the new Cabinet but did not rule out possible 'compromises' regarding policies. They asked Bayrou for a commitment not to use a special constitutional power to pass a law without a vote at parliament. 'We expect you to provide the guarantees needed to avoid another no-confidence vote,' the party wrote in a letter to Bayrou. Weighty partner Bayrou leads the centrist Democratic Movement, known as MoDem, which he founded in 2007. In 2017, he supported Macron’s first presidential bid and became a weighty partner in the French president’s centrist alliance. At the time, he was appointed justice minister, but he quickly resigned from the government amid an investigation into the MoDem’s alleged embezzlement of European Parliament funds. He this year was cleared in the case by a Paris court, which found eight other party officials guilty and sentenced the party to pay a fine. Bayrou became well known to the French public when he was education minister from 1993-97 in a conservative government. Three-time presidential candidate Bayrou was three times a candidate for president, in 2002, 2007 and 2012, which made him a familiar face in French politics. His name had repeatedly surfaced as a potential prime minister in the past, but he was repeatedly passed over. He is widely considered having helped lay the groundwork for Macron’s rise to power in 2017. Long before the French president upended the country's politics by crushing the traditional right and left, Bayrou tapped into voter frustration with entrenched conservative and Socialist camps. A father of six and a practicing Catholic, Bayrou has played up his rural farming roots in the Pyrenees mountains, showing off his knowledge of tractors and cattle-raising — even while spending most of his time in the corridors of political power in Paris.	https://www.voanews.com/a/president-macron-names-centrist-ally-bayrou-as-france-s-next-prime-minister/7901159.html	2024-12-13T19:32:06-08:00	
Indonesia still eyes BRICS membership despite Trump tariff threat	Jakarta, indonesia — Indonesia remains cautiously determined to join BRICS despite a threat from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to double tariffs on members of the Russia- and China-led bloc if it pursues its stated goal of establishing an alternative to the U.S. dollar in international trade. At a parliament meeting this month with the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, legislators expressed their concern about Trump's threats. 'Although we are confident in expanding our diplomatic relations, Indonesia's presence in BRICS may be considered as a departure from traditional trade relations with U.S. and the European Union,' said Sumail Abdullah, a ruling party legislator with a role in foreign affairs. 'Don't let this become a reality, because countries like Russia and China will certainly dominate BRICS.' Foreign Minister Sugiono defended his decision to join BRICS, arguing that there are many benefits to being a member. 'Essentially, BRICS is a good platform that we can utilize as our vessel to discuss and bring forward the interests of developing countries. It is also an implementation of our independent and active foreign policy,' he told legislators at the December 2 session. Sugiono stressed the importance of strengthening Indonesia's economy by building food and energy security and developing downstream industries. Indonesia, he added, should be less reliant economically on other countries so it can better decide its own foreign policy. Although the BRICS countries have made it a goal to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar as an exchange currency, Sugiono said the issue was not brought up during the October 2024 BRICS Summit in Russia. However, the minister left the door open to reconsidering the decision in light of Trump's threat. 'If we think there are things that could harm our national interests, then we can review our membership in BRICS. What is important is that our attempt to join any multilateral group is focused towards maintaining our national interests,' he told the legislators. Indonesia's journey to join BRICS BRICS is a global economic cooperation organization that was formed in 2006 to focus attention on investment opportunities among its founding countries: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Indonesia expressed its desire to join the bloc at the October summit in Kazan, Russia, where Sugiono proposed several concrete steps to strengthen BRICS and Global South cooperation. President Prabowo Subianto has repeatedly underlined his intention to befriend both China and the United States, saying Indonesia will not join any military bloc. Teuku Rezasyah, a professor specializing in diplomacy and foreign policy at Universitas Padjadjaran, told VOA that joining BRICS places Indonesia in the geopolitical center between the rival power blocs. 'We're not only close with the U.S., the European Union, but also getting closer with Russia and China. As a result, we have more bargaining power, which will benefit us,' he said at a national seminar. Teuku argued that the shared BRICS vision, as laid out in a 2021 joint statement, calls for a restructured global political, economic and financial architecture with a reformed United Nations at its center. He said this vision reflects a contemporary world that is more equitable, balanced and representative. Political benefits, challenges Although Indonesia has been invited to become a BRICS member since 2022, it did not officially express its intention until this October. Indonesia is currently a BRICS partner country, a status that applies to 12 other countries, including fellow ASEAN states Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. Teuku said the organization 'is commonly understood as an attempt to form a geopolitical bloc capable of counterbalancing the influence of Western-dominated global institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.' Muhsin Shihab, an expert adviser on institutional relations at Indonesia's foreign ministry, said in November that by joining BRICS, Indonesia can increase its global clout and can help to shape the agenda of the Global South. But Tobias Basuki, co-founder of Aristoteles Consults, a political consultancy and legal services firm, said in an interview with VOA that he doubted Indonesia would gain much from joining the bloc because most of its political and economic goals can be achieved through bilateral ties with the BRICS members. Russia and China have more to gain from expanding the group's membership, he said, adding that they 'have their own agenda and interests, which are not necessarily always aligned with the Global South's needs and interests. 'So by joining BRICS, you're actually entering their playground. It may not give Indonesia the position that Prabowo wants to be as a bridge-maker between the two competing powers.' Basuki said that 'if Indonesia wants to be a leader of the Global South, then it's better to revive the [Indonesia-led] Asia-Africa conference and Non-Aligned Movement, which already has 120 countries, a true reflection of a Global South alliance.' Apart from joining BRICS, Indonesia is also seeking membership at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which signals its ambition to align with global standards of governance and economic openness.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-still-eyes-brics-membership-despite-trump-tariff-threat-/7901154.html	2024-12-13T19:15:56-08:00	
Nancy Pelosi hospitalized after fall on official trip to Luxembourg	WASHINGTON — Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been hospitalized after she 'sustained an injury' during an official engagement in Luxembourg, according to a spokesperson. Pelosi, 84, was in Europe with a bipartisan congressional delegation to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in World War II. Her spokesperson, Ian Krager, said in a statement that she is 'currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals' and is unable to attend the remainder of events on her trip. He did not describe the nature of her injury or give any additional details, but a person familiar with the incident said that Pelosi tripped and fell while at an event with the other members of Congress. Another person familiar with the situation said she injured her hip. The people requested anonymity to discuss the fall because they were not authorized to speak about it publicly. Krager said that Pelosi 'looks forward to returning home to the U.S. soon.' Among the members on the trip was Representative Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, who posted on social media that he was 'praying for a speedy recovery' for Pelosi. The two lawmakers were captured holding hands in a group photo Friday at the U.S. Embassy in Luxembourg. 'I’m disappointed Speaker Emerita Pelosi won’t be able to join the rest of our delegation’s events this weekend as I know how much she looked forward to honoring our veterans,' McCaul wrote on X. 'But she is strong, and I am confident she will be back on her feet in no time.' The former leader's fall comes two years after her husband, Paul, was attacked by a man with a hammer at their San Francisco home. The man, who was sentenced in October to 30 years in federal prison, broke into their home looking for Pelosi. Pelosi, who was first elected in 1987 and served as speaker twice, stepped down from her leadership post two years ago but remained in Congress and was re-elected to represent her San Francisco district in November. She has remained active in the two years since she left the top job, working with Democrats in private and in public and attending official events. Last summer, she was instrumental in her party's behind the scenes push to urge President Joe Biden to leave the presidential ticket. She attended the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington last weekend and was on the Senate floor Monday to attend the swearing in of her former Democratic House colleagues, Adam Schiff of California and Andy Kim of New Jersey. Earlier this week, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, 82, tripped and fell in the Senate, spraining his wrist and cutting his face. McConnell, who is stepping down from his leadership post at the end of the year, missed Senate votes on Thursday after experiencing some stiffness in his leg from the fall, his office said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nancy-pelosi-hospitalized-after-fall-on-official-trip-to-luxembourg/7901153.html	2024-12-13T19:14:42-08:00	
Syrian refugees in Somalia hope to return home	MOGADISHU, SOMALIA/WASHINGTON — Expressing a renewed desire to return to their homeland, some Syrian refugees residing Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, are hopeful that recent developments, including the ousting of the Assad family regime that brutally ruled Syria for 53 years, might signal a safer future in Syria. Since the Syrian civil war broke out more than a decade ago, Syrians have fled to countries in the Middle East and Europe, as well as to African countries that have been grappling with instability. Many Syrian refugees found themselves in Somalia, a war-torn nation in the Horn of Africa that has faced terrorist attacks, piracy and humanitarian crises. On Wednesday, dozens of Syrian refugees in Mogadishu staged a demonstration marked with emotional speeches to celebrate the fall of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Holding placards that read 'We want to go home' and 'Syria awaits us,' the demonstrators expressed their longing for peace and stability in their homeland. Some of them shared their stories with VOA. 'We are victorious because of the free Syrian army. Those in control [Syrian rebels] now are God-abiding people, not the ousted and strayed al-Assad,' said Hussein Hikmat, a refugee from Damascus. 'Here, Somalis welcomed us and supported us, but we will go back to our country.' Ali Al-Zahir, who fled from Aleppo, Syria's largest city, lost his wife and three children in the Syrian war. He arrived in Mogadishu in hopes of keeping his two surviving children safe. 'I am your brother from Aleppo, a city that suffered at the hands of al-Assad and his predator regime. Syria is free today, and free soldiers control it. I swear to God I want to return to my country,' he said, in tears, reflecting on his deep desire to reunite with his homeland. Syrian refugee Khadija Mohamed sells perfumes and tusbah, prayer beads used in Islamic practices, in Mogadishu. While she is hopeful about returning to Syria, she acknowledges the challenges her impoverished family faces. 'The situation in Syria is good. Bashar al-Assad is gone, and now Syria is in safe hands,' Mohamed said. 'I have lived in Somalia for two years with my husband and kids. We want to return, but our current situation does not allow us to do so.' Fatima Mohamed, another refugee, shared a cautious outlook. 'The situation in Syria is improving, and many places are free,' she said. 'It is not entirely stable yet. We hear that some of the Syrian prisoners arrested by the Assad regime are still in underground jails,' she added, pointing out that conditions would need to be less volatile for her to consider returning home. Like Fatima Mohamed, many Syrian refugees remain cautious despite their longing to return home. Somali officials who spoke at the demonstrations have acknowledged the refugees' wishes and said they were working with international organizations to assess the situation in Syria and facilitate safe returns. There is no official data on the number of Syrian refugees living in Somalia, but officials estimate it to be in the thousands. Syrians who found refuge in Somalia said the two countries' history of amicable relations drove them. The Syrians say Somalis' friendliness toward refugees and Somalia's lack of visa restrictions also drew them to Mogadishu and other major cities in the country. In return, the Syrian refugees, which include doctors, nurses, engineers, chefs, technicians, and teachers among their ranks, have enriched Somalia culturally and economically because of the knowledge and skillsets they brought with them. This story originated in VOA's Somali Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-refugees-in-somalia-hope-to-return-home/7901147.html	2024-12-13T19:03:20-08:00	
What happened to Iranian proxies in Syria?	WASHINGTON — They were part of Iran's 'Axis of Resistance' — Syria-based proxy groups created to defend the former Assad regime as part of Iran's campaign to expand its influence across the Middle East. The Fatemiyoun Brigade was made up of Afghan Shiites brought in from Iran; the Zainebiyoun Brigade was composed of their Pakistani religious cohorts. At the height of the Syrian civil war, the two groups fought in major battles, helping Syrian forces to reclaim lost territory from the Islamic State group (IS), including Palmyra and Aleppo in 2016 and Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor in 2017. But when a coalition of anti-Assad rebels swept the country in recent weeks, most abandoned their posts and fled, according to news accounts and researchers who follow these groups. 'They folded so quickly that central bases that I knew for a fact were surrounded by at least 1,000 of these guys were empty,' said Phillip Smyth, who has researched Iranian proxy groups for nearly 20 years. Their whereabouts remain uncertain. But experts say Iran is unlikely to disband them at a time when Hamas and Hezbollah — two other members of the Axis of Resistance — are reeling from devastating Israeli strikes. 'They need forces like this,' Smyth said in an interview, referring to Iran. 'They can no longer rely on Lebanese Hezbollah. They can no longer rely on a lot of other regional partners, so I think if we look at this, they kind of have to not only keep it going, but they're going to have to probably develop it in a different way.' Origins The Fatemiyoun and the Zainebiyoun emerged in the early years of the Syrian civil war as the fundamentalist Sunni IS began threatening the Assad regime and targeting Shiite shrines in Syria and other Shiite sites. The Fatemiyoun started in 2012 with just a handful of Afghan Shiite volunteers. Some had fought in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and the 1990s Afghan civil war, while others were living as refugees in Syria. Initially fighting alongside other pro-Assad militias in Syria, they emerged as an independent group in 2013, largely led by Iranian military commanders, according to Smyth. The Pakistani Zainebiyoun, the smaller of the two groups, was initially part of the Afghan Fatemiyoun, according to Smyth. But the Pakistanis didn't always 'mesh' with the Afghans, so Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) decided to split them off, according to Smyth. Despite initial denials, the IRGC's involvement in recruiting, arming, training and funding the two militias was an open secret, according to researchers. The IRGC used a combination of incentives and coercion to recruit Afghan refugees and migrants. Undocumented Afghans were offered money and the promise of legal status. Some were pulled out of prisons and were promised that their criminal records would be expunged if they joined the Fatemiyoun, according to Smyth. Others were religiously and ideologically motivated, determined to defend Shiite shrines against IS. Many Afghans and Pakistanis were recruited from religious seminaries in Iran. The recruitment effort extended to Afghanistan and Pakistan, where Iran-allied Shiite groups enlisted volunteers, drawing fire from the authorities. According to Fakhar Hayat Kakakhel, a researcher on militant outfits in Pakistan, many Zainebiyoun members were recruited from Pakistan's Shiite-dominated Kurram tribal district, Gilgit region, southern Punjab and the Hazara population in Quetta. As the civil war intensified and IS emerged as a potent force, the ranks of the two groups swelled. In 2015, a news outlet affiliated with the general staff of the Iranian armed forces reported that the Fatemiyoun had been upgraded from a brigade to a division, suggesting it had between 10,000 and 20,000 soldiers. Smyth estimates their number more conservatively at 5,000 to 10,000. The Zainebiyoun was about half that size with 2,500 to 4,000 fighters, according to Smyth. Role in Syrian civil war The two groups played a significant role during the Syrian civil war, serving as key pillars of support for the Assad regime. At various points during the conflict, they operated across nearly all of Syria's governorates, said Muaz Al Abdullah, Middle East research manager at Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), an independent research group. Their mission, according to Abdullah, was 'to retake control of areas from IS and then to defend the Syrian government military and pro-government military bases.' Members of the Fatemiyoun and Zainebiyoun also participated in battles in Aleppo and southern Syria, Abdullah said. In 2018, a Fatemiyoun official said that 2,000 of its own fighters had been killed and 8,000 wounded. No figures on Zainebiyoun casualties are available. Smyth said the Fatemiyoun were often used as 'cannon fodder.' 'Let's say Lebanese Hezbollah needed to be used a little bit more readily in Lebanon, then they could pull out, leave some command elements on the ground to control Fatemiyoun, and then have the Fatemiyoun guys there,' Smyth said. Final days of Assad regime In recent years, as the Assad regime consolidated its control over much of the country, the number of militia forces fighting in Syria dwindled. Yet even before the Assad regime's fall, there were still 2,500 to 5,000 Fatemiyoun and Zainebiyoun fighters in Syria, Smyth said. Mostly concentrated in northeastern Syria, smaller forces operated in Damascus, and some were occasionally deployed to Aleppo and other parts of the country, he said. As the rebels began their surprise offensive late last month, some experts predicted a fierce battle for Damascus, expecting the IRGC and its proxies to defend the regime. Videos circulated by Iraqi militia last week showed the Fatemiyoun around the shrine of Zainab outside Damascus. 'Some of them were claiming these Fatemiyoun want to stay and defend the shrine. They're not getting ready to leave,' Smyth said. On Iranian television, IRGC officials echoed that message. They were saying 'don't worry, our boys, the guys we trained … were fighting very, very hard,' Smyth said. 'I haven't seen any evidence of that. There are no casualty lists. There is no claim of what was going on.' Instead, anti-government rebels found abandoned bases, capturing the scene on video. One video shows an armed rebel fighter inside a former Fatemiyoun base shouting 'Khomeini's pigs' as he rips out Fatemiyoun and Iranian flags. Another shows a larger base in Idlib with walls painted with the Fatemiyoun flag and ransacked rooms with Persian language posters and signs scattered around. Where they went remains uncertain. Iranian officials haven't commented, but news reports have indicated that some were flown to Iran along with IRGC forces. Others are said to have crossed into neighboring Iraq or followed fleeing Hezbollah forces into Lebanon. Smyth speculates that some remnants of the two groups might still be in Syria, awaiting evacuation. However, a return to Afghanistan and Pakistan seems improbable, given that authorities have cracked down on returning fighters.

China's Xi to attend Macau 25th handover anniversary next week, state media says	Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit Macau next week for a gathering marking 25 years since the former Portuguese colony's handover to China, state news agency Xinhua said Saturday. Xi will also attend the inauguration of Macau's incoming administration and conduct an inspection tour during the December 18-20 visit, according to Xinhua. Macau grew into a trading post with a mixed Portuguese-Chinese population and cultural heritage during 442 years of colonial rule before it was handed over to China on December 20, 1999. The city has since become the world's top casino hub by gaming revenue and a popular destination for Chinese tourists. It is the only place in China where casino gambling is allowed. Like neighboring Hong Kong, Macau operates under a 'One Country, Two Systems' framework that promises a high degree of autonomy, its own legal system and stronger safeguards for civil liberties than on the mainland. Former top judge Sam Hou-fai will be sworn in as Macau's next leader on December 20, replacing Ho Iat-seng. Sam was the sole candidate in an election where only 400 pro-establishment figures — out of the city's nearly 700,000 people — were eligible to vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-to-attend-macau-25th-handover-anniversary-next-week-state-media-says/7901143.html	2024-12-13T18:29:16-08:00	
Political turmoil casts uncertainty over South Korea's role in Indo-Pacific	WASHINGTON — The cancellation of an international forum in South Korea on Friday is feeding concerns that a carefully constructed multilateral partnership aiming at countering China could be in jeopardy if efforts to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol are successful. The rules-based maritime order was among the topics to have been discussed at the South Korea and Australia-hosted Indo-Pacific High-Level Forum, which has been postponed until further notice while Seoul deals with its political crisis. The forum was to have convened government representatives from 13 countries to discuss Indo-Pacific strategies, according to a statement issued by the South Korean Foreign Ministry on December 3. That night, Seoul was plunged into political chaos when South Korean President Yoon declared martial law and then rescinded it hours later. Opposition parties Thursday filed a second motion to impeach Yoon after a previous impeachment attempt failed. In a televised speech Thursday, Yoon vowed to 'fight to the end' while opposition parties prepared for the next impeachment vote on Saturday over what they call Yoon's 'insurrectionary acts.' Uncertainty over South Korea's role Some analysts say progress on Indo-Pacific security under Yoon's leadership, especially South Korea's ties with the Philippines and Japan, could be reversed if Yoon is forced from office, leading to the election of a new government. 'If a government comes in that is more friendly to China and is seeking to balance between the United States and the PRC [People's Republic of China], then the increased cooperation on security issues with the Philippines is likely to be downgraded,' said Kenneth Weinstein, the Japan chair at Hudson Institute. 'A greater burden will absolutely fall on Japan if South Korea is doing less' in the region, and their trilateral security ties with the U.S. 'can be easily reversed if a government in Seoul does not believe in the spirit of Camp David,' said Weinstein. This would be 'a major blow' to U.S. efforts 'to counter China's growing attempts at regional hegemony,' he told VOA in a phone interview. Yoon has gradually increased his country's role in the Indo-Pacific through close cooperation with the U.S. and Japan. The country participated in a first-of-its-kind meeting with the United States, Australia, Japan and the Philippines in November to discuss plans for a free and open Indo-Pacific. South Korea and the Philippines upgraded their ties to a strategic partnership and agreed to bolster their defense cooperation a month earlier during Yoon's trip to Manila. That followed a trilateral summit in August 2023 at Camp David where the U.S., South Korea and Japan agreed to align their collective efforts toward the region. The Spirit of Camp David, a joint statement issued at the summit, underscored their efforts to sustain the rules-based order in the South China Sea, where China's aggressive behavior has alarmed many of its neighbors. The three countries signed a Trilateral Security Cooperation Framework (TSCF) in July to institutionalize their ties and a Trilateral Secretariat was established last month to implement the framework. Challenge to US efforts on China Daniel Sneider, a lecturer on East Asian studies at Stanford University, told VOA in a phone interview by that if the main opposition Democratic Party comes to power, it will probably 'roll back the trilateral security cooperation.' He said trilateral military exercises, which are the 'substantive' result of policies pursued in the last two years, are 'most in danger' of being canceled if there is a change in government in Seoul. The U.S., South Korea, and Japan held large-scale joint exercises in June and November in the East China Sea. Yoon can be impeached with a two-thirds majority of South Korea's 300-seat National Assembly and approval by six of nine judges in the constitutional court, where there are three vacancies. In that event, the country will hold a snap election to choose a new president within 60 days. A failed impeachment motion filed by the opposition parties last week included a paragraph criticizing Yoon for advancing close trilateral ties with Japan and the U.S. The ruling People Power Party boycotted the session, leaving it short of the necessary quorum. That paragraph was removed from the second motion filed Thursday. Other analysts said Seoul's relations with Tokyo and Manila are unlikely to change even if there is a change of government in South Korea. Rahman Yaacob, research fellow for Southeast Asia Program at the Lowy Institute based in Sydney, said the Trilateral Security Cooperation Framework, 'has been institutionalized through the formation of the Secretariat,' and that he doubts that a change of government in Seoul 'will have a substantial impact on the operations of the TSCF.' Yaacob added, 'Given that Manila is embarking on military modernization, I believe Seoul will continue to maintain defense cooperation with Manila, driven more by the potential of sales of military equipment and less because of the Chinese factor.' Yaacob told VOA via email that South Korea has been a critical supplier of modern military equipment to the Philippines, such as FA-50 combat frigates for the Philippines Navy. Eric Ballbach, East Asia analyst at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs based in Berlin, told VOA via email that South Korean opposition parties 'acknowledge the significance of trilateral cooperation in this changed geopolitical context.' He added, 'It was a smart move to institutionalize trilateral cooperation ahead' of any government change in Seoul. Although the large-scale Indo-Pacific forum was canceled amid the upheaval, South Korea held a three-way Indo-Pacific Dialogue with the U.S. and Japan in Tokyo on Wednesday and discussed ways to strengthen stability and maritime security in the region. Seoul also held a bilateral Indo-Pacific Dialogue with Australia on Thursday and agreed to cooperate closely on maintaining a rules-based order in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/political-turmoil-casts-uncertainty-over-south-korea-s-role-in-indo-pacific-/7901095.html	2024-12-13T18:22:35-08:00	
Texas attorney general sues NY doctor over abortion pill prescription	Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Friday sued a New York doctor for allegedly providing a Texas woman with abortion pills by telemedicine. The lawsuit by the Republican attorney general, which appeared to be the first of its kind, could offer a test of conservative states' power to stop abortion pills from reaching their residents. New York is among the Democratic-led states that have passed so-called shield laws aiming to protect doctors who provide abortion pills to patients in other states. The law says New York will not cooperate with another state's effort to prosecute, sue or otherwise penalize a doctor for providing the pills, as long as the doctor complies with New York law. 'As other states move to attack those who provide or obtain abortion care, New York is proud to be a safe haven for abortion access,' New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. 'We will always protect our providers from unjust attempts to punish them for doing their job and we will never cower in the face of intimidation or threats.' In the lawsuit, filed in the District Court of Collin County, Paxton said that New Paltz, New York, Dr. Margaret Carpenter prescribed and provided mifepristone and misoprostol, the two drugs used in medication abortion, to a Texas woman via telemedicine. Medication abortion accounts for more than half of U.S. abortions. It has drawn increasing attention since the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision allowing states to ban abortion, which more than 20 have done. The woman went to the hospital after experiencing bleeding as a complication of taking the drugs, which were subsequently discovered by her partner, according to the lawsuit. Paxton claimed that Carpenter violated Texas's abortion law and its occupational licensing law by practicing medicine in the state despite not being licensed there. He is seeking an injunction barring her from further violations of Texas's abortion ban and at least $100,000 in civil penalties for each past violation. Carpenter is a member of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, which supports nationwide access to abortion through telemedicine, and helped start Hey Jane, an online telehealth clinic offering abortion pills, according to the coalition's website. She could not immediately be reached for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/texas-attorney-general-sues-ny-doctor-over-abortion-pill-prescription/7901138.html	2024-12-13T18:17:12-08:00	
Illegal Chinese immigrants uneasy as US conducts fourth China removal flight	WASHINGTON — After more than two years of separation, Chinese migrant Duan Chunxia, 51, recently met face to face with her husband and daughter at Stewart Detention Center, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Georgia. 'My wife has lost a lot of weight, and her hair turned gray,' her husband, Ni Jinfang, told VOA Mandarin in an emotional video interview. 'Our daughter cried so much when she saw her mother. Her tears were all over her face and neck.' That tearful reunion on December 1 was the latest in an emotional roller-coaster ride for the family as they’ve separately come to the United States seeking political asylum. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a surge in Chinese nationals entering the United States illegally and seeking asylum. Over the past year, those numbers have dwindled, and U.S. authorities are stepping up efforts to send a growing number back to China. There is also increasing concern among undocumented migrants from China about President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to carry out mass deportations. Deportation flights Just days after Duan met with her family, she was scheduled to be sent back to China on a U.S. government-chartered removal flight. That flight departed Monday, but Duan was not on it. Following a second asylum interview, authorities agreed to give her more time to appeal the deportation order. The charter flight marked the fourth time in six months that the United States has deported undocumented migrants back to China. Three previous flights in June, October and November carried a total of at least 350 Chinese citizens back to their homeland. The last previous large-scale repatriation occurred in 2018. Growing cooperation In a statement Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the flight 'is yet another example of the department’s ongoing cooperation with [China] and other international partners to deter irregular migration.' It added that DHS and its counterparts in China 'also continue joint work to counter the human smuggling networks that facilitate irregular migration.' DHS did not say how many migrants were on the flight. Chen Chuangchuang, an immigration lawyer in California, told VOA Mandarin that the Chinese and U.S. governments have cooperated more closely on immigration issues this year than previously. 'In the past, China rarely cooperated with the U.S. government in accepting illegal migrants,' Chen told VOA in a December phone interview. 'China has recently exchanged prisoners with the U.S. many times and also accepted undocumented people. [Chinese leader] Xi Jinping calls it ‘law enforcement cooperation’ rather than ‘border and immigration issues.’ ' How they arrived Ni, 53, and the couple’s 18-year-old daughter entered the U.S. on tourist visas in 2022. After Duan’s husband and daughter left China, she applied for a tourist visa the following year, but her application was rejected. More than one year after that, in late September, she illegally entered the U.S., crossing the southern border with Mexico. Duan made the hazardous journey through Ecuador and then traveled overland through Colombia, Central America and Mexico to the U.S. border. Both Duan and Ni are from China’s central city of Suzhou, just outside Shanghai. The city is relatively wealthy but human rights violations are not unheard of. In 2012, Ni lost his house and land following a government-led forced demolition. He tried to sue the local government in 2013 but was not given a chance to file his lawsuit. He continued to petition the government without result. In 2016, Ni was assaulted by local police officers and put in jail for 171 days for the crime of 'disturbing public order.' Ni continued to speak against the Chinese government after coming to the United States and participated in a protest in San Francisco last November, when Xi visited the city for the APEC summit and met with U.S. President Joe Biden. Panicking Another Chinese immigrant who entered the United States last year via the same route as Duan and is now living in New York state spoke with VOA on the condition that his name not be used because of his undocumented status. In a telephone interview, he said that with the recent deportations and Trump’s pledges, many in the Chinese immigrant community are a little panicked. 'After he takes office, everyone will be worried about being deported, not just us illegal immigrants,' he said. 'The ones with green cards, aren’t they afraid, too?' Before entering the United States, this man said he had openly criticized Xi on Chinese social media. He said that if he is deported, he will undoubtedly face a prison sentence in China. The man, who is in his 30s, has already begun applying for political asylum and is still hopeful. 'Although I don't like this result [Trump's victory], this is the choice of the American people, and there is nothing I can do. We are all entering an uncertain era, and everyone's future is uncertain,' he said. Immigration lawyer Chen said that Chinese immigrants in the U.S. who have not yet obtained legal status do face a 'real threat.' 'The Republicans have already occupied both houses [of Congress], and conservatives also have a clear advantage in the Supreme Court,' he said. 'We can say with absolute certainty that the second Trump administration will have way more resources, in terms of manpower, law and finances, to support the implementation of his deportation plan. This is bound to happen.' However, Chen does not think that all Chinese immigrants who apply for asylum will be unsuccessful. 'For those who have a deportation order, if you have a legal reason to apply to stay in the U.S., there is still a chance for review. It’s not easy though. The standard will be raised,' Chen said, adding that individuals need to prove that they will be persecuted if they return to their home country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/illegal-chinese-immigrants-uneasy-as-us-conducts-fourth-china-removal-flight-/7901128.html	2024-12-13T17:56:38-08:00	
US court rejects TikTok request to temporarily halt pending US ban	WASHINGTON — A U.S. appeals court on Friday rejected an emergency bid by TikTok to temporarily block a law that would require its Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest the short-video app by January 19 or face a ban on the app. TikTok and ByteDance on Monday filed the emergency motion with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, asking for more time to make its case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Friday's ruling means that TikTok now must quickly move to the Supreme Court in an attempt to halt the pending ban. The companies had warned that without court action, the law will 'shut down TikTok — one of the nation's most popular speech platforms — for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users.' 'The petitioners have not identified any case in which a court, after rejecting a constitutional challenge to an Act of Congress, has enjoined the Act from going into effect while review is sought in the Supreme Court,' the D.C. Circuit said. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Under the law, TikTok will be banned unless ByteDance divests it by January 19. The law also gives the U.S. government sweeping powers to ban other foreign-owned apps that could raise concerns about collection of Americans' data. The U.S. Justice Department argues 'continued Chinese control of the TikTok application poses a continuing threat to national security.' TikTok says the Justice Department has misstated the social media app's ties to China, arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the U.S. on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content moderation decisions that affect U.S. users are made in the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-court-rejects-tiktok-request-to-temporarily-halt-pending-us-ban-/7901118.html	2024-12-13T17:30:26-08:00	
Moody's hands France surprise downgrade over deteriorating finances	PARIS — Credit ratings agency Moody's unexpectedly downgraded France's rating on Friday, adding pressure on the country's new prime minister to corral divided lawmakers into backing his efforts to rein in the strained public finances. The downgrade, which came outside of Moody's regular review schedule for France, brings its rating to 'Aa3' from 'Aa2' with a stable outlook for future moves and puts it in line with those from rival agencies Standard & Poor's and Fitch. It comes hours after President Emmanuel Macron named on Friday veteran centrist politician and early ally Francois Bayrou as his fourth prime minister this year. His predecessor, Michel Barnier, failed to pass a 2025 budget and was toppled earlier this month by left-wing and far-right lawmakers opposed to his $63 billion (60 billion euro) belt-tightening push that he had hoped would rein in France's spiraling fiscal deficit. The political crisis forced the outgoing government to propose emergency legislation this week to temporarily roll over 2024 spending limits and tax thresholds into next year until a more permanent 2025 budget can be passed. 'Looking ahead, there is now very low probability that the next government will sustainably reduce the size of fiscal deficits beyond next year,' Moody's said in a statement. 'As a result, we forecast that France's public finances will be materially weaker over the next three years compared to our October 2024 baseline scenario,' it added. Barnier had intended to cut the budget deficit next year to 5% of economic output from 6.1% this year with a $63 billion (60 billion euro) package of spending cuts and tax hikes. But left-wing and far-right lawmakers were opposed to much of the belt-tightening drive and voted a no confidence measure against Barnier's government, bringing it down. Bayrou, who has long warned about France's weak public finances, said on Friday shortly after taking office that he faced a 'Himalaya' of a challenge reining in the deficit. Outgoing Finance Minister Antoine Armand said he took note of Moody's decision, adding there was a will to reduce the deficit as indicated by the nomination of Bayrou. The political crisis put French stocks and debt under pressure, pushing the risk premium on French government bonds at one point to their highest level over 12 years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moody-s-hands-france-surprise-downgrade-over-deteriorating-finances/7901120.html	2024-12-13T17:24:27-08:00	
Nigeria unveils new gunboats to enhance operations against oil theft	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigerian authorities in oil-rich Rivers State unveiled on Friday six military-grade gunboats to help security agents battle the piracy and oil theft that have plagued the Niger Delta region for decades. The latest measure is part of a broader crackdown aiming at boosting Nigeria's oil production. Local singers and dancers enthralled hundreds of delegates at the ceremony marking the handover of six military gunboats to Nigeria's navy in southern Rivers State. It's the latest effort by state authorities to support a national crackdown on oil thieves and to check piracy along the waterways in the Niger Delta. Officials said the boats will bolster the navy's ability to patrol and respond to threats, especially near submerged oil export pipelines, which are often prone to attacks by thieves. Siminalayi Fubara is the Rivers State governor. 'We're doing logistics support to the Nigerian navy, who are the closest agency that can battle the ones off the land,' said Fubara. 'It's a big problem. When you see the technology involved in the lines, you'd see that it's not small engineering, it's a professional thing.' Nigeria has long declared a war on crude oil theft, but the problem has continued to cut into the government's income and disrupt exports. Authorities estimate the country loses $10 billion every year, or the equivalent of about 200,000 barrels of oil per day, to illegal actors. Corruption, lack of security, and poor regulation have hindered authorities' ability to effectively curb the problem. Fubara said in addition to heightening security measures, state authorities will expand investments in infrastructure, health care and education in local communities most prone to oil theft to dissuade them from the practice. 'This problem is not just a problem that attacking those people on the field can solve,' said Fubara. 'What we need is a total reorientation. You need to engage them.' The state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company said this week that 94 incidents of crude oil theft occurred between November 30 and December 6. On Thursday, the Nigerian military said its 90-day Operation Delta Safe, a program that aimed to reduce oil theft and increase production, was successful upon its conclusion in mid-October. Rear Admiral John Okeke is commander of the operation. He spoke to journalists. 'We've been able to arrest, and the appropriate handling of over 300 vehicles comprising trucks, tankers, cars, tricycles conveying crude oil and illegal products,' said Okeke. 'Similarly, we've been able to handle over 15 million liters of stolen crude oil and about four million liters of illegally refined automotive gasoline oil.' Authorities say Nigeria plans to use drones, automated metering systems and other technology to monitor its oil pipelines next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-unveils-new-gunboats-to-enhance-operations-against-oil-theft/7901110.html	2024-12-13T16:55:36-08:00	
China quietly razes Uyghur business landmark in Xinjiang	WASHINGTON — Unannounced, China recently demolished a center for Uyghur culture and commerce, erasing the legacy of a prominent Uyghur rights dissident and sparking outrage among Uyghur rights groups. The long-vacant Rebiya Kadeer Trade Center, located in the capital of northwest China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, had been empty since 2009 but was once a vibrant hub for more than 800 mostly Uyghur-owned businesses. Local business owners near the site reported being ordered by authorities to close their shops for two days at the end of last month. 'When we returned, the buildings were already gone,' said a former perfume shop owner from the trade center, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. 'We were not allowed near the area during the demolition.' Uyghur activists see the destruction of the trade center as part of Beijing’s sustained effort to suppress Uyghur identity and heritage. Mounting criticism Since 2017, China has been facing mounting international condemnation for its actions in Xinjiang, including allegations of mass detentions, forced labor, and the systematic erasure of Uyghur cultural and religious landmarks. The U.S. government and other international bodies have designated these actions as crimes against humanity and genocide. China has consistently denied these accusations, framing its policies as necessary measures to combat terrorism, extremism and separatism. 'The measures carried out in Xinjiang have effectively curbed the rising and frequent occurrences of violent terrorist activities, safeguarded national unity and security to the greatest extent possible, and protected the fundamental rights of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, including their rights to life, health and development,' the Chinese foreign ministry said in June 2020. However, critics argue that these justifications served as a facade for a campaign aimed at assimilating Uyghurs into a homogenized Chinese identity, effectively dismantling their distinct culture and historical presence. Sealed off and shrouded in secrecy Zumret Dawut, a U.S.-based Uyghur rights activist, was the first to confirm the demolition after speaking with sources in Urumqi. She posted the news on her social media account on November 30, revealing that Chinese authorities had secretly demolished the trade center building the day before. 'They told me the area was sealed off, and no one could take pictures or videos,' Dawut told VOA in a phone interview. 'The Chinese government treated it as a state secret. Sharing any evidence could lead to persecution.' The trade center once drew international attention, including a visit by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in 1995. The building’s owner, Rebiya Kadeer, recalled preparing a warm reception for Gates, who toured the center as part of efforts to foster U.S.-China business ties. Kadeer sees the demolition as a calculated move to erase her legacy. 'They want to wipe out every trace of my contributions,' she said in an interview with VOA. 'But I will not be silenced. My fight for Uyghur justice continues.' From entrepreneur to exile The trade center’s destruction adds another chapter to the life of Kadeer, 78, a prominent Uyghur dissident now living in exile in northern Virginia in the United States. Once celebrated as the wealthiest woman in Xinjiang, Kadeer has become a lasting symbol of Uyghur resistance to Beijing’s policies. Kadeer’s rise began during China’s economic reforms in the 1980s. Her business, Akida Industry and Trade Co., grew into a vast enterprise, spanning textiles, trade centers and factories. She built the Rebiya Kadeer Trade Center in 1991, and within four years it had housed up to 800 mostly Uyghur-owned businesses, making it a thriving cultural and economic hub. 'The building was more than just a business space — it was a gathering place for Uyghur intellectuals,' Kadeer told VOA. Her entrepreneurial success earned her a seat on the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, where she was celebrated as an exemplary minority leader. However, her growing advocacy for Uyghur rights, particularly her efforts to draw attention to the 1997 Ghulja massacre, or what China calls the Ghulja incident, marked the beginning of her fall from favor with Beijing. On February 5, 1997, Chinese security forces brutally suppressed a peaceful demonstration in Ghulja, a city near Xinjiang's border with Kazakhstan. The protests were sparked by Uyghurs calling for cultural rights, religious freedom and an end to repressive policies. Arrest, sentence In 1999, Kadeer was arrested and accused of 'illegally providing national intelligence to overseas organizations' after attempting to send evidence of China’s crackdown on peaceful protesters to visiting U.S. congressional staff in Urumqi. Sentenced to eight years in prison, Kadeer said she endured harsh treatment. 'I witnessed young Uyghur prisoners being brutalized,' she recalled. Released in 2005 through U.S. diplomatic efforts, Kadeer moved to the United States. Upon arrival in the U.S., Kadeer became a leading voice for Uyghur rights, detailing her ordeal and advocating for her people. In 2006, she was elected president of the World Uyghur Congress, a position that put her at odds with Beijing. She said in retaliation for her activism, China imprisoned two of her sons who were living in Urumqi on charges including tax evasion. Kadeer said the charges are all false and her sons are being used against her in an attempt to keep her quiet. 'They used my children to punish me,' she said. 'But I couldn’t abandon the fight.' Since her exile, Beijing has been telling a different story about Kadeer’s legacy. In 2009, Chinese authorities blamed her for inciting riots in Urumqi that killed nearly 200 people. 'I had no involvement in the violence,' Kadeer said. The 2009 unrest marked the beginning of the end for Kadeer’s business empire. The businesses that rented space at the trade center were relocated to a nearby building, The trade center owned by Kadeer stayed vacant until last month’s demolition. Relatives held Since 2017, at least 20 of her relatives living in Xinjing — including children, grandchildren and siblings — have been detained. Her children and grandchildren were released in late 2019 and early 2020 after pressure from the U.S. and international rights groups, according to Kadeer. 'My sister died in a detention camp,' Kadeer said. 'The Chinese government made propaganda videos of my children speaking out against me, but I know they were coerced.' In one video on Chinese state media outlet Global Times, Kadeer’s grandchildren and son praised Beijing’s policies and denounced her. 'Grandma, we are living well,' one granddaughter claimed. 'Don’t be deceived by bad people abroad.' Kadeer dismissed the videos as propaganda. 'The truth is hidden behind the cameras,' she said, expressing her heartbreak over her family’s forced participation. VOA sought comment from the Chinese Embassy in Washington, asking whether the demolition followed legal procedures, including notification and compensation. Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu did not respond. Kadeer confirmed she was neither informed nor compensated. 'They might claim my children consented, but they have no rights to the property. Only I do,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-quietly-razes-uyghur-business-landmark-in-xinjiang/7901087.html	2024-12-13T16:33:52-08:00	
Trump wants to eliminate daylight saving time in US	NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump wants to turn the lights out on daylight saving time. In a post on his social media site Friday, Trump said his party would try to end the practice when he returns to office. 'The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't! Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation,' he wrote. Setting clocks forward one hour in the spring and back an hour in the fall is intended to maximize daylight during summer months but has long been subject to scrutiny. Daylight saving time was first adopted as a wartime measure in 1942. Lawmakers have occasionally proposed getting rid of the time change altogether. The most prominent recent attempt, a now-stalled bipartisan bill named the Sunshine Protection Act, had proposed making daylight saving time permanent. The measure was sponsored by Florida Senator Marco Rubio, whom Trump has tapped to helm the State Department. 'Changing the clock twice a year is outdated and unnecessary,' Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida said as the Senate voted in favor of the measure. Health experts have said that lawmakers have it backward and that standard time should be made permanent. Some health groups, including the American Medical Association and American Academy of Sleep Medicine, have said that it's time to do away with time switches and that sticking with standard time aligns better with the sun — and human biology. Most countries do not observe daylight saving time. For those that do, the date that clocks are changed varies, creating a complicated tapestry of changing time differences. The U.S. states of Arizona and Hawaii don't change their clocks at all.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-wants-to-eliminate-daylight-saving-time-in-us/7900879.html	2024-12-13T15:49:18-08:00	
You are loved,' Jill Biden tells military children at toy drive	washington — Less than 10 minutes was all it took for a large pile of toys donated by the White House staff to disappear as Jill Biden and children from military families sorted them into boxes as part of the annual Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots campaign for the less fortunate. The White House is a longtime supporter of the program, which has been helping families for 77 years, said Lieutenant General Leonard Anderson IV, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. 'We're making a significant impact right here in the nation's capital, where these toys will go to kids in need,' he said at a White House event hosted by the first lady. Last year, the program delivered over 25 million toys to more than 10 million children nationwide, he said. 'This year we think we're going to set another record, so we're really excited,' he said. Jill Biden, whose father and late son served in the military, spoke with several dozen military children who sat in front of her on the floor of the East Room facing two large glittering Christmas trees flanking the doorway. 'If you only remember one thing for the holidays, after all the wrapping paper is cleaned up, let it be this: You are loved,' she said. 'There are so many people who care about you, from your family and your friends, from your teachers and your classmates, to the president and me. 'And the best thing that we can do with that love is to let it overflow, to share it with others who might really need it,' she added. After her brief remarks, the first lady asked the children: 'Are you guys ready to get sorting?' And off they went toward the large pile of dolls, stuffed animals, sports gear, vehicles, books, puzzles and other items, including a copy of 'Delaware Opoly' — a Monopoly-style board game themed after President Joe Biden's home state.	https://www.voanews.com/a/you-are-loved-jill-biden-tells-military-children-at-toy-drive/7900895.html	2024-12-13T15:27:04-08:00	
Nigeria: Experts call for increased funding for malaria intervention	ABUJA, NIGERIA — The World Health Organization (WHO) and public health experts are calling for increased political commitment and funding to fight malaria, especially in endemic regions like Africa. This week's release of the 2024 World Malaria Report by the WHO said there were 11 million more malaria cases compared to the previous year and that Ethiopia and Nigeria recorded their highest death tolls from the disease since 2015. According to Wednesday's report, there were 263 million cases of the mosquito-borne disease and nearly 600,000 deaths worldwide last year. The report indicates global malaria cases grew by about 11 million compared to the year prior while fatalities remained nearly the same. The WHO report said Africa accounted for 95% of global malaria deaths. Most of the victims were children under 5 years of age. Dr. Kehinde Ajayi, an expert on malaria epidemiology and control, said one issue is that since 2020, most developing nations have had a shortage of resources to combat the disease. 'Some of the resources like insecticide-treated nets and also funding towards the malaria control programs have been hampered because of ... COVID-19 and the economic imbalance in developing countries,' Ajayi said. Ajayi said climate change and declining effectiveness of anti-malaria drugs are threatening progress. Nigeria bears the world's highest burden of malaria with more than 27% of global malaria cases and 31% of deaths. But the WHO report also showed some progress — estimating that about 2.2 billion cases of malaria and 12.7 million deaths were averted globally since 2000. Ajayi said increased government funding for malaria interventions could change things. 'Mosquitoes thrive very well under temperatures that are more than 19 degrees Celsius, and the climate change has made [that] possible,' Ajayi said. 'Also, the plasmodium parasite has gained a lot of resistance against malaria drugs. Also, the government needs to invest more in our health sector. Government also needs to fund research that will help us in discovering indigenous drugs.' The WHO report said only about half of the $8.7 billion target for malaria intervention last year was achieved. In Nigeria, spending on health care is about 4% of the national budget, much lower than the 15% agreed upon by the African Union in 2001 — in the so-called Abuja Declaration. Authorities have pledged to improve spending on health. On Thursday, Nigeria signed a deal to promote local production of test kits for HIV and malaria. Last week, Nigeria launched its malaria vaccination campaign — becoming the latest African country to provide malaria vaccines to young children.

Blinken calls on Azerbaijan to release Meydan TV journalists	The arrests in Azerbaijan of several journalists, including staff at the independent Meydan TV, have been condemned by the international community, including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Azerbaijani authorities have detained Meydan TV's editor-in-chief, Aynur Elgunash, and four of her reporters. Also being held are freelancer Ramin Jabrailzada, who is known as Deko, and Ulvi Tahirov, deputy director of the Baku School of Journalism. All are charged with smuggling foreign currency and have been ordered to be held for four months in pre-trial detention. The journalists denied the charges and said the criminal case is a result of their journalism work. During the arrests, others were briefly detained and later released, according to local reports. Journalist Ahmad Mukhtar was placed in administrative detention on charges of petty hooliganism and disobedience to the police. Blinken in a statement called on Azerbaijani authorities to immediately release the journalists who he said were 'arrested for their work on human rights.' The media advocacy group Reporters Without Borders, known as RSF, described the arrests as part of a strategy to silence critics of President Ilham Aliyev's administration. VOA reached out to authorities, but the calls went unanswered. Jeanne Cavelier, who heads RSF's Eastern Europe and Central Asia Desk, said the government has resumed its crackdown against journalists in the aftermath of COP29, the annual U.N. climate change conference that Azerbaijan hosted. The Meydan TV arrests again prove the regime's 'willingness to shamelessly target the individuals who dare to keep Azerbaijani citizens informed,' Cavelier said in a statement. She added that Azerbaijan has detained 13 other journalists in the past year. RSF 'calls on the international community not to turn a blind eye to these grave, systematic violations of fundamental rights,' said Cavelier. Meydan TV in a statement described the arrests and questioning of its team as illegal. 'Since the day we began our activities, our journalists have been arrested, they and their families have been subjected to harassment, and they have been subjected to various pressures and threats. Journalists who cooperate with us have been illegally banned from leaving the country,' the statement said. Bahruz Maharramov, a member of the Azerbaijani parliament, questioned the criticism of the arrests. 'If there are real suspicions based on valid, irrefutable evidence, why should any person's profession prevent those suspicions from being investigated?' he said. 'Why should we remain silent about the illegal actions of a mercenary network like Meydan TV, just because they are journalists? Where is the legality, where is the equality?' he told VOA. Regular pressure Meydan TV was founded in 2013 as an impartial and objective media organization. It has regularly faced pressure from the authorities, and in 2017 access to its website was blocked in the country. The network's social media accounts have been hacked multiple times and their contents deleted. Orkhan Mammad, an editor at Meydan TV, said that some of those detained were subjected to violence and that the authorities tried to forcefully extract statements from them. 'Ramin Deko had bruises under his eyes. He was left without a lawyer for a long time. When Aynur Elgunash's house was searched, she was pinned against the wall, hit in the kidney region, and her computer was seized,' he said. The lawyer for Tahirov, Bahruz Bayramov, told VOA that the assistant director of the Baku School of Journalism has no connection with Meydan TV. 'They were just family friends with Aynur Elgunash. A large amount of money was seized during a search at Tahirov's house. However, Tahirov stated that the money belonged to his wife,' Bayramov said. The money found was from her salary, the lawyer said. Zibeyda Sadigova, who is representing another of the journalists, Natig Javadli, said that there was no basis for the arrest. 'We were not provided with the decision and protocols regarding the search of his home, so we were unable to review them. Natig said that his computers and phones were confiscated, but no money was found in the house,' Sadigova said. The lawyer said that Javadli has been in journalism for 30 years and that the arrest is related to that work. 'They seized his passwords without a court order. He was subjected to psychological pressure,' the lawyer told VOA. Lawyers representing the journalists have filed an appeal against the pre-trial detention. Media crackdown More than 20 journalists and media workers have been arrested in Azerbaijan since late 2023 on allegations of smuggling and other crimes. Among those affected are journalists from Abzas Media, known for its corruption investigations, and the independent media outlet Toplum TV. The editor-in-chief of Abzas Media, Sevinj Vagifgizi, was among the Anti-Corruption Champions honored by Blinken on Monday. 'Vagifgizi has devoted more than a decade in exposing government abuses. She's also the one awardee who is not with us this afternoon,' Blinken said during a ceremony. He noted that Vagifgizi had returned to Azerbaijan in November 2023, 'knowing that she might be arrested on arrival.' More than a year later, said Blinken, 'she remains in detention.' Azerbaijan's government has rejected international criticism of the arrests, calling it an 'interference in Azerbaijan's internal affairs and the independence of the judiciary.' Officials say that fundamental rights, as well as media freedom, are guaranteed. Local human rights organizations estimate that there are more than 300 political prisoners in Azerbaijan. The country ranks 164th out of 180 on the RSF's World Press Freedom Index, where 1 reflects the best environment for media.

Argentina's Milei receives Italian citizenship during Rome visit, source says	ROME — Italy's government has granted citizenship to Argentinian President Javier Milei on account of his Italian family roots, a source with knowledge of the matter said Friday, confirming earlier media reports. Milei is in Rome to meet Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and to take part in her Brothers of Italy party's annual festival Saturday. The source declined to provide further details. The news on Italian media triggered an angry reaction from some politicians and on social media from people protesting at citizenship being given to Milei when it is hard to obtain for the children of migrants born in Italy. Italy's citizenship laws are based on blood ties, meaning that even distant descendants of an Italian national can obtain an Italian passport. Requirements for foreigners born in Italy or who migrate there, on the other hand, are much tougher. Pro-migrant groups have proposed a referendum to ease them, but Meloni's right-wing coalition is against any relaxation. Riccardo Magi, a lawmaker from the small opposition More Europa party, said granting citizenship to Milei was an act of 'intolerable discrimination against so many young people who will only get it after many years.' During a previous trip to Italy in February, Milei told a TV interview that he felt '75% Italian' since three of his grandparents had Italian origins, and that he has 'an incredible passion for Italian Opera.' Libertarian Milei and conservative Meloni have established a close relationship. When they met in Buenos Aires last month, the Argentine leader gave his Italian guest a statuette of himself wielding his trademark chainsaw.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentina-s-milei-receives-italian-citizenship-during-rome-visit-source-says/7900855.html	2024-12-13T14:30:35-08:00	
Israeli airstrikes kill at least 30 in Gaza	Palestinian health officials and U.N. aid workers report at least 30 people killed in Israeli strikes in central Gaza overnight, while the Israeli military reports that it conducted operations in Gaza and southern Lebanon in the past 24 hours. Senior emergency officer Louise Wateridge with the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees — UNRWA — reported Friday that 30 people were killed in Israeli strikes in central Gaza, citing local media sources. She spoke via videoconference at a news briefing in Geneva. Wateridge described the scene to reporters as 'horrific.' 'There are parents looking for their children, children covered in dust and blood looking for their parents, multiple injuries on top of the casualties reported, and people still buried under the rubble,' she said. The Palestinian Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza reported Friday that a total of 40 people were killed in the previous 24 hours. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces, said on the X social media platform that its troops conducted operations in the Jabaliya and Beit Lahia areas of northern Gaza, where the troops located and destroyed launchers they said were aimed at perimeter Gaza communities. The report said numerous weapons were discovered as well. The IDF also reported one of its combat teams continues to fight in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. Over the past 24 hours, the IDF, said its troops located shafts, eliminated terrorists and destroyed terrorist infrastructure. As part of the attacks, Israeli forces identified a squad of armed terrorists moving toward the forces, and an Israel Air Force aircraft attacked the squad and eliminated it. In Lebanon The IDF also reported Friday that its 769th Brigade 'remains deployed in southern Lebanon and along the border, conducting operational activities to eliminate threats to Israeli citizens, while acting in accordance with the ceasefire understandings between Israel and Lebanon.' The report said IDF soldiers discovered a large cache of weapons, including concealed Kornet missile launchers, AK-47 rifles, magazines, other military equipment and missiles hidden in dense, mountainous terrain. The troops also located and confiscated an antitank missile launch site they said had been used by Hezbollah to fire at communities in northern Israel during the past year. Ceasefire talks The activities come a day after U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan raised hopes for a Gaza ceasefire. Sulivan, who was in Tel Aviv as part of a Mideast tour, said Hamas negotiators 'did adapt' after the announcement of a ceasefire deal in Lebanon. 'For months, we believe Hamas was waiting for lots of other actors and forces to come to their rescue, to come to their aid,' Sulivan said, adding that 'we believe that it puts us in a position to be able to close this negotiation.' The Israel-Lebanon ceasefire halted months of intensified fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which included Israeli ground operations inside Lebanon and airstrikes that killed multiple Hezbollah leaders. Hezbollah launched cross-border attacks against Israel in solidarity with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip following the October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel. That attack killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,800 people, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The United States, United Kingdom and several other Western countries designate Hamas as a terror group. Natasha Mozgovaya, senior analyst with VOA's Eurasia Division, contributed to this report. Some material came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-airstrikes-kill-at-least-30-in-gaza/7900829.html	2024-12-13T14:03:07-08:00	
Southern African countries build $45M military depot in Botswana	Gaborone, Botswana — The Southern African Development Community (SADC) is building a military logistics hub in Botswana to ensure rapid deployment of troops. The construction follows the regional bloc's 2021 failure to quickly send forces to quell an insurgence in northern Mozambique. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, in his capacity as SADC chairperson, performed the groundbreaking ceremony Friday to mark the start of construction. The 19 hectare-SADC Standby Force Regional Logistics Depot will be built in Rasesa, 40 kilometers north of Gaborone. 'This groundbreaking ceremony is timely and marks a significant stride in our journey towards promoting and consolidating peace, stability and security in our region,' said Mnangagwa. 'Regrettably, the last four years have seen our region witnessing complex and multifaceted threats to peace and security. These require urgent and collective regional responses.' Having faced previous deployment challenges, Mnangagwa says the establishment of the center will ensure the region will be able to deploy troops quickly. 'The regional logistics depot will serve as a critical hub for the storage of and the rapid deployment of resources, personnel and equipment,' said Mnangagwa. 'This ensures that the SADC Standby Force has tactical capability to swiftly respond to the threats to peace and security.' However, Mnangagwa says only $15 million of the $45 million required to complete the facility has been raised. He appealed to international partners to come to the SADC's aid. Botswana President Duma Boko said the military hub will give the SADC the capacity to intervene in strife-torn regions. 'They (people) are mostly unsafe in some of their countries. They face strife, they face belligerent hostilities,' said Boko. 'They are in distress and they are looking for help and we in SADC have taken it upon ourselves when these calls of distress are raised to step in, to step up and come to the rescue we set up therefore, a force through which we intervene in some of these situations.' Boko said the depot will be crucial to the distribution of military equipment when needed. 'We have taken it upon ourselves to respond, to take to these trouble spots and deploy forces to assist and to bring an end to the conflicts,' said Boko. 'Such missions require facilities where the equipment they will need in the execution of their missions will be kept and from which such equipment can then be moved and distributed with speed and dispatched to the front lines where it is needed.' Zimbabwe-based political analyst Effie Dlela Ncube said while it is critical to have the armory, regional leaders must first address the root cause of conflict. 'We need to go beyond that (deploying troops) and deal with the political, socio-economic, legal and other structural root causes of conflict in the region,' said Ncube. 'We need to ensure that there are free and fair elections so that people do not have to rely on war in order to change governments. We need to eradicate discrimination on the basis of where people come from, on the basis of the language they speak, because that is a key driver of conflict. We need to deal with poverty, corruption (and) economic inequalities.' The SADC has seen the emergence of trouble spots, notably in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and in northern Mozambique.	https://www.voanews.com/a/southern-african-countries-build-45m-military-depot-in-botswana/7900778.html	2024-12-13T14:02:33-08:00	
Syrian Kurds seek to preserve autonomy following Assad's fall	WASHINGTON — Syrian Kurdish groups have welcomed the ousting of President Bashar al-Assad's regime, viewing it as a historic opportunity for change after 54 years of rule by the Assad dynasty. However, concerns remain among Kurdish communities about potential opposition to Kurdish rights from the Islamist rebels who led the regime's overthrow. Following Assad's fall on Sunday, Mazloum Abdi, the top commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, said, 'This change is an opportunity to build a new Syria based on democracy and justice that guarantee the rights of all Syrians.' The SDF is the military arm of the Kurdish-led Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), which governs a significant portion of the country. On Thursday, the AANES announced its decision to raise the new Syrian flag adopted by the rebels. Both the SDF and AANES have expressed their readiness to engage in dialogue with the new authorities in Damascus over the status of Syrian Kurds and other ethnic and religious minorities in territories under their administration. Kamal Akif, a spokesperson for the AANES, confirmed in a statement on Friday that 'the autonomous administration currently works to prepare for the dialogue period.' Syrian Kurds, who constitute nearly 15% of Syria's population of 24 million, have long faced persecution under successive governments in Syria. Their oppression intensified under the Baath party's rule, which began in 1963, stripping Kurds of basic civic, linguistic and cultural rights. In the wake of Syria's civil war, which erupted in 2011, Kurdish forces established control over their region in northeast Syria, eventually becoming a key partner of the United States in the fight against Islamic State group militants. Preserving autonomy Salih Muslim, a senior Kurdish politician with the Democratic Union Party, the de facto ruling party in northeast Syria, said the governing institutions that have been set up in recent years should be preserved. 'We have established a sophisticated governing system in our region, so we will not accept returning to the pre-2011 status,' he told VOA in a phone interview. 'We are ready to start a dialogue process with the new rulers in Damascus, who have so far been saying positive things about inclusiveness and coexistence in Syria.' The offensive that led to the overthrow of Assad's regime was headed by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Following the capture of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city with a significant Kurdish population, the HTS political affairs office issued a statement saying that 'Syrian Kurds have the full rights to live in dignity and freedom, as do all the Syrian people.' 'We stand with the Kurds as we stand with all segments of the Syrian people and society in building the future Syria in which justice and dignity prevail for all,' the statement said. Other groups that participated in the anti-regime offensive are backed by Turkey, which views the SDF as a terrorist organization. These armed groups have intensified their attacks on Kurdish forces in recent days. Salih Muslim said Kurds 'fear that these groups will continue attacking our forces and further destabilizing our region.' Yerevan Saeed, director of the Global Kurdish Initiative for Peace at American University in Washington, said Kurdish unity is crucial at this critical juncture in Syria to safeguard Kurdish rights. 'For Kurds to preserve their autonomy in the region, the most effective course of action for the Syrian Democratic Forces in the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria and the Kurdish National Council is to negotiate a preliminary agreement and present a unified, credible and legitimate front in Damascus,' Saeed told VOA. The Kurdish National Council, or ENKS, a coalition of Kurdish parties that has often been at odds with the AANES, is aligned with the Turkey-based national Syrian opposition. 'This unified representation would be essential to securing Kurdish rights in the new Syrian constitution, much like the successful strategy employed by the Kurds in Iraq in 2003,' Saeed added, referring to the unified Iraqi Kurdish front in Baghdad following the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. Amy Austin Holmes, a professor at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, emphasized that the most effective approach for the SDF and its civilian component is to engage with all sides. 'Besides HTS, they should also reach out with other rebel factions, for example those in the southern front, as well as the ENKS,' she told VOA. The oil factor The areas under SDF control in northeast Syria contain most of the country's oil and natural gas fields. Ahed al-Hendi, a Syrian affairs analyst based in Washington, said that this dynamic presents both opportunities and challenges for Syrian Kurdish groups. 'For the Kurdish administration, controlling oilfields could be the biggest leverage point and the most vulnerable one at the same time,' he told VOA. 'Controlling the oil means all eyes will be on the Kurds, including different hostile powers such as Turkey and the many Syrian rebel groups.' Hendi added that Kurds could leverage their control over oil resources if they successfully manage to integrate with the new Syrian state and demonstrate a willingness to contribute to the country's new phase. 'Controlling oil is a sovereignty matter. It belongs to the Syrian state,' he said. 'The Kurds can negotiate a proportional share of oil revenues as part of their integration.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-kurds-seek-to-preserve-autonomy-following-assad-s-fall-/7900801.html	2024-12-13T13:32:04-08:00	
Landmark climate change legal hearing wraps up in The Hague	LONDON — A landmark hearing into nation-states' legal obligations over climate change wrapped up at the United Nations' top court in The Hague on Friday. The outcome could have implications for the fight against climate change — and for the big polluters blamed for emitting most greenhouse gases. The 15 judges at the International Court of Justice have heard evidence from 99 countries and dozens of organizations over the course of the two-week hearing. They are trying to determine the legal obligations of states to tackle climate change and to repair the harm caused. The judges' advisory opinion is expected to be published next year. Emotional testimony The testimony has at times been technical – but also impassioned and emotional. Small island states have argued their existence is at stake and so international human rights laws must apply to climate change. 'For young people, the demand for reparations is crucial for justice. We have inherited a planet in decline and face the grim prospect of passing on an even more degraded world to future generations,' said Vishal Prasad, campaign director for Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, which lobbied for the case to be heard. 'Equally clear is the demand for immediate cessation. If greenhouse gas emissions are not stopped, we are not just risking our future, we are welcoming its demise,' he said. Polluters Countering that argument were several big polluting nations, including China, India, Britain and the United States. They argued that only climate treaties, such as the 2015 Paris Agreement, confer any legal obligations on nation-states regarding climate change. 'An advisory proceeding is not the means to litigate whether individual states or groups of states have violated obligations pertaining to climate change in the past or bear responsibility for reparations, as some participants have suggested,' legal adviser to the U.S. State Department, Margaret L. Taylor, told the court on December 4. 'It's a suggestion … that some, but not all, states are entitled, as a matter of international law, to reparations simply upon a showing that the climate system has been harmed. We do not see a basis for such a conclusion,' Taylor added. Island states The U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice to issue an advisory ruling after years of lobbying from small island and vulnerable coastal states, which argue that rising sea levels due to global warming pose an existential threat. The judges' opinion will not be legally binding, but analysts say it will carry legal weight and could influence future climate negotiations. Youth climate groups have led the campaign at the U.N., and several attended the hearings in The Hague. Many campaigners were optimistic as the two-week hearing closed Friday. 'We came here hoping that at the end of it all, we shall get a favorable advisory opinion,' ,' said Kenyan lawyer Brenda Reson Sapuro, who represented the group World's Youth for Climate Justice at the hearing. 'And we still stand hopeful because we have told our stories. We have told our stories from our heart. We've spoken of our experiences, and we believe that the law is also on our side.' What happens next? The ICJ's advisory opinion may simply reiterate existing climate deals such as the 2015 Paris Agreement, according to Renatus Otto Franz Derler, a climate law expert and editor-in-chief of the Cambridge International Law Journal. '[Or] a second intermediate outcome would be that states have an obligation to fight climate change. The conduct that they're doing, for example the petrostates, is in breach of general international law, so therefore state responsibility would apply,' Derler told VOA. Petrostates are countries that are heavily dependent on the export of oil and natural gas. The judges may instead issue a much more ambitious advisory, 'in terms of saying that, yes, states cause climate change, it is a breach of international law, and therefore states are obligated to pay financial compensation and cessation of all these harmful activities,' Derler said. He added that such an outcome would likely lead to further legal uncertainties over how and where such compensation claims would be heard.	https://www.voanews.com/a/landmark-climate-change-legal-hearing-wraps-up-in-the-hague-/7900693.html	2024-12-13T13:30:41-08:00

Chinese Embassy in Kenya partners with state broadcaster to train journalists	nairobi, kenya — The Chinese Embassy in Kenya says it has begun training Kenyan journalists to promote professionalism and integrity. But press advocates say the initiative is ironic as China sits close to the bottom in a key press freedom ranking for 2024. Kenyan news anchor and reporter Allan Aoko is one of dozens of reporters and editors at the state-run Kenya Broadcasting Corporation who recently participated in a Chinese Embassy-sponsored media course in Nairobi. The course touched on a range of journalism topics. ''It was very critical for me to understand the kind of tools that we should be using in artificial intelligence as a reporter using those tools to disseminate the news,' he said. 'It was important for me to understand the details.'' Some 70 journalists participated in the training. Speaking at the opening of the training session, the Chinese Embassy’s deputy ambassador to Kenya, Zhang Zhizhong, talked about the importance of the role of journalism in a nation. ''Journalists and reporters, you are the core of media and also the key factor in the success of media in conveying information and shaping perceptions and leading a country or nation into the correct direction,' Zhang said. Studies by independent journalist advocacy groups have documented how China uses such partnerships to try to foster more positive coverage, including via press junkets, sponsorships and so-called career development opportunities to nurture better media relations. It has also offered tightly controlled press trips to Xinjiang to try to counter investigative reporting that has exposed its mass detentions and abuses in the region. As the world's leading jailer of journalists, China is considered one of the most censored countries in the world, using a combination of censorship, surveillance and legal threats to prevent free expression. The country ranks 172nd out of 180 on the Press Freedom Index, where 1 reflects the best media environment. Aleksandra Bielakowska works for Reporters Without Borders, which compiles the index. She said that 'inside their country, Beijing is conducting a full-scale campaign against independent voices, which is also independent journalists. In the past 10 years, we could see some space for independent journalism in China. The investigative journalists have almost died out.' The Kenyan national broadcaster’s editor-in-chief, Simon Maina, told VOA that because resources are limited, accepting help from China may be inevitable. But Maina said his newsroom’s editorial decisions are free of China’s influence. ''The sponsorship they have given us does not interfere with our editorial policy,' Maina said. 'Our editorial policy still stands, so it has nothing to do with how they operate in their country.' A 2021 report by the International Federation of Journalists found that Beijing's strategy was to target journalists in developing countries, such as in Africa, where it has deep financial interests. The report further showed that three quarters of African respondents said they viewed cooperation with Chinese entities as positive, especially where there was not enough media infrastructure. Kenyan foreign policy professor Noah Midamba said that even with Beijing’s efforts and investments in Africa, the continent's mass media are still aligned with the West because of the language barrier with China. ''What is lagging for the Chinese is their information has not penetrated to the people in the streets, people in the rural areas and the most populous [regions] in Africa, as most Africans don’t understand Chinese,'' he said. At the same time, what has made the headlines is Kenya’s participation in China’s global infrastructure development project called the Belt and Road Initiative - a partnership many economists say has led the country into a debt trap.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-embassy-in-kenya-partners-with-state-broadcaster-to-train-journalists/7900762.html	2024-12-13T13:11:41-08:00

Russian troops moving close to key Ukrainian city, local reports say	Ukrainian news outlets say Russian troops are closing in on Pokrovsk, an eastern city that is considered a key logistical hub for the Ukrainian military. The Kyiv Post and Kyiv Independent newspapers reported Friday that Russian troops control areas 5 kilometers or less from Pokrovsk, a city of about 60,000 in Ukraine's Donetsk region. On the positive side for Ukraine, the Independent, citing the DeepState monitoring group that tracks the Russia-Ukraine war, reports that Ukrainian forces have resisted Russian assaults on several other Donetsk locales in recent days. Earlier Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had launched one of the largest assaults to date on his nation's energy infrastructure, sending 93 missiles and nearly 200 attack drones against the nation. In a report from his X social media account, Zelenskyy said Ukraine's air defenses managed to shoot down 81 of the missiles, including 11 cruise missiles shot down by Ukraine's F-16 fighter aircraft. The Ukrainian president said there was at least one North Korean missile used in the attack. In his comments, Zelenskyy lashed out at Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying of the attack, 'This is Putin's 'peaceful' plan — to destroy everything. This is how he wants 'negotiations' — terrorizing millions of people.' Zelenskyy also called for a strong reaction from world leaders: 'a massive strike — a massive reaction. This is the only way to stop terror,' he said. Zelensky said if world leaders hesitate to react, 'Putin takes it as permission to continue. Patriots are needed to shoot down these missiles and prove that terror will not achieve its goal.' He also called for stronger sanctions against Russia to hamper missile production. The Ukrainian president said he discussed the attack later Friday in a telephone call with Finnish President Alexander Stubb. He said Stubb expressed his readiness to help enhance Ukraine's air defenses as well as Finland's strong support for 'Ukraine's sovereign right to choose its own future without external interference, including our choice to join the EU and NATO.' Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-troops-moving-close-to-key-ukrainian-city-local-reports-say-/7900740.html	2024-12-13T12:50:44-08:00	
Syrian White Helmets co-founder: ‘No perpetrator or criminal will live forever’	The search for secret prisoners in the dungeons of ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is now the top priority of the Syrian civil defense group known as the White Helmets, which has been working throughout the civil war to rescue victims of bombing raids on civilian areas. Since the fall of Assad's government earlier this month, the group has also been documenting the former regime’s alleged war crimes and helping millions of displaced Syrians to return home. In an interview with VOA’s Ukrainian Service, White Helmets co-founder Abdulrahman Almawwas discussed what the group’s volunteers have found in the liberated areas, how they are gathering evidence to bring Assad regime elements to justice, and whether Syria faces a threat from radical Islamist forces. The following transcript has been edited for clarity and length. VOA: What have White Helmets volunteers found in the newly liberated areas of Syria? Abdulrahman Almawwas, White Helmets co-founder: After the [rebel] military operation started, we started to receive a lot of calls related to unidentified bodies. … We found more than 400 unidentified bodies, most of them [Syrian government] soldiers. Moreover, we found a lot of documents in the military facilities [that] had geolocations for potential targets, mostly in civilian areas. We also found some lists of detainees with the names and dates of their arrest, and execution orders with the names of the dead. When we moved to Damascus, we also found prisons. We weren’t there from the beginning, so we didn't meet the prisoners in Sednaya, but we were in touch with other prisoners. We were there to find if there were any underground cells. After that, we started receiving a lot of calls about secret prisons, and that is what we are working on now — to find any secret prisoners. That is our top priority. ... We are also working on the unexploded ordnance. A lot of civilians, including our volunteers … , come home and their houses were mined or have unexploded ordnance. And our UXO — exploded ordinance teams — are trying to deal with this. VOA: Photos of Sednaya prison shocked the world. Can you talk a little bit more about your work helping to free the prisoners and also how you documented crimes against people held there? Almawwas: We don't work on freeing prisoners, but we come after that, trying to connect them with their families, trying to provide first aid. And in this case, we brought some prisoners to hospitals in Damascus and transported them from the hospitals to their families if needed. VOA: According to the human rights organizations, around 137,000 Syrians were missing from the Assad regime’s war on its own people. Only a small percentage of those people have been found. What are you doing to find those people, alive or not? Almawwas: We are collaborating with other organizations because we cannot do all this work ourselves. Our vision for the future is to document and preserve all these facts to use for transitional justice and share it with the families. This is exactly what we aim to do — to make this reconciliation and then to have a peaceful country. Therefore we are focusing more on documenting the witnesses' testimonies and identifying the bodies. Later, we will reach the families to interview them, collect the DNA, do the matching and simply find an answer to their questions about their loved ones’ fate. VOA: In the Oscar-winning documentary about your organization, one of your volunteers, Muhammad Farah, said that justice will prevail one day. Do you believe that Syria’s liberation from the Assad regime is the justice you've been waiting for? Almawwas: No, I don't believe this is justice, yet I believe this is … a victory for these families, for these detainees. In the videos from Sednaya, I saw a woman who was arrested when she was 19 years old — she was a virgin. And now she is released with four kids; she doesn't know who the fathers of these kids are. [Ending the regime's] arrests, torture and detentions — this is a victory. This is something we can be proud of. But justice hasn't started, because the perpetrators, the criminals, are still free. There is no court now, national or international. And that's what we are asking other states, other governments — we call them the friends of the Syrian people — to take real steps towards reconstructing Syria and bringing reconciliation and transitional justice. And without these three things, we will not have a country. VOA: You worked closely with your Ukrainian counterparts on documenting Russian war crimes in Syria and in Ukraine. Can you tell a little bit more about that collaboration? Almawwas: We worked on many cases. One of the most important ones was about the double tap airstrikes and attacks against humanitarian workers. We believe that this collaboration must continue. Russian perpetrators committed war crimes in Syria, and then they moved to Ukraine. And this collaboration is aimed to stop it from spreading. … We also need to share what we have to bring criminals to justice. VOA: The Assad family regime ruled Syria for 53 years and it collapsed in 11 days. Very unexpectedly. In that context, do you have any message for the Ukrainian people? Almawwas: Yes. We were suffering a lot, but we believed that this day would come. Despite a lot of disappointment with many countries and the international community — they let us down many times — in the end it happened. So my message to Ukrainians, on behalf of the White Helmets and the Syrian people: We are standing with them against war crimes and their perpetrators. They should have confidence that justice will happen one day. No perpetrator or criminal will live forever. VOA: Following the liberation of Syria, Russian propaganda has expressed concern about the rise of Islamist forces in the country, which is also a concern of some Western experts. What do you have to say about those concerns? Almawwas: This was the [Assad] regime’s narrative since 2011. It was trying to export this image about Syria: You have Bashar al-Assad, or you will have ISIS, you will have Islamic groups. … If you look at Syria, you will find a lot of civil society organizations. You will find that a lot of Syrians are not to the right or to the left — they are in the middle, they are just normal people, like in any country. … We have Muslims, Christians, other groups, and we used to live together. And the only one who divided these groups was the regime. So we hope that the next government will be a serious transitional government … and it will lead us to a new Syria that all Syrians dream of.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-white-helmets-co-founder-no-perpetrator-or-criminal-will-live-forever-/7900722.html	2024-12-13T12:49:15-08:00

Malawi goes on high alert as Tropical Cyclone Chido approaches	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — Malawi is on high alert for the impact of Tropical Cyclone Chido, as meteorological experts said Friday the cyclone will bring heavy rain and flooding to the country’s south. An update from Malawi’s Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services said the cyclone, which at the time was northeast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, has maintained its strength with maximum winds of 250 kilometers per hour. It said the cyclone is expected to sustain that intensity through Saturday afternoon as it slowly moves westward at a speed of 22 kilometers per hour, with significant potential for heavy rainfall. According to the update, Cyclone Chido will likely pass through 11 districts in southern Malawi — Mangochi, Machinga, Phalombe, Balaka, Mulanje, Blantyre, Thyolo, Chiradzulu, Zomba, Mwanza and Neno. It’s expected to make landfall Sunday near Nacala in Mozambique, causing heavy rain and flooding in some areas until Tuesday. Chipiliro Khamula, spokesperson for the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, told VOA that the agency has advised people in flood-prone areas to move to higher ground and follow evacuation orders. 'We have alerted all [district] councils and activated all clusters for swift preparatory and anticipatory actions,' Khamula said. 'We have also made standby arrangements for the deployment of a search-and-rescue team comprising the Malawi Defense Force, the Malawi Police Service, the Marine Department and the Malawi Red Cross Society.' Tropical Cyclone Chido comes a year after Cyclone Freddy, which killed over 1,000 people in southern Malawi and washed away large numbers of crops and livestock. Freddy also hit Madagascar, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. This year, even before the coming cyclone, Malawi has had to cope with the impact of El Nino weather conditions, which caused drought and food shortages for more than a quarter of the country’s population of 20 million. Paul Turnbull, country director for the World Food Program in Malawi, told VOA via a messaging app on Friday that the WFP has available food stocks in its warehouses to complement the government’s food stocks. 'These stocks were mainly intended to be food assistance for people affected by El Nino as the requirement for El Nino persists,' he said. 'If food is needed to respond to Cyclone Chido, WFP will be seeking support to cover these costs so that we would not compromise the support for the ongoing El Nino response.' Turnbull also said the WFP has boats to assist the Malawi government fleet if boats are needed to deliver food and rescue victims of post-cyclone flooding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malawi-goes-on-high-alert-as-tropical-cyclone-chido-approaches/7900683.html	2024-12-13T12:14:00-08:00	
Russia’s war steals childhood from Ukrainian kids	At least 2,400 children have been killed or injured since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, according to the latest UNICEF reports.

Ukraine, Syria key focus of Biden talks with G7	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden met virtually with G7 leaders Friday to secure support for Kyiv’s fight against Russia’s invasion, less than six weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, a skeptic of aid to Ukraine, is set to take office. The talks followed Washington’s $20 billion disbursement earlier this week to a new World Bank fund that will provide economic support for Ukraine. The money is part of a new $50 billion loan for Kyiv from the Group of Seven democracies that will be paid back with interest income earned from Russian sovereign assets immobilized in G7 countries. Earlier this week Biden approved a new security assistance package for Ukraine that will provide Kyiv with additional air defense, artillery, drones, and armored vehicles — the 72nd such drawdown package announced by Washington since Russia’s invasion. 'As the president made clear, we’re going to continue to provide additional packages right up until the end of this administration,' White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby said during a news briefing Thursday. On Jan. 20, Biden will hand over power to Trump, who has been critical of using American taxpayers’ money to help Kyiv. Without providing details, Trump often boasts he can swiftly end the war — a statement that many in Europe fear would mean forcing Ukraine to capitulate. 'We are likely to see the G7 redouble support for Ukraine in part because of concerns that President Trump may reduce support,' said William Courtney, adjunct senior fellow at the RAND Corp, to VOA in an interview. Additional sanctions on Russia appear to be in the works, Courtney told VOA. Syria aftermath G7 leaders also focused on fast-moving events related to the momentous transition of power in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad. On Thursday , the leaders said in a statement they 'stand ready to support a transition process that leads to credible, inclusive, and non-sectarian governance' in Syria. Support for the new government is conditional upon 'respect for the rule of law, universal human rights, including women's rights, the protection of all Syrians, including religious and ethnic minorities, transparency and accountability,' the leaders’ statement said. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that toppled Assad, is a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization. Its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has a $10 million bounty on his head. The U.S. and other G7 countries have signaled that HTS’ delisting from their terror list would be dependent upon how inclusive the new government would be. In recent years, Jolani has distanced himself from extremist ideology. Since the rebels’ victory, he has sought to assure his non-sectarian stance to Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities, which include Christians, Kurds, Druze and the Alawite community, a sect from which the Assad family originates. Trump has also signaled that he wants the U.S. to stay out of the Syrian conflict. 'This is not our fight,' Trump said on social media in response to Assad’s ouster. 'Let it play out. Do not get involved!' It’s unclear whether a new U.S. administration would be able to maintain a hands-off approach that Trump said he wants. There are approximately 900 American troops stationed in Syria, and Washington has close ties with all of Syria’s neighbors including allies Turkey and Israel. Both are already making military maneuvers to secure their interests. Two days after the Syrian rebels took control of Damascus on Dec. 8, Israel launched airstrikes across the country, further weakening what remains of the Assad regime’s military, once a stalwart-ally of Israel’s archnemesis, Iran. Since then, Israeli troops have advanced deeper into the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone separating the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Syrian territory. The United Nations said Israel’s actions violate the country’s 1974 Disengagement Agreement with Syria. The U.S. said it is in line with Israel’s right to self-defense, to avoid weapons falling into extremists’ hands amid a vacuum in power. Meanwhile, Syrian Kurds near the northern border with Turkey have been displaced amid clashes between U.S.-backed Kurdish forces and Ankara-backed rebels. The U.S. brokered a ceasefire deal between the groups on Wednesday but it is unclear whether the fragile truce will hold. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are currently in the region for talks, hoping to ensure a smooth transition in Damascus and making a last-ditch diplomatic push to achieve a deal to end fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-syria-key-focus-of-biden-talks-with-g7-/7900525.html	2024-12-13T10:49:17-08:00

Taliban minister’s killing raises concerns about IS terror group’s expansion	ISLAMABAD — The recent assassination of a Taliban minister in Afghanistan by a local Islamic State offshoot has raised concerns about the terrorist network's expansion in the region, while signifying an escalation of the terror group’s conflict with the country’s de facto Taliban leaders. Taliban Minister of Refugees and Repartition Khalil-Ur-Rahman Haqqani was killed, along with several staff members, in a suicide bombing while he was exiting his office in the Afghan capital on Wednesday. Haqqani, 58, is the highest-profile target of Islamic State-Khorasan, or IS-K, since the Taliban swept back to power in August 2021. The group has so far killed at least eight high-ranking Taliban officials and prominent figures in suicide bombings. The victims include the governors of the northern Afghan provinces of Balkh and Badakhshan. Taliban authorities have repeatedly claimed that their security operations have effectively diminished IS-K in Afghanistan, urging critics to provide evidence or stop making unfounded allegations about the terrorist group’s presence within the Afghan population. Islamic State social media channels again derided the Taliban’s claims following Haqqani’s assassination, asserting the latest deadly attack was a testament to the group’s presence in the country and its capacity to strike at will. The United States has refrained from immediately commenting on the deadly attack against the Taliban minister. 'The only thing I would say is that we recognize — and we said so at the time — that there was still an ISIS threat inside Afghanistan,' National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby told a White House news conference on Thursday, using an acronym for the terrorist group. 'And clearly, they have set their sights on the Taliban.' Afghanistan’s growing terror threat? The assassination and the terrorism threat emanating from Afghanistan prominently figured in a meeting the United Nations Security Council held Thursday to discuss the situation in the crisis-ridden country. 'Terrorist forces in Afghanistan such as Daesh, al-Qaida and ETIM/TIP still pose a major threat to international peace and security,' Fu Cong, the Chinese ambassador to the U.N., told the gathering. Fu used the Arabic acronym Daesh for the IS-K and referenced the anti-China group known as the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), also known as the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP). 'We call on the Afghan interim government to take counterterrorism measures to eradicate the breeding ground for terrorism and prevent Afghanistan from becoming a gathering place for terrorist organizations again,' the Chinese ambassador said. The Russian representative, Vassily Nebenzia, addressed the meeting and highlighted Moscow’s concerns regarding Islamic State activities in Afghanistan. 'We are particularly concerned about the ongoing security risks emanating from the persistent terrorist activity of the ISIL Afghan wing,' Nebenzia said, using another acronym for the regional IS offshoot. The Russian envoy acknowledged the Taliban’s efforts to combat the terrorist threat but characterized them as insufficient. 'We see that the fighters are enhancing their presence in the country, and they are deliberately escalating the situation, thereby recruiting new fighters, including foreign terrorist fighters, and carrying out new terrorist attacks targeting representatives of religious and ethnic minorities, including women and children,' he said. Nebenzia went on to assert that Islamic State militants are actively attempting to establish themselves as an alternative force, thereby jeopardizing stability in Afghanistan and the broader region. Transnational terror groups On Thursday, the U.S. State Department’s annual country report on terrorism also underscored the threat transnational groups pose to regional stability from Afghanistan. 'Despite commitments by the Taliban that Afghan soil would be used neither to support terrorist groups nor to launch attacks against the United States or its allies, terrorist groups such as the Islamic State’s Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (the TTP) continued to take advantage of poor socioeconomic conditions and uneven security procedures that make for a more-permissive operating environment,' the report stated. 'The Taliban arrested some notable ISIS-K operatives in 2023 and viewed ISIS-K as the primary threat in Afghanistan while appearing to apply less pressure against al-Qaida and TTP,' the report noted. TTP, a globally designated terrorist group, has waged attacks against Pakistan and has intensified its cross-border raids since the Taliban seized power in Kabul. The IS-K began its extremist operations in the region in early 2015 and mainly consisted of defectors from members of the then-insurgent Afghan Taliban and the TTP. Despite both being ardent advocates of the strict interpretation of Islamic law known as Sharia, the Sunni-based Afghan Taliban and IS-K are notorious for their intense rivalry. ISIS-K claimed responsibility for multiple attacks it carried out beyond the Afghan borders in 2024. The targets included a memorial service in Shiite Iran, a Moscow concert hall and a church in Turkey, collectively killing nearly 250 people. Pakistan, while briefing the Security Council Thursday, highlighted growing TTP attacks, saying the violence is being orchestrated from Afghan hideouts. 'The TTP — with 6,000 fighters — is the largest listed terrorist organization operating in Afghanistan. With safe havens close to our border, it poses a direct and daily threat to Pakistan’s security,' Usman Iqbal Jadoon, the Pakistani representative at the U.N., told the meeting Thursday. 'We have evidence of its [the TTP’s] collaboration with other terrorist groups … to disrupt Pakistan’s economic cooperation with China. Given its long association with al-Qaida, the TTP could emerge as al-Qaida’s arm with a regional and global terrorist agenda,' Jadoon asserted without elaborating further. Taliban leaders deny allegations Afghanistan is being used by foreign militants, including the TTP, to threaten other countries, including Pakistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-minister-s-killing-raises-concerns-about-is-terror-group-s-expansion/7900252.html	2024-12-13T07:21:32-08:00

US, China sign 5-year amended agreement on science and technology cooperation	State Department — The United States and China Friday signed a protocol to amend the bilateral, government-to-government Science and Technology Agreement and extend it for five years, according to the State Department. The STA, first signed in 1979 by then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, is aimed at facilitating cooperation in areas such as agriculture, energy, space, health, environment, earth sciences, engineering, and educational and scholarly exchanges. The amended agreement, which U.S. officials said excludes 'critical or emerging technologies,' took effect retroactively as of August 27 for a five-year term and was signed in Beijing by representatives from both countries. A senior State Department official told reporters the new agreement narrows the scope of the previous deal and introduces 'guardrails' to ensure 'reciprocity, transparency and openness.' Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters in February that the nature of scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation between the two countries is 'mutually beneficial and a win-win.' U.S.-China science and technology cooperation has faced criticism and raised security concerns over the years, with critics arguing it could bolster Beijing's military capabilities. Since its inception, the STA has been renewed approximately every five years. In August 2023, it was granted a six-month extension, which was followed by another in February 2024, to maintain the agreement while the U.S. negotiated an amended deal. The short-term extensions occurred amid scrutiny from several members of Congress, who argued China had previously exploited the agreement to advance military objectives against the U.S. In June 2023, Republican Representative Elise Stefanik, who is President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for U.N. ambassador, and other lawmakers wrote to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urging him not to renew the STA when it was set to expire on August 27, 2023. They cited concerns over joint research projects between the U.S. Agriculture Department and Chinese entities, including concerns over such dual-use technologies as those used to analyze drone imagery for irrigation management. Covers basic research The amended agreement focuses on basic research in fields such as weather, oceanography and geology. It supports U.S. scientific agencies with research related to tsunami warnings, influenza data, air quality monitoring, agriculture, and pest management, according to the State Department. Another senior State Department official said the amended STA framework enables agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the departments of Energy and Agriculture to propose cooperation and set up data-sharing agreements and joint research projects with their Chinese counterparts. The State Department reviews proposed collaborations, which also undergo a broader interagency review process led by the White House. Once vetted, the proposals can be implemented. If either party fails to adhere to the agreed terms, a dispute resolution mechanism is triggered. Additionally, a termination clause allows cancellation of proposed projects in the case of 'bad faith action.' The amended agreement 'sustains intellectual property protections and establishes new guardrails for implementing agencies to protect the safety and security of their researchers,' according to a State Department statement. Security concerns However, concerns persist regarding China's stricter data localization and privacy laws, which raise legal risks for U.S. researchers handling Chinese data. The new STA has yet to clarify the protections available for U.S. researchers who may use or transfer Chinese data outside of China. Congressional critics, including Republican Senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick to be secretary of state, have been outspoken opponents of renewing U.S.-China science and technology cooperation. Earlier this year, Rubio called for stronger measures to safeguard the security of U.S. scientific research. He also introduced a bill to underscore the risks posed by problematic research collaborations with Chinese-linked entities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-china-sign-5-year-amended-agreement-on-science-and-technology-cooperation-/7900132.html	2024-12-13T05:13:17-08:00	
Moldova declares a state of emergency over energy as fears of Russian gas shortage loom	CHISINAU — Moldova's parliament on Friday voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector over fears that Russia could leave the European Union candidate country without sufficient natural gas supplies this winter. A majority in Moldova's 101-seat legislature voted to pass the state of emergency, which will start on Dec. 16 and last 60 days. A special commission will urgently adopt measures to manage 'imminent risks' if Moscow fails to supply gas to the Kuciurgan power plant, the country's largest, which is situated in the separatist pro-Russian Transnistria region. Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean said his country faces an 'exceptional situation' in which Moscow could deliberately weaponize energy flows to destabilize the country, and potentially leave people 'in the middle of winter without heat and electricity.' Russian energy giant Gazprom supplies the gas-operated Kuciurgan plant, which generates electricity that powers a significant portion of Moldova proper. The plant was privatized in 2004 by Transnistrian officials and later sold to a Russian state-owned company. Moldova doesn't recognize the privatization. In late 2022, Moldova suffered major power outages following Russian strikes on neighboring Ukraine, which is interconnected to the Kuciurgan plant. 'This must be the last winter in the country's history in which we can still be threatened with energy,' Recean said. 'It is clear that these crises are deliberately provoked, and their goal is to create panic and chaos.' He added that a cessation of natural gas could trigger economic and humanitarian crises, but vowed that nobody in Moldova would be left 'in the cold and dark.' Transnistria, which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries, also declared its own state of emergency this week in case the region does not receive gas supplies. When Russia fully invaded Ukraine in 2022, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.5 million people, was entirely dependent on Moscow for natural gas but has since pushed to diversify and expand its energy sources. Sebastian Burduja, Romania's energy minister, said late Thursday that Romania has the resources to support Moldova 'if the situation demands it,' saying it would be 'a duty … in the face of the aggressions coming from the east.' In October, Moldova's pro-Western President Maia Sandu won a second term in office, and a referendum voted in favor of securing the country's path toward the EU, in two votes overshadowed by ongoing claims of Russian interference to derail the country's westward shift in recent years. Russia denies it is meddling in Moldova.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldova-declares-a-state-of-emergency-over-energy-as-fears-of-russian-gas-shortage-loom-/7900095.html	2024-12-13T04:56:25-08:00	
Georgia crisis deepens as government set to name far-right president	Tbilisi — Georgia's political crisis deepened Friday after new pro-Europe protests were announced ahead of the controversial nomination of a far-right government loyalist as president. The Black Sea nation has been in turmoil since the governing Georgian Dream party claimed victory in contested October parliamentary elections, with its decision last month to delay EU accession talks igniting a fresh wave of mass rallies. More unrest is expected on Saturday when Georgian Dream will appoint far-right former footballer Mikheil Kavelashvili as president in a controversial election process. The pro-Western incumbent, President Salome Zurabishvili, has refused to step down and is demanding new parliamentary elections, paving the way for a constitutional showdown. Opposition groups accuse Georgian Dream of rigging the parliamentary vote, democratic backsliding in office and moving Tbilisi closer to Russia — all at the expensive of the Caucasus nation's bid for EU membership. A forceful police crackdown on the protestors has also triggered outrage at home and condemnation abroad. Washington imposed fresh sanctions on Georgian officials overnight, barring visas for around 20 people accused of 'undermining democracy in Georgia,' including sitting ministers and parliamentarians, the U.S. State Department said. Police have used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the rallies, arresting more than 400 demonstrators, and the country's rights ombudsman has accused security forces of 'torturing' those detained. 'Unprecedented constitutional crisis' Pro-EU demonstrators have staged daily rallies across Georgia for the last two weeks, with more to take place across Tbilisi on Friday. On Saturday, an electoral college controlled by Georgian Dream is expected to elect Kavelashvili as the country's new figurehead president, in an indirect vote boycotted by the opposition. Kavelashvili, 53, is known for his vehement anti-West diatribes and opposition to LGBTQ rights. Georgian Dream scrapped direct presidential elections in 2017. With Zurabishvili refusing to leave office, opposition lawmakers boycotting Parliament and protests showing no signs of abating, critics are questioning Kavelashvili's legitimacy before he even takes up the role. One author of Georgia's constitution, Vakhtang Khmaladze, has argued that all decisions by the new Parliament are void because the body started work before awaiting the outcome of a lawsuit brought by Zurabishvili. 'Georgia is facing an unprecedented constitutional crisis,' Khmaladze told AFP. It remains unclear how the government will react to Zurabishvili's refusal to step down after her successor is inaugurated on December 29. A former French diplomat, Zurabishvili is a hugely popular figure among protesters who view her as a beacon of Georgia's European aspirations. 'Let them try to kick Salome out of the presidential palace -- we will all stand up to defend her,' Otar Turnava, a 23-year-old protester, told AFP at a rally outside Parliament on Thursday. 'She is the only legitimate leader we have had since Georgian Dream stole the election, and she will lead us into the EU.' 'Brutal violence' In power for more than a decade, Georgian Dream has pushed increasingly conservative policies in recent years, including measures targeting civil society, independent media, opposition parties and the LGBTQ community. Critics say the moves mirror repressive Russian-style legislation and Brussels has called them 'incompatible' with EU membership. Amid the latest crisis, police have raided the offices of opposition parties and the prime minister has repeatedly pledged to 'eradicate liberal fascism.' Announcing the latest visa bans on top Georgian figures, U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said: 'The United States strongly condemns the Georgian Dream party's ongoing, brutal, and unjustified violence against Georgian citizens, including protesters, members of the media, human rights activists, and opposition figures.' Georgia's Parliament speaker Shalva Papuashvili called the move 'incomprehensible and meaningless,' accusing the outgoing U.S. administration of 'deliberately worsening relations with Georgia.' He struck back at critics of Kavelashvili, saying 'it is vital to have a president who does not fall under the influence of a foreign power, as is the case with Ms. Salome Zurabishvili.' French President Emmanuel Macron also condemned the ongoing repressions in a phone call to Georgian Dream's honorary chairman and founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili. The secretive billionaire, widely assumed to be Georgia's real power broker, raged against the West on the campaign trail earlier this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-crisis-deepens-as-government-set-to-name-far-right-president-/7900086.html	2024-12-13T04:52:48-08:00	
Ukraine's reformed military procurement agency drives country's NATO ambitions	KYIV — Ukraine's Defense Ministry unveiled a new state agency for its armed forces last year. It was the government's answer to the rampant corruption within the ministry's procurement companies and meant to be a driver of reform on the elusive path toward NATO membership. The enterprise, in charge of purchasing nonlethal military goods such as food, clothes and fuel, has already contracted 95% of the products requested for supply, and saved 25% in the process, says Arsen Zhumadilov, the CEO of the State Logistics Operator, known by the local abbreviation DOT. Soon, he says, DOT also will begin procuring drones. These kinds of results are an example of the type of reform that Ukraine hopes will help clear the path toward NATO, a key deterrent against Russia, officials have argued. Membership in the alliance remains largely a political question, with key states reluctant to grant it, fearing escalation from Moscow. Western officials are also keenly awaiting the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump before making declarations. But NATO officials have also demanded widespread anti-graft reforms before Kyiv can join. Change has been a difficult pill for many within Ukraine's post-Soviet institutions to swallow. DOT's promising results so far stand in contrast to the deeply rooted challenges that continue to plague the tenure of Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, including slow progress with restructuring the institution and ongoing allegations of corruption within lethal military procurement. Recently, Umerov has come under scrutiny in the Ukrainian press for appointing ministry officials with whom he also has close business ties, including Zhumadilov. Western officials are closely monitoring DOT, three Western diplomats told The Associated Press. So far, they have been pleased with the results one year since it was formed. They spoke on condition of anonymity in order to speak freely about their assessments. DOT embodies the uneasy coexistence of a digital-savvy youthful ethos and paper-heavy post-Soviet bureaucracy. Its office exudes a fresh startup culture vibe, while catering to one of the most stubbornly rigid ministries in the country. The contrast underscores the spirit of how Russia's war in Ukraine is being fought, in which innovative drone wars coincide with World War II-style trenches. 'We understand that we have been on the radars of NATO, of G7 [Group of Seven] countries, of all NATO member countries in terms of whether we manage or not to put in place a procurement system that is resilient, that is effective, efficient, and that is not prone to corruption,' Zhumadilov said. Nonlethal military purchases became the focus of two corruption scandals under the leadership of Oleksii Reznikov, the previous defense minister. The first involved inflated prices for food supplies and the other was connected to low-quality winter jackets. Umerov, Reznikov's successor, has described DOT as not just a new agency, but as the beginning of a new public procurement architecture in Ukraine's defense sector. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy specifically tasked Umerov to increase transparency in defense procurement where corruption has always been rife. Zhumadilov, an influential public figure with Crimean Tatar origins known for spearheading reforms in public procurement, was selected because of his previous track record of success. He previously headed Ukraine's procurement of medical supplies. He was appointed to the role in Reznikov's time. Plastered on the wall of the agency is a mood board devised by the company's marketing department. A photo of a military vehicle is placed next to a snaking jungle dirt road, a drone in flight next to a fluffy puppy in midair, a Rubik's Cube and a designer candle. Staff wear oversized hoodies and T-shirts, a contrast to the military fatigues adorned by ministry officials. DOT's answer to increasing transparency is DOT-Chain, an IT system that manages the army's supply demands by digitizing the entire process, from the submission of applications to issuing invoices. Developed by a team of DOT IT specialists, it could reduce delivery time fourfold and is the largest digital project in the institution. For now it will cover foodstuffs, but Zhumadilov envisions scaling it up. There were blips on the road. A planned merger with the Defense Procurement Agency, the state company in charge of purchasing lethal military supplies, was aborted after NATO officials recommended against it, casting Umerov's decision-making in a negative light and raising concerns they were driven by personal preferences. Acknowledging that corrupt practices in defense purchases has plagued Ukraine for years, Umerov has said the state needed to eliminate the 'Soviet, oligarchic' approach to public funds. But, like most things in the war, that is easier said than done. Zhumadilov said their company still faces resistance from ministry officials set in their old ways. 'We are trying to be open to our colleagues at Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but at the same time, and this is also good news, we are an autonomous agency within a larger ecosystem, we can preserve our own culture here.' DOT-Chain, which was designed to lower the burden of army paperwork, for instance, still faces pushback from bureaucrats who prefer signing thousands of papers per week to clicking a smartphone. 'They say that we don't need that. We just want to keep on signing papers,' he said. 'We are saying, 'Look, the sheer amount of papers that you are signing on a weekly basis … it is just unsustainable.''	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-s-reformed-military-procurement-agency-drives-country-s-nato-ambitions-/7900048.html	2024-12-13T03:56:05-08:00	
Switzerland plans revamp of Cold War-era nuclear bunker network	GOLLION, Switzerland — Switzerland wants to update its network of aging nuclear shelters, which are increasingly seen as an asset at a time of greater global uncertainty, notably since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thanks to a 1963 law, Switzerland is already ahead of neighbors like Germany. Each of its 9 million residents, including foreigners and refugees, is guaranteed a spot in a bunker to protect them from bombs and nuclear radiation. 'In the coming years, the [Swiss] Confederation wants to remove some of the exceptions to the current rules and update some of the older shelters,' Louis-Henri Delarageaz, civil protection commander for the Vaud canton, told Reuters. The government launched consultations in October to ensure Swiss 'resilience in the event of armed conflict' and plans a $250 million upgrade of old structures. 'It doesn't mean we're preparing for a conflict – that's not the message – but we have a network of shelters and we need to maintain them and make sure they're functional.' In the village of Bercher in Vaud canton, civil protection officers in orange overalls inspected a bunker beneath an apartment block as part of a mandatory 10-year check-up. One tried to shove the bunker's door to seal it shut but it would not budge. An air vent wedged between plant pots and a stone ornament was deemed fit, but an escape tunnel full of cobwebs led to a deep manhole with no ladder. 'This shelter is not usable in the current state,' concluded team head Gregory Fuhrer. The owner will be given a year to fix the faults or else must pay $900 for each resident's spot in a public shelter, he added. Switzerland has stayed out of foreign wars since it became neutral in 1815. It was occupied by France in the 18th century and suffered some aerial bombing in World War II. Delarageaz said his office had received a surge in calls from worried residents about shelters after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. 'All of a sudden ... we were indeed extremely sought-after with people wanting to know: where the shelters were, where is my place, is my shelter ready?' he said, adding that requests for a spot from French citizens had to be turned down. While most Swiss have private shelters, some rely on community bunkers. Next to his office is one of the canton's 350 such shelters, well-maintained with bunk beds and toilets. Nearby is an underground command center, an underground hospital with an operating theater and decontamination showers and a bunker to protect works of art. 'In Switzerland we have foresight,' said Delarageaz. 'There's a Latin adage that says: 'If you want peace, prepare for war'.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/switzerland-plans-revamp-of-cold-war-era-nuclear-bunker-network-/7900040.html	2024-12-13T03:34:29-08:00	
China jails former national football coach for 20 years for bribery	BEIJING — The former coach of the Chinese men's national football team has received a 20-year-prison sentence for bribery, Chinese state media reported Friday. Liu Tie, who once played in the English Premier League as a midfielder for Everton, was found guilty of 'leveraging his positions' as head coach of the national football and national selection team to receive bribes of more than 50 million yuan (about $7 million), by a court in the city of Xianning in the central Hubei province. Liu coached the Chinese men's team between January 2020 and December 2021. He was also charged with taking bribes between 2015 to 2019, when he worked for local football clubs. The investigation into Liu's conduct began in November 2022. He pleaded guilty to bribery and corruption in March of this year. His sentencing is the latest in a series of high-profile corruption cases involving Chinese football. In March, the former president of the Chinese Football Association, Chen Xuyuan, was sentenced to life in prison for bribery. Earlier this week, three other CFA officials received prison sentences for bribery, according to state media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-jails-former-national-football-coach-for-20-years-for-bribery/7899981.html	2024-12-13T01:10:41-08:00	
Blinken talks with Turkey's top diplomat about Syrian rebels	ANKARA, TURKEY — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken began talks with Turkey's top diplomat Friday after reassurances that Ankara would never allow any let-up in the fight against rebels in Syria following the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. Blinken began meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan at 9:40 a.m., a U.S. official said. He flew into the Turkish capital late Thursday and met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for more than an hour at the VIP lounge inside Ankara airport, a U.S. official said. During their talks, Erdogan said Turkey would never ease up in the fight against rebels from the Islamist State group in Syria, despite its efforts to target a U.S.-backed Kurdish group seen as key to containing the extremists. 'Turkey will never allow any weakness to arise in the fight against ISIS,' Erdogan told him, according to an overnight statement from his office. Turkey, he said, would take 'preventive measures against all terrorist organizations, primarily the PKK/PYD/YPG and ISIS (IS) terrorist organizations, operating in Syria and posing a threat to Turkey, primarily for its own national security.' The YPG is a Kurdish force that makes up the bulk of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed group that spearheaded the offensive that defeated IS's self-declared caliphate in Syria in 2019. Ankara views the YPG and its political wing, the PYD, as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) that has led a decadeslong insurgency against the Turkish state, effectively blacklisting the SDF as a terror outfit. 'Critical' role against IS U.S. backing for the SDF has put it sharply at odds with Ankara. As the Islamist-led rebels marched on Damascus, the SNA, a Turkish proxy force, began its own offensive against the SDF, raising concerns about the two NATO allies' competing interests in Syria. Turkey sees armed Kurdish forces so close to its southern border as a threat. And while Washington has acknowledged its security concerns, Blinken said Thursday that the SDF was 'critical' to preventing an IS resurgence. 'At a time when we want to see this transition ... to a better way forward for Syria, part of that also has to be ensuring that ISIS doesn't rear its ugly head again,' he said. 'Critical to making sure that doesn't happen are the so-called SDF -- the Syrian Democratic Forces,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-talks-with-turkey-s-top-diplomat-about-syrian-rebels/7899979.html	2024-12-13T00:58:54-08:00	
Russia launches massive aerial attack against Ukraine with cruise missiles, drones	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russia on Friday launched a massive aerial attack against Ukraine, involving dozens of cruise missiles and drones. The Russian military targeted Ukrainian power grid, energy minister Herman Halushchenko wrote on his Facebook page. 'The enemy continues its terror,' he said. Halushchenko said energy workers do everything necessary to 'minimize negative consequences for the energy system,' promising to release more details on damages once the security situation allows it. Ukraine's air force reported multiple strike drones launched at Ukraine overnight followed by swarms of cruise missiles in country's air space. It said Russia also used air-launched ballistic Kinzhal missiles against Ukraine's western regions. Friday's attack is the latest in a series of such raids that heightened fears that the Kremlin aims to cripple the country's power generation capacity as the winter sets in. Since launching its invasion in February 2022, Russia has relentlessly pummeled Ukraine's electricity system, resulting in repeated shutdown of critical heating and drinking water supplies during the bitter winter months in an apparent attempt to break Ukrainian spirits and resolve. Moscow has declared that the attacks were aimed to hobble Ukraine's defense industry producing missiles, drones, armored vehicles and artillery among other weapons. The previous such massive attack on November 28 involved about 200 missiles and drones and left more than a million households without power until emergency teams restored supplies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-launches-massive-aerial-attack-against-ukraine-with-cruise-missiles-drones/7899957.html	2024-12-12T23:48:37-08:00	
South Korea opposition leader says impeaching Yoon best way to restore order	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung said on Friday the best way to restore order in the country is to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol, a day ahead of a planned parliamentary vote over Yoon's short-lived imposition of martial law. Yoon's move to impose military rule on December 3 was rescinded barely six hours later but it plunged the country into a constitutional crisis and widespread calls for him to step down for breaking the law. Yoon on Thursday vowed to 'fight to the end,' blaming the opposition party for paralyzing the government and claiming a North Korean hack into the election commission made his party's crushing defeat in an April parliamentary election questionable. Democratic Party leader Lee called Yoon's remarks 'a declaration of war' against the people. 'It proved that impeachment is the fastest and the most effect way to end the confusion,' he said. Yoon survived the first attempt to impeach him last Saturday when most of his ruling People Power Party (PPP) boycotted the vote. Since then, at least seven PPP members have publicly supported a vote to impeach him. Opposition parties, which control the single-chamber parliament, have introduced another impeachment bill and plan to hold a vote at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT) on Saturday. They need at least eight PPP members to pass the bill with the two-third majority required. Lee called on opposition members to 'join and vote yes for impeachment,' saying 'history will remember and record your decision.' A vote to impeach Yoon would send the case to the Constitutional Court, which has up to six months to decide whether to remove him from office or reinstate him. There was more criticism of Yoon's defiant address on Thursday, including his claim that a hack by North Korea last year may have compromised the computer system of the National Election Commission, without citing evidence. Yoon cited as one reason for declaring martial law a refusal by the commission to cooperate fully in a systems inspection which meant the integrity of the parliamentary election held in April could not be assured. On Friday, the Secretary General of the commission, Kim Yong-bin, denied the possibility of election fraud, saying voting is entirely done by paper ballots and the courts have dismissed all 216 claims of irregularities raised as groundless. Yoon is separately under criminal investigation for alleged insurrection over the martial law declaration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-opposition-leader-says-impeaching-yoon-best-way-to-restore-order-/7899947.html	2024-12-12T23:00:52-08:00	
‘We have nowhere to go’: Exiled from Myanmar, journalists fear new Thai law	BANGKOK — Fleeing an arrest warrant issued by Myanmar’s junta, journalist Nyan Linn Htet moved to neighboring Thailand three years ago. From there, the founder and managing editor at the Mekong News Agency has continued to provide coverage of issues affecting his home country. But a new law being debated in the Thai parliament could damage the fragile existence that he and so many others in exile from Myanmar have. The Association and Foundations Bill was proposed in the Thai parliament in October. If passed, it would require nonprofits to register with the Minister of Interior and to have of a minimum of 30 Thai staff members. Noncompliance comes with fines of up to $3,000. The draft bill is concerning for journalists like Nyan, who have been working from exile in Thailand since the February 2021 military coup. Many registered their outlets as nonprofits, and do not have the capacity to comply with the law. 'The new draft bill is one of the challenges for our exiled media,' Nyan told VOA. 'When it comes to making financial information available to Thai authorities, many local media can find it difficult to follow since they are currently operating with the financial support made by the donors or [nongovernmental organizations].' Thailand’s government says the bill is needed to counter national security concerns. But analysts say it would give authorities expansive powers and could make the work of Myanmar’s exiled media more precarious. Akarachai Chaimaneekarakate, an advocacy lead at Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, says the legislation could lead to interference in nonprofits, and would give authorities the power to dissolve organizations and put civil society organizations at risk of being deemed national security threats. 'The draft act on Association and Foundations is yet another attempt by the authorities to monitor and control the work of civil society organizations, many of which take the form of either an association or a foundation,' he told VOA by email. Akarachai noted that the law would give authorities 'expansive powers' to close organizations on grounds such as 'good morals of the people,' 'public order,' or 'national security.' Failure to submit an annual report or balance sheet within 30 days could also result in being closed. Thailand is not alone in passing laws around foreign funding and national security. 'The Ministry of Interior and related national security agencies seem determined to follow the lead of authoritarian neighbors like Cambodia and Vietnam in severely restricting civil society organizations, regardless of the damage it does to Thailand’s reputation and its ability to operate as a regional hub for international agencies,' Phil Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates, told VOA. The Thai government 'need to live up their progressive principles and face down this conservative threat against people’s civil and political freedoms,' he said. Safe haven Thailand, which has a 2,400-kilometer border with Myanmar, has seen thousands of people flee the conflict between opposition groups and junta forces. When Myanmar’s military seized power, it revoked some broadcast licenses and detained dozens of journalists, including a VOA contributor. Fearing arrest or retaliation, many journalists fled. In Thailand they found a temporary base, especially in border towns. But the threat of being sent back to Myanmar weighs heavily. Strict paperwork and requirements make it hard for Myanmar nationals to get proper media visas. Not all of them have the necessary documentation after fleeing their homes, and some are wanted by the junta over their coverage. Journalist Toe Zaw Latt says most exiled media chose Thailand because they had 'nowhere else to go.' It offers better facilities including internet connection and communications as well as 'easy access to the sources,' he told VOA. The journalist said he believes it would be impractical for the media to operate further away. And if the legislation comes into force in Thailand, he predicts many will evade it. 'A lot [of journalists] will go undercover. I don't think any media want to legally register under Thai law, simply because they don't trust it, or [because it’s] very difficult,' he said. In Nyan’s case, he says the majority of his 17-person team are based in Thailand. 'We can’t afford to move back to Myanmar since it is crystal clear that we are at risk of being arrested, tortured or even murdered unlawfully,' Nyan said. Myanmar is one of the world’s worst jailers of journalists, ranking second, only behind China. At least seven journalists have also been killed since the coup, according to data by the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. Shawn Crispin, CPJ’s senior Southeast Asia representative, described the draft bill as a danger for Myanmar media 'that operate from Thailand and play crucial roles in supporting the many Myanmar journalists driven into exile since the 2021 coup.' 'Thai lawmakers should scrap this severe and wrong-headed legislation and allow Myanmar's exile media organizations to continue functioning without fear of reprisal,' he told VOA via email. Nyan fears that a reduction in active exiled Myanmar media in Thailand will pave the way for Myanmar state media to spread disinformation. He says if the law comes into force and Myanmar media are forced to leave Thailand, it will mean there is only limited independent news in Myanmar. 'This will result in having military’s disinformation, misinformation or hate speech campaigns proliferated seriously,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7899939.html	2024-12-12T22:46:27-08:00	
US charges ex-head of Syrian prison with torture	LOS ANGELES — The former head of a notorious Syrian prison was charged Thursday in the United States with torturing opponents of the now-collapsed government of Bashar al-Assad, the Justice Department said. Samir Ousman Alsheikh, 72, who has been in the U.S. since 2020, allegedly ran Damascus Central Prison -- known colloquially as Adra Prison -- from approximately 2005 to 2008, where detainees were subjected to horrific abuse in the 'Punishment Wing.' The charges come days after Assad fled the country as his government crumbled, and as millions of Syrians begin a reckoning with decades of repression. Alsheikh personally inflicted severe physical and mental pain on detainees, as well as ordering his staff to carry out such acts, U.S. prosecutors said. Under Alsheikh, prisoners were beaten while hung from the ceiling or subjected to a device known as the 'Flying Carpet,' which folded their bodies in half at the waist, causing excruciating pain and sometimes resulting in fractured spines. 'We are one step closer to holding him accountable for those heinous crimes. The United States will never be a safe haven for those who commit human rights abuses abroad,' said Eddy Wang, special agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigations Los Angeles field office. Alsheikh faces three counts of torture and one count of conspiracy to commit torture. He was arrested in July at the Los Angeles airport on separate immigration fraud charges. If convicted, he could be jailed for up to 20 years for each of the torture charges. The Justice Department said Alsheikh held a variety of positions in the Syrian police and the Syrian state security apparatus. He was also associated with the Syrian Ba'ath Party that ruled the country and had been appointed governor of the province of Deir Ez-Zour by Assad in 2011. He moved to the United States in 2020 and applied for citizenship in 2023. A simmering civil war in Syria erupted late last month with a lightning offensive spearheaded by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group and its allies. After racing through several major cities, the rebels quickly swept Damascus, sending Assad fleeing to Russia and bringing a sudden end to five decades of repressive rule by his clan. Syrians have since flocked to prisons searching for missing loved ones. Tens of thousands of people died of torture or as a result of the conditions of their detention in prisons under Assad's rule since the civil war erupted in 2011, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-charges-ex-head-of-syrian-prison-with-torture/7899929.html	2024-12-12T21:46:29-08:00	
Malawi president appeals for international food aid	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — Malawi’s President Lazarus Chakwera has renewed his appeal for international assistance to address severe food shortages affecting more than one quarter of the country’s population of 20 million. Malawi is currently facing one of its worst food shortage situations in decades with about 5.7 million people affected, according to a recent Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee report. This is about a quarter of the country’s population of about 20 million people. In rural areas, some villagers were reported to be surviving on wild plants like buffalo beans. In a televised address to the nation Wednesday evening, Chakwera discussed the ongoing issue. 'We are not out of the woods yet,' he said. 'This is why I continue to lobby for international support to address the humanitarian crisis we are facing.' In March of this year, the president appealed for $200 million in food aid for millions of citizens facing starvation due to a drought linked to the El Nino weather condition. In his renewed appeal on Wednesday, Chakwera acknowledged the donations that Malawi has so far received from various development partners through the U.N. World Food Program. 'From the governments of Sweden and Netherlands, the WFP received a donation of $11.8 million,' he said. 'I say thank you. From the government of the United States, the WFP received a donation of $7 million, and I say thank you. From the government of the United Kingdom, the WFP received a donation of $3.8 million , and I say thank you. From the government of Japan, the WFP received a donation of $1.9 million, and I say thank you.' Chakwera said additional food aid is urgently needed to save lives. 'If you are out there standing with Malawians and giving them the help they need during this crisis, I can assure you that Malawians are honest and fair-minded people who will remember those who are bringing them food in this season of drought and hunger, and who know how to distinguish them from those who brought them nothing,' he said. Kylie Scott, head of partnerships and communication for the U.N.’s World Food program in Malawi, told VOA that the U.N.’s food agency still needs more assistance. 'At the moment, we have got funding until the end of the year,' Scott said. 'But there will be a gap until March 2025. So, we are working really hard to make sure that we can close that gap and make sure that no one gets left behind.' In the meantime, Malawi’s Department of Disaster Management Affairs, the World Food Program and several local humanitarian organizations are distributing assistance to communities facing food shortages.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malawi-president-appeals-for-international-food-aid/7899917.html	2024-12-12T20:48:26-08:00

American imprisoned in Assad's Syria calls his release from prison a 'blessing'	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — An American who disappeared seven months ago into former Syrian President Bashar Assad's notorious prison system said early Friday he was released by the 'liberators' who arrived in Damascus a day after the longtime ruler fled the capital. Travis Timmerman called his release a 'blessing' when he spoke to The Associated Press from a hotel room in Damascus, where he arrived late Thursday. He was among the thousands of people released from Syria's sprawling military prisons this week after rebels reached Damascus, overthrowing Assad and ending his family's 54-year rule. Timmerman, 29, said he had gone to Syria on a Christian pilgrimage and was not ill-treated while in Palestine Branch, a notorious detention facility operated by Syrian intelligence. He said he was freed by 'the liberators who came into the prison and knocked the door down (of his cell) with a hammer.' The political affairs office of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that led the lightning offensive to topple Assad's government, said the group had secured his release. 'We affirm our readiness to cooperate directly with the U.S. administration to complete the search for American citizens disappeared by the former Assad regime,' the group said, adding that a search was under way for Austin Tice, an American journalist who went missing in Syria 12 years ago. An official with the group later said it was arranging for Timmerman to leave Syria, but gave no details. Timmerman said he was released Monday morning alongside a young Syrian man and 70 female prisoners, some of whom had their children with them. He had been held separately from Syrian and other Arab prisoners and said he didn't know of any other Americans held in the facility. 'I was there seven months. There were women there up above me,' Timmerman said. He heard the women singing and teaching their children and could hear some of the men being beaten regularly. 'I was never beaten,' he said. He was detained after he crossed into Syria from a mountain along the eastern Lebanese town of Zahle in June. He was questioned for three and half hours by interrogators who thought he must be a spy. In a brief second interview, they searched his mobile phone, and in the last interview, he started discussing his dreams with his captors. He said their threat of using violence against him was 'implicit' because he could hear daily beatings next door. But his captors let him use his mobile to call his family three weeks ago. At the time, Timmerman didn't tell his family he was in Damascus, only that he was fine. He said later in his detention, he could hear explosions — at a time when Israel was intensifying its strikes in Syria. Israel's war with the Hezbollah militant group had intensified in September, before a ceasefire was reached last month. 'I heard some explosives that shook the building,' he said. In his prison cell, Timmerman said he had a mattress, a plastic drinking container and two others for waste. He had three bathroom breaks and had exercise breaks in the first half of his stay. He said the Friday calls to prayers helped keep track of days. He said he gained weight at first because he ate unleavened bread, rice and oats. Sometimes he would get a potato or a tomato — a treatment clearly reserved for non-Syrian prisoners, who often ended up emaciated or sick. 'It is a time of solace and you can meditate on your life,' he told AP. 'It was good for me.' Timmerman was disheveled, with a scraggly beard and long hair and nails. He said he had a good sleep and a meal on Thursday. He said he planned to return to Damascus. Timmerman is from Urbana, Missouri, about 80 kilometers north of Springfield in the southwestern part of the state. He earned a finance degree from Missouri State University in 2017. Timmerman's mother, Stacey Gardiner, told the AP that as of Thursday evening, she hadn't spoken to her son. She said he told her he was visiting Prague and Budapest, Hungary, to 'write about different churches.' She said she last heard from him in May, when he said he was going somewhere without internet and that he would call when he had access again. Then he stopped replying to calls and texts and she didn't know whether he was alive or dead. 'I couldn't help him, and that broke my heart more and more each day,' Gardiner said. 'I just want my baby (to) come home.' The family reported him missing, and the Missouri State Highway Patrol issued a bulletin saying 'Pete Timmerman' had gone missing in Hungary in early June. In late August, Hungarian police put out a missing persons announcement for 'Travis Pete Timmerman,' saying he was last seen at a church in Budapest. Timmerman goes by Travis. In describing his release from prison, Timmerman said the action outside his cell woke him up. Those who came to release him spoke to him in Arabic. 'It was an excited scene. It was not clear if the guards who were there were still there,' Timmerman said. 'I didn't know if they were taking us out in the midst of a war zone … in hindsight, this shooting was not actual clashes.' He said he was panicked for a moment. But he realized some of the gunfire was celebratory from blanks. One man was shooting from an AK-47. At one point, he went running back into the prison with two other prisoners. A fellow prisoner helped him out, holding his arm, and speaking Arabic to those around. They both accompanied a female prisoner to her home. He spent two nights in Damascus, one in abandoned apartment in the old town and another at a new friend's house. He then started walking toward Jordan, when a Syrian family found him barefoot on a main road in the countryside of Damascus early Thursday. At first some mistook him for Tice. The Syrian family told AP that Timmerman appeared cold and hungry so they brought him back to their home. 'I fed him and called a doctor,' said Mosaed al-Rifai, the 68-year-old waste collector who first found Timmerman. A few hours after al-Rifai discovered him, rebels arrived at the family's house to pick him up, he said. Mouaz Mostafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a U.S.-based nonprofit group, who was in Damascus learned of Timmerman's location, reached him and contacted US authorities about him. Timmerman is now recovering until the rebels can figure out how to hand him to U.S. authorities, Moustafa said. From Aqaba, Jordan, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that the White House was 'working to bring him home, to bring him out of Syria' but declined further comment for privacy reasons. Washington's top hostage negotiator, Roger Carstens, travelled to Lebanon this week in hopes of collecting information on the whereabouts of Tice. President Joe Biden has said his administration believed Tice was alive and was committed to bringing him home, though he also acknowledged on Sunday that 'we have no direct evidence' of his status. The case has frustrated U.S. intelligence officials for years. 'This is a priority for the United States,' Blinken said.

China-Russia Arctic cooperation a US national security concern	LOS ANGELES — The United States and its NATO allies are paying increased attention to military cooperation between Russia and China in the Arctic, where the two countries have conducted joint naval exercises, coast guard patrols and strategic bomber air training. That cooperation includes more closely coordinated military drills, said Iris Ferguson, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for Arctic and Global Resilience. She spoke during an online December 5 discussion hosted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'The increasing levels of collaboration between Russia and the PRC [People’s Republic of China] and the unprecedented style of collaboration, especially in the military domain, give us again pause,' said Ferguson. In October, the coast guards of China and Russia conducted their first joint Arctic maritime patrol. In July, four Russian and Chinese strategic bombers flew over the Chukchi Sea and the Bering Sea, marking the first time their military aircraft launched from the same airbase in northern Russia and the first time Chinese bombers flew within the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone. China and Russia also held joint naval exercises in the Bering Strait in 2022 and 2023. China has no Arctic territory of its own but is interested in growing opportunities for mineral exploration and a shipping route to Europe as climate change causes the Arctic ice cap to recede. 'It is an interesting development showing that a level of cooperation that a few years ago we didn’t think will get to that level,' said Stephanie Pezard, associate research department director at the RAND Corporation, headquartered in Santa Monica, California. As recently as a few years ago, she told VOA Mandarin earlier this week, 'Russia was really trying to beat China in industrial development in the Arctic.' The U.S. Department of Defense published a '2024 Arctic Strategy' in July that identifies Chinese and Russian collaboration as a major geopolitical challenge driving the need for a new strategic approach to the Arctic. Chang Ching, a senior researcher from the Society for Strategic Studies based in Taipei, said China's presence in the Arctic creates pressure on the U.S. and other countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). 'In the past, Russia was the only traditional adversary in the Arctic, but now there is an additional challenge,' Chang told VOA Mandarin this week. No immediate threat Other NATO members are responding to the increased military activities of Russia and China in the Arctic. Canada released a new Arctic Foreign Policy report December 6 to address its growing military cooperation with other like-minded nations in the region. The report recommends that Canada strengthen diplomatic and technological cooperation with NATO countries in the Arctic and like-minded nations such as Japan and South Korea. It also emphasizes enhancing Canada's military presence in the Arctic. Canada’s Arctic territory makes up about 40% of the country and more than 70% of its coastline. Canada, Finland, and the U.S. in November agreed to jointly build icebreakers, ships to cut through frozen waters, a decision driven at least in part by a desire to counter Russia's influence in the region. Despite their stepped-up joint military activities in the Arctic, analysts say China and Russia do not pose an immediate threat to the U.S. and its partners in the region. 'I think it’s really important to not overstate what the PRC is getting from Russia as well,' Ferguson said. 'We know what it takes to operate with allies. We know the years of investment and trust building and interoperability required to make an alliance, and you know their flying in [a] circle together is not the same.' Why is China in the Arctic? China is a new player in the Arctic. Beijing’s 'Arctic Policy White Paper,' published in 2018, stated that China's polar strategy focuses on issues such as climate change, environmental protection, scientific research, navigation routes, resource exploration and development, security and international governance. 'China will not and has no intention of using Arctic issues to promote its geopolitical interests,' said the Chinese Embassy to VOA Mandarin in an emailed response Wednesday to the comments made at the online CSIS discussion. 'As a non-Arctic country, China is an active participant, builder and contributor to Arctic affairs, contributing its wisdom and strength to the change and development of the Arctic,' the embassy statement said. However, Yang Zhen and Ren Yanyan, researchers at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, suggest that China-Russia naval cooperation in the Arctic is a way to counterbalance what they call the U.S.’s 'maritime hegemony.' Meanwhile, Beijing and Moscow have been developing Arctic shipping routes, especially for Russian oil and gas, as Western sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have largely halted the trade with Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-russia-arctic-cooperation-a-us-national-security-concern/7899904.html	2024-12-12T20:02:04-08:00	
San Francisco names street for Associated Press Iwo Jima photographer	SAN FRANCISCO — A photojournalist who captured one of the most enduring images of World War II — the U.S. Marines raising the flag on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima — had a block in downtown San Francisco named for him Thursday. Joe Rosenthal, who died in 2006 at age 94, was working for The Associated Press in 1945 when he took the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo. After the war, he went to work as a staff photographer for the San Francisco Chronicle, and for 35 years until his retirement in 1981, he captured moments of city life both extraordinary and routine. Rosenthal photographed famous people for the paper, including a young Willie Mays getting his hat fitted as a San Francisco Giant in 1957, and regular people, including children making a joyous dash for freedom on the last day of school in 1965. The 600 block of Sutter Street, near downtown's Union Square, became Joe Rosenthal Way after a short ceremony Thursday morning. The Marines Memorial Club, which sits on the block, welcomed the street's new name. Aaron Peskin, who heads the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, welcomed the city's political elite, military officials and members of Rosenthal's family to toast the late photographer, who was born in Washington, D.C., to Russian Jewish immigrant parents. The famous photo became the centerpiece of a war bonds poster that helped raise $26 billion in 1945. Tom Graves, chapter historian for the USMC Combat Correspondents Association, which pushed for the street naming, said the image helped win the war. 'But I've grown over the years to appreciate also his role as a San Francisco newspaper photographer who, as Supervisor Peskin says, went to work every day photographing the city where we all live, we all love,' he said. Graves and others said they look forward to tourists and locals happening upon the street sign, seeing Rosenthal's name for perhaps the first time, and then going online to learn about the photographer with the terrible eyesight but an eye for composition. Rosenthal never considered himself a wartime hero, just a working photographer lucky enough to document the courage of soldiers. When complimented on his Pulitzer Prize-winning photo, Rosenthal said: 'Sure, I took the photo. But the Marines took Iwo Jima.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/san-francisco-names-street-for-associated-press-iwo-jima-photographer-/7899875.html	2024-12-12T18:26:41-08:00	
Millions mark Mexico's Virgin of Guadalupe Day, but calls for a truce in drug violence go unheeded	MEXICO CITY — Millions of faithful gathered to mark Mexico's Virgin of Guadalupe Day, honoring the country's patron saint. But calls by the Roman Catholic Church for a truce in Mexico's cartel violence apparently went unheeded as more dead bodies were found in the country Thursday. Enormous crowds gathered early in the day, singing the traditional Mexican birthday song 'Las mananitas' at Mexico City's Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe to honor the virgin on the 493rd anniversary of her apparition in 1531. Mariachi bands and traditional dance groups were also present at the basilica, which has a mix of modern and colonial-era architecture. Maria Luisa Vazquez Mendoza, 33, a homemaker, walked for 16 hours from neighboring Mexico state to visit the basilica on the capital's north side and give thanks 'for another year of life, and that my family is all right.' 'You feel joy in your heart when you see the gates of the basilica so close,' said Vazquez Mendoza. 'Your body relaxes completely. You don't feel pain or tiredness anymore.' Earlier this week, the Mexican Council of Bishops wrote an editorial calling for 'a halt to the armed violence and hostile statements.' 'In a country where violence has left painful wounds in families and polarization among the public, this is a proposal to reflect, and act in favor of reconciliation and human dignity,' the council wrote on a church website, Desde la Fe. But in the north-central state of Guanajuato — which has the highest number of homicides of any of Mexico's 32 states — the day was possibly even more violent than usual. Police and prosecutors said 15 dead bodies were found on the streets in various cities in Guanajuato, and they warned that the death toll might be higher. In one macabre location, a pile of human remains was discovered on a highway near the city of Salvatierra, but authorities were still investigating how many victims it contained. Local media said parts of hacked-up human bodies were left in black garbage bags in the back of a pickup truck with a banner signed by a drug cartel. In Guanajuato in 2023 there were 8.5 homicides a day on average, according to official figures. Vazquez Mendoza said she hoped the call for a truce might still influence people 'to be a little more human, more conscious.' Over 11 million worshippers had visited the basilica in the days leading up to the annual celebration of Mexico's patroness, authorities said. Many had walked from distant villages and others rode on bicycles or buses to reach the basilica's enormous patio, where a sea of tents held pilgrims who had slept overnight to greet the virgin in the morning. The cold temperature, long walks and the wait to see the virgin's cloak inside the basilica did not discourage them. Many of the pilgrims walked the last mile or so carrying flowers or large paintings of the virgin. According to church tradition, in 1531, the dark-skinned virgin appeared to the Indigenous peasant Juan Diego and her image was imprinted on his cloak, which is on display inside the church. Juan Diego was made a saint in 2002 by Pope John Paul II. Traditionally, those who have asked for help from the Virgin of Guadalupe come in a sign of appreciation. Some, like street vendor Christofer Hernandez, completed the last stretch to the basilica barefoot or on their knees. Arturo Rivas was one of 200 people who made the pilgrimage on bicycle from the nearby state of Tlaxacala, a ride of over 60 miles (100 kilometers). 'We are excited to come year after year,' Rivas said. 'This is what our parents taught us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/millions-mark-mexico-s-virgin-of-guadalupe-day-but-calls-for-a-truce-in-drug-violence-go-unheeded-/7899873.html	2024-12-12T18:23:17-08:00	
Trump offers support for dockworkers, says ports shouldn't install more automated systems	WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday voiced his support for the dockworkers union before their contract expires next month at Eastern and Gulf Coast ports, saying that any further 'automation' of the ports would harm workers. The incoming president posted on social media that he met Harold Daggett, the president of the International Longshoreman's Association, and Dennis Daggett, the union's executive vice president. 'I've studied automation, and know just about everything there is to know about it,' Trump posted. 'The amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt, and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen. Foreign companies have made a fortune in the U.S. by giving them access to our markets. They shouldn't be looking for every last penny knowing how many families are hurt.' The International Longshoremen's Association has until January 15 to negotiate a new contract with the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies. At the heart of the dispute is whether ports can install automated gates, cranes and container-moving trucks that could make it faster to unload and load ships. The union argues that automation would lead to fewer jobs, even though higher levels of productivity could do more to boost the salaries of remaining workers. The Maritime Alliance said in a statement that the contract goes beyond ports to 'supporting American consumers and giving American businesses access to the global marketplace – from farmers, to manufacturers, to small businesses, and innovative start-ups looking for new markets to sell their products.' 'To achieve this, we need modern technology that is proven to improve worker safety, boost port efficiency, increase port capacity, and strengthen our supply chains,' said the alliance, adding that it looks forward to working with Trump. In October, the union representing 45,000 dockworkers went on strike for three days, raising the risk that a prolonged shutdown could push up inflation by making it difficult to unload container ships and export American products overseas. The issue pits an incoming president who won November's election on the promise of bringing down prices against commitments to support blue-collar workers along with the kinds of advanced technology that drew him support from Silicon Valley elite such as billionaire Elon Musk. Trump sought to portray the dispute as being between U.S. workers and foreign companies, but advanced ports are also key for staying globally competitive. China is opening a $1.3 billion port in Peru that could accommodate ships too large for the Panama Canal. There is a risk that shippers could move to other ports, which could also lead to job losses. Mexico is constructing a port that is highly automated, while Dubai, Singapore and Rotterdam already have more advanced ports. Instead, Trump said that ports and shipping companies should eschew 'machinery, which is expensive, and which will constantly have to be replaced.' 'For the great privilege of accessing our markets, these foreign companies should hire our incredible American Workers, instead of laying them off, and sending those profits back to foreign countries,' Trump posted. 'It is time to put AMERICA FIRST!'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-offers-support-for-dockworkers-says-ports-shouldn-t-install-more-automated-systems-/7899870.html	2024-12-12T18:14:58-08:00	
Environmental groups condemn new laws threatening soybean restrictions in Brazil's Amazon	BRASILIA, Brazil — Dozens of environmental nonprofits issued a manifesto Thursday condemning new laws in Brazilian states that threaten to dismantle the Amazon soy moratorium — a landmark voluntary agreement banning trade in soybeans from recently deforested areas. The 18-year-old moratorium stipulates that traders and oil producers refrain from buying soybeans grown on land cleared after 2008. The deal gathered strange bedfellows, ranging from environmental groups Greenpeace and WWF to U.S. commodity giants Cargill, Bunge and ADM. However, new laws recently enacted in the Amazon states of Mato Grosso, Brazil's largest soybean producer, and neighboring Rondonia have cut tax incentives for processing and trade companies that adhere to the agreement. Two other states and Brazil's Congress are weighing similar legislation. 'This means penalizing companies committed to ending deforestation, promoting the continued expansion of agribusiness in Amazon forest areas, creating subsidies for deforestation and discriminating against the granting of tax incentives based on companies' environmental commitment,' Thursday's declaration stated. 'Therefore, those who are more ambitious in environmental protection lose the incentive,' said the manifesto, whose 67 signers include Greenpeace, WWF and Climate Observatory, a network of 119 organizations watching federal climate policy in Brazil. The document argues soybean production grew exponentially in the Amazon under the moratorium as it expanded into pastureland. Its area jumped from 1.6 million hectares (4 million acres) in 2007 to 7.28 million hectares (18 million acres) in 2022, according to a moratorium report. The manifesto also calls for the companies that operate in Mato Grosso and Rondonia to maintain their commitment to the agreement even though it means losing millions of dollars in tax incentives — a tough decision for small and medium-sized companies. Researchers have found the moratorium is helping to preserve the Amazon forest. A 2020 study in the journal Nature Food found that the agreement, in combination with public policies, contributed to the steepest reduction of deforestation recorded in Brazil, between 2003 and 2016. In a written response, the government of Mato Grosso said it enacted the law because the moratorium is harsher than Brazil's legislation, which already has 'the world's strictest environmental regulations.' It also stated that most of the state is covered by original rainforest trees and plants. 'We challenge these nonprofits to name any state, in any country, that is a major food producer and preserves 60% of its territory,' the statement said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/environmental-groups-condemn-new-laws-threatening-soybean-restrictions-in-brazil-s-amazon/7899868.html	2024-12-12T18:05:45-08:00	
Impeaching Yoon best way to restore order, S. Korean opposition leader says	Seoul, south korea — South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung said on Friday the best way to restore order in the country is to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol, a day ahead of a planned parliamentary vote over Yoon's short-lived imposition of martial law. Yoon's move to impose military rule on December 3 was rescinded within six hours, but it plunged the country into a constitutional crisis and there were widespread calls for him to step down for breaking the law. Yoon on Thursday vowed to 'fight to the end,' blaming the opposition party for paralyzing the government and claiming a North Korean hack into the election commission made his party's crushing defeat in an April parliamentary election questionable. Democratic Party leader Lee called Yoon's remarks 'a declaration of war' against the people. 'It proved that impeachment is the fastest and the most effective way to end the confusion,' he said. Yoon survived the first attempt to impeach him last Saturday, when most of his ruling People Power Party (PPP) boycotted the vote. Since then, some PPP members have publicly supported a vote to impeach him. Opposition parties, which control the single-chamber parliament, have introduced another impeachment bill and plan to hold a vote on Saturday. They need at least eight PPP members to join to pass the bill with the two-thirds majority required.	https://www.voanews.com/a/impeaching-yoon-best-way-to-restore-order-s-korean-opposition-leader-says/7899864.html	2024-12-12T17:47:05-08:00	
US announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced another package of weapons aid for Ukraine on Thursday, valued at $500 million, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. White House spokesperson John Kirby said earlier the U.S. would continue to provide additional packages for Ukraine 'right up to the end of this administration.' Washington said 10 days ago it would send Ukraine $725 million worth of missiles, ammunition, anti-personnel mines and other weapons. Biden's outgoing administration is seeking to bolster Ukraine in tackling Russia's invasion, before Biden's term ends in January when Republican President-elect Donald Trump would take office. Thursday's package worth about $500 million included ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and High-speed Anti-radiation missiles (HARMs), among other assistance, according to Blinken. After Thursday, about $5.6 billion worth of Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) to rush weapons from U.S. stocks to the front lines remains available to Biden without requiring congressional approval. Moscow's troops have been capturing village after village in Ukraine's east, part of a drive to seize the industrial Donbas region, while Russian air strikes target a hobbled Ukrainian energy grid as winter sets in.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-announces-new-arms-aid-package-for-ukraine-worth-500-million/7899855.html	2024-12-12T17:37:47-08:00

As Syria’s prison doors open, tens of thousands remain missing	united nations — As Syrians celebrate the collapse of President Bashar al-Assad's regime after more than 50 years of brutal father-son rule, the search continues for tens of thousands of Syrians who are still missing after having been arrested, detained or 'disappeared.' Human rights experts are urging the preservation of evidence of the torture and death of political prisoners as the doors of the country’s prisons are finally opened. 'We must prioritize accounting for the missing, ensuring that families receive the clarity and recognition they desperately need,' Geir Pedersen, U.N. special envoy for Syria, said in a statement Thursday. 'Evidence of atrocities must be preserved and thoroughly documented to ensure accountability under international humanitarian law. Justice for the victims and their families is not only a right, but also essential for healing and for preventing further violations.' The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) has been documenting the thousands of arbitrarily detained, forcibly disappeared and persons tortured to death under Assad’s rule since 2011, when a regime crackdown on peaceful anti-government protests grew into a civil war. According to SNHR’s figures, at least 231,000 civilians have been killed in the war, with 202,000 deaths attributed to the regime and the rest to various armed factions. SNHR says those killed by the regime include 23,000 children and 22,000 women as well as 15,000 who were tortured to death. The group has also documented more than 96,000 forcibly disappeared persons and about 40,000 detainees. SNHR director Fadel Abdul Ghany told VOA that his group has been continuously monitoring who has been released from detention since the Assad regime collapsed Sunday. 'So, approximately 31,000 have been released from those arbitrary arrests or enforced disappearances,' he said, from a total of 136,000 persons. He said that leaves about 105,000 people who are unaccounted for. Abdul Ghany said his organization’s research over the past 14 years, including the examination of thousands of death certificates, has 'enabled us at the Syrian Network for Human Rights to announce that the vast majority of those, the remaining 105,000, have been killed.' It is devastating news for families, many of whom have held out hope for more than a decade that they might see their missing loved ones again. This week, many families descended upon the notorious military prison on the outskirts of the capital, Damascus, known as Sednaya. In 2017, Amnesty International described the prison as a 'human slaughterhouse,' where authorities quietly and methodically killed thousands of people. International news reports this week have shown men, many barefoot and some half naked, walking out of the prison, many emaciated, some unable to recall their own names. Some prisoners had been in the facility since before the war, dating back decades to the rule of Assad’s father, Hafez al-Assad. Video from inside Sednaya shows torture chambers and cells, walls and floors caked in years of blood, mold, filth and thick cobwebs. Brazilian political science professor Paulo Pinheiro has chaired the U.N.-mandated Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic since 2011. The Assad regime would not grant them access to Syria, but the commission carried out its work, methodically chronicling testimony from more than 11,000 survivors and witnesses of abuses and atrocities in the civil war. Pinheiro said Sednaya had close links to the government. 'We know what units were responsible for the arbitrary detention, what personnel was involved in each center, the command of the center, the articulation with central organizations in the Syrian state,' he told VOA. Also seen in video from Sednaya were people taking documents, perhaps in the hope of finding their loved ones’ names among the pages. Other papers appeared burned to ashes. Pinheiro said evidence must be preserved for the new authorities. 'And we are intending to contact the new authorities precisely to affirm this need,' he said. 'I think it is in the best interests of the new authorities that the evidence is being preserved.' Those new authorities are members of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which until 2016 was affiliated with al-Qaida. HTS is listed by the United Nations and the United States as a terrorist organization. The group's leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, led the coalition of rebels whose offensive toppled the Assad regime in just over one week. Assad and his family fled to Russia as the rebels approached the capital. On Tuesday, Jolani said he would name officials from the former regime who are wanted for torturing Syrian citizens. In its latest report launched in August, the U.N. Syria Commission of Inquiry said it had 'reasonable grounds to believe that the Government continued to commit acts of torture and ill-treatment against persons in State custody, including practices causing death in detention, as well as arbitrary imprisonment, rape or other forms of sexual violence of similar gravity, and enforced disappearances, again confirming continuing patterns of crimes against humanity and war crimes.' Pinheiro said since the conflict began in 2011, the commission has compiled and updated a confidential list of alleged perpetrators. Their names are held in a safe in Geneva with the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. 'When the government will be established, we will be very happy to contribute this list to the judicial system,' Pinheiro said. SNHR issued an appeal this week to Russian President Vladimir Putin to extradite Assad to face trial in Syria for the crimes his regime committed, which include the use of chemical weapons and barrel bombs against the population in opposition areas. Abdul Ghany told VOA that the new authorities should offer assurances that Assad or any security or military officers will not be subject to torture. 'This should be a rule that no one should be subjected to any type of torture,' he said. 'The uprising’s aim is to move our state from brutal dictatorship, family rule, toward democracy and toward rule [that] respects the human rights.' Both Abdul Ghany and Pinheiro say accountability must not be limited to only the Assad regime. Rights violations were committed by other armed groups in Syria’s civil war, including HTS, although to a much lesser extent than the regime. The Commission of Inquiry’s August report cited HTS for some executions, as well as detentions including a 7-year-old child, beatings, coerced confessions and reports of torture in their prisons. Since HTS launched its lightning offensive across several cities and towns on November 27, SNHR says the group has been responsible for the deaths of fewer than 10 civilians. 'I think it is a good indication,' Abdul Ghany said. He said his group has recorded minor violations by HTS and will continue to monitor them as the transition plays out. 'Until now, they are doing good,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-syria-s-prison-doors-open-tens-of-thousands-remain-missing-/7899828.html	2024-12-12T17:28:44-08:00	
White House releases national strategy to combat Islamophobia	washington — The White House on Thursday announced what it called the first national strategy to counter Islamophobia, detailing more than 100 steps federal officials can take to curb hate, violence, bias and discrimination against Muslims and Arab Americans. The proposal follows a similar national plan to battle antisemitism that President Joe Biden unveiled in May 2023, as fears about increasing hatred and discrimination were rising among U.S. Jews. Officials worked on the anti-Islamophobia plan for months, and its release came five weeks before Biden leaves office — meaning implementation will mostly fall to President-elect Donald Trump, if his administration chooses to do so. In a statement announcing the strategy, the Biden administration wrote that 'over the past year, this initiative has become even more important as threats against American Muslim and Arab communities have spiked.' It said that included the October 2023 slaying of 6-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi, an American Muslim boy of Palestinian descent, who was stabbed to death in Illinois. The plan details actions the Executive Branch can take, along with more than 100 other calls to action across all sectors of society. Four pillars of plan The strategy has four basic priorities: increasing awareness of hatred against Muslims and Arabs while more widely recognizing these communities' heritages; broadly improving their safety and security; appropriately accommodating Muslim and Arab religious practices by working to curb discrimination against them; and encouraging cross-community solidarity to further counter hate. Many of those goals are similar to ones the Biden administration laid out in its plan to reduce antisemitism — especially the emphasis on improving safety and security and building cross-community solidarity. 'While individuals have sometimes been targeted because they are thought to be Muslim, it is also crucial to recognize that Arabs are routinely targeted simply for being who they are,' the announcement of the strategy states, noting that Muslims and Arab Americans have helped build out the nation since its founding. It says that new data collection and education efforts are 'increasing awareness of these forms of hate as well of the proud heritages of Muslim and Arab Americans.' The plan calls for more widely disseminating successful practices of engaging Muslim and Arab Americans in the reporting of hate crimes, and notes that more federal agencies are now more clearly spelling out that 'discrimination against Muslim and Arab Americans in federally funded activities is illegal.' The White House's plan also urges 'state, local and international counterparts, as well as the nongovernmental sector, to pursue similar initiatives that seek to build greater unity by recognizing our common humanity, affirming our shared values and history, and embracing equal justice, liberty and security for all.' Pro-Palestinian groups, decrying his administration's full-throated support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza, frequently disrupted Biden campaign events, as well as those of Vice President Kamala Harris after Biden abandoned his reelection bid in July. Trump, who implemented a travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries during his first term, won the largest majority-Muslim U.S. city in last month's elections. Yet some Arab Americans who backed Trump have begun expressing concerns about some of his choices to fill his Cabinet and other positions for his incoming administration. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization in the U.S., panned what it called 'the White House's long-delayed document' as 'too little, too late.' 'The White House strategy lays out some positive recommendations related to anti-Muslim bigotry, but it has been released too late to make an impact, fails to promise any changes to federal programs that perpetuate anti-Muslim discrimination on a massive scale,' the council said in a statement. The council further noted that the plan doesn't address what it called a 'federal watchlist' targeting some Arab-Americans as potential terrorists. It added that the plan 'fails to promise an end the most significant driver of anti-Muslim bigotry today: the U.S.-backed genocide in Gaza.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-releases-national-strategy-to-combat-islamophobia/7899853.html	2024-12-12T17:28:16-08:00	
First Chechen War: The moment when ‘Russia’s democratic post-Soviet dream ended’	WASHINGTON — Brutal tactics employed by Russia in its war on Ukraine have shocked much of the world but come as no surprise to older residents of Chechnya, who this week marked the 30th anniversary of an equally brutal war — one that many believe bore the seeds of the current conflict in Ukraine. It was on December 11, 1994, that then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin launched an armed response to a bid by Chechnya, an autonomous republic in southern Russia’s North Caucasus region, to break away from the Russian Federation. To thwart the self-styled Chechen Republic of Ichkeria’s independence bid, the Russian military threw poorly trained and equipped conscripts against highly motivated Chechen guerrillas. Between December 1994 and August 1996, when the two sides signed the Khasavyurt Accords ending the First Chechen War, an estimated 8,000 Russian troops were killed or listed as missing in action, and more than 50,000 wounded. The conflict also killed an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 Chechen civilians and fighters, and claimed the lives of as many as 35,000 ethnic Russian residents of Chechnya. British journalist Thomas de Waal, who had worked in Chechnya before the war, returned to the Chechen capital of Grozny in January 1995 and found a horrific scene. 'Already the city had fallen to the Russian forces, but [only] after the most intense bombardment I think anyone had seen … certainly Russia had seen since the end of the Second World War,' De Waal, now a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe in Brussels, recently told Voice of America’s Russian Service. 'Most of the city lay in ruins,' he said. 'Entire blocks had been destroyed, leaving gaping holes in their place. People were coming out of the basements where they had been hiding for weeks.' Among those hiding from Russian bombing in Grozny’s basements was Abubakar Yangulbayev, now a lawyer and human rights activist, who was then 2 years old. The First Chechen War left a deep imprint on him. 'It was total devastation,' he told VOA. 'There was nothing, everything was broken, everything was destroyed. And here is my first understanding: Is there any peace anywhere, where everything is not destroyed, where there are roads, where there is normal life without mud, without those constant annoying tanks, armored personnel carriers and all that?' One general’s bid Chechnya’s independence bid was launched by Dzhokhar Dudayev, a former Soviet general who had commanded strategic nuclear bomber aircraft divisions. He declared the region’s independence from the Russian Federation in October 1991, following a referendum that confirmed him as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria’s president. De Waal, who met Dudayev three times, called him 'an extraordinary figure,' but also 'pretty crazy.' 'He’d become a general in the Soviet army, but he also had become a Chechen nationalist,' De Waal said. 'He was very Soviet in his mentality as well as Chechen. He would give these long, long speeches, denunciations of Russian imperialism, but he was really part of the problem.' However, the Russian military’s indiscriminate mass bombardment of civilian areas in Chechnya, along with looting and human rights abuses committed by Russian troops deployed there, soon tipped the scales in the moral assessment of the conflict. 'It was complete devastation,' said De Waal. 'It had gone from a situation where Russia had said that they wanted to remove, as they described it, the ‘anti-constitutional regime’ of Dzhokhar Dudayev, to a position of total war. And it certainly felt that way to the Chechens. They did not feel that they were being liberated from an unfriendly regime.' De Waal, along with other observers, believes that the First Chechen War marked a watershed in Russia’s post-Soviet development. 'For me, Yeltsin’s invasion of — his intervention in — Chechnya, whatever you want to call it, in December 1994, was a Rubicon moment,' he said. 'It was the moment when … Russia’s democratic post-Soviet dream ended, and it entered a much darker period from that moment on.' Lost diplomatic opportunity? That 'Rubicon moment,' however, was not acknowledged by Western governments that supported Yeltsin. Thomas Graham, a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, was a U.S. Foreign Service officer working in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow when the First Chechen War started. He noted that then-U.S. President Bill Clinton, who 'had decided early on that Yeltsin was the best hope for democratic transition in Russia,' compared the Chechen conflict with the American Civil War. 'Now, that was a bit far-fetched even for some people inside the Clinton administration at that point, who saw, I think even in the early stages, that this was going to pose a threat to the democratic transition,' Graham told VOA. 'The question is, what could we have done differently at that point? You know, we certainly weren’t going to insert ourselves militarily into this and we weren’t going to support the Chechen rebels by any stretch of the imagination,' he added. 'We could have perhaps put more pressure on Yeltsin in the private conversations to bring this conflict to an end or to pursue the conflict with greater regard to what you would call the laws of armed conflict and so forth.' Khasavyurt Accords On April 21, 1996, Dudayev was assassinated by two laser-guided missiles fired by Russian warplanes. Several months later, his successor, Aslan Maskhadov — who would be killed by Russian forces in Chechnya nearly nine years later — negotiated the Khasavyurt Accords with the Yeltsin government, ending the fighting. The cessation of hostilities, however, would prove to be relatively short-lived. Over the next several years, Chechen militants, increasingly influenced by radical Islamist ideology and operating jointly with allied fighters from neighboring North Caucasus republics and Middle Eastern jihadists, ratcheted up attacks. Amid persistent rumors that President Boris Yeltsin’s health was deteriorating, the rising violence and unrest in the North Caucasus ultimately sparked the Second Chechen War in August 1999. Yeltsin’s newly chosen prime minister, former spy chief Vladimir Putin, increasingly took the lead in the new North Caucasus military campaign, taking full charge of the Second Chechen War after Yeltsin stepped down and Putin became acting president on December 31, 1999. The renewed conflict again saw systematic human rights violations against civilians committed by Russian forces. For their part, the Chechen insurgents, sometimes operating together with allied regional and Middle Eastern militants, carried out high-profile terrorist attacks targeting Russian civilians. According to human rights activist Abubakar Yangulbayev, Putin 'built his career' on the 'reoccupation or retaking of Chechnya.' 'He built his elections on this, he built his promises on this,' he said. 'By creating a cult of impunity in Chechnya, he created the same foundation for all of Russia, which ultimately led to the war in Georgia, and the war in Syria, and the war in Ukraine.' The First Chechen War, said de Waal, was not only 'a huge tragedy for the Chechen people, who still live with the legacy of this war,' but 'also a huge tragedy for Russia, not only in terms of the lives of Russian soldiers lost, but in a social sense, in terms of the violence that permeates society.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/first-chechen-war-the-moment-when-russia-s-democratic-post-soviet-dream-ended-/7899845.html	2024-12-12T17:28:04-08:00	
Police say suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO killing wasn't client of insurer	New York — The man charged with killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was not a client of the medical insurer and may have targeted it because of its size and influence, a senior police official said Thursday. NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told NBC New York in an interview Thursday that investigators have uncovered evidence that Luigi Mangione had prior knowledge UnitedHealthcare was holding its annual investor conference in New York City. Mangione also mentioned the company in a note found in his possession when he was detained by police in Pennsylvania. 'We have no indication that he was ever a client of UnitedHealthcare, but he does make mention that it is the fifth-largest corporation in America, which would make it the largest health care organization in America. So that's possibly why he targeted that company,' said Kenny. UnitedHealthcare is in the top 20 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization but is not the fifth largest. It is the largest U.S. health insurer. Mangione remains jailed without bail in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested Monday after being spotted at a McDonald's in the city of Altoona, about 370 kilometers (about 230 miles) west of New York City. His lawyer there, Thomas Dickey, has said Mangione intends to plead not guilty. Dickey also said he has yet to see evidence decisively linking his client to the crime. Mangione's arrest came five days after the caught-on-camera killing of Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel. Police say the shooter waited outside the hotel where the health insurer was holding its investor conference, early on the morning of Dec. 4. He approached Thompson from behind and shot him before fleeing on a bicycle through Central Park. Mangione is fighting attempts to extradite him back to New York so that he can face a murder charge in Thompson's killing. A hearing has been scheduled for Dec. 30. The 26-year-old, who police say was found with a 'ghost gun' matching shell casings found at the site of the shooting, is charged in Pennsylvania with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. Mangione is an Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland real estate family. In posts on social media, Mangione wrote about experiencing severe chronic back pain before undergoing a spinal fusion surgery in 2023. Afterward, he posted that the operation had been a success and that his pain had improved and mobility returned. He urged others to consider the same type of surgery. On Wednesday, police said investigators are looking at his writings about his health problems and his criticism of corporate America and the U.S. health care system. Kenny said in the NBC interview that Mangione's family reported him missing to San Francisco authorities in November.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-say-suspect-in-unitedhealthcare-ceo-killing-wasn-t-client-of-insurer-/7899831.html	2024-12-12T16:50:35-08:00	
Biden aides in region on diplomatic push for Syria, Gaza	Top aides to U.S. President Joe Biden are in the Middle East this week, to push for a ceasefire in Gaza and to deal with the fallout in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad. The visits come amid military maneuvers from neighboring countries including U.S. allies Israel and Turkey.

UN huddle condemns Taliban's curb on female medical education	Islamabad — The United Nations warned Thursday that the Taliban's decision to prohibit female students from pursuing medical training is expected to worsen Afghanistan's already dire humanitarian crisis, which the U.N. undersecretary-general says is the second-worst in the world after Sudan's. Tom Fletcher, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told a quarterly Security Council meeting that the proposed restriction could potentially inflict 'serious and lasting damage' on health care for Afghan women and girls. Earlier this month, Taliban health authorities ordered public and private medical institutions across the country to halt enrollment of female students and the completion of their end-of-semester examinations. However, the abrupt directive gave 10 days to medical institutions to allow female students to take their semester exams. 'This was the last remaining sector in which Afghan women could pursue higher-level learning, following the ban on girls' higher education,' Fletcher said. 'It would prevent more than 36,000 midwives and 2,800 nurses from entering the workforce in the next few years, and rates of antenatal, neonatal and maternal mortality could dramatically increase,' he said. The ban on female medical education comes as the Taliban have barred male doctors in several Afghan provinces from treating female patients. Fletcher noted that one-third of women in Afghanistan already give birth without professional medical assistance, and preventable maternal complications claim the life of a woman every two hours in the country. The female medical education ban is the latest in a series of edicts that radical Taliban leaders have enforced in the country since sweeping back to power in August 2021. Previously they banned secondary school education for girls and excluded Afghan women from most workplaces except those in health and a few other sectors. The restrictions are part of what is known as the 'Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice' law, or PVPV law, which the Taliban have promulgated in line with their stringent interpretation of Islamic law, known as Shariah. During a virtual address to Thursday's Security Council meeting, Roza Otunbayeva, head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, said she had strongly urged the Taliban to reconsider their ban on female medical education. However, Otunbayeva said, de facto Afghan authorities have persistently pursued their vision of an Islamic system 'characterized by unprecedented' restrictions on women and girls. 'It is now approaching nearly 1,200 days without girls having access to formal education beyond sixth grade, with women and girls facing a progressive erasure from almost all walks of life,' she said. She lamented that the enforcement of the PVPV law has impacted women's already constrained freedom of movement and access to public services, with the Taliban morality police inspectors preventing women who are unaccompanied by a male guardian from traveling in vehicles, even for short distances from their homes, and from accessing health care facilities. 'There has been a notable expansion of de facto PVPV inspectors' enforcement of the requirements regarding men's beards and Western-style haircuts through visits to mosques and other public places to advise on the requirements of the law, arrests of barbers and men identified as having shaved their beards and forcing barbershops to close,' she said. Her mission, she said, has been engaging with the Taliban to establish a 'constructive dialogue' in support of Afghan peace and stability. 'The objective is an Afghanistan reintegrated into the international community and upholding its international obligations,' she said. Responding to those criticizing her engagement with the Taliban despite their bans on women, the UNAMA chief emphasized that isolation is not a solution. 'Some say that engagement has not worked because these decisions keep coming despite international condemnation,' Otunbayeva said. 'But pressure and condemnation do not seem to be working, and if pursued without forward-leaning principled engagement, it will lead to Afghanistan's isolation.' Otunbayeva told the Security Council meeting that her office had documented a 'widening pattern of restrictions' on the media, noting that the 'space for public debate, including on key issues such as the rights of women and girls, continues to shrink' in Afghanistan. The Taliban government, which is neither officially recognized by any country nor allowed to represent Afghanistan at the U.N, did not immediately respond to Thursday's criticism of its policies. Nonetheless, de facto Afghan authorities have persistently ignored international objections to their governance, saying their rules are aligned with Sharia and local culture. 'Sick' and 'heartless' In her address to Thursday's meeting, the head of the United States mission to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, condemned the Taliban for restricting the education, employment and overall well-being of women and girls. She decried as 'sick and heartless' the restriction on female medical education, calling it 'a death sentence' for Afghan women in need of potentially lifesaving medical treatment. 'How will women's health care needs be met in the future if there are no qualified women doctors, nurses, dentists and midwives? And male doctors are not allowed to treat women,' Thomas-Greenfield said. 'This is not cultural, and it's not religious. It is unfathomable. It is sick. It is heartless. It means these men — Taliban — are sentencing their mothers who birthed them, their sisters, their wives, their own daughters, to die before their eyes if they become ill,' she said. The U.S. envoy emphasized that any engagement with the Taliban must be linked with a broader dialogue on human rights and a political road map in line with the U.N. resolutions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-huddle-condemns-taliban-s-curb-on-female-medical-education-/7899517.html	2024-12-12T14:58:48-08:00	
US officials stress collaboration with Japan, South Korea amid Seoul leadership crisis	WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers and diplomatic officials stressed the need for close cooperation among the United States, South Korea and Japan in response to the possible impeachment of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. The officials say that Yoon, who could be removed from office as soon as this weekend over a short-lived imposition of martial law that threw his country into turmoil, has played an important role in the informal U.S. alliance that Washington has forged in the Asia-Pacific region. Senator Jack Reed, who spoke to VOA Korean on Wednesday, said Yoon's diplomacy has 'strengthened South Korea vis-a-vis China and Russia and other emerging threats in the Pacific.' 'The collaboration between South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia — that is probably going to do more to deter hostilities than anything else. So, that has to be maintained,' said Reed, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He emphasized that the presence of a significant number of U.S. forces in South Korea 'keeps the North Koreans from doing something rash and very destructive to South Korea.' More than 28,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea. 'That relationship — the United States and South Korea — I think, is made more formidable when Japan is also part of it, and the Philippines are also part of it,' Reed said. 'And I think South Korean people have to recognize that we're talking about their safety and security.' The embattled president has been criticized in his own country for pursuing a foreign policy that fostered closer relations with Japan, a country still reviled by many of his countrymen for its harsh colonial rule from 1910 to 1945. Senator Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told VOA Korean that a strong relationship between South Korea and Japan is beneficial to the overall Indo-Pacific region, which faces the rise of China. 'We know there's been historic tensions for centuries between Japan and Korea,' Warner said. 'I actually think that level of collaboration between America, South Korea and Japan is in the best interests of the region.' Andy Kim, who was sworn in this week as the first Korean American U.S. senator, told VOA Korean he hopes 'people recognize the importance of ensuring that South Korea remains engaged in the region.' 'I do think that the work that has been happening between the United States, South Korea and Japan is important, and I hope that whoever is the leader and whatever happens next in South Korea, that type of work continues,' said Kim, who expressed shock at Yoon's declaration of martial law on Dec. 3. The South Korean president said his decision was aimed at 'eradicating pro-North Korean forces and to protect the constitutional order of freedom.' Soon after his declaration, a majority of South Korean lawmakers voted to overturn the order. Yoon, who was legally obligated to comply with the vote, did so six hours after his original declaration. South Korean lawmakers pushed Dec. 7 to impeach Yoon for the failed martial law declaration. The resolution accused Yoon of putting South Korea on the brink of war by operating a foreign policy 'hostile to North Korea, China and Russia, but centered on Japan.' The opposition-led attempt failed because a boycott by Yoon’s ruling People’s Party left the legislature short of the necessary quorum. Yoon now faces another impeachment vote, which he vowed Thursday to 'fight to the end.' Representative Marilyn Strickland, who recently secured a U.S. House seat for a third term, called for 'good relationships' with allies, when asked about the controversy. 'If I think about the safety and the freedom of the entire Indo-Pacific region, it is better to have good relationships with our allies than to be at odds with each other,' she said in a Zoom interview Tuesday with VOA Korean. 'Disturbing signals' U.S. diplomatic and security experts said Yoon's declaration of martial law was clearly wrong but questioned whether an impeachment resolution should be based on his approach to international relations. 'If you look back at the impeachment resolution, one of the paragraphs in that impeachment resolution directly attacked President Yoon for the trilateral partnership that he had established with Japan and the United States. That was very disturbing,' said Evans Revere, the former principal deputy assistant secretary and acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. He spoke to VOA Korean on Monday via Zoom. Kenneth Weinstein, the Japan chair at the Hudson Institute, shared a similar sentiment. 'It's disturbing in the sense that if the South Korean opposition is going to run on an anti-American, anti-Japanese agenda, it sends disturbing signals to North Korea about alliance unity. It sends disturbing signals to China about alliance unity,' Weinstein said. 'And frankly, it sends disturbing signals to the incoming Trump administration about what kind of government South Korea is likely to have if President Yoon is impeached.' Harry Harris, former U.S. ambassador to South Korea during the first Trump administration, told VOA Korean on Tuesday via email that the cooperation among the U.S., South Korea and Japan should continue. 'I've spoken for a while now how important President Yoon's outreach to Japan is, especially his meetings in the U.S. and Japan with former Prime Minister [Fumio] Kishida,' he said. The U.S. State Department has sidestepped questions on the controversy. 'We continue to call for the full and proper functioning of the ROK's democratic institutions and processes, in accordance with the constitution,' said a spokesperson for the State Department in an email to VOA Korean on Saturday. ROK, or the Republic of Korea, is the official name of South Korea. 'The United States is committed to the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula,' the spokesperson said. VOA's Joon Ho Ahn contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-officials-stress-collaboration-with-japan-south-korea-amid-seoul-leadership-crisis/7899536.html	2024-12-12T14:57:13-08:00	
Far-right support rose in Europe in 2024	LONDON — Support for far-right parties in Europe continued to grow in 2024 amid voter concerns over immigration, inflation and the war in Ukraine. Far-right parties gained nearly a quarter of votes from across the bloc in June’s European Union parliamentary elections, although centrist parties continue to hold the balance of power at the EU institutions in Brussels. In France, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally Party won the highest share of French votes in the EU parliament election, with 31%. French President Emmanuel Macron — whose Renaissance Party won 15% of the vote — made the shock decision to dissolve parliament and call a general election. National Rally saw a path to government for the first time. 'We are ready to be in power if the French people give us their support in the forthcoming legislative elections,' Le Pen told supporters. 'We are ready to turn the country around, ready to defend the interests of the French people, ready to put an end to mass immigration.' Left and centrist parties, however, formed an alliance to block National Rally from power. Macron appointed a new government under Prime Minister Michel Barnier, but France was plunged into turmoil again in early December after National Rally withdrew its support for government, forcing a no-confidence vote and prompting Barnier’s resignation. Macron is struggling to appoint a new prime minister amid calls for his resignation. Meanwhile, Le Pen faces troubles of her own, as an ongoing corruption trial could derail her political ambitions. A verdict is due in March. German elections In Germany, Europe’s biggest economic power, the far-right Alternative for Germany Party finished second in the EU parliament elections, putting the Social Democrats of Chancellor Olaf Scholz in third place. Scholz appealed to voters to reject the right-wing party. 'We have to worry about the vote for right-wing populist parties here and in other European countries. We must never get used to this, and it must always be our mission to push them back,' Scholz said in the wake of the results. His call went unheeded. In September, Alternative for Germany won a state election for the first time in Thuringia and came a close second in Saxony. Immigration Concerns over immigration were central to the far right’s success, said Guntram Wolff, senior fellow at the Bruegel economic think tank in Brussels. 'How do you respond to that dissatisfaction that relates to migration? I mean, perhaps also the topic of inflation and increases in prices in the last years play a role. But I think the migration topic really is sort of at the center of the dissatisfaction,' Wolff said. Germany’s three-party ruling coalition under Scholz collapsed in November. The country is due to hold a general election in February. Aid to Ukraine Alternative for Germany, which is currently polling in second place behind the center-right Christian Democrats, is campaigning on a platform of slashing immigration and ending military support for Ukraine in its war against Russian invaders. Germany is Kyiv’s second-biggest donor, after the United States. 'We want peace in Ukraine. We don't want any weapons deliveries. We don't want any tanks. We don't want any missiles,' AfD leader Alice Weidel said at a press conference on December 7. In Austria, the far-right Freedom Party topped the vote in September’s election with more than 28%. However, all other parties ruled out forming a coalition with it, so the party has been excluded from power. In 2025, analysts say, all eyes will be on the political turbulence in France and Germany as Europe prepares for the return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency in January.	https://www.voanews.com/a/far-right-support-rose-in-europe-in-2024/7899483.html	2024-12-12T14:22:31-08:00

Calls rise for accountability in Assad's crimes against journalists in Syria	WASHINGTON — When news broke about the fall of President Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria this week, photojournalist Paul Conroy found himself thinking about a former colleague, Marie Colvin. An American journalist, Colvin was killed in February 2012 in the city of Homs when the Syrian military shelled the media center she was in. French photographer Remi Ochlik was also killed, and Conroy and two other journalists were injured. In 2019, a U.S. court determined that the Syrian military had tracked the broadcasts of the journalists covering the siege of Homs, then deliberately targeted the makeshift media center. 'That was a good moral victory,' Conroy said about the ruling. But now that Assad’s government has collapsed, Conroy hopes more justice will come. 'I think there’s a lot more to come out now that Syria has opened up,' he told VOA from Odesa, where he has been covering the war in Ukraine. Conroy said that access to government records might provide more evidence about the crimes committed by Assad and his government. 'The aim is twofold — primarily the justice and accountability for Syrian citizens, but also the press,' he said. Conroy joins a chorus of press freedom and rights groups, as well as U.S. President Joe Biden, calling for accountability for actions taken by the Assad government. Syria has long been one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, has documented 141 journalists killed between 2011, when the civil war began, and 2024. Of those, CPJ said that at least 23 were classified as murders, including the cases of Colvin and Ochlik, and six deaths occurred in government custody. The New York-based press freedom group ranks Syria fourth in the world in terms of impunity in journalist killings. Meanwhile, Reporters Without Borders, known as RSF, determined that as of Monday, 23 journalists were jailed in Syria, and 10 others were missing. 'We’re very concerned about their well-being,' Jonathan Dagher, the head of RSF’s Middle East desk, told VOA from Paris. The press freedom group is investigating 'where they have been, if they’re still alive, which is a very grim thing to say, but for many, we haven’t had the sign of life in years,' Dagher said. Rebels led by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, took control of the major cities of Aleppo, Hama and then the capital, Damascus, over the past week. In those cities, thousands of prisoners have been released. Among them, according to RSF, are Hanin Gebran, a journalist with Syria Media Monitor who had been detained since June 2024, and Tal al-Mallouhi, a blogger who had been detained since 2009. The fact that there was no sign for years that al-Mallouhi was alive is cause for hope that other jailed journalists may be alive, too, Dagher said. Among the journalists still missing is American reporter Austin Tice, who has been detained in Syria since 2012. His family announced last week that they have received information vetted by the U.S. government that confirms Tice is alive and detained in Damascus. Following Assad’s ousting, Biden said the U.S. remained committed to securing Tice’s release. But his exact whereabouts are unclear. That the whereabouts of so many journalists in Syria remain unknown highlights how the Assad government long targeted reporters to prevent details being made public about crimes it was perpetrating against its own people, according to Alessandro Accorsi, a conflict analyst at International Crisis Group. 'It was a regime that was built largely on fear and largely on keeping people disconnected,' Accorsi told VOA from Brussels. Details surrounding how accountability will be achieved — for instance, at an international court or in Syria — remain unclear, experts told VOA. 'But what’s for sure is we want a trial by an independent and competent court that can result in clear and transparent accountability for all the victims,' Dagher said. Complicating matters is that Assad has fled to Russia, where the Kremlin has given him and his family asylum. But even charges in absentia would be worthwhile, Conroy said. 'There needs to be some deterrence that you cannot just kill journalists and run off into the sunset,' he said. Alongside calls for accountability are efforts to foster improved press freedom in Syria. Establishing an environment in which free speech and press freedom are respected is crucial, said Fadel Abdulghany, executive director of the Syrian Network for Human Rights. 'That’s what we are fighting for. This is essential for the democratic state,' Abdulghany told VOA from Doha in Qatar. HTS also has a concerning press freedom record. The militant group stands accused of killing six journalists between 2012 and 2019, according to RSF. HTS has also abducted, detained and mistreated journalists in detention. The United States, Turkey, the United Nations and several other countries designate HTS as a terrorist organization. Dagher said the only way to establish respect for press freedom is to ensure that perpetrators of previous crimes are held accountable. Speaking with VOA in between sporadic blackouts in Ukraine, Conroy said he plans to return to Syria in January. But if Colvin were still alive, Conroy said, they would already be back there, together. 'I know for a fact, as soon as that started happening,' Conroy said, 'my phone would be ringing off the hook, and it would have been, ‘Get onto the picture desk and get moving. I’ll see you in Beirut.’' He chuckled at the thought.	https://www.voanews.com/a/calls-rise-for-accountability-in-assad-s-crimes-against-journalists-in-syria/7899393.html	2024-12-12T12:55:32-08:00	
France's Macron expected to name new PM	French President Emmanuel Macron’s office said he cut short a visit to Poland Thursday to return home to name a new prime minister eight days after French lawmakers rejected Prime Minister Michel Barnier in a no-confidence vote. Barnier, who had been prime minister for just three months, angered members of parliament on both the right and the left last week when he pushed through the 2025 budget without parliamentary approval, something Barnier said he did to maintain 'stability' amid France's deep political divisions. Macron asked Barnier to stay on in a caretaker capacity until the president names a successor. Following a meeting with Macron at his Elysee Palace office Tuesday, party leaders said the president had promised to name a replacement to lead the government within 48 hours. The meeting did not include the far-right National Rally party led by Marine Le Pen or the far-left France Unbowed party of Jean-Luc Melenchon. The Associated Press reports Macron said he would only speak with more moderate political forces. Following last week’s no-confidence vote, Macron, in a nationally televised speech, vowed to stay in office until the end of his term in 2027. He also promised to appoint a prime minister who would form a government 'in the general interest, representing all the political parties who can participate in it, or at least who agree not to bring it down.' A spokeswoman for Barnier’s caretaker government, Maud Bregeon, told reporters Wednesday Macron would either seek to bring parties from the center-left into his center/center-right coalition or make a deal with them not hold any no confidence votes against them. Analysts suggest top candidates to be prime minister include centrist Democratic Movement party leader François Bayrou, Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu and center-left ex-Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-macron-expected-to-name-new-pm/7899388.html	2024-12-12T12:54:18-08:00	
Civilians search notorious Syrian prison for loved ones	In the aftermath of the fall of Bashar al-Assad's government, many Syrians flocked to the Sednaya Prison, infamously known as 'the human slaughterhouse,' in search of clues about their missing loved ones. Veronica Villafane narrates this report from Joan Cabases Vega in Sednaya.	https://www.voanews.com/a/civilians-search-notorious-syrian-prison-for-loved-ones-/7899392.html	2024-12-12T12:52:17-08:00	
Trump names Kari Lake as choice for VOA director	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday he plans to have Kari Lake, a politician and former Arizona journalist, appointed head of the international government-funded broadcaster Voice of America. Trump announced on his social media platform Truth Social that Lake would be appointed director of VOA. Lake is a close political ally of the president-elect and a former anchor for a Fox News television station in Phoenix, Arizona. She worked in journalism for 27 years before leaving the profession in 2021 to run for Arizona governor. During an unsuccessful run for Senate in 2024, Lake said Arizona should be a 'standard bearer for America First policies.' Trump also wrote Wednesday that he would soon announce his pick to head the U.S. Agency for Global Media, known as USAGM, which oversees VOA along with other U.S.-funded broadcasters. That position is presidentially nominated and requires Senate approval. Trump said his pick for CEO would appoint and work closely with Lake. The chief executive of the publicly funded USAGM ensures that the broadcasters are meeting their missions to produce credible and accurate journalism to countries with limited free media. VOA’s current director, Mike Abramowitz, sent an email to staff Thursday morning saying that he read the announcement about Lake Wednesday night and had not been given additional information beyond the social media post. 'I welcome a smooth transition of power for both USAGM and VOA. I intend to cooperate with the new administration and follow the process' for the appointment of the director of VOA, he wrote. 2020 law restructured agency management The USAGM CEO has the power to hire or dismiss network heads, but under a bipartisan bill passed in December 2020, network head changes require a majority vote of the International Broadcasting Advisory Board. The board consists of six presidentially appointed members who serve staggered terms, plus the secretary of state. Its function is to advise the CEO to ensure that he or she respects the editorial independence and integrity of the networks and grantees, and that the highest standards of journalism are upheld. In a post on the social media platform X, Lake said she is honored to be considered for the VOA role. She said that VOA is a 'vital international media outlet' that promotes 'democracy and truth.' 'Under my leadership, the VOA will excel in its mission: chronicling America’s achievements worldwide.' VOA attempted to reach Lake for comment via the media section of her campaign website, but as of publication had not received a response. VOA broadcasts to a weekly audience of 354 million people in 49 languages. Its current director, Abramowitz, is the former president of Freedom House and was a reporter and editor for The Washington Post for 24 years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-names-kari-lake-as-choice-for-voa-director/7899195.html	2024-12-12T11:00:59-08:00	
FBI should have done more to collect intelligence before Capitol riot, watchdog finds	WASHINGTON — The FBI should have done more to collect intelligence before the Capitol riot even though the bureau did prepare for the possibility of violence on Jan. 6, 2021, according to a watchdog report Thursday. It also said no undercover FBI employees were present that day and none of the bureau's informants was authorized to participate. The report from the Justice Department inspector general's office knocks down a fringe conspiracy theory advanced by some Republicans in Congress that the FBI played a role in instigating the events that day, when rioters determined to overturn Republican Donald Trump's 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden stormed the building in a violent clash with police. The review was being released nearly four years after a dark chapter in history that shook the bedrock of American democracy. Though narrow in scope, the report aims to shed light on gnawing questions that have dominated public discourse, including whether major intelligence failures preceded the riot and whether anyone in the crowd was for some reason acting at the behest of the FBI. It's the latest major investigation about a day unlike any other in U.S. history that has already yielded congressional inquiries and federal and state indictments. The watchdog found that 26 FBI informants were in Washington for election-related protests on Jan. 6, and though three entered either the building or a restricted area outside, none had been authorized to do so by the bureau or to break the law or encourage others to do so. The report also found that the FBI did take appropriate steps to prepare for the events of Jan. 6, but failed to scour its 56 field offices across the country for relevant intelligence. The watchdog's lengthy review was launched days after the riot, following revelations that a Jan. 5, 2021, bulletin prepared by the FBI's Norfolk, Virginia, field office warned of the potential for 'war' at the Capitol. The former head of the FBI's office in Washington has said that once he received that Jan. 5 warning, the information was quickly shared with other law enforcement agencies through a joint terrorism task force. But Capitol Police leaders have said they were unaware of that document at the time and have insisted that they had no specific or credible intelligence that any demonstration at the Capitol would result in a large-scale attack on the building. FBI Director Chris Wray, who announced this week his plans to resign at the end of President Joe Biden's term in January, has defended his agency's handling of the intelligence report. He told lawmakers in 2021 that the report was disseminated through the joint terrorism task force, discussed at a command post in Washington and posted on an internet portal available to other law enforcement agencies. 'We did communicate that information in a timely fashion to the Capitol Police and [Metropolitan Police Department] in not one, not two, but three different ways,' Wray said at the time. The conspiracy theory that federal law enforcement officers entrapped members of the mob has been spread in conservative circles, including by some Republican lawmakers. Representative Clay Higgins recently suggested on a podcast that agents pretending to be Trump supporters were responsible for instigating the violence. And former Republican Representative Matt Gaetz, who withdrew as Trump's pick as attorney general amid scrutiny over sex trafficking allegations, sent a letter to Wray in 2021 asking how many informants were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and if they were 'merely passive informants or active instigators.' It wasn't previously clear how many FBI informants were in the crowd that day. Wray refused to say during a congressional hearing last year how many of the people who entered the Capitol and surrounding area on Jan. 6 were either FBI employees or people with whom the FBI had made contact. But Wray said the 'notion that somehow the violence at the Capitol on January 6 was part of some operation orchestrated by FBI sources and agents is ludicrous.' One FBI informant testified last year at the trial of former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio about marching to the Capitol with his fellow extremist group members, and described communicating with his handler as the mob of Trump supporters swarmed the building. But the informant wasn't in any of the Telegram chats the Proud Boys were accused of using to plot violence in the days leading up to Jan. 6.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-should-have-done-more-to-collect-intelligence-before-capitol-riot-watchdog-finds/7899171.html	2024-12-12T10:36:57-08:00	
ETA terrorists jailed in Spain for attempted murder of journalists	Four former members of Basque separatist organization ETA were each sentenced Thursday in Spain to nearly 75 years in prison, more than 20 years after they attempted to murder two journalists and their infant son by placing a flowerpot filled with explosives outside the family’s home. Aurora Intxausti, a journalist for El Pais newspaper; her husband, Juan Palomo, a reporter for Antena 3 television; and their then-18-month-old son, Inigo, were targeted in 2000 as ETA broadened its terror campaign across Basque society. In previous years, the organization had targeted only police and soldiers but began killing and threatening journalists, judges, local politicians, women and children in a campaign it called the 'socialization of suffering.' In 2018, ETA announced its full and formal dissolution, but the Spanish judiciary is still pursuing members of the organization for past crimes. The Spanish branch of watchdog Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, said attacks on journalists should be punished even if it takes judicial authorities two decades to catch up with the perpetrators. 'It is important that justice is done,' Alfonso Bauluz, president of RSF, told VOA. 'ETA represented a permanent threat to the freedom of expression, and its disappearance represents a strengthening of the freedom of the media and the security of Spanish journalists,' he said. The bomb attack failed because as the family was leaving their home on November 10, 2000, Palomo heard something that sounded like a firecracker going off. He noticed a plant pot on the front doorstep that had not been there and told his family to get as far away from the door as possible. The bomb contained 2.5 kilograms of dynamite and shrapnel. It failed to go off because Palomo opened the door briskly, causing the connection between the detonator and the explosives to fail. Four ETA members admitted to attempted murder on Thursday in Madrid at the Audiencia Nacional, Spain’s top criminal court, and were sentenced to nearly 75 years each in prison. Asier Garcia, Patxi Xabier Makazaga, Jon Zubiaurre and Imanol Miner received sentences of 19 years and 10 months for each of the three counts of attempted murder and a further 14 years and 10 months each for terrorist offenses. In their closing remarks, the judges said the bomb had been planted 'with the sole intention of causing the deaths of the couple and their child.' Despite the sentences, under Spanish law, most criminals can serve a maximum of only 30 years in prison. The case had been shelved through lack of evidence, but in 2020, police made a breakthrough when French authorities passed files on the case to the Spanish. Intxausti said her family was forced to leave Basque country after the attempt on their lives, which left many other journalists fearing for their own lives. Intxausti said the jailing of the four ETA bombers has given her family closure. 'It is proven that they went to kill without caring that my child was with us,' Intxausti told El Pais. 'It puts an end to a tragic event that occurred in 2000,' she said. 'I have to thank the Civil Guard, who discovered who the people who wanted to kill us were, and to the court for issuing a fair sentence.' ETA, which killed 858 people during its four-decade armed campaign, renounced its use of arms in 2011. The organization also kidnapped 77 people, threatened 42,000 others and carried out 9,000 assaults, according to a 2013 study by the University of Seville. It said 326 journalists had been threatened by the separatist organization, according to data from the Spanish police. Another report, by the Committee to Protect Journalists, from 2001 found ETA’s attacks on reporters threatened press freedom. 'Press freedom is generally respected in Spain, and the CPJ does not routinely monitor conditions in the country; however, a series of attacks on journalists by ETA, including the murder of a prominent columnist from El Mundo [newspaper] greatly alarmed journalists during 2000, forcing many to leave the Basque region and others to hire full-time bodyguards,' the report said. 'ETA is using the same kind of terror tactics used by [late Spanish dictator General Francisco] Franco,' it said. In 2018, ETA issued an apology for its actions and accepted that it bore 'direct responsibility' for years of bloodshed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eta-terrorists-jailed-in-spain-for-attempted-murder-of-journalists/7899061.html	2024-12-12T09:34:57-08:00	
ByteDance seeks to delay US TikTok ban, putting hope on Trump administration	WASHINGTON — As the deadline approaches for ByteDance to divest from TikTok or face a ban in the United States, the Chinese company made an appeal Monday to U.S. courts to extend the date of the ultimatum until after President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. The current deadline requires ByteDance to divest from TikTok by Jan. 19, 2025, a day before Trump is sworn into office. Despite an unsuccessful attempt in his first term to ban the social media platform, Trump promised during his recent presidential campaign to save the video-hosting service –– a promise that ByteDance is willing to bet on as it seeks to extend the 'divest or ban' deadline. In April, Congress addressed the perceived national security concerns posed by TikTok. The decision to ban or divest the platform was unanimously upheld as constitutional by the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals on December 6. 'The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,' the court, in an opinion written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg, said Friday. 'Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary’s ability to gather data on people in the United States.' TikTok has over 170 million users in the United States. A September survey conducted by the Pew Research Center showed that 17% of American adults regularly get news from the platform. Trump, once a staunch opponent of the app, now stands to become its savior, pending the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court to grant ByteDance an extension on the deadline. During his first term, Trump signed an executive order banning TikTok. In the order, which was ultimately blocked by a federal judge, Trump expressed concerns over data privacy and the threat TikTok could pose to U.S. national security. Last June, Trump created a TikTok account which has since amassed nearly 15 million followers and 106 million likes. In a video posted on Truth Social in September, he appealed to voters. 'For all of those that want to save TikTok in America, vote for Trump,' he said. Analysts argue that Trump’s change in tone could be attributed to his personal relationship with the platform and its potential use in negotiations with China. 'Trump became familiar with TikTok during the campaign and saw how it helped him reach a massive following in the U.S.,' said Anupam Chander, a law professor at Georgetown University who focuses on global new technology regulation. 'He also still blames TikTok's main rival, Facebook, for his election loss in 2020 because of what he sees as censorship by Facebook,' Chander told VOA. Beyond his connection to the app, Trump could benefit from using the uncertain fate of the social media app as leverage against the Chinese government as part of 'his transactional approach to politics,' said Emile Dirks, a researcher at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. 'Trump has threatened to impose further tariffs on Chinese goods in response to alleged Chinese inaction on fentanyl shipments to the United States. He may treat the looming ban or forced sale of the social networking service as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Beijing,' Dirks told VOA by email. Chander also said that TikTok holds geopolitical importance and highlighted that the platform could even be used to ease strained U.S.-China relations. 'While much of the attention has been focused on Trump's tariff strategy, the TikTok ban is part of what some are calling the 'tech Cold War' between the two countries,' he said. 'If Trump can save TikTok in the United States, it would help ease tensions between the two countries,' Chander added. The president-elect’s promise to 'save TikTok' might not be as simple as his words suggest. Within the pool of his proposed Cabinet members is a discordant stance on the validity and necessity of a TikTok ban. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s choice for director of national intelligence, has over a million followers on TikTok, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his choice for secretary of Health and Human Services, has more than 3 million followers. Both have publicly criticized legislation that would force the sale of TikTok or impose a ban. But Senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, has previously called for a complete ban on TikTok, describing it as a 'spyware' tool for China. Brendan Carr, Trump's nominee for Federal Communications Commission chairman, told Time magazine in November 2022 that he 'can't see a path forward without a ban' and that TikTok poses a 'huge national security risk.' The variance in Republican attitudes toward TikTok reflects a broader trend within the Republican stance toward China that will color the foreign policy pursuits of the new administration, according to Dirks. 'While some Republicans are foreign policy hawks who see Beijing as the paramount threat facing the United States, others are America First nationalists with little appetite for leveraging U.S. power to support East Asian democracies like Taiwan. These two sides will jockey for Trump’s support under his second presidency, much as they did under his first term in office,' he told VOA. Still, despite the Biden administration’s imperative to change American policy on TikTok, and Trump’s own attempts to ban the platform and internal division, Chander said that Trump will most likely hold true to his word to protect the social media platform. 'President Trump will not want to begin his term breaking his promise to save TikTok. He will try to obtain some additional concessions from TikTok about how they manage their algorithm and the data of U.S. residents,' he said. TikTok denies being controlled by or sharing data with the Chinese government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bytedance-seeks-to-delay-tiktok-ban-putting-hope-on-trump-administration/7899041.html	2024-12-12T09:08:34-08:00	
Trump invites China's Xi, other world leaders to his inauguration	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and other foreign leaders to his January 20 inauguration, but it is not known yet whether any of them plan to attend the ceremony on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Fox News it was yet 'to be determined' whether Xi will accept Trump’s invitation, which was extended in early November, shortly after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris for a new four-year term in the White House. She did not name other world leaders who have been invited. Typically, foreign ambassadors to Washington and other diplomats have witnessed the peaceful quadrennial transfers of U.S. presidential power but not heads of government. State Department records dating to 1874 show that no foreign leader has attended a U.S. presidential inauguration. But Leavitt said the invitations to the noontime outdoor ceremony in six weeks are 'an example of President Trump creating an open dialogue with leaders of countries that are not just our allies but our adversaries and our competitors, too. He is willing to talk to anyone, and he will always put America's interests first.' If Xi travels to Washington, it could provide a first opportunity during Trump’s second presidential term for the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies to discuss contentious trade and military issues. Trump has threatened to impose massive tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States, partly to push Beijing to curb the deadly flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to boost the sale of U.S. products in China. The U.S. has imposed a January 19 deadline, the eve of the inauguration, for TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the social media app or face a ban in the U.S. TikTok is fighting the ban in court; it lost a bid last week to block the ban but is appealing the case to the Supreme Court. Trump on Thursday, during an appearance at the New York Stock Exchange, where he was ringing the bell to open the market, said he's been 'thinking about inviting certain people to the inauguration' without referring to any specific individuals. 'And some people said, 'Wow, that's a little risky, isn't it?'' Trump said. 'And I said, 'Maybe it is. We'll see. We'll see what happens.' But we like to take little chances.' The Kremlin separately on Thursday said President Vladimir Putin, at war with U.S.-supported Ukraine for nearly three years, has not received an inaugural invitation. Since his election victory, Trump has met or talked with several world leaders, including visits with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Argentine President Javier Milei, at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida oceanside retreat. In addition, Trump met with French President Emmanuel Macron, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Britian’s Prince William in Paris last weekend at the reopening of the refurbished Notre Dame Cathedral, much of which was gutted by a fire five years ago. 'World leaders are lining up to meet with President Trump because they know he will soon return to power and restore peace through American strength around the globe,' Leavitt said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-invites-china-s-xi-other-world-leaders-to-his-inauguration/7899021.html	2024-12-12T08:52:09-08:00	
Israel refuses to withdraw from Syrian border zone for now	JERUSALEM — Israeli troops this week took over a buffer zone between Israel and Syria in the wake of the Syrian government’s fall, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says they will remain for now. After a meeting with Biden administration national security advisor Jake Sullivan in Jerusalem, Netanyahu’s office said that Israeli troops will stay in the buffer zone next to the Golan Heights until some force on the Syrian side can ensure security for Israelis. The United Nations, France and other countries have accused Israel of violating the 1974 disengagement agreement between the Mideast neighbors, but Israeli officials say the move is temporary. Israeli officials say they fear that the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad created a vacuum as Syrian troops in the buffer zone fled. Netanyahu’s office said that Israel will not permit militant groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities in the Golan Heights with October 7-style attacks. The statement referred to the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas from Gaza that killed some 1,200 Israelis and led to 250 being taken captive, 100 of whom, living and dead, are still being held. Brigadier General (Reserve) Nitzan Nuriel, the former head of the Counter-Terrorism Bureau of the Israeli National Security Counci, said Israel is carefully watching events in Syria. 'The worst-case scenario for Syria is that Syria may become the Somalia of the Middle East, meaning many organizations fighting each other,' Nuriel said. '‘Stability’ will not be the nickname of Syria for the next few years.' Israel also has launched hundreds of airstrikes on weapons stores and seized tanks and other weaponry. Military analysts say they believe Israel has destroyed almost all of Syria’s offensive capability. 'This is a pure preemptive attack to make sure that those unexpected rivals will not be able to use aircraft, artillery, chemical weapons and ... so on,' Nuriel said. Former senior intelligence official Avi Melamed said Israel is watching as the rebel groups who overthrew Assad take control in Syria. He said that rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani seems to be taking power in Damascus. The concern, Melamed said, is that Jolani leads the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group the Biden administration has designated as a terrorist organization and says has links to al-Qaida. 'He is coming from al-Qaida,' Melamed said. 'He was operating in Iraq and in Syria.' But Melamed said that in recent years Jolani has broken away from al-Qaida and seems to have moderated his positions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-refuses-to-withdraw-from-syrian-border-zone-for-now/7898978.html	2024-12-12T08:39:41-08:00	
Funeral held for slain Afghan Taliban minister; IS-K claims credit for killing	Islamabad — Thousands of mourners assembled in eastern Afghanistan Thursday for the funeral of the high-profile Taliban minister of refugees, a day after his assassination in a suicide bombing for which a regional Islamic State affiliate has claimed responsibility. Minister Khalil-Ur-Rahman Haqqani was targeted while he was exiting his office building in the Afghan capital, Kabul, on Wednesday, marking the most significant casualty inflicted on the Taliban since they swept back to power in August 2021. The blast also killed and injured several ministry employees, but Taliban officials have refrained from commenting on the reported casualties from what they denounced as a 'cowardly attack' against Haqqani. The funeral was held in Haqqani’s native eastern Afghan province of Paktia, which borders Pakistan, where senior Taliban leaders, ministers, and other officials were also in attendance. The Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, IS-Khorasan or IS-K, through its Amaq News Agency media wing, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying a bomber detonated an explosive vest inside the Afghan Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation. Haqqani was listed by the United States’ Rewards for Justice website as a global terrorist and carried a $5 million bounty for information leading to his apprehension. The 58-year-old was a central leader of the Haqqani network, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization headed by his nephew, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who serves as the de facto Taliban interior minister. The younger Haqqani also carries a $10 million bounty on his head for allegedly directing terrorist attacks against American and NATO troops until they withdrew from Afghanistan in August 2021 after nearly two decades of presence. Wednesday’s deadly attack has drawn condemnation from the United Nations, the European Union, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and countries such as neighboring Iran and Pakistan, along with Qatar and Saudi Arabia. 'There can be no place for terrorism in the quest for stability,' the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said on X, formerly known as Twitter, offering condolences to the victims' families. IS-K has claimed responsibility for previous gun and bomb attacks in the country, targeting Taliban leaders, prominent religious figures loyal to them, Shi’ite community members, and foreigners. The violence has prompted de facto Afghan authorities to conduct regular counterterrorism operations that they claim have degraded the group’s ability to pose any significant threat. However, critics dispute Taliban claims, citing the continued launch of high-profile IS-K attacks in the country, which is reeling from years of war and natural disasters. U.N. assessments and U.S. officials have described the group as a significant threat to Afghanistan and regional stability at large.	https://www.voanews.com/a/funeral-held-for-slain-afghan-taliban-minister-is-k-claims-credit-for-killing/7898958.html	2024-12-12T08:38:49-08:00	
Brazil's Lula recovering from second brain surgery	Doctors in Brazil say President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had a surgical procedure Thursday to treat bleeding in his brain – his second this week. The operation was successful, and he was recovering in a hospital’s intensive care unit – ICU. Speaking to reporters at Sao Paulo's Sirio-Libanes Hospital, the president’s doctor, Roberto Kalil Filho, said the 79-year-old Lula was awake and speaking, following the early-morning procedure, which lasted about an hour. Doctors performed a 'middle meningeal artery embolization,' a minimally invasive treatment that blocks one or more blood vessels, in this case intended to reduce the risk of future bleeding. They said he is expected to be moved from the ICU Friday and released from the hospital to resume normal activities next week. Thursday’s procedure follows a two-hour 'unscheduled' surgery Tuesday to drain bleeding between his brain and the meningeal membrane that surrounds it. Lula traveled from Brasilia, 1,000 kilometers south to Sao Paulo, in the early hours of Tuesday to be treated. Doctors said the surgery was linked to an accident at the president ‘s official residence in October. Media reports said he was trimming his toenails in the bathroom October 19 when he fell and hit his head. He was taken to the hospital, received five stitches and was discharged, but as a precaution, doctors barred him from traveling to a BRICS intergovernmental summit in Russia. At the time of the accident, Dr. Filho told GloboNews TV the president’s fall caused 'great' trauma to the back of his head, requiring stitches and resulting in a 'small brain hemorrhage' in the temporal-frontal region. He said then that the injury would have to be monitored. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-s-lula-recovering-from-second-brain-surgery/7898918.html	2024-12-12T08:07:14-08:00	
Meta donates $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund	NEW YORK — Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said it has donated $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration fund. The donation comes just weeks after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump privately at Mar-a-Lago. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the offering Thursday. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Stephen Miller, who has been appointed deputy chief of staff for Trump's second term, has said that Zuckerberg, like other business leaders, wants to support Trump's economic plans. The tech CEO has been seeking to change his company's perception on the right following a rocky relationship with Trump. Trump was kicked off Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The company restored his account in early 2023. During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president but has voiced a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump's response to his first assassination attempt. Still, Trump had continued to attack Zuckerberg publicly during the campaign. In July, he posted a message on his own social network Truth Social threatening to send election fraudsters to prison in part by citing a nickname he used for the Meta CEO. 'ZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!' Trump wrote. Corporations have traditionally made up a large share of donors to presidential inaugurals, with an exception in 2009, when then-President-elect Barack Obama refused to accept corporate donations. He reversed course for his second inaugural in 2013. Facebook did not donate to either Biden's 2021 inaugural or Trump's 2017 inaugural.

As tourists discover Finland's Santa Claus Village, some locals call for rules to control the masses	Rovaniemi, Finland — Shuffling across icy ground on a cold December afternoon, lots of tourist groups poured into Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park perched on the edge of the Arctic Circle. They frolic in the snow, take a reindeer sleigh ride, sip a cocktail in an ice bar or even meet Saint Nick himself in the capital of Finnish Lapland, Rovaniemi, which happily calls itself the 'official hometown of Santa Claus.' The Santa Claus Village theme park, which attracts more than 600,000 people annually, is especially popular during the holiday season. 'This is like my dream came true,' beamed Polish visitor Elzbieta Nazaruk. 'I'm really excited to be here.' Tourism is booming in Rovaniemi — which has hotel and restaurant owners, as well as city officials, excited as it brings lots of money to the town. However, not everyone is happy about the onslaught of visitors, 10 times the town's population, each year at Christmas time. 'We are worried about the overgrowth of tourism. Tourism has grown so rapidly, it's not anymore in control,' said 43-year-old Antti Pakkanen, a photographer and member of a housing network that in September organized a rally through the city's streets. It's a feeling that has been echoed in other popular European travel destinations, including Barcelona, Amsterdam, Malaga and Florence. Across the continent, locals have protested against 'over-tourism' — which generally describes the tipping point at which visitors and their cash stop benefiting residents and instead cause harm by degrading historic sites, overwhelming infrastructure and making life markedly more difficult for those who live there. Now, it seems to have spread north, all the way to the edges of the Arctic Circle. Rovaniemi counted a record 1.2 million overnight visitors in 2023, almost 30 percent growth on 2022, after rebounding from pandemic travel disruptions. 'Nordic is a trend,' Visit Rovaniemi CEO Sanna Karkkainen, said as she stood in an ice restaurant, where snow carvers were working nearby. 'People want to travel to cool countries to see the snow, to see the Northern Lights, and, of course, to see Santa Claus,' she added. Thirteen new flight routes to Rovaniemi Airport opened this year, bringing passengers from Geneva, Berlin, Bordeaux and more. Most tourists come from European countries like France, Germany and the UK, but Rovaniemi's appeal has also spread further. Hotel availability is scarce this winter, and Tiina Maatta, general manager of the 159-room Original Sokos Hotel, expects 2024 to break more records. Local critics of mass tourism say many apartment buildings in Rovaniemi's city center are also used for accommodation services during peak season and are thus no longer available for residential use. They say the proliferation of short-term rentals has driven up prices, squeezed out long-term residents, and turned its city center into a 'transient space for tourists.' Finnish law prohibits professional accommodation services in buildings intended for residential use, so campaigners are calling on authorities to act. 'The rules must be enforced better,' said Pakkanen. Not everyone agrees. Mayor Ulla-Kirsikka Vainio notes some make 'good money' on short-term rentals. Either way, stricter regulations likely won't be in place to impact this winter season, and despite the unease expressed by locals, mass tourism to Rovaniemi is probably only going to grow in 2025 — as visitors want to experience the unique atmosphere up north, especially during the holiday season. 'It's Christmas time and we would love to see the Northern Lights,' says Joy, a visitor from Bangkok. 'Rovaniemi seems to be a good place.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-tourists-discover-finland-s-santa-claus-village-some-locals-call-for-rules-to-control-the-masses/7898765.html	2024-12-12T06:07:48-08:00	
Trump is named Time's Person of the Year	New York — About six months ago, Donald Trump was sitting in a courtroom in lower Manhattan listening to a jury make him the first former president convicted of a crime. On Thursday, he will ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange just blocks from that courthouse and as he was recognized by Time magazine as its person of the year. The honors for the businessman-turned-politician represent the latest chapter in his love-hate relationship with New York. They're also a measure of Trump's remarkable comeback from an ostracized former president who refused to accept his election loss four years ago to a president-elect who won the White House decisively in November. Sam Jacobs, Time's editor in chief, announced on NBC's 'Today' show on Thursday morning that Trump was Time's 2024 Person of the Year. Jacobs said Trump was someone who 'for better or for worse, had the most influence on the news in 2024.' Trump is expected to be on Wall Street to mark the ceremonial start of the day's trading, according to four people with knowledge of his plans who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Trump was also Time's Person of the Year in 2016, when he was first elected to the White House. He was listed as a finalist for this year's award alongside notables including Vice President Kamala Harris, X owner Elon Musk, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Kate, the Princess of Wales. The NYSE regularly invites celebrities and business leaders to participate in the 9:30 a.m. ceremonial opening trading. Thursday will be Trump's first time doing the honors, which have become a marker of culture and politics. Last year, Time CEO Jessica Sibley rang the NYSE opening bell to unveil the magazine's 2023 Person of the Year: Taylor Swift. During Trump's first term, his wife, Melania Trump, rang the bell to promote her 'Be Best' initiative on children's well-being. Donald Trump's trip to New York from his adopted home of Florida to sound the call of capitalism in the mecca of finance tops a string of visits that the former president has made to various spots in the city this year. Outside of his required presence in a downtown courthouse for his trial, Trump, who is always attuned to the art of a photo op, held campaign events around the city: at a firehouse, a bodega and a construction site. He also held a rally in the Bronx, among the places in the city where Trump made inroads during the election. To mark the final stretch of his campaign, he held a high-octane rally at Madison Square Garden, which drew immediate blowback after speakers there made rude and racist insults and incendiary remarks. Trump has long had a fascination with being on the cover of Time, where he first made an appearance in 1989. He has falsely claimed to hold the record for cover appearances, and The Washington Post reported in 2017 that Trump had a fake picture of himself on the cover of the magazine hanging in several of his golf country clubs. Trump crafted his image as a wealthy real estate developer, which he played up as the star of the TV reality show 'The Apprentice' and during his presidential campaign. He won the election in part by channeling Americans' anxieties about the economy's ability to provide for the middle class. After the Nov. 5 election, the S&P 500 rallied 2.5% for its best day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,508 points, or 3.6%, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 3%. All three indexes topped records they had set in previous weeks. Trump, who often regards the stock market as a measure of public support, has said his coming term as president should be dated to the day after the election so he is credited for the gains. Trump's campaign promises have included pledges to deliver historic levels of economic growth, and the people he's selecting to fill out his incoming administration skew heavily from the business sector. The larger business community has applauded his promises to reduce corporate taxes and cut regulations. But there are also concerns about his stated plans to impose broad tariffs and possibly target companies that he sees as not aligning with his own political interests. The U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins the White House, with Democrats scoring bigger average gains since 1945. But Republican control could mean big shifts in the winning and losing industries underneath the surface, and investors are adding to bets built earlier on what the higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation that Trump favors will mean. In light of his election win, his lawyers have sought to have his conviction in the Manhattan case be thrown out.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-is-named-time-s-person-of-the-year/7898755.html	2024-12-12T05:55:52-08:00	
Biden commutes roughly 1,500 sentences and pardons 39 people in biggest single-day act of clemency	Washington — President Joe Biden is commuting the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic and is pardoning 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes. It's the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history. The commutations announced Thursday are for people who have served out home confinement sentences for at least one year after they were released. Prisons were uniquely bad for spreading the virus and some inmates were released in part to stop the spread. At one point, 1 in 5 prisoners had COVID-19, according to a tally kept by The Associated Press. Biden said he would be taking more steps in the weeks ahead and would continue to review clemency petitions. The second largest single-day act of clemency was by Barack Obama, with 330, shortly before leaving office in 2017. 'America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances,' Biden said in a statement. 'As president, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their communities, and taking steps to remove sentencing disparities for non-violent offenders, especially those convicted of drug offenses.' The clemency follows a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was prosecuted for gun and tax crimes. Biden is under pressure from advocacy groups to pardon broad swaths of people, including those on federal death row, before the Trump administration takes over in January. He's also weighing whether to issue preemptive pardons to those who investigated Trump's effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and are facing possible retribution when he takes office. Those pardoned Thursday had been convicted of nonviolent crimes such as drug offenses and turned their lives around, White House lawyers said. They include a woman who led emergency response teams during natural disasters; a church deacon who has worked as an addiction counselor and youth counselor; a doctoral student in molecular biosciences; and a decorated military veteran. The president had previously issued 122 commutations and 21 other pardons. He's also broadly pardoned those convicted of use and simple possession of marijuana on federal lands and in the District of Columbia, and pardoned former U.S. service members convicted of violating a now-repealed military ban on consensual gay sex. Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., and 34 other lawmakers are urging the president to pardon environmental and human rights lawyer Steven Donziger, who was imprisoned or under house arrest for three years because of a contempt of court charge related to his work representing Indigenous farmers in a lawsuit against Chevron. Others are advocating for Biden to commute the sentences of federal death row prisoners. His attorney general, Merrick Garland, paused federal executions. Biden had said on the campaign trail in 2020 that he wanted to end the death penalty but he never did, and now, with Trump coming back into office, it's likely executions will resume. During his first term, Trump presided over an unprecedented number of federal executions, carried out during the height of the pandemic. More pardons are coming before Biden leaves office on Jan. 20, but it's not clear whether he'll take action to guard against possible prosecution by Trump, an untested use of the power. The president has been taking the idea seriously and has been thinking about it for as much as six months — before the presidential election — but has been concerned about the precedent it would set, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions. But those who received the pardons would have to accept them. New California Sen. Adam Schiff, who was the chairman of the congressional committee that investigated the violent Jan. 6 insurrection, said such a pardon from Biden would be 'unnecessary,' and that the president shouldn't be spending his waning days in office worrying about this. A president has the power to both pardon, in which a person is relieved of guilt and punishment, or commute a sentence, which reduces or eliminates the punishment but doesn't exonerate the wrongdoing. It's customary for a president to grant mercy at the end of his term, using the power of the office to wipe away records or end prison terms. Before pardoning his son, Biden had repeatedly pledged not to do so. He said in a statement explaining his reversal that the prosecution had been poisoned by politics. The decision prompted criminal justice advocates and lawmakers to put additional public pressure on the administration to use that same power for everyday Americans. It wasn't a very popular move; only about 2 in 10 Americans approved of his decision, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-commutes-roughly-1-500-sentences-and-pardons-39-people-in-biggest-single-day-act-of-clemency/7898674.html	2024-12-12T04:42:05-08:00	
Israel says troops to remain in Syrian buffer zone until security guaranteed	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Thursday that Israeli forces will remain in a Syrian buffer zone adjacent to the Golan Heights until a force on the Syrian side can guarantee security. The Israeli troops advanced from their side of the Golan Heights into the buffer zone and onto the Syrian side after rebels ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 'Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities on the Golan Heights with October 7th style attacks,' Netanyahu’s office said. The Israeli move has been criticized by the United Nations as a violation of a 1974 agreement that defines lines separating Israeli and Syrian forces with a U.N.-monitored buffer area in between. France, Iran, Russia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia have also criticized the Israeli move, and the United States has said it is important for the deployment to be temporary. The main commander of the Syrian fighters who deposed Assad said Wednesday that anyone involved in the torture and killing of people Assad detained during his iron-fisted rule would be hunted down, with pardons out of the question. 'We will pursue them in Syria, and we ask countries to hand over those who fled so we can achieve justice,' Abu Mohammed al-Golani said in a statement published on the Syrian state TV's Telegram channel. Golani’s vow to extract revenge against Assad’s lieutenants of torture and death came as the world is watching to see if Syria's new rulers can stabilize the country after civil war fought for nearly 14 years along sectarian and ethnic lines has left it in shambles. Mohammed al-Bashir, the man installed by Jolani's fighters to lead an interim administration through March 1, pleaded with millions of refugees to return home, create unity and provide basic services. But rebuilding is a daunting proposition with little funding on hand. 'In the coffers, there are only Syrian pounds worth little or nothing. One U.S. dollar buys 35,000 of our coins,' Bashir told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. 'We have no foreign currency, and as for loans and bonds, we are still collecting data. So yes, financially we are very bad,' said Bashir, who previously ran a small rebel-led administration in a pocket of northwestern Syria. But Bashir said the Islamist-led alliance that ousted Assad will guarantee the rights of all religious groups. 'Precisely because we are Islamic, we will guarantee the rights of all people and all sects in Syria,' Bashir said. More than 500,000 people were killed in the war, with more than half the population forced to flee their homes. About 6 million Syrians sought refuge abroad. Bashir pleaded with those who fled the violence to return home. In his interview with Corriere della Sera, he said, 'Syria is now a free country that has earned its pride and dignity. Come back.' Foreign officials are warily engaging with the former rebels, part of the former al-Qaida affiliate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which remains designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and others. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the new government must 'uphold clear commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance to all in need, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbors.' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, 'It's our duty to do everything to support different Syrian leaders in order to make sure that they come together, they are able to guarantee a smooth transition.' But the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the security situation in Syria remains volatile. The agency said it has found more than 50 minefields over the past 10 days, which is curtailing the movement of civilians and impeding the delivery of goods and services. Some information for this report was provided by from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-troops-to-remain-in-syrian-buffer-zone-until-security-guaranteed/7898667.html	2024-12-12T04:25:55-08:00	
Rights group accuses Russian mercenaries of abuses against civilians in Mali	DAKAR, SENEGAL — Mali’s armed forces, supported by Russian mercenaries, committed abuses against civilians since the withdrawal of a U.N. peacekeeping mission late last year, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday. Malian armed forces and the Russia-backed Wagner Group deliberately killed at least 32 civilians, including seven in a drone strike, kidnapped four others, and burned at least 100 homes in towns and villages in central and northern Mali since May, the rights group said. Human Rights Watch also accused jihadi groups in the region of having summarily executed at least 47 civilians and displaced thousands of people since June. It said the groups burned thousands of houses and looted livestock, which is vital to the survival of the nomadic communities in the region. 'The Malian army with the Wagner Group and Islamist armed groups have been targeting civilians and their property in violation of the laws of war,' Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in the report. Mali, along with its neighbors Burkina Faso and Niger, has for over a decade battled an insurgency fought by jihadi groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. Following military coups in all three nations in recent years, the ruling juntas have expelled French forces and turned to Russia’s mercenary units for security assistance. Wagner has been present in Mali since late 2021 following a military coup, replacing French troops and international peacekeepers to help fight the militants. At the same time, the mercenary group has been accused of helping to carry out raids and drone strikes that have killed civilians. In December last year, the United Nations ended its decade long peacekeeping mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA, following the government’s request that alleged the force was inadequate to respond to the insurgency. 'Since MINUSMA left Mali a year ago, it has been extremely difficult to get comprehensive information on abuses, and we are deeply concerned that the situation is even worse than reported,' Allegrozzi said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rights-group-accuses-russian-mercenaries-of-abuses-against-civilians-in-mali/7898587.html	2024-12-12T02:53:20-08:00	
South Korea's top court upholds 2-year jail term for opposition MP	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's top court upheld on Thursday a two-year jail term for an opposition lawmaker on charges including bribery and academic fraud in a scandal that has deepened the political divide in the country and disenchanted many young voters. The verdict stripped Cho Kuk, a former justice minister and President Yoon Suk Yeol's adversary, who now runs the minor opposition Rebuilding Korea Party, of his seat in parliament and his right to run for office for the next five years. It could also undermine the opposition camp's all-out efforts to impeach Yoon over his martial law attempt in a vote scheduled for Saturday, even though another member will inherit Cho's seat -- among the party's 12 in the single-chamber, 300-seat assembly. The Seoul Central District Court convicted Cho early last year of falsifying documents to send his children to prestigious high schools and universities, taking 6 million won ($4,200) in bribery in the form of their scholarships, and peddling influence to hamper a corruption investigation involving a confidant to then President Moon Jae-in. The Supreme Court confirmed the lower court's ruling that sentenced him to two years in prison and a fine of 6 million won, saying in a statement that there was no error in that decision. It was unclear when Cho will be imprisoned. He has denied wrongdoing and said after the verdict that he would accept it with a 'heavy heart' and his party would continue activities. 'I have a lot to say, but I won't,' he told a news conference. 'But it doesn't mean that our party is backing down.' His party earlier said in a statement that it respects the verdict but expressed regret, adding that Yoon had ordered a 'brutal' investigation against Cho when he was prosecutor-general. 'His role is crucial in resolving the mess that Yoon's gang has made. Why now?' the party said in a statement. Once a star law professor, Cho was a key aide to Moon and briefly served as justice minister before resigning and being indicted in late 2019. Cho's scandal divided the already polarized country and frustrated many young voters, dealing a crushing blow to Moon's progressive Democratic Party and making way for Yoon's foray into politics and eventual election victory in 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-top-court-upholds-2-year-jail-term-for-opposition-mp/7898584.html	2024-12-12T02:45:50-08:00	
Ukrainian drones hit Russia’s Chechnya region	The head of Russia’s Chechnya region said Thursday a Ukrainian drone attack hit a police barracks, injuring at least four people. Ramzan Kadyrov said on Telegram the drone damaged the building’s roof and windows and also caused a small fire. The attack was the second to hit a police facility in the region this month, according to Kadyrov. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it shot down a drone over Chechnya, as well as four drones over Kursk, three over North Ossetia and eight over Russia-occupied Crimea. In Ukraine, the governor of the Kherson region said Russian drones attacked Thursday, with one injuring a man in the city of Kherson. Missile warfare Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russia would respond to Ukraine’s use of U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles, which Russian defense officials said were used in a Wednesday strike on a Russian airfield in the city of Taganrog. 'The response will follow in a manner deemed appropriate. But it will definitely follow,' Peskov said. A U.S. official said Wednesday that a U.S. intelligence assessment has concluded Russia could launch another of its experimental hypersonic ballistic missiles against Ukraine in the coming days, although Washington does not consider it to be decisive in the nearly three-year war. Russia first fired the Oreshnik missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on November 21, in what President Vladimir Putin characterized as a response to Ukraine's first use of long-range U.S. and British missiles to strike more deeply into Russian territory with Western permission. 'We assess that the Oreshnik is not a game-changer on the battlefield, but rather just another attempt by Russia to terrorize Ukraine, which will fail,' the U.S. official told reporters. There was no immediate response from Russia. Putin had said that Russia might fire the Oreshnik missile again, possibly to target 'decision-making centers' in Kyiv, if Ukraine keeps attacking Russia with long-range Western weapons. The Russian leader has claimed that the Oreshnik is impossible to intercept and that it has destructive power comparable to that of a nuclear weapon, even when fitted with a conventional warhead. Some Western experts have said the novel feature of the Oreshnik is that it carries multiple warheads that can simultaneously strike different targets — a capability usually associated with longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles. Nonetheless, the U.S. official downplayed the usefulness of the missiles, calling them 'experimental' in nature and saying that 'Russia likely possesses only a handful' of them. The official also said the weapon has a smaller warhead than other missiles Russia has deployed in Ukraine. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-drones-hit-russia-s-chechnya-region/7898576.html	2024-12-12T02:37:24-08:00	
Case filed against Libya over South African journalist killed in 2011	Washington — Closure has been elusive for Penny Sukhraj-Hammerl for more than a decade. Her husband, South African photojournalist Anton Hammerl, was shot and killed in the Libyan desert on April 5, 2011, by pro-Moammar Gadhafi forces. Since then, the questions have outnumbered the answers, and justice has remained a far-off hope, Sukhraj-Hammerl, also a journalist, told VOA from London. At the time of Hammerl’s killing, Libyan authorities claimed he was in their custody alongside three other journalists, including American James Foley. It wasn’t until more than a month later when the three journalists were released that they called Sukhraj-Hammerl to let her know her husband had been killed. 'They told me that Anton had been shot. They told me that they saw him being shot,' Sukhraj-Hammerl said. 'After that, there was nothing. So, that was most tragic. It was awful. And that’s Day One of our world completely caving in,' she said. With that phone call, more than a month of false hope slowly gave way to more than a decade of unanswered questions and unresolved pain. Hammerl is survived by his wife and their two sons. To date, his body has not been returned to them. But more than 13 years since her husband was killed, Sukhraj-Hammerl is taking new steps to achieve justice. On Thursday, a legal team filed a case at the U.N. Human Rights Committee against Libya on behalf of Hammerl and Sukhraj-Hammerl, hoping to finally achieve justice in the photojournalist’s death. 'We still don’t have any closure. After learning of his death, to have no body, to have nothing, it almost is impossible to still accept,' Sukhraj-Hammerl said. 'It’s a long game, but we’re not giving up.' Thursday is Hammerl’s birthday. He would have been 55. Based in New York, the Human Rights Committee functions like a court. Caoilfhionn Gallagher, who is leading the legal team, told VOA that the two primary goals from the case are to recover Hammerl’s remains and hold accountable those responsible for his death. 'It’s often said that no journalist wants to become the story. But 13 years ago, Anton Hammerl became the story when he was killed,' Gallagher said. 'His family wants to ensure that his story is told, and that there’s accountability.' To date, the Libyan government has failed to help figure out what happened to Hammerl, Gallagher said. In this case, she is hoping for an investigation that holds accountable not only the soldiers who killed Hammerl but also those who contributed to the culture of impunity. 'Many Gadhafi officials at the time were describing foreign journalists as rats and as dogs, and there was a general sense that there was a green light if journalists were killed,' Gallagher said. 'That is part and parcel of what happened to Anton.' There’s also hope that Hammerl’s remains can be found, Gallagher said, because there was documentation of where bodies were at the time, and the remains of other people killed at the time have since been located. Libya’s Foreign Ministry and Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment for this story. With a lively personality, Hammerl was someone who commanded attention when he walked into a room, his widow said. 'He was just gregarious in his personality. He made you laugh,' she said. The memories of her husband are comforting, but Sukhraj-Hammerl is optimistic that her husband’s remains will one day be returned to her. 'Knowing what became of Anton’s remains and being able to do something to bring back his remains, perhaps, would be amazing,' she said. Part of why Sukhraj-Hammerl is turning to the Human Rights Committee is because no other avenues have worked. Libyan authorities have failed to help with an investigation. And while the governments of South Africa and Austria, where Hammerl was a dual citizen, were helpful at first, their efforts eventually waned, Sukhraj-Hammerl said. The United Kingdom, where the couple had lived for years, refused to help because neither of them was a British citizen. 'We fell between the cracks,' she said. Gallagher said it’s not surprising that Libyan authorities have been unhelpful. 'But my view is that the international community failed to step in and fill the gap,' she said. As a freelancer, Hammerl was motivated to go to Libya in the first place to report on the civil war and humanitarian crisis, which he didn’t think was getting enough attention. 'He was passionate about telling peoples’ stories,' Sukhraj-Hammerl said. The situation for journalists remains dangerous in Libya, which ranks 143 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, where 180 shows the worst media freedom environment. Hammerl’s case underscores a global phenomenon in which the perpetrators of journalist killings are not held accountable. Nearly 80% of journalist killings around the world remain unsolved, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. 'Anton’s case is, in so many ways, quite emblematic of what happens year after year,' Sukhraj-Hammerl said. The many years that have passed since her husband was killed have only fortified her commitment to fight for him. 'I actually really do still hold on and hope every single day that we’ll find out what really happened,' she said. 'I don’t give up hope. I can’t — not as far as I’m alive, anyway. I can’t. I can’t give up on trying to find out what really happened and what’s become of his remains. I find it difficult to give up on wanting to know.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/case-filed-against-libya-over-south-african-journalist-killed-in-2011/7898377.html	2024-12-12T02:30:00-08:00	
South Korea's tourism, soft power gains, at risk from extended political crisis	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — From plastic surgery clinics to tour firms and hotel chains, South Korea's hospitality sector is wary of the potential impact of a protracted political crisis, as some overseas travelers cancel trips following last week's brief bout of martial law. South Korea's travel and tourism industry, which generated $59.1 billion in 2023, around 3.8% of GDP, has held up through previous bumps in the road, including a 2016 presidential impeachment and periodic tensions with North Korea. But more than a dozen hospitality and administrative sources said the army's involvement in the latest political crisis was a serious development that could deter leisure and business travel, when the sector is approaching a full recovery in visitor numbers, which stood at 97% of pre-COVID levels as of October. 'There are concerns that safety issues in Seoul would throw cold water on the tourism industry,' Seoul mayor Oh Se-hoon said on Wednesday while meeting tourism industry officials to discuss a fall in travel demand. 'There is a growing number of examples of foreign tourists canceling visits to Seoul and shortening their stays,' Oh said, before declaring 'Seoul is safe,' in English, Chinese and Japanese to the media. Daily life and tourist activities have continued as usual, despite ongoing large protests, since President Yoon Suk Yeol rescinded his six hours of martial law on December 4 after parliament voted it down, with analysts noting that South Korea's institutional checks and balances seem to be holding up. Some tourists have since canceled bookings, albeit not in great numbers, while others are enquiring whether they could pull out should the situation change, travel and hospitality sources said. Accor hotel group, which includes the Fairmont and Sofitel brands, said it noted a 'slight increase' in cancellation rates since December 3, around 5% higher than in November. The Korea Tourism Start-up Association said on Friday bookings for the first half of 2025 already had seen a sharp decline. Rooms in previously fully booked hotels in the capital, Seoul, have become available due to cancellations with some hotels 'even lowering their rates and offering special deals to attract more bookings,' said an inbound travel agency that asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. A plastic surgery clinic in Seoul's upmarket Gangnam neighborhood also said some foreign patients had canceled visits since the martial law incident. 'We are not worried now, but if this situation continues, that would have an impact on foreign visitors,' a clinic representative said, declining to be named. South Korea is a top global destination for medical and plastic surgery tourism. Soft power The latest political crisis also threatens to deal a major blow to the country's brand, which has been improving thanks to Korean culture and economic success, said Kim Wou-kyung, head of a government brand promotion agency. The explosion to global prominence of South Korean drama, music and beauty, known as the 'Korean Wave,' plus a reputation for safety, and global brands such as Samsung, are key forms of soft power that the government leverages to grow tourist numbers. South Korea hopes to almost double the number of annual tourists by 2027 from 2019 levels, to 30 million. Part of the strategy also is to focus on group business travel for events including conferences and exhibitions, a sector known as MICE tourism, which could be impacted if the political crisis continues into early next year, said Ha Hong-kook, secretary-general at Korea MICE Association. The parliament plans to vote on a motion to impeach Yoon on Saturday, a week after its first impeachment vote was defeated. 'If we get through this immediate, unprecedented period ... into a clear route to new elections, then I think actually the impact won't be that bad,' said Andrew Gilholm, director at risk consultancy Control Risks Group. He said the country's reputation 'might even be improved' long-term by displaying how it comes through the problems. Su Shu, founder of Chinese firm Moment Travel in Chengdu, is also sanguine about travel demand for South Korea. 'No matter where there is chaos, there will be people who dare not go,' Su said. China is the largest source of foreign visitors to South Korea, followed by Japan and the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-tourism-soft-power-gains-at-risk-from-extended-political-crisis/7898571.html	2024-12-12T02:09:17-08:00	
Australia to charge tech companies for news content if they do not pay	SYDNEY — Australia's center-left government said on Thursday it planned new rules that would charge big tech firms millions of dollars if they did not pay Australian media companies for news hosted on their platforms. The move piles pressure on global tech giants such as Facebook-owner Meta Platforms and Alphabet's Google to pay publishers for content or face the risk of paying millions to continue operations in Australia. 'The news bargaining initiative will ... will create a financial incentive for agreement-making between digital platforms and news media businesses in Australia,' Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services Stephen Jones told a news conference. The platforms at risk will be significant social media platforms and search engines with an Australian-based revenue in excess of $160 million, he said. The charge will be offset for any commercial agreements that are voluntarily entered into between the platforms and news media businesses, Jones said. Tech companies condemned the plan. 'The proposal fails to account for the realities of how our platforms work, specifically that most people don't come to our platforms for news content and that news publishers voluntarily choose to post content on our platforms because they receive value from doing so,' a Meta spokesperson said after Jones' remarks. A spokesperson for Google said the government's decision 'risks ongoing viability of commercial deals with news publishers in Australia.' The proposed new rules come as Australia toughens its approach to the mostly U.S.-domiciled tech giants. Last month it became the first country to ban children under the age of 16 from social media, in a move seen as setting a benchmark for other governments' handling of Big Tech. Canberra also plans to threaten the companies with fines for failing to stamp out scams. Google, ByteDance through TikTok, and Meta through its various platforms, would fall within the scope of the charges under the new rules. However X, formerly Twitter, would not be covered, Jones said. Blocking news In 2021, Australia passed laws to make the U.S. tech giants, such as Google and Meta, compensate media companies for the links that lure readers and advertising revenue. After the move, Meta briefly blocked users from reposting news articles, but later struck deals with several Australian media firms, such as News Corp and national broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corp. It has said since it will not renew those arrangements beyond 2024. Meta, which also owns Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, has been scaling back its promotion of news and political content globally to drive traffic, and says news links are now a fraction of users' feeds. This year it said it would discontinue the news tab on Facebook in Australia and the United States, adding that it had canceled the tab last year in Britain, France and Germany. In 2023, Meta blocked users in Canada from reposting news content after its government took similar action. Australia news organizations, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, are expected to benefit from the new rules. Following Jones' announcement, News Corp Australia Executive Chairman Michael Miller said he would contact Meta and TikTok immediately to seek a commercial relationship with News Corp Australia. 'I believe news publishers and the tech platforms should have relationships that benefit both parties on commercial and broader terms,' he said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-to-charge-tech-companies-for-news-content-if-they-do-not-pay/7898562.html	2024-12-12T01:39:35-08:00	
Somalia, Ethiopia agree to end dispute	Ethiopia and Somalia reached an agreement Wednesday to end diplomatic tensions and to begin talks by February to iron out details over a controversial maritime access deal signed by Ethiopia with the breakaway Somalia region of Somaliland. The dispute between began January 1 when Somaliland’s president, Muse Bihi Abdi, and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed signed a 'historic' memorandum of understanding to lease 20 kilometers of seafront to Ethiopia for 50 years, in return for diplomatic recognition. The Somali government has rejected the deal, calling it 'null and void,' and has accused Ethiopia of 'blatant violation' of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Following Wednesday’s third round of talks mediated by Turkey’s President Tayyip Recep Erdogan, the president of Somalia, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, Ethiopia’s Ahmed, have agreed to assure to protect each other’s territorial unity and sovereignty, according to the published agreement. The 'Ankara Declaration' says, 'The Leaders of Somalia and Ethiopia reaffirmed their respect and commitment to one another’s sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity, as well as the principles enshrined in international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the Constitutive Act of the African Union.' It also says the two leaders agreed to forgo differences and cooperate in the interest of common prosperity. 'Somalia recognizes the sacrifices of Ethiopian soldiers within the African Union Missions. They acknowledged the potentially diverse benefits that could be derived from Ethiopia’s assured access to and from the sea, whilst respecting the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia,' the declaration read. 'The two leaders agreed, according to Turkey, that the countries would start 'technical negotiations' by February on details of Ethiopia's sea access, and that those negotiations would be facilitated by Turkey and be 'concluded and signed' within four months of starting.' The two sides agreed to work together to finalize 'mutually advantageous commercial arrangements through bilateral agreements, including contract, lease, and similar modalities, which will allow the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to enjoy reliable, secure and sustainable access to and from the sea, under the sovereign authority of the Federal Republic of Somalia.' Erdoğan brokered the agreement and commended the two sides. 'I would like to congratulate both brothers for coming to a compromise,' Erdogan said. Mohamud, speaking after Erdogan, said he is pleased with the agreement. 'In one aspect it’s a conclusion because It stops the differences we had the recent times,' he said. Mohamud said Somalia and Ethiopia have 'mutual interests in cooperating together and building prosperous futures of both our two countries and our two peoples.' 'Somalia, as has been, will remain a true friend of Ethiopia for the future and the years to come,' Mohamud said. Abiy, in his remarks, touched on similar points and has described the tensions between the two countries as a 'misunderstanding.' 'We are not only neighbors, but brothers and sisters, whose fates are bound by blood,' Abiy said. 'Not only do Ethiopians and Somalis share common ancestry, language and culture but we are also held together with the blood sacrifice that has been paid by thousands of Ethiopian soldiers in defense of the security of the state of Somalia from terrorist forces.' Somaliland announced secession from Somalia in 1991 but did not gain international recognition. Somalia considers Somaliland as part of Somalia. Landlocked Ethiopia has thousands of troops operating in Somalia as part of the African Union peacekeeping mission. Ethiopia has not officially said it will recognize Somaliland but has defended the deal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-ethiopia-agree-to-end-dispute/7898555.html	2024-12-12T00:49:05-08:00	
Korean journalists recount night of fear under Yoon’s martial law	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea’s most recent encounter with martial law may have only lasted a few hours, but for many South Korean journalists already facing growing harassment under President Yoon Suk Yeol’s government, the threat was deeply unsettling. Yoon’s decree late last Tuesday declared 'all media and publishing [to be] under the control of Martial Law Command,' evoking memories of South Korea’s past military dictatorships, with their strict media censorship. Though lawmakers overturned the decree, forcing Yoon to lift it within hours, South Korean journalists who spoke to VOA described moments of late-night panic, with many concerned they would become targets of martial law forces. One broadcaster, a prominent Yoon critic, said he went into hiding after martial law troops were seen outside his office. Another, who already faced defamation charges over his reporting on Yoon, recounted huddling with colleagues, bracing for what they feared was imminent arrest. At least one journalist reported being threatened with a taser by military police. The events marked a dramatic escalation of Yoon’s combative stance toward the media, which in some ways had already reached levels unprecedented in South Korea’s democratic history. A VOA investigation last year found that Yoon pursued criminal defamation charges against journalists and media outlets at a record pace. As investigators probe the failed martial law attempt as part of a treason inquiry into Yoon, many questions remain about the extent of his intentions. On Thursday, Yoon insisted he did not intend for the decree to result in violence, instead framing it as a 'strong message' to his political opponents, whom he described as North Korea sympathizers and anti-state forces. However, there is emerging evidence to suggest Yoon’s martial law forces were meant to target at least some media outlets and journalists who were critical of his conservative government. Soon after the decree went into effect, Kim Ou-joon, a liberal broadcaster and fierce Yoon critic, posted footage showing about 20 armed soldiers standing outside his office in central Seoul. Kim, whose YouTube channel has about 1.7 million subscribers, said he went into hiding, fearing for his life. 'It was an extremely urgent situation, and everyone panicked,' said Kim, who spoke to VOA on Wednesday as his personal guards stood watch outside his office. Kim had for months discussed on his show rumors about Yoon declaring martial law, even as other more mainstream commentators dismissed it as a far-fetched political smear. 'Yoon probably views the military dictatorship era as having an ideal media environment, and he wanted to return to that period, which is why he considered martial law,' Kim said. At least two South Korean newspapers reported that Yoon had instructed Cho Ji-ho, the commissioner-general of the Korean National Police Agency, to occupy several organizations, including MBC, one of the country’s largest broadcasters, which has also been the target of defamation charges by Yoon and his ruling party. There is no evidence that martial law forces ever visited MBC facilities. Nevertheless, in a statement, MBC’s labor union condemned the alleged MBC takeover plan as 'truly crazy,' saying it had exposed the 'true face' of Yoon. During the short-lived martial law attempt, fear extended beyond newsrooms, reaching even the reporters who were covering the developments at the defense ministry, which is directly opposite Yoon's office. Kwon Hyuk-cheol, a defense correspondent for the left-leaning Hankyoreh newspaper, was working a night shift when martial law was declared. About 20 minutes after the decree went into effect, military police at the ministry ordered journalists to leave the press room. When he refused, an officer who claimed to be 'just following orders' threatened to use his taser, Kwon told VOA. Meanwhile, in the nearby office of Newstapa, an online newspaper, Han Sang-jin and his colleagues gathered in fear of arrest. 'We knew that if armed soldiers came for us, there was no way to resist,' said Han, who was indicted in July on defamation charges after his home and office were raided by prosecutors last year. 'We were about to accept our fate.' In the end, no arrests or violence occurred during the six-hour ordeal and no media were placed under control of the military. But Han noted the decree marked an unprecedented escalation. While the previous 1980 martial law decree subjected media coverage to censorship, Yoon’s order aimed to place all media entirely under military control, Han said. 'Censorship only targets specific articles, but control implies the government could take over the entire operation of a media organization,' he explained. Yoon’s decree also banned 'fake news' and 'manipulation of public opinion'—terms that Kim believes were aimed at bolstering unfounded claims, including far-right allegations that April’s liberal landslide in the legislative election was fraudulent. Before his arrest this week, Yoon’s former defense minister, Kim Yong-hyun, who is suspected of involvement in the martial law attempt, told Korean media that martial law troops were sent to the country’s election commission to assess voter fraud claims. In a hearing this week, the head of South Korea’s special warfare command revealed that Yoon also ordered him to forcibly remove lawmakers from the National Assembly and cordon off key sites, including the legislative building, the opposition party headquarters, and the office of the YouTuber, Kim Ou-joon. The developments are expected to further damage South Korea’s global reputation for press freedom, which has already been in sharp decline, according to media watchdogs. In the 2024 World Press Freedom Index, released in May by Reporters Without Borders, known by its French language acronym, RSF, South Korea ranked 62nd out of 180 nations, a drop of 15 spots from the previous year. Following Yoon’s martial law attempt, South Korea’s National Union of Media Workers, which represents 15,000 journalists and media members, said it will no longer refer to Yoon as president. 'The recent insurrection was clearly unconstitutional,' said Yun Chang-hyun, the group’s chairman, 'which led us to believe that he lost his presidential qualification.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/korean-journalists-recount-night-of-fear-under-yoon-s-martial-law/7898549.html	2024-12-12T00:34:14-08:00	
Serbia's president says he won't flee his country like Syria's Assad did despite growing protests	BELGRADE, SERBIA — Serbia's president accused Tuesday foreign intelligence services of trying to unseat him in the wake of spreading protests in the Balkan state and that he wouldn't flee the country like the ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad. President Aleksandar Vučić posted a video message on Instagram saying: 'I will fight for Serbia and serve only my Serbian people and all other citizens of Serbia, I will never serve foreigners, those who seek to defeat, humiliate, and destroy Serbia,' he added. Opponents of the populist leader compared him to Assad who fled to Moscow following a stunning rebel advance, ending his family's half-century of iron rule. Vučić's opponents in Serbia have compared him to Assad and other world dictators, predicting that he may also try to flee the country if he loses his firm grip on power amid the protests triggered by a rail station roof collapse in the northern city of Novi Sad that killed 15 people on November 1. The protesters in Novi Sad, Belgrade and other Serbian cities have blaming the deadly collapse on rampant corruption in the country that led to sloppy renovation work on the station building in Novi Sad — part of a wider deal with Chinese state companies involved in a number of infrastructure projects in the Balkan country. The canopy collapse has became a flashpoint for broader dissatisfaction with Vučić's growingly autocratic rule, reflecting public demands for democratic changes in the country. In the video, Vučić alleged that the spreading protests, which have recently been joined by university students, are financed from the West with the intention of toppling him and his government from power 'with various hybrid tactics being employed to undermine the country.' 'If they think I'm Assad, and that I'll run away somewhere, I will not,' Vučić said. Vučić said that in the next few days and weeks, he will expose 'in full detail how much money was paid over the last four years to destroy Serbia' and make it a vassal state, 'which would not make its own decisions or choose its own future, but instead would have to listen to and serve someone else.' The Balkan nation is formally seeking European Union membership while maintaining very close ties with both Russia and China. Vučić, who claims political neutrality of Serbia, has repeatedly pledged never to join Western sanctions against Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. In a move that could further derail Serbia from its proclaimed EU ambitions, national parliament lawmakers have begun deliberating a bill that would establish a 'foreign agents' registry — a carbon copy of a restrictive law previously adopted in Russia. The bill aims to regulate organizations and individuals receiving more than 50% of their funding from foreign sources. Critics both within Serbia and internationally have warned that such a law could stigmatize civil society organizations, hinder their operations and limit freedom of expression.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbia-s-president-says-he-won-t-flee-his-country-like-syria-s-assad-did-despite-growing-protests/7898543.html	2024-12-12T00:15:01-08:00	
New data finds fewer US grandparents are taking care of grandchildren	Fewer grandparents were living with and taking care of grandchildren, there was a decline in young children going to preschool and more people stayed put in their homes in the first part of the 2020s compared to the last part of the 2010s, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released Thursday, reflecting some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest figures from the most comprehensive survey of American life compares the years of 2014-18 and 2019-23, timeframes before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the virus' spread. The American Community Survey data show how lives were changed and family relationships altered by the pandemic and other occurrences like the opioid crisis. The survey of 3.5 million households covers more than 40 topics, including ancestry, fertility, marital status, commutes, veterans status, disability and housing. The decrease in grandparents' taking care of their grandchildren is most likely the result of a decline in opioid-related deaths during the more recent timeframe since substance abuse is a leading reason that grandparents find themselves raising grandchildren. A reduction in the number of incarcerated women also likely played a role, said Susan Kelley, a professor emerita of nursing at Georgia State University. 'It's very rarely for positive reasons that grandparents find themselves in this situation. Usually, it's a tragic situation in an adult child's life, either a death, incarceration or mental health issues which correlate with substance abuse,' Kelly said. 'Many grandparents thrive in that role, but there are still socioeconomic and emotional burdens on the grandparents.' A stronger economy in the most recent period also may be a reason that the number of grandparents living with their grandchildren declined from 7.2 million to 6.8 million by making it less likely that adult children with their own children were seeking housing help from their parents, she said. The decline in the number of young children enrolled in preschool stemmed from an unwillingness to send young children to school and the closure of many schools at the height of the pandemic, according to the Census Bureau. 'These data show how the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on patterns of early childhood education,' the bureau said in a separate report. 'Future research will show if this was the start of a long-term trend or if enrollment will bounce back to prior levels.' Americans continued to get older, with the median age rising to 38.7 from 37.9 and the nation's share of senior citizens up from 16.8% from 15.2%. The share of households with a computer jumped to almost 95% from almost 89%, as did the share of households with a broadband connection to almost 90% from 80%. Additionally, fewer people moved and more people stayed put in the most recent time period compared to the earlier one, in many cases because of rising home values and the limited availability of homes to buy. Home values increased by 21.7% and the percentage of vacant homes dropped from 12.2% to 10.4%. The median home value jumped from $249,400 to $303,400 nationwide. In some vacation communities popular with the wealthy, the bump was even more dramatic, such as in the county that is home to Aspen, Colorado, where it went from $758,800 to $1.1 million, and in the county which is home to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where it jumped from $812,400 to $1.1 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-data-finds-fewer-us-grandparents-are-taking-care-of-grandchildren-/7898540.html	2024-12-12T00:02:49-08:00	
Israeli troops withdraw from southern Lebanon village under ceasefire deal	Israeli forces withdrew Wednesday from a strategic town in southern Lebanon and were replaced by Lebanese troops as part of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah. The withdrawal from Al-Khiam came two weeks after the start of the ceasefire brokered by the United States and France. 'This is an important first step in the implementation of a lasting cessation of hostilities and lays the foundation for continued progress,' Gen. Erik Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, said in a statement. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called the development 'a fundamental step towards strengthening the army's deployment in the south, in implementation of the ceasefire decision.' The ceasefire halted months of intensified fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which included Israeli ground operations inside Lebanon and airstrikes that killed multiple Hezbollah leaders. Hezbollah launched cross-border attacks against Israel in solidarity with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip following the October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel. The Pentagon said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin discussed the ceasefire during a Wednesday phone call with Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, saying it could bring lasting calm and allow people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border to return to their homes. 'The secretary emphasized the U.S. commitment to securing the release of all hostages in Gaza, including U.S. citizens, and urged the government of Israel to continue to take steps to improve the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza,' Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement. The U.N. General Assembly demanded on Wednesday an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as well as the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages still being held by Palestinian militants. 'The message that it is sending is that we are with you,' Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour said after the vote. He added that it shows that Israel and its main backer, the United States, are more isolated internationally over the war. The ceasefire resolution, which had 85 cosponsors, was adopted with 158 votes in favor and nine against, including the United States and Israel. 'The vote today is not a vote for compassion,' Israel’s ambassador, Danny Danon, said. 'It is a vote for complicity.' He said the resolution failed to directly link the release of the remaining 100 hostages held by Hamas with the ceasefire, saying that amounted to 'appeasement.' The United States blocked a similar measure with its veto at the U.N. Security Council on November 20, saying that it could not support an unconditional ceasefire that did not come with the release of hostages. It voted against the ceasefire resolution in the General Assembly on Wednesday on similar grounds, as well as a second resolution supporting UNRWA, the embattled U.N aid agency that assists Palestinian refugees. 'Colleagues, the messages we send to the world through these resolutions matter. And both of these resolutions have significant problems,' U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Robert Wood told the Assembly. 'One rewards Hamas and downplays the need to release the hostages, and the other denigrates Israel without providing a path forward to increasing humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians.' The General Assembly previously has called for a ceasefire, but its resolutions, though they carry the moral weight of the majority of the international community, are nonbinding and have been ignored. 'We cannot remain silent in the face of this abhorrent situation. We must uphold our political, humanitarian and moral obligation -- I repeat -- our moral obligation,' said Indonesia’s ambassador, Arrmanatha Nasir, in introducing the ceasefire proposal. The text also demands that Palestinian civilians across Gaza be given immediate access to aid necessary for their survival. The situation is especially dire in northern Gaza, where the U.N. says between 65,000 to 75,000 Palestinians have been largely cut off from aid deliveries for the past two months. International hunger monitors say famine is imminent there. 'This organization cannot stand idly by while thousands of innocent lives are cut short,' Mexico’s ambassador, Héctor Vasconcelos, said. Support for UNRWA In a separate vote, the 193-member assembly expressed support for UNRWA, the embattled U.N. aid agency that assists Palestinian refugees in the occupied territories and the wider Middle East. On October 28, Israel’s parliament adopted legislation to ban the agency in Israel, potentially crippling its ability to reach millions of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. The law will go into effect in January. More than 90 countries cosponsored the text, and 159 countries voted in favor of it, while nine voted against. The resolution says no other agency can replace it and called on Israel 'to abide by its international obligations, respect the privileges and immunities of the agency and uphold its responsibility to allow and facilitate full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian assistance in all its forms into and throughout the entire Gaza Strip.' The resolution also calls on Israel to pay UNRWA reparations for the dozens of schools, health centers and other facilities the agency runs that its military has bombed during the past 14 months. 'An agency we established is under threat,' said Slovenian Ambassador Samuel Žbogar, referring to the General Assembly’s creation of UNRWA in 1949. 'It is an agency acting on our behalf, on behalf of the values and principles of this organization. We need to support it.' Norway’s ambassador said her country will submit a draft resolution to the assembly requesting the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on Israel's obligations to facilitate humanitarian assistance and other kinds of aid to the Palestinian population, delivered by the U.N., NGOs and states. The two resolutions voted on Wednesday received the highest margin of support of any Gaza-related motions in the General Assembly since the war started 14 months ago. The United Nations on Wednesday appealed for just over $4 billion to address the most urgent humanitarian needs in the Palestinian territories for the next year. Hamas set off the war with its October 7, 2023, terror attack on southern Israel during which its fighters killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,800 people, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, United Kingdom and several other Western countries. U.N. correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report.

US signals conditional support for future government in Syria	WASHINGTON — Following the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, the Biden administration said it would fully support a transparent and inclusive transition process toward a nonsectarian government accountable to the Syrian people. 'The transition process and new government must also uphold clear commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance to all in need, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbors, and ensure that any chemical or biological weapons stockpiles are secured and safely destroyed,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement on Tuesday. U.S. recognition of a new government in Damascus could lead to the lifting of sanctions that have crippled the Syrian economy. It’s an incentive the Biden administration can leverage at a moment when the country’s future is deeply uncertain. 'What we want to see in terms of governance in Syria is governance that is seen as credible and legitimate, that is sustainable, that meets the aspirations of the Syrian people,' White House national security communications adviser John Kirby said in an interview Tuesday with VOA. It has to be 'the product of a Syrian-led process.' Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebels who toppled Assad, is a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist group. Its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has a $10 million bounty on his head. 'This victory, my brothers, is a new chapter in the history of the entire Islamic nation,' he said in his first speech since his fighters rapidly took control of the country. 'It is a turning point for the region,' he said, singling out Iran — a message he knows will be received well in Israel and the U.S. 'He [Assad] handed Syria over to Iranian ambitions, spreading sectarianism and corruption throughout the country.' Jolani pledged in a statement Tuesday to 'hold accountable' members of Assad’s regime who were 'involved in torturing the Syrian people.' In recent years, he has espoused sectarian tolerance and distanced himself from extremist ideology. He has sought to reassure Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities, which include Christians, Kurds, Druze and the Alawite community, a sect from which the Assad family originates. But by delivering his victory speech not from the presidential palace but from the Great Mosque of Umayyad in Damascus — built in the eighth century by a Sunni caliphate —Jolani is sending a message to the region about his majoritarian movement. His speech mirrors that of Islamic State’s first caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, at the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul in 2014, Michael Rubin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told VOA. 'On the rebels’ own Telegram channel, there were statements saying, ‘We've taken the Umayyad Mosque. Next, we're going to go for Al-Aqsa,’ which is in Jerusalem, of course. ‘Then, we're going to go for the Kaaba,’ which is in Saudi Arabia,' Rubin said. US involvement President Joe Biden has moved quickly, sending Blinken to Turkey and Jordan Wednesday to consult with leaders after ordering more than 70 airstrikes on Islamic State targets in Syria on Sunday. 'The United States will work with our partners and stakeholders in Syria to help them seize an opportunity to manage the risks,' Biden said. But on January 20, 2025, Biden will be replaced by President-elect Donald Trump, who is signaling that he wants the U.S. to stay out of the Syrian conflict. 'This is not our fight,' Trump said on social media. 'Let it play out. Do not get involved!' But the U.S. is already involved. It has about 900 troops deployed in Syria and backs a Syrian Kurdish rebel group. Washington also has close ties with all of Syria's neighbors — Iraq, Lebanon, as well as allies Israel and Jordan, and NATO ally Turkey. 'They are directly impacted by what happens in Syria, and they are also in a position to influence what happens in Syria, for better or for worse,' said Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. 'Don't disengage completely, certainly not,' he told VOA. 'But if you don't want to be overly engaged yourself, the United States of America, this is the time to work very closely with partners around the region.' Under Trump’s 'America First' doctrine, it's unclear whether the U.S. would aim its diplomatic efforts toward what Biden wants — a future Syrian government that’s inclusive and nonsectarian. Stakeholders make moves Meanwhile, aside from the U.S., Israel and Turkey have bombed Syrian targets to protect their interests. Israel has launched hundreds of strikes on military targets to further weaken what remains of the military of Tehran’s once-stalwart ally and keep weapons from falling into extremists’ hands. In northern Syria, rebel groups supported by Turkey attacked U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters, who Ankara sees as allies of a separatist movement and displacing Syrian Kurds. For now, Assad’s ally, Tehran, has lost much of its leverage. Weakened by the defeat of its proxies in Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, it may employ pragmatism in dealing with Damascus. 'The Iranian foreign minister has talked about the new Syrians as the victory of the opposition, whereas in the past, they wouldn't legitimize them as opposition. They spoke of them instead as terrorists,' Rubin said, a signal that Tehran is weighing whether it can work with the incoming government. Russia, another Assad backer who has provided asylum for the embattled leader and his family, is lobbying to keep its two military bases in Syria. On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would enter talks with incoming authorities about Russia's future military presence. Mohammed al-Bashir, Syria’s newly appointed caretaker prime minister who previously led the rebels’ civilian government, will run a transitional government until March 1, 2025, he said in remarks on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-signals-conditional-support-for-future-government-in-syria/7898437.html	2024-12-11T18:58:44-08:00	
Brazil's Lula to undergo new procedure after initial surgery for brain bleed	RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will undergo a new procedure on Thursday following up on an unplanned surgery earlier this week for a brain bleed, doctors said. The minimally invasive procedure aims to stop persistent bleeding on the surface of the brain. On Tuesday, the 79-year-old leftist leader underwent surgery for a brain bleed after suffering complications resulting from a fall at home in October. In a statement, doctors at the Sirio-Libanes hospital said Wednesday that Lula 'spent the day well,' adding that 'he underwent physiotherapy, walked and received visits from family members.' Lula remains in intensive care. In an earlier statement on Wednesday, doctors said the Brazilian president was lucid and had his bearings, and that he remained hooked up to a surgical drain as he awaited further routine tests. After the first surgery, doctors had said there would be no aftereffects and that Lula was expected to return to the capital, Brasilia, at the beginning of next week. Until then, they said, he would be unable to work. Doctors will hold a press conference at 10 a.m. local time Thursday to provide further updates, they said. Lula canceled a trip to Russia for a BRICS summit after the accident, his office said at the time. It left him with a visible cut on the back of his head, slightly above his neck. Fagnislainny Fernandes, a 40-year-old visual artist, said she went to the hospital 'out of compassion' for Lula. 'This country, unfortunately, has a lot of misinformation and so I came personally to find out if this situation is really happening,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-s-lula-to-undergo-new-procedure-after-initial-surgery-for-brain-bleed/7898444.html	2024-12-11T18:51:23-08:00

UN General Assembly demands immediate Gaza ceasefire, release of hostages	The U.N. General Assembly demanded on Wednesday an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as well as the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages still being held by Palestinian militants. 'The message that it is sending is that we are with you,' Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour said after the vote. He added that it shows that Israel and its main backer, the United States, are more isolated in the international community over the war. The ceasefire resolution, which had 85 co-sponsors, was adopted with 158 votes in favor and nine against, including the United States and Israel. 'The vote today is not a vote for compassion,' Israel’s ambassador, Danny Danon, said. 'It is a vote for complicity.' He said the resolution failed to directly link the release of the remaining 100 hostages held by Hamas with the ceasefire, saying that amounted to 'appeasement.' The United States blocked a similar measure with its veto at the U.N. Security Council on November 20, saying that it could not support an unconditional ceasefire that did not come with the release of hostages. It voted against the ceasefire resolution in the General Assembly on Wednesday on similar grounds, as well as a second resolution supporting UNRWA, the embattled U.N aid agency that assists Palestinian refugees. 'Colleagues, the messages we send to the world through these resolutions matter. And both of these resolutions have significant problems,' U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Robert Wood told the Assembly. 'One rewards Hamas and downplays the need to release the hostages, and the other denigrates Israel without providing a path forward to increasing humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians.' The General Assembly has previously called for a ceasefire, but its resolutions, though they carry the moral weight of the majority of the international community, are non-binding and have been ignored. 'We cannot remain silent in the face of this abhorrent situation. We must uphold our political, humanitarian and moral obligation -- I repeat -- our moral obligation,' said Indonesia’s ambassador, Arrmanatha Nasir, in introducing the ceasefire proposal. The text also demands that Palestinian civilians across Gaza be given immediate access to aid necessary for their survival. The situation is especially dire in northern Gaza, where the U.N. says between 65,000 to 75,000 Palestinians have been largely cut off from aid deliveries for the past two months. International hunger monitors say famine is imminent there. 'This organization cannot stand idly by while thousands of innocent lives are cut short,' Mexico’s ambassador, Héctor Vasconcelos, said. Support for UNRWA In a separate vote, the 193-member assembly expressed support for UNRWA, the embattled U.N aid agency that assists Palestinian refugees in the occupied territories and the wider Middle East. On October 28, Israel’s parliament adopted legislation to ban the agency in Israel, potentially crippling its ability to reach millions of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. The law will go into effect in January. More than 90 countries co-sponsored the text, and 159 countries voted in favor of it, while nine voted against. The resolution says no other agency can replace it and called on Israel 'to abide by its international obligations, respect the privileges and immunities of the Agency and uphold its responsibility to allow and facilitate full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian assistance in all its forms into and throughout the entire Gaza Strip.' The resolution also emphasizes the need for Israel to pay UNRWA reparations for the dozens of schools, health centers and other facilities the agency runs that its military has bombed during the past 14 months. 'An agency we established is under threat,' said Slovenian Ambassador Samuel Žbogar, referring to the General Assembly’s creation of UNRWA in 1949. 'It is an agency acting on our behalf, on behalf of the values and principles of this organization. We need to support it.' Norway’s ambassador said her country will submit a draft resolution to the Assembly requesting the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on Israel's obligations to facilitate humanitarian assistance and other kinds of aid to the Palestinian population, delivered by the U.N., NGOs and states. The two resolutions voted on Wednesday received the highest margin of support of any Gaza-related motions in the General Assembly since the war started 14 months ago. The United Nations on Wednesday appealed for just over $4 billion to address the most urgent humanitarian needs in the Palestinian territories for the next year. War grinds on Israeli forces carried out airstrikes in northern and central Gaza on Wednesday that Palestinian health officials said killed at least 26 people. At least 19 of the dead were killed in a strike that hit a house in Beit Lahiya, the officials said. Another airstrike hit a house in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza, killing at least seven people. The U.N. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said Wednesday that Israel issued another evacuation order for several parts of Deir al Balah governorate, in central Gaza. OCHA said it is the third time this year people there have been ordered to move. Hamas set off the war with its October 7, 2023, terror attack on southern Israel during which its fighters killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,700 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, United Kingdom and several other Western countries. U.N. correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report.

S. Korea's Yoon says martial law was act of governance, denies rebellion charges	SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea's president defended his martial law decree as an act of governance and denied rebellion charges in a statement Thursday, suggesting he has no intention of resigning and rejecting the impeachment attempts and investigations into last week's move. Yoon Suk Yeol's televised statement came hours before the main liberal opposition Democratic Party was to submit a new impeachment motion against Yoon. The opposition party plans to put the motion to a floor vote Saturday. Its earlier attempt to impeach Yoon fell through last Saturday, with ruling party lawmakers boycotting a vote at the National Assembly. Yoon's December 3 martial law decree has generated political chaos and protests calling for his ouster. 'I will fight to the end, to prevent the forces and criminal groups that have been responsible for paralyzing the country's government and disrupting the nation's constitutional order from threatening the future of the Republic of Korea,' Yoon said. Yoon said his martial law introduction was meant to defend the county's liberal democracy and constitutional order in the face of the liberal opposition party, which he says threatens the constitution. Yoo said his martial law decree was an act of governance that could not be the subject of investigations and did not amount to rebellion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/s-korea-s-yoon-says-martial-law-was-act-of-governance-denies-rebellion-charges/7898410.html	2024-12-11T17:40:33-08:00	
Turkey assists with evacuations of foreign nationals from Syria	Ankara/Washington — Turkey is helping several countries that want to ensure the safe departure of their citizens from Syria after rebels captured Damascus and toppled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government last week. According to Turkish diplomatic sources who spoke to VOA Turkish on the condition of anonymity, Turkey's foreign and defense ministries are coordinating the evacuations of third-country nationals from Syria with the logistical support of Turkish ground forces. Turkish diplomatic sources also emphasized that the assistance to third-country nationals who want to leave Syria is being provided discreetly to prevent security risks such as hostage-taking. Turkey was less secretive about its assistance in evacuating third-country nationals from Lebanon during the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel in October. In that operation, Turkish Foreign Ministry sources said, Ankara had helped 2,120 foreign citizens from 21 countries, including the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, to reach their destinations by air via Turkey as of October 16. In both evacuations, sources from Turkey's Ministry of National Defense told VOA Turkish, they provided necessary military vehicles and personnel support. The Turkish operation has been especially important because Damascus International Airport has been closed since Sunday, shortly after Assad fled the country. 'God willing, the airport will reopen as quickly as possible because we are going to work flat out,' airport director Anis Fallough told Agence France-Presse, without giving a precise time frame. An AFP correspondent saw armed rebel fighters deployed around the airport. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, in phone conversations with his counterparts, talked about evacuating foreign nationals through Turkey without disclosing the countries, diplomatic sources who were familiar with the talks told VOA Turkish. Pakistan, Italy Pakistan and Italy were among the countries that discussed the safety of their citizens with Turkey. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry posted on X that Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar had discussed the matter in a phone call with Fidan on December 8. In 2012, Italy cut diplomatic ties with Syria 'to reiterate the firmest condemnation of the unacceptable violence perpetrated by the Syrian regime against its citizens.' Italy resumed its diplomatic presence in Syria in July by appointing Stefano Ravagnan as an ambassador. Ravagnan began his post on November 20. In a press conference last Sunday, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani announced that Syrian rebels had entered the Italian ambassador's residence but had not harmed Ravagnan or his security staff. According to Tajani, about 300 Italian citizens are in Syria, and the embassy is ready to help them leave the country if they want. However, Tajani said that as of December 8, there were no evacuation requests other than from a group of 15 Italians who crossed into Lebanon overnight last weekend. US citizens in Syria The United States has suspended its diplomatic presence in Syria since February 2012. The Czech Republic has served as U.S. protecting power in the country since then. However, according to a State Department security alert on Tuesday, the Czech Republic is unable to assist the U.S. citizens in Syria at this time. 'We have been in contact with U.S. citizens who have enrolled in STEP or contacted us directly,' a State Department spokesperson said Wednesday in a statement to VOA Turkish, using the acronym for a traveler enrollment program that enables the State Department to contact them in case of emergency. 'Not all are seeking assistance to depart. With suspended embassy operations in Syria, it is difficult to provide an accurate number,' the statement said. The State Department spokesman also said that U.S. embassies in Syria’s neighboring countries are providing consular assistance to U.S. citizens who are able to depart. 'We are working with our partners to communicate U.S. citizen requests to cross into neighboring countries,' the statement said. UN presence Turkish diplomatic sources also said that Turkey provides logistical and security support to U.N. teams in Syria when necessary. The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it continues delivering humanitarian aid in Syria, even though the situation is 'highly volatile and uncertain, including determining which groups are in control.' 'The volatile security situation has forced the U.N. to suspend many lifesaving operations and reduce its footprint on the ground, but UNHCR and the U.N. are determined to remain here and provide services to all vulnerable Syrians in need of humanitarian support,' UNHCR Turkey spokesperson Selin Unal told VOA Turkish on Tuesday. Unal emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety of civilians, civilian infrastructure and humanitarian workers so the U.N. can continue its programs at full capacity.

Democracy tested in Eastern Europe amid accusations of Russian meddling	LONDON — This year saw a battle for influence in eastern Europe between the West and Russia as elections were held in several states that were once under Soviet rule. Moscow is widely accused of meddling in European democracy amid tensions that have run high since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Georgia In April, tens of thousands of Georgians staged demonstrations in Tbilisi against the government’s so-called 'foreign agent' law, which requires all organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from overseas to register and submit to detailed investigations. The legislation was dubbed the 'Russian law' by its opponents, after similar laws long used by President Vladimir Putin’s government to silence political opposition and free media. The protests evolved into a battle for Georgia’s future: to be aligned with the West or with Russia. It is a fight that continues to this day on the streets of Tbilisi. Georgia’s opposition parties pinned their hopes on ousting the government in the October general election; however, the ruling Georgian Dream party won with more than 53% of the vote. Election monitors accused Georgian Dream of overseeing widespread vote rigging, including 'ballot box stuffing, physical assault on observers attempting to report on violations, observer and media removal from polling stations, tearing up of observers' complaints, intimidation of voters inside and outside polling stations,' according to the head of the European Parliament monitoring delegation, Antonio Lopez-Isturiz White. Georgian Dream insisted it won a fair election. The government suspended accession talks with the European Union. The United States in turn suspended its strategic partnership with Georgia. Many Georgians fear their hopes of a future tied to the West are being lost. Protesters returned to the streets in November, demanding another vote. 'I just want us to look towards Europe and not back to the hole where we just got out,' said student Salome Bakhtadze. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze was unrepentant. 'We are absolutely committed to fully neutralizing the radical opposition,' he said at a press conference on December 6. Moldova Moldova, another former Soviet republic, held a bitterly fought presidential election in October. Despite widespread evidence of meddling by Moscow, which it denied, pro-European incumbent Maia Sandu won the November second-round vote after Moldovans voted by a thin margin to embed the desire for EU membership in the nation’s constitution. 'Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy,' she said after her victory. Romania In neighboring Romania, far-right candidate Calin Georgescu, who opposes Western aid for Ukraine, scored a shock first-round win in November’s presidential election with 23% of the vote. Polls taken ahead of the vote suggested support for Georgescu was in the single digits. Romania’s top court annulled the result after security services uncovered an alleged disinformation campaign to promote Georgescu on social media, which was widely blamed on Russia. Moscow again denied meddling in the vote. 'This candidate’s campaign was supported by a state foreign to Romania’s interests,' Romania’s incumbent president, Klaus Iohannis, said in a televised address on December 6. The country has yet to choose a new date for an election rerun. Election interference Russia is conducting a campaign of interference in European democracy — but the picture is complex, argues Costin Ciobanu, a political analyst at Aarhus University in Denmark. 'There is evidence that Russia tried to use its tools to favor Georgescu, but we don't know yet whether there was a direct coordination between the Georgescu campaign and Russia,' Ciobanu told VOA. 'Russia is exploiting vulnerabilities within our democracies. They are leveraging the way in which social networks function in today's democracies. But I would not say that all that is happening within our societies, that all the grievances and fury that we see is a result of Russia leveraging its hybrid warfare techniques.' 'I would always emphasize the local vulnerabilities, the fact that sometimes you have this kind of gap between the elite and the population. And sometimes Russia is just trying to make those gaps wider,' Ciobanu said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-democracy-tested-in-2024-amid-accusations-of-russian-meddling/7897977.html	2024-12-11T15:38:42-08:00

No Iranian drone 'mothership' off the United States, Pentagon says	WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Wednesday flatly dismissed claims by a U.S. lawmaker that Iran might be launching drones over New Jersey from a 'mothership' off the East Coast. 'There is no truth to that,' said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh. 'There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States and there's no so-called 'mothership' launching drones towards the United States.' Republican Congressman Jeff Van Drew, whose district in New Jersey includes Atlantic City, said he had uncovered what appeared to be an Iranian plot. 'What we’ve uncovered is alarming — drones flying in from the direction of the ocean, possibly linked to a missing Iranian mothership,' he said on social media platform X. The lawmaker also made the claims on Fox News. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it began receiving reports of drone activity near Morris County, New Jersey, on Nov. 18. The FAA has barred drone flights over Picatinny Arsenal Military Base and Trump National Golf Club Bedminster. Last week, the FBI and New Jersey State Police asked the public to report any information related to the recent sightings of possible drones flying in several areas along the Raritan River. 'Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed-wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks,' the FBI said. The Pentagon said an initial assessment had shown the drones were not from another country and that the U.S. military had not shot them down because they did not pose a threat to any military installations. 'We have no evidence that these activities are coming from a foreign entity or the work of an adversary,' Singh said. 'We're going to continue to monitor what is happening. But, you know, at no point were our installations threatened when this activity was occurring.' Still, the latest drone sightings are a reminder of the growing concern about a proliferation of drone technology and the potential security considerations, given that drones can carry surveillance technology or even explosives. At a press conference, House of Representatives Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries was asked about the lack of information about the drones. 'We need a greater degree of transparency from law enforcement authorities, and we will make sure that happens in the days and weeks to come,' Jeffries said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/no-iranian-drone-mothership-off-the-united-states-pentagon-says/7898051.html	2024-12-11T15:14:12-08:00	
Syrian rebel commander: Assad lieutenants will be hunted down	The main commander of the Syrian fighters who deposed strongman Bashar al-Assad said Wednesday that anyone involved in the torture and killing of people Assad detained during his iron-fisted rule would be hunted down, with pardons out of the question. 'We will pursue them in Syria, and we ask countries to hand over those who fled so we can achieve justice,' Abu Mohammed al-Jolani said in a statement published on the Syrian state TV's Telegram channel. Jolani’s vow to extract revenge against Assad’s lieutenants of torture and death came as the world is watching to see if Syria's new rulers can stabilize the country after civil war fought for nearly 14 years along sectarian and ethnic lines has left it in shambles. Mohammed al-Bashir, the man installed by Jolani's fighters to lead an interim administration through March 1, pleaded with millions of refugees to return home, create unity and provide basic services. But rebuilding is a daunting proposition with little funding on hand. 'In the coffers, there are only Syrian pounds worth little or nothing. One U.S. dollar buys 35,000 of our coins,' Bashir told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. 'We have no foreign currency, and as for loans and bonds, we are still collecting data. So yes, financially we are very bad,' said Bashir, who previously ran a small rebel-led administration in a pocket of northwestern Syria. But Bashir said the Islamist-led alliance that ousted Assad will guarantee the rights of all religious groups. 'Precisely because we are Islamic, we will guarantee the rights of all people and all sects in Syria,' Bashir said. More than 500,000 people were killed in the war, with more than half the population forced to flee their homes. About 6 million Syrians sought refuge abroad. Bashir pleaded with those who fled the violence to return home. In his interview with Corriere della Sera, he said, 'Syria is now a free country that has earned its pride and dignity. Come back.' Foreign officials are warily engaging with the former rebels, part of the former al-Qaida affiliate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which remains designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and others. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the new government must 'uphold clear commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance to all in need, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbors.' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, 'It's our duty to do everything to support different Syrian leaders in order to make sure that they come together, they are able to guarantee a smooth transition.' But the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the security situation in Syria remains volatile. The agency said it has found more than 50 minefields over the past 10 days, which is curtailing the movement of civilians and impeding the delivery of goods and services. Meanwhile, Russia, which had supported Assad’s fight against the rebels and now has granted him asylum, said Wednesday it is closely monitoring the situation in Syria and is in contact with 'those who are currently controlling the situation.' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov highlighted Russia’s need to ensure the security of its diplomatic facilities and its military bases in Syria, where Russian troops were based for years supporting the Syrian military in the country’s civil war. Assad’s fall also dealt a blow to Iran’s interests in the region, cutting off a land delivery route for weapons to the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, as well as territory in which Iranian militias could operate. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday rejected the idea of a weakened Iranian network in the region, which includes its support of Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, militias in Iraq and Houthi militants in Yemen. Khamenei also said what happened in Syria was the result of a U.S.-Israeli plan, and that a 'neighboring state' of Syria played a role in Assad’s ouster. He did not name the neighboring country, but Turkey, which borders Syria, was a main supporter of groups that opposed Assad. As Syrians work to establish the future of their country, Pope Francis said Wednesday he hoped for a political solution that promotes 'the stability and unity of the country.' 'I pray ... that the Syrian people may live in peace and security in their beloved land and the different religions may walk together in friendship and mutual respect for the good of that nation afflicted by so many years of war,' he said.

EU imposes new sanctions on Russia	European Union ambassadors have agreed to a new raft of sanctions against Russia because of its war on Ukraine, mainly targeting Russia’s massive shadow fleet of ships, the EU’s Hungarian presidency said Wednesday. The Associated Press reports the new sanctions are directed at some 50 'routinely decrepit' ships that Russia uses to avoid restrictions on transporting oil and fuel. 'I welcome the adoption of our 15th package of sanctions, targeting in particular Russia's shadow fleet,' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X. The sanctions, which are expected to be formally adopted by the EU on Monday, will add additional entities and individuals to the current list. Details about the new list of sanctions will be revealed when they are published in the EU’s legal journal. The current roster of sanctions imposed against Russia by the 27-member European bloc names more than 2,000 individuals and entities. The sanctions have included travel bans and the freezing of assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his associates, as well as several Russian lawmakers.

US judge orders CIA analyst accused of Israel-Iran leak held pending trial	ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — A CIA analyst charged with leaking top-secret details ahead of a planned Israeli attack on Iran earlier this year will remain jailed pending trial, a judge ordered Wednesday. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles overruled a magistrate who said last week that Asif Rahman, 34, of Vienna, Virginia, could be free on restrictions while he awaited trial on charges of disclosing national defense information. The fight over Rahman's detention revealed additional details about the government's investigation of the leak and the analyst who allegedly disclosed the classified documents in October on the Telegram messaging app. At Wednesday's detention hearing, prosecutor Troy Edwards said Rahman was motivated by ideology, though he did not discuss what that ideology might be. In fact, he said the conclusion that Rahman's motive was ideological was essentially the result of the process of elimination, noting that Rahman comes from a wealthy family and has access to a multimillion-dollar family trust, and therefore wouldn't have a financial incentive. Edwards also highlighted eight pages of notes found on Rahman when he was arrested last month in Cambodia, where he worked at the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh. Those notes included two separate 'to-do' lists, one of which was largely blocks of apparently encrypted text along with an unencrypted sentence pertaining to U.S. missile capabilities. Edwards said investigators have not yet been able to decipher the encryption. A separate, unencrypted to-do list included categories labeled 'contingencies' and 'run,' Edwards said. Official court documents are vague about what was leaked, but details discussed in open court made clear that the material references an October disclosure of documents from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, noting that Israel was moving military assets into place to conduct a military strike on Iran after Iran launched its own missile attack on Israel on October 1. Israel ended up carrying out an attack on Iran's air defense systems and missile manufacturing facilities in late October. In court papers, the government said the leak caused Israel to delay its attack plans. Edwards said the volatile nature of the Middle East made the leak exceptionally dangerous. 'It is hard to overstate what other circumstances present graver risks of danger to human life than unilaterally deciding' to transmit information related to plans for 'kinetic military action between two countries,' prosecutors wrote in court papers. Rahman's attorney, Amy Jeffress, cited anonymous sources in news articles who have downplayed the leak's significance. Jeffress said the to-do list included the word 'run' because Rahman is an avid jogger. She also said it's rare for defendants facing similar charges to be detained pending trial. Rahman was born in California and moved with his family when he was a child to Cincinnati, where he was a high school valedictorian, according to court papers submitted by his lawyer. He went to Yale University and graduated in three years. He and his wife now live in the D.C. metro area, along with his parents. His father, Muhit Rahman, who was prepared to serve as his son's custodian pretrial if he had been released, attended Wednesday's hearing along with numerous family members and friends in support. Rahman made his initial court appearance last month in Guam. Jeffress said after Wednesday's hearing that she intended to appeal the detention order.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-orders-cia-analyst-accused-of-israel-iran-leak-held-pending-trial-/7898068.html	2024-12-11T14:32:23-08:00	
Arizona sues Saudi firm over 'excessive' groundwater pumping, saying it's a public nuisance	PHOENIX, Arizona — Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes announced Wednesday she's suing a Saudi Arabian agribusiness for allegedly violating a public nuisance law, contending that its groundwater pumping threatens the public health, safety and infrastructure of local communities in a rural western county. The complaint filed in Maricopa County Superior Court alleges that the pumping at a Fondomonte Arizona, LLC. alfalfa farm has had widespread effects in the Ranegras Plain Basin of La Paz County, harming everyone who depends on basin water by drawing down supplies, drying up wells and causing the ground to crack and sink in some areas. The lawsuit is the latest action by Arizona against foreign companies that use huge amounts of groundwater to grow thirsty forage crops for export because of climate challenges in other countries. Rural Arizona is especially attractive to international businesses because it has no groundwater pumping regulations. The lawsuit alleges that since 2014, Fondomonte has extracted huge amounts that accelerated depletion of the basin's aquifer. The Associated Press called and emailed Fondomonte Arizona, a subsidiary of Saudi Dairy giant Almarai Co., seeking a response to the lawsuit Wednesday. Its lawyers have previously said that the company legally leased and purchased land in the U.S. and spent millions on infrastructure improvements. Years of drought have increased pressure on water users across the West, particularly in states like Arizona, which relies heavily on the dwindling Colorado River. The drought has also made groundwater — long used by farmers and rural residents without restriction — even more important for users across the state. Mayes' lawsuit alleges that Fondomonte's actions are a public nuisance under a state statute that prohibits activity that injures health, obstructs property use or interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property by a community. Mayes called the company's groundwater pumping 'unsustainable' and said it caused 'devastating consequences' for people in the area. 'Arizona law is clear: No company has the right to endanger an entire community's health and safety for its own gain,' she said. The lawsuit seeks to enjoin the company from further groundwater pumping it says is 'excessive' and require that an abatement fund be established. Arizona officials have been targeting Fondomonte for more than a year over its use of groundwater to grow forage crops, by not renewing or canceling the company's leases in Butler Valley in western Arizona. Some residents there had complained that the company's pumping was threatening their wells.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arizona-sues-saudi-firm-over-excessive-groundwater-pumping-saying-it-s-a-public-nuisance-/7898047.html	2024-12-11T14:08:13-08:00	
California's Malibu remains under threat of flames, thousands evacuated	MALIBU, CALIFORNIA — A fire continued to spread Wednesday in Malibu, a posh Californian city popular with celebrities, where thousands of people were evacuated as firefighters battled wind-fanned flames to save threatened homes. About 4,000 acres and at least seven properties, authorities said, have gone up in smoke since the Franklin Fire broke out Monday night on the hills above Pepperdine University. As of Wednesday morning, firefighters had contained the fire by 7%, firefighters said. The fire's intensity has decreased to the east and north, but the flames have strengthened to the west overnight, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said Wednesday, warning that the area is not out of danger. 'Weather conditions, including strong winds and low humidity, will be closely monitored today as they play a key role in the evolution of the fire,' he told reporters. The resulting red alert should be maintained for a good part of the day, estimates the local official. About 20,000 people were under evacuation orders or alerts Tuesday asking them to prepare to evacuate, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Among the evacuees was former movie star Dick Van Dyke, 99, best known for his role in Mary Poppins (1964): 'Arlene [his wife] and I have safely evacuated our animals, except for one cat that escaped as we were leaving. We pray that he will survive and that our community will survive these terrible fires,' he wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. More than 1,500 firefighters are battling the blaze, supported by a fleet of water-bombing aircraft. After two rainy winters that gave it a relative respite, California is experiencing a very active fire season this year. In July through August, the state suffered the fourth largest fire in its history. Scientists believe that increasingly intense heat waves and droughts are fueling forest fires and are consequences of climate change.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-s-malibu-remains-under-threat-of-flames-thousands-evacuated/7898035.html	2024-12-11T14:04:55-08:00	
Biden says healthy women help US prosperity as he highlights White House initiative	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he was 'so proud' that a women's health research initiative he launched last year at his wife's urging has already invested nearly $1 billion because a healthy female population improves U.S. prosperity. 'That's a fact,' he said in closing remarks at the first White House Conference on Women's Health Research. 'We haven't gotten that through to the other team yet,' Biden said, referencing President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration. Trump's three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court from his first term as president voted to overturn a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. Democrats campaigned on reproductive rights and women's health issues in this year's elections. Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump's transition team, said the president-elect would keep his promise to improve health in the U.S. 'President Trump campaigned on making America healthy again for ALL Americans including men, women, and children, and he will deliver on that promise,' Leavitt said in an email. Women make up half of the U.S. population, about 168 million people, but medical research into their unique health circumstances has largely been underfunded and understudied, officials have said. First lady Jill Biden has said she brought the idea for the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research to the president after Maria Shriver, herself a women's health advocate and member of the influential Kennedy political family, brought it to her. The first lady told the researchers, advocates, and business and philanthropic leaders attending the conference that she would keep pressing the issue. 'My work doesn't stop in January when Joe and I leave this house,' she said. 'I will keep building alliances, like the ones that brought us here today, and I will keep pushing for funding for innovative research.' Jill Biden said the U.S. economy loses about $1.8 billion in working time every year because of how menopause affects women. And she is interested in learning more about extreme morning sickness during pregnancy. 'I heard this a couple weeks ago and I was particularly interested because my own granddaughter was going through the same thing, because we're going to be great-grandparents,' Jill Biden said. Granddaughter Naomi Biden Neal and her husband, Peter Neal, are expecting their first child. Since its launch, the women's health research initiative has attracted nearly $1 billion in federal funding, including from the Defense Department and National Institutes of Health. 'In one year, everybody in this room kicked butt,' Shriver said at the conference. 'Not until the Bidens did anyone ever think to make women's health and research a priority for the federal government, so let that sink in.' President Biden closed the conference with a nod to the influence of his wife, who, after her remarks, sat in the front row beside their daughter, Ashley Biden, who runs a women's shelter in Philadelphia. 'You stepped up, kid,' Biden told the first lady. Then he told the audience, 'In case you wonder, when she speaks, I listen.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-says-healthy-women-help-us-prosperity-as-he-highlights-white-house-initiative/7898040.html	2024-12-11T13:55:49-08:00

Azerbaijani rights defender receives US human rights award in absentia	Rufat Safarov, a prominent human rights defender from Azerbaijan, was one of the recipients of the U.S. secretary of state’s 2024 Human Rights Defender Award. He did not attend Tuesday's ceremony in Washington, because he'd been arrested December 3, hours after visiting the U.S. Embassy in Baku to receive his visa to travel to the United States. During the ceremony, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, pointing to the empty chair reserved for Safarov, called for his immediate release. 'Now, one chair, as you will have noted, is empty on this stage. ... It belongs to Rufat Safarov, the Azerbaijani human rights defender that I spoke of just a few moments ago,' he said. 'The government of Azerbaijan should release Rufat — and release him immediately — as well as all the other journalists, human rights defenders, political opponents and others that are unjustly detained.' At the end of the ceremony, Blinken presented awards to human rights defenders from Bolivia, Colombia, Eswatini, Ghana, Kuwait, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan, and he posed for a photo with them. Later, Blinken approached the empty seat reserved for Safarov and took a commemorative photo with his award. Blinken issued another statement Wednesday calling on the Azerbaijani government to release Safarov, as well as others unjustly detained for their work in the field of human rights. 'The United States is deeply concerned not only by these detentions, but by the increasing crackdown on civil society and media in Azerbaijan,' the statement read. Safarov, a former prosecutor who heads the Defense Line human rights organization, issued a statement expressing his gratitude for the award. 'Unfortunately, Baku arrested me in order to prevent me from personally receiving that award and to punish me for my human rights advocacy,' he said in the statement sent to VOA from prison. Safarov said he was proud of his work defending universal values as a human rights activist 'despite all the slander and pressure' from the government. 'In fact, I have accepted my arrest as a reward from the government for human rights advocacy. Human rights are not an internal affair of any country. İt is a universal concept. 'Without human rights, not only the state, but even the society cannot exist. I call on everyone to stand in solidarity in the defense of human rights,' the statement read. Last week, Safarov was charged with fraud and hooliganism and put on four months of pretrial detention. Azerbaijan's Ministry of Internal Affairs told VOA that Safarov's detention was related to a conflict between him and an individual over a land purchase, an allegation he denied. Safarov was previously sentenced to jail for bribery in 2016 and served three years before being pardoned by President Ilham Aliyev. His arrest coincides with a new crackdown in Azerbaijan following a recent climate change conference held November 11-22 in Baku. The arrests prompted Western concerns about the state of human rights in the country. In his statement Wednesday, Blinken called on Azerbaijani authorities to end the crackdown on civil society and the media. 'We urge the government of Azerbaijan to release those unjustly detained for their advocacy on behalf of human rights, cease its crackdown on civil society, respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all, and fulfill the commitments it made when it joined the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,' Blinken said.

Arrest warrant for Guatemalan journalist viewed as retaliatory	WASHINGTON — A court in Guatemala City has issued an arrest warrant in absentia for a prominent investigative journalist known for his reporting on governmental and judicial corruption in the country. Juan Luis Font, director and host of the daily radio talk show 'ConCriterio' and a co-founder of El Periodico newspaper in Guatemala, is accused of collusion and bribery, charges he denies. The journalist, who lives in exile in France, told VOA he expected that a warrant would be issued because of his stories on corruption. 'They speak about me laundering money. They speak about me being bribed. And they have not been able to build up any of these cases. Instead, they have proceeded with these accusations against me,' he said. Watchdogs say the Justice Department in Guatemala often uses the threat of legal action to silence critical voices. The press freedom environment in the country is 'dire,' according to the free expression group Fundamedios, which said journalists have difficulty bringing corruption cases to light because they are frequently prosecuted. The Guatemala Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to VOA’s request for comment. Font said he has been vocal about allegations of corruption in the judiciary. 'I am not a person who is going to be well-seen by the people in power,' he said. Guatemala experienced years of corruption before electing current President Bernardo Arevalo, who ran on an anti-corruption platform in 2023. There are 'serious problems' with the independence of the Guatemalan judiciary, according to a 2023 State Department country report. The report found inefficiency, corruption and 'manipulation of justice' within the justice system, and many who are arrested are denied fair, public trials. Judicial harassment of journalists has also been on the rise, according to the watchdog group Reporters Without Borders. 'The Justice Department is still in the hands of people who really want to silence all the critical voices, all the people who do investigations, and the people who bring to light what's happening in Guatemala,' Dagmar Thiel, U.S. CEO of Fundamedios, told VOA. 'And Juan Luis is one of the strongest critical voices in Guatemala.' Font is one of the most well-known journalists in Guatemala, according to Thiel. He co-founded El Periodico with Jose Ruben Zamora, who spent more than two years in prison in what watchdogs say was retaliatory action. Zamora is currently under house arrest after an appeals court overturned a conviction on money laundering charges in October. Zamora’s son, Jose Carlos, told VOA that Guatemalan Attorney General Consuelo Porras and special prosecutor Rafael Curruchiche have led an 'assault' on press freedom. 'This group fabricates cases and issues unlawful rulings to silence journalists exposing corruption,' Jose Carlos wrote to VOA. The case against Font has been condemned by international groups. The National Press Club in Washington demanded an end to the harassment that Font and other Guatemalan journalists experience. Cases like these highlight the 'animosity Guatemala's judicial authorities have for independent and critical journalism,' club president Emily Wilkins said in a statement Tuesday. 'Journalism is not a crime, and Font is not a criminal.' Font told VOA that one of the accusations against him is 'bribing' an anti-corruption judge named Erika Aifan, who fled Guatemala in 2022. The alleged bribe, he said, is a 'Person of the Year' award that Font presented to her on 'ConCriterio.' 'It’s absolutely nuts,' Font said. 'They said I granted her a payment in the form of an honor two years before I knew I would even need her help.' Font is one of around 20 Guatemalan journalists now in exile who fled Guatemala to avoid legal retaliation, Thiel of Fundamedios said. In France, Font is still running his radio show. 'I did the right thing by leaving my country two years ago, and I have been well,' he said. 'I’m sleeping peacefully, because I'm sure that they're not going to be able to put me in jail the next morning.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/arrest-warrant-for-guatemalan-journalist-viewed-as-retaliatory/7897897.html	2024-12-11T12:42:37-08:00	
Gun found on suspect in killing of US insurance CEO matches shell casings at scene, police say	ALTOONA, PENNSYLVANIA — The gun found on the suspect in the killing of United Healthcare's CEO matched shell casings found at the site of the shooting, New York City's police commissioner said Wednesday. Suspect Luigi Mangione's fingerprints also matched a water bottle and a protein bar wrapper that police found near the scene and say the gunman purchased at a nearby coffee shop while awaiting his target, Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at an unrelated news conference. Mangione, 26, was charged with murder in the shooting last week in midtown Manhattan of Brian Thompson, who led the United States' largest medical insurance company. Authorities have said that writings found in Mangione's possession hinted at a hatred of corporate greed. They've recovered a spiral notebook that Mangione kept, along with a three-page handwritten letter found when he was arrested, a law enforcement official said Wednesday. Police have not disclosed what was in the notebook. The letter, found when Mangione was arrested Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, teased the possibility that clues to the attack — 'some straggling notes and To Do lists that illuminate the gist of it' — could be found in the notebook, the law enforcement official said. The official wasn't authorized to disclose information about the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Kenny told CBS New York that the motive might have been related to an accident that sent Mangione to an emergency room on July 4, 2023. A law enforcement bulletin obtained by the AP earlier this week said the letter expressed anger with what Mangione called 'parasitic' health insurance companies and a disdain for corporate greed and power. The prep school and Ivy League graduate wrote that the U.S. has the most expensive health care system in the world and that profits of major corporations continue to rise while life expectancy doesn't, according to the bulletin. In his first public words since his arrest, Mangione emerged from a patrol car Tuesday shouting about an 'insult to the intelligence of the American people' while deputies pushed him into a courthouse. Mangione remained jailed without bail in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged with gun and forgery offenses. Manhattan prosecutors were working to bring Mangione to New York. At a brief hearing Tuesday in Pennsylvania, defense lawyer Thomas Dickey said Mangione will not waive extradition and instead wants a hearing on the issue. 'You can't rush to judgment in this case or any case,' Dickey said afterward. 'He's presumed innocent. Let's not forget that.' Mangione was arrested in Altoona, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City, after a McDonald's customer recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said. New York police officials have said Mangione was carrying a gun like the one used to kill Thompson and the same fake ID the suspected shooter had used to check into a New York hostel, along with a passport and other fraudulent IDs. Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4 as he walked alone to a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. From surveillance video, New York investigators determined the shooter quickly fled the city, likely by bus. His movements afterward are unclear, but authorities believe he took steps to stay off the radar. Prosecutors said at his Pennsylvania hearing Tuesday that when arrested, he had bags for his cellphone and laptop that prevent such devices from transmitting signals that authorities can use to track them. Mangione, a grandson of a well-known Maryland real estate developer and philanthropist, had a graduate degree in computer science and worked for a time at a car-buying website. During the first half of 2022, he bunked at a 'co-living' space in Hawaii, where those who knew him said he suffered from severe and sometimes debilitating back pain. His relatives have said in a statement that they are was 'shocked and devastated' at his arrest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gun-found-on-suspect-in-killing-of-us-insurance-ceo-matches-shell-casings-at-scene-police-say-/7897916.html	2024-12-11T12:39:51-08:00

Wisconsin kayaker who faked his death and fled to Eastern Europe has willingly returned to US	GREEN LAKE, WISCONSIN — A Wisconsin man who faked his own drowning and left his wife and three children and was believed to have been in Eastern Europe willingly returned to the U.S. after roughly four months and is in custody, a sheriff said Wednesday. Ryan Borgwardt 'came back on his own' because of his family, Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll said during a brief news conference. 'We can stand here feeling relieved,' Podoll said. Borgwardt, 45, landed Tuesday and was being held at the county jail pending an afternoon court appearance. The sheriff said his office has recommended a number of charges, including obstruction. A message seeking information on potential charges was not immediately returned by the county prosecutor. Last month, Podoll said Borgwardt began communicating with authorities on Nov. 11 after disappearing for three months but hadn't committed to returning to Wisconsin. Podoll said police were 'pulling at his heartstrings' to come home. Podoll declined to say specifically where Borgwardt has been since he disappeared and deflected a question about any conversations that may have persuaded him to return. 'That's going to be up to him someday. We're not going to release that. ... We brought a dad back on his own,' Podoll said. Podoll declined to discuss the details of Borgwardt's return trip, other than to say 'he got on an airplane and landed in the U.S.' and turned himself in at the Green Lake County Justice Center on Tuesday. Borgwardt told authorities last month that he faked his death because of 'personal matters,' the sheriff said in November. He told them that in mid-August he traveled about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from his home in Watertown to Green Lake, where he overturned his kayak, dumped his phone and then paddled an inflatable boat to shore. He said he picked that lake because it's the deepest in Wisconsin. After leaving the lake, he rode an electric bike about 70 miles (110 kilometers) through the night to Madison. From there, he said he took a bus to Detroit, then boarded a bus to Canada and got on a plane. An analysis of a laptop — it was not clear whose — revealed a digital trail that shows Borgwardt had planned to head to Europe and tried to mislead investigators. The laptop's hard drive had been replaced and the browsers had been cleared on the day Borgwardt disappeared, Podoll said in a news release in November. Investigators found passport photos, inquiries about moving funds to foreign banks and communication with a woman from Uzbekistan. They also discovered that Borgwardt also took out a $375,000 life insurance policy in January. Law enforcement personnel made contact with Borgwardt on Nov. 11. He sent them a video of himself wearing an orange T-shirt and not smiling. He said in the video that he was in his apartment and briefly panned the camera but mostly showed just a door and bare walls. He did not say where he was. The sheriff's office has said the search for Borgwardt's body, which lasted more than a month, cost at least $35,000. The sheriff said that Borgwardt told authorities that he didn't expect the search to last more than two weeks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wisconsin-kayaker-who-faked-his-death-and-fled-to-eastern-europe-has-willingly-returned-to-us-/7897861.html	2024-12-11T12:30:39-08:00	
US: Russia could target Ukraine again with new missile	A U.S. intelligence assessment has concluded that Russia could launch another of its experimental hypersonic ballistic missiles against Ukraine in the coming days, although Washington does not consider it to be decisive in the nearly three-year war, a U.S. official said Wednesday. Russia first fired the Oreshnik missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Nov. 21, in what President Vladimir Putin characterized as a response to Ukraine's first use of long-range U.S. and British missiles to strike deeper into Russian territory with Western permission. 'We assess that the Oreshnik is not a game-changer on the battlefield, but rather just another attempt by Russia to terrorize Ukraine, which will fail,' the U.S. official told reporters. There was no immediate response from Russia. Putin has previously said Russia may fire the Oreshnik missile again, possibly to target 'decision-making centers' in Kyiv, if Ukraine keeps attacking Russia with long-range Western weapons. Russia's defense ministry said that Ukraine had attacked a military airfield in the southern Russian city of Taganrog on Wednesday morning with six of the U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles and promised retaliation. It said all six had been intercepted, but that falling missile debris had caused some injuries. The Russian leader has claimed that the Oreshnik is impossible to intercept and that it has destructive power comparable to that of a nuclear weapon, even when fitted with a conventional warhead. Some Western experts have said the novel feature of the Oreshnik is that it carries multiple warheads capable of simultaneously striking different targets — something usually associated with longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles. A surveillance camera video of the strike three weeks ago showed huge fireballs piercing the darkness and slamming into the ground at astonishing speed. Within hours of Ukraine’s attack on the Russian military facility, Putin took the rare step of speaking on national TV to boast about the new, hypersonic missile. He warned the West that its next use could be against Ukraine's NATO allies, which allowed Kyiv to use their longer-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Nonetheless, the U.S. official downplayed the usefulness of the missiles, calling them 'experimental' in nature and said that 'Russia likely possesses only a handful' of them. The official also said the weapon has a smaller warhead than other missiles Russia has deployed in Ukraine. The United States says it is sending more air defense systems to Ukraine even as Russia gains territory in eastern Ukraine six weeks ahead of Donald Trump becoming the U.S. president again. Trump has been a skeptic of continuing U.S. support for Ukraine. Trump has said he will end the war before he takes office but has not said how. He has pointedly refused to say he wants Ukraine to win the war, leaving Washington's long-term military support for Ukraine in question. Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris over the weekend. Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Tuesday that a rescue operation was 'currently under way' in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, following a Russian missile strike that killed three people and injured 18 others. Zelenskyy added that Ukraine does not have enough air defense systems to protect it from Russian missiles. 'But our partners do have these systems. We repeat, again and again, that air defense systems should save lives, not collect dust in storage bases,' he said. Separately, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Tuesday that Ukraine-Russia peace talks could begin 'in the winter,' a timeline that coincides with Poland taking over the rotating presidency of the European Union on January 1. Tusk offered few details about where, when or even who would be involved in the negotiations, but he told his Cabinet he hoped the 'end effect' of the EU's negotiations would result in peace for Ukraine. Tusk, however, indicated that Poland, which has been a staunch supporter of neighboring Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country in February 2022, will be a major participant in the talks. 'I really want Poland to be the country that will not only be present but will set the tone for these decisions that are to bring us security and secure Polish interests,' the prime minister said. Separately, France’s Macron is expected to meet with Tusk Thursday in Warsaw to discuss Ukraine.

FBI Director Wray says he plans to resign at end of Biden's term in January	Washington — FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday he intends to resign at the end of President Joe Biden's term in January, an announcement that came a week and a half after President-elect Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate loyalist Kash Patel for the job. At a town hall meeting with the bureau workforce, Wray said he would be stepping down 'after weeks of careful thought.' Wray's intended resignation is not unexpected considering that Trump had picked Patel for the role in his new administration. Wray had previously been named by Trump and began the 10-year term — a length meant to insulate the agency from the political influence of changing administrations — in 2017, after Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey. Trump had telegraphed his anger with Wray on multiple occasions, including after Wray's congressional testimony in September. But the soft-spoken director rarely seemed to go out of his way to publicly confront the White House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-director-wray-says-he-plans-to-resign-at-end-of-biden-s-term-in-january/7897887.html	2024-12-11T11:41:05-08:00	
US security officials meet with lawmakers about mysterious drone flights	U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials in New Jersey huddled with state and local lawmakers Wednesday to discuss the recent spate of drone sightings throughout the state. Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights started last month and have raised growing concern among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster. Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must be FAA certified. Most, but not all, of the drones spotted in New Jersey were larger than those typically used by hobbyists. The number of sightings has increased in recent days, although officials say many of the objects seen may have been planes rather than drones. It's also possible that a single drone has been reported more than once. Governor Phil Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don't appear to threaten public safety. The FBI has been investigating and has asked residents to share any videos, photos or other information they may have. Many municipal lawmakers have called for more restrictions on who is entitled to fly the unmanned devices. At least one state lawmaker proposed a temporary ban on drone flights in the state. 'This is something we're taking deadly seriously. I don't blame people for being frustrated,' Murphy said earlier this week. Details about Wednesday's meeting were not immediately disclosed. A spokesperson for the Democratic governor said he was not attending. Republican Assemblyman Erik Peterson, whose district includes parts of the state where the drones have been reported, said he and other legislators met with Homeland Security and state police officials for about 90 minutes at a state police facility in West Trenton. Peterson said DHS officials were generous with their time but appeared dismissive of some concerns, saying not all the sightings reported have been confirmed to involve drones. Who or what is behind the flying objects? Where are they coming from? What are they doing? 'My understanding is they have no clue,' Peterson said. A message seeking comment on Peterson's remarks was left with the Department of Homeland Security. Most of the drones have been spotted along coastal areas and some were recently reported flying over a large reservoir in Clinton. Sightings also have been reported in neighboring states, including the New York City area, and over Pennsylvania's Delaware County and Philadelphia. James Edwards of Succasunna, New Jersey, said he has seen a few drones flying over his neighborhood since last month. 'It raises concern mainly because there's so much that's unknown,' Edwards said Wednesday. 'There are lots of people spouting off about various conspiracies that they believe are in play here, but that only adds fuel to the fire unnecessarily. We need to wait and see what is really happening here, not let fear of the unknown overtake us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-security-officials-meet-with-lawmakers-about-mysterious-drone-flights/7897847.html	2024-12-11T11:37:51-08:00	
Zimbabwe aims to end HIV/AIDS as public health threat by 2030	MARONDERA, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwean health officials said Tuesday they aim to eliminate HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, crediting the United States with making such progress possible through aid and support. U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe Pamela Tremont and officials from PEPFAR and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention toured the HIV services area at Marondera Hospital, located some 70 kilometers east of Harare, the Zimbabwe capital, where HIV/AIDS once sickened thousands. Speaking to journalists afterward, Dr. Delight Madoro, a district medical officer in Mashonaland East province, said PEPFAR — or the U.S. Presidential Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — enabled Zimbabwe to combat the epidemic with strategies such as blood-based self-testing and PrEP, which stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. 'And after maybe you test positive, there are staff and support ... at the facilities to help link you to other HIV services,' Madoro said. 'There is a lot that is happening on the ground in terms of [the] fight against HIV through the support that we are getting from PEPFAR,' he continued. 'And in terms of human resources, we’re getting more staff. This means our clients are going to have more time with clinicians, so that we become thorough, and we get thorough with our treatment. 'So, in a nutshell, I can say the support that we have been getting from PEPFAR is of paramount importance,' he said. Tremont said the U.S. was committed to help fight the HIV epidemic in Zimbabwe. 'We’ve made huge progress since 2006,' she said. 'The number of deaths from HIV has fallen 80%, and that is something I think we should all be very proud of.' Tremont mentioned that the U.S. provided antiretroviral treatments and many health care workers at clinics and hospitals around Zimbabwe. 'It’s great to see all that in action today and to see the dedication and stubbornness of the health care workers reaching down to those HIV patients who are scared and reluctant to undertake treatment,' she said. 'Thank you to the health care workers. You are our heroes in all this.' Haddi Cham, the Centers for Disease Control’s Zimbabwe HIV services branch chief, said the PEPFAR program made the HIV facility at Marondera Hospital possible. 'We have been supporting this facility for many, many years now, and we are really grateful for the collaboration with all the key stakeholders. Through that strong collaboration, we are able to realize these results,' Cham said. Zimbabwe is one of the countries hit hardest by HIV/AIDS, especially before 1999, when authorities introduced an AIDS levy — a 3% tax on income and business profits that is used by the National AIDS Council for programs to combat the spread of the pandemic. Data indicate the prevalence of HIV among adults ages 15 to 49 in Zimbabwe declined from 12.7% in 2019 to 10.5% in 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-aims-to-end-hiv-aids-as-public-health-threat-by-2030/7897816.html	2024-12-11T11:26:52-08:00	
In photos: Syrians desperately search for missing relatives in notorious prison	Using only the light on their mobile phones, wailing men and women examined disfigured bodies lying in a darkened hospital morgue in Syria's capital for signs of their relatives who had disappeared into Bashar al-Assad's notorious prison system, Reuters reported. Dozens of corpses - blackened, decomposing and missing limbs or heads - were found overnight by rescuers digging for hidden cells at Sednaya, a prison north of Damascus, where rights groups said torture and mass executions had been common, Reuters said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-photos-syrians-desperately-search-for-missing-relatives-in-notorious-prison/7897757.html	2024-12-11T11:15:09-08:00	
2024: Ukraine-Russia war deadlock sets stage for possible negotiations	In 2024, Russia’s war in Ukraine reached a near-standstill, with Russia pressing forward while Ukraine’s counterattacks faltered. Both sides, well matched in advanced military tech, struggled to make headway, shifting attention toward possible peace talks. Ukraine launched strikes into Russian territory to boost its bargaining power, and despite a possible weakening of U.S. support under the incoming Trump administration, hopes remain that renewed diplomacy could pave the way to peace.

Wife of journalist killed in Cambodia says she feared for his safety	The wife of Chhoeung Chheng, an environmental journalist killed in Cambodia, says she had warned him against investigating illegal logging at night. Chhoeung had been working to uncover deforestation in Siem Reap province when he was shot on December 4. The 63-year-old journalist died from his injuries at a hospital on December 7. His wife, Cheav Chab, 53, told VOA’s Khmer service that Chhoeung had been dedicated to journalism, with a career spanning over a decade. But she worried about his work for the news website Kampuchea Aphiwat on illegal activity in their region. 'I warned him not to investigate forests at night, as those involved in deforestation don't take kindly to us,' she said. She is now seeking justice for her husband's killing, telling VOA, 'I don't want his death to be in vain.' Moeun Ny, a journalist and friend of Chhoeung, told VOA that the pair worked together to expose deforestation. 'We aimed to prevent further forest loss,' said Moeun. 'We always reported logging activities to the authorities.' Moeun believes their reporting made them a target for those involved in deforestation. The Ministry of Information said a suspected gunman has been arrested and is under investigation. The ministry spokesperson, Tep Asnarith, said the ministry is taking the incident seriously and reiterated the government's commitment to protecting press freedom as enshrined in the Cambodian Constitution. Nop Vy, the executive director of the media association CamboJA, said the case underscores the threats to journalists in Cambodia, particularly those covering environmental issues. He called for a thorough investigation into Chheung's case, and incidents involving other media workers. Nop added that punishing those responsible is crucial to ending harassment of journalists. Authorities looking into attacks on media should 'speed up the investigations effectively and transparently to conclude the investigations and bring perpetrators to prosecute,' he told VOA. The media watchdog Reporters Without Borders in a statement also emphasized the need to secure justice in such cases. 'This murder is appalling and demands a strong response,' the watchdog said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wife-of-journalist-killed-in-cambodia-says-she-feared-for-his-safety/7897716.html	2024-12-11T10:44:53-08:00	
Israel urges action to protect Syria’s Kurds	WASHINGTON — Israeli government officials have intensified calls to protect Syria’s Kurds as they face armed groups backed by Turkey following the sudden collapse of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. An 11-day rebel offensive, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, resulted in the capture of the capital, Damascus, and other strategic cities in northwest and central Syria. Now, an operation led by Turkish-backed factions is aimed at dislodging Kurdish forces from parts of Aleppo province, including the town of Manbij. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, have been a major U.S. partner in the fight against the Islamic State terror group. The partnership led to the liberation of most territory once controlled by Islamic State in Syria. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said Monday that Turkish-backed attacks on Syria’s Kurds must be stopped. 'It’s a commitment of the international community towards those who fought bravely against ISIS,' Sa’ar said during a press briefing in Jerusalem. 'It’s also a commitment for the future of Syria, because the Kurds are a stabilizing force in this country.' The top Israeli diplomat said they were discussing this issue with the United States and other countries. Since the ouster of the Assad regime, the Israeli military said it has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria, targeting weapons stockpiles across the country. Israeli officials said the airstrikes were aimed at preventing strategic weapons from falling into the wrong hands amid the ongoing chaos. Israel has also deployed ground troops beyond a demilitarized buffer zone between the two countries. Israeli officials described these measures as temporary, pending a resolution of the political situation in Syria. The Turkish government, a main backer of the Syrian rebels, views the SDF as an extension of the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union. Washington, however, makes a clear distinction between the two Kurdish groups. Salih Muslim, a senior Kurdish politician with the Democratic Union Party, the de facto ruling party in northeast Syria, welcomed the recent statements by Israeli officials expressing support for the Kurds, describing the position as a positive and encouraging step. 'Undoubtedly, any force that defends our rights is welcomed,' he said in an interview posted Tuesday on X by a London-based journalist. 'Israel’s stance is correct; they have seen our actions and understand that we have never denied the existence of the Jewish people in the Middle East. It is encouraging to see those who recognize our pain and suffering. ... Beyond verbal support, we await practical measures,' Muslim said. Michael Rubin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said these mutual statements are welcome and build confidence. 'But when the Kurds are under fire by the Turkish army and their militias, no one has time for the courtship,' he told VOA. 'The two sides need a shotgun wedding, or else it will simply be too late. Kurds need Israeli weapons, not words.' The group battling SDF fighters in northern Syria is the Syrian National Army, or SNA, which is not the official Syrian armed forces but rather an umbrella organization for Turkish-backed militias. The SNA previously participated in offensives against Kurdish forces in 2018 and 2019. While the fighting in Manbij appears to have paused following a U.S.-brokered ceasefire early Wednesday, attacks continue elsewhere in the region, said Mazloum Abdi, the top SDF commander. The ceasefire in Manbij is intended to allow SDF fighters to withdraw from the city, which has been captured by the SNA, Abdi said in a statement. Militias backed by Turkey appear intent in their efforts to drive Kurds from their homes, said Seth Frantzman, a Jerusalem-based adjunct fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 'Israel has influence with the U.S. and should use it to make sure Ankara stops its attacks,' he told VOA. Israel and Syria don’t have diplomatic ties. Under Syrian law, any interaction with Israel by a Syrian citizen or group is considered high treason. Additionally, the topic of Israel remains a taboo in Syrian society. However, Kurds in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East generally hold a more positive view of Israel. Experts warn that recent Israeli statements could potentially harm the Kurds if not backed by concrete actions. 'Arabs and Muslims in Syria and elsewhere in the region already view the Kurds with suspicion on this issue. The popular and official narrative in many societies across the region portrays the Kurds as a ‘second Israel,’' John Saleh, an analyst of Kurdish affairs, told VOA. 'So, if Israel has a plan to support the Kurds, it should execute right away,' Saleh said. 'Otherwise, the consequences for the Kurds of this perceived association with Israel could be severe under the new Islamist regime in Damascus.' Saleh added that Turkey could also use this as a pretext to further mobilize Islamist militias against Kurdish civilians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-urges-action-to-protect-syria-s-kurds-/7897681.html	2024-12-11T09:58:05-08:00	
Botswana’s president promises to restore Bushmen rights after yearslong delay in burial	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Botswana’s new president has promised to restore some rights, which were taken away from the Bushmen, an indigenous tribe of hunters and gatherers found across southern Africa. This week, the government allowed the tribe to bury Pitseng Gaoberekwe who died in December 2021 on the group’s ancestral land, ending a drawn-out impasse. The courts had barred the family from burying Gaoberekwe in his ancestral home in the vast and arid Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR), from which most of his relatives were forcibly removed to protect the wildlife zone. International tribal rights advocacy group Survival International has argued the Bushmen were pushed out of the game reserve because there are diamonds in the area. The previous government denied those allegations, saying it wanted the Bushmen to move closer to modern amenities and life. Before Gaoberekwe’s burial Tuesday, President Duma Boko, who took power six weeks ago, promised to restore the Bushmen’s rights, including allowing them to resume hunting wild animals. Boko, a former opposition leader, is a human rights lawyer who represented the tribe in court against the state before he became Botswana’s president. Itumeleng Johanne, an officer at local human rights advocacy group Ditshwanelo, said the new government is on the right track and should do more to protect minority groups. 'We, therefore, note with appreciation that finally the body of Mr. Pitseng Gaoberekwe, which has been in a mortuary for over two years, will be laid to rest. His family will be able to lay him to rest on his ancestral land with dignity to which he had, hitherto been denied by our courts,' Johanne said. Survival International has been involved in legal battles against the Botswana government, notably against the group’s eviction from the CKGR in 2006. 'This is an incredibly significant moment for the new government,' said U.K.-based Jonathan Mazower, Survival International communications director. 'The fact that the new president in one of his first acts in office has done this — that he has signaled that it is important for him and his administration — I think that will give a lot of people hope, especially the Bushmen who fought so long for their right to return to the Central Kalahari Game Reserve and especially for their rights to bury their elders on their ancestral land.' Mazower said better days could lie ahead for the tribe under Boko’s administration. 'No one would have ever imagined that the President of Botswana will be the very lawyer who helped them (Bushmen) in court in the long legal battle to return to their ancestral land and to live there once more,' Mazower said. 'For many of them and for some of us who supported them from the outside, it is a historic event and one that signals, hopefully, better days ahead.' There are more than 100,000 Bushmen spread across southern Africa, but most live under pressure from area governments to abandon their traditional lives of hunting wild animals and gathering wild plants and roots.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-s-president-promises-to-restore-bushmen-rights-after-yearslong-delay-in-burial/7897607.html	2024-12-11T08:58:51-08:00	
Blinken faces critics in Congress who say Afghanistan withdrawal 'lit the world on fire'	washington — Secretary of State Antony Blinken appeared Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to face questions for the last time about some of the darkest moments of Joe Biden's presidency: the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The hearing comes at the twilight of Blinken's diplomatic career, with only weeks left before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, and at the end of the chairmanship of Representative Michael McCaul, who will no longer lead the committee in the next Congress. It's the capstone to nearly four years of animosity between the two men over the end of America's longest war. 'This catastrophic event was the beginning of a failed foreign policy that lit the world on fire,' McCaul, a Texas Republican, said in his opening statement. 'I welcome your testimony today and hope you use this opportunity to take accountability for the disastrous withdrawal.' Blinken was expected to defend the decision to withdraw U.S. troops in August 2021. He said previously that the Biden administration was 'severely constrained' by Trump's decisions and those of previous presidents. His long-awaited testimony comes months after House Republicans issued a scathing report on their investigation into the withdrawal, blaming the disastrous end on Biden's administration. They downplayed Trump's role in the failures even though he had signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban. The Republican-led review laid out the final months of military and civilian failures, following Trump's February 2020 withdrawal deal, that allowed America's fundamentalist Taliban enemy to sweep through and conquer all of the country even before the last U.S. officials flew out on Aug. 30, 2021. The chaotic exit left behind many American citizens, Afghan battlefield allies, women activists and others at risk from the Taliban. Previous investigations and analyses have pointed to a systemic failure spanning the last four presidential administrations and concluded that Biden and Trump share the heaviest blame.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-faces-critics-in-congress-who-say-afghanistan-withdrawal-lit-the-world-on-fire-/7897591.html	2024-12-11T08:42:00-08:00	
FIFA names Saudi Arabia as 2034 World Cup host	ZURICH — FIFA has confirmed Saudi Arabia as host of the 2034 World Cup in men's soccer. The Saudi bid was the only candidate and was acclaimed by the applause of more than 200 FIFA member federations. They took part remotely in an online meeting hosted in Zurich on Wednesday by the soccer body's president, Gianni Infantino. The decision was combined with approving the only candidate to host the 2030 World Cup. Spain, Portugal and Morocco will co-host in a six-nation project, with Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay each getting one of the 104 games. The South American connection will mark the centenary of Uruguay hosting the first World Cup in 1930. The decision announced Wednesday completes a mostly opaque 15-month bid process that FIFA president Gianni Infantino helped steer toward Saudi Arabia without a rival candidate, without taking questions, and which human rights groups warn will put the lives of migrant workers at risk. FIFA and Saudi officials say hosting the 2034 tournament can accelerate change, including more freedoms and rights for women. It will kick off a decade of scrutiny on Saudi labor laws and treatment of workers mostly from South Asia needed to help build and upgrade 15 stadiums, plus hotels and transport networks ahead of the 104-game tournament. One of the stadiums is planned to be 350 meters above the ground in Neom — a futuristic city that does not yet exist — and another named for the crown prince is designed to be atop a 200-meter cliff near Riyadh. During the bid campaign, FIFA has accepted limited scrutiny of Saudi Arabia's human rights record, which was widely criticized this year at the United Nations. The kingdom plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on projects related to the World Cup as part of the crown prince's sweeping Vision 2030 project, which aims to modernize Saudi society and economy. At its core is spending on sports by the $900 billion sovereign wealth operation, the Public Investment Fund, which he oversees. Critics have called it 'sportswashing' of the kingdom's reputation. The prince, known as MBS, has built close working ties to Infantino since 2017 — aligning with the organizer of sport's most-watched event rather than directly confronting the established system as it did with the disruptive LIV Golf project. The result for Saudi Arabia and FIFA has been smooth progress toward the win Wednesday with limited pushback from soccer officials, although some from women international players. The steady flow of Saudi cash into international soccer is set to increase. FIFA created a new and higher World Cup sponsor category for state oil firm Aramco, and Saudi funding is set to underwrite the 2025 Club World Cup in the United States, which is a pet project for Infantino.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fifa-names-saudi-arabia-as-2034-world-cup-host/7897559.html	2024-12-11T08:23:41-08:00	
Taliban minister from Haqqani network assassinated in Kabul	ISLAMABAD — A bomb blast Wednesday in Kabul, Afghanistan, killed the Taliban’s minister of refugees and repatriation, Khalil-Ur-Rahman Haqqani, and at least four associates. Taliban sources said that the afternoon 'suicide' bombing occurred within the ministry building in the Afghan capital as Haqqani was exiting his office. Several other individuals were reportedly injured. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the assassination of the minister, which marks one of the most significant attacks on hardline Taliban leaders since they returned to power in August 2021. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid confirmed the 'martyrdom' of Haqqani in the attack he blamed on 'Khawarij,' a term the de facto rulers use to refer to Islamic State-Khorasan or IS-K, an Afghanistan-based Islamic State affiliate. Mujahid did not provide further details about the incident, nor did he mention other casualties or the nature of the attack. 'This reprehensible act of cowardice, culminating in his martyrdom at the hands of the Khawarij [outsiders], will neither diminish the resolve of Muslims nor succeed in undermining the resilience of our robust Sharia-based governance,' he stated. The slain minister was responsible for overseeing the repatriation and resettlement of Afghan refugees, primarily those being sent back from neighboring Pakistan and Iran. The United States’ Rewards for Justice website listed Haqqani as a global terrorist and offered a $5 million bounty for information leading to his apprehension. 'Khalil has conducted operations for the Taliban on orders from his nephew, Sirajuddin Haqqani,' and 'has also acted on behalf of al-Qa’ida (AQ) and has been linked to AQ terrorist operations,' according to the Rewards for Justice site. The elder Haqqani was considered a key member of the Haqqani network, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization headed by his nephew, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who serves as the de facto Taliban interior minister. He has a $10 million bounty on his head for his alleged terrorist activities. Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the attack, saying his government was in contact with Kabul to ascertain further details. 'We are deeply shocked at the death of Acting Afghan Minister Khalil ur Rehman Haqqani and loss of precious lives as a result of a terrorist attack in the Afghan Refugee Ministry in Kabul today,' Dar said on the X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-minister-from-haqqani-network-assassinated-in-kabul/7897515.html	2024-12-11T07:50:33-08:00	
Doctors Without Borders resumes some activities in Haiti's capital	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — Medical charity Doctors Without Borders said Wednesday it would partially resume its activities in Haiti's violence-wracked capital, Port-au-Prince, less than a month after suspending its operations over threats to its staff. Haiti has suffered from decades of instability, but the situation escalated in February when armed groups launched coordinated attacks in Port-au-Prince to overthrow then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry. Gangs currently control 80% of the city, where Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, said the medical needs are 'immense.' 'MSF is now resuming activities thanks to a constructive dialogue with key stakeholders and involvement by the authorities to ensure respect for our teams and our medical mission,' the nongovernmental organization said in a statement. But the group said it would not resume patient transports, as 'the risk for our teams and patients remains high, particularly in ambulances.' Three MSF-run hospitals and a clinic in the greater Port-au-Prince metropolitan area will reopen, but the Turgeau hospital will remain closed, due to the issue with patient transports, it said. MSF suspended operations on November 19 over what it said was 'violence and threats from police,' after two patients were shot dead. 'These past three weeks have been especially painful,' Jean-Marc Biquet, MSF's head of mission in Haiti, said in a statement. 'Despite the commitments made by the authorities, the risks remain high, and our ability to continue our work in Haiti is uncertain as we move ahead,' he said. 'We call on all parties to respect our medical and humanitarian mission so that we can respond to medical needs to the full extent of our capacity.' Nearly 200 people were killed in brutal violence in Port-au-Prince last weekend, reportedly orchestrated against voodoo practitioners. The government has condemned the massacre as 'unbearable cruelty.' The latest killings bring the death toll this year in Haiti to around 5,000 people, according to the United Nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/doctors-without-borders-resumes-some-activities-in-haiti-s-capital/7897508.html	2024-12-11T07:43:30-08:00

Community-led farming initiative restores wastelands, rural incomes in North India	In North India, vast tracts of land turned into wasteland in recent years as farmers abandoned cultivating their fields — partly because it was unprofitable to farm their small patches of land and partly because stray animals destroyed crops they planted. Now some farmers have come together to restore these wastelands in an initiative that is helping rural women raise their income. Anjana Pasricha reports.

Blinken travels to Mideast as Syria navigates post-Assad path	WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading to Jordan and Turkey Wednesday to rally regional countries around an aligned vision for Syria's future following the ousting of longtime authoritarian ruler Bashar al-Assad. Blinken will travel to Aqaba, Jordan, and Ankara, Turkey, and meet leaders to discuss developments in Syria, Israel, Gaza, Lebanon and across the region, said the U.S. State Department. A spokesperson said Blinken aims to secure consensus among regional leaders on key principles for Syria’s post-Assad transition. He said these include full respect for minority rights, the facilitation of humanitarian aid, the prevention of Syria becoming a haven for terrorism or a threat to its neighbors, and the securing and safe destruction of chemical or biological weapons stockpiles. Blinken has said that the United States will recognize a Syrian government that upholds those principles. The spokesperson said that in Aqaba, Blinken will meet with senior Jordanian officials to discuss bilateral issues, highlight the U.S.-Jordan strategic partnership, and reaffirm U.S. support for regional stability. In Ankara, Blinken will engage with senior Turkish officials to strengthen bilateral cooperation on shared priorities, including counterterrorism and regional stability, with NATO ally Turkey. On Tuesday, Blinken held talks with counterparts from Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Egypt, where he reiterated the need for a Syrian-led transition. Meanwhile, on Thursday, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, will hold an emergency session to address the situation in Syria. The OPCW — the implementing body for the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention — said it is monitoring Syria with 'special attention' to chemical weapons sites and has reminded the country of its duty to declare and destroy all banned weapons. The U.S. State Department said it will await the session's outcome to determine the next steps. Also, U.S. President Joe Biden will join leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in a virtual summit on Friday to discuss Syria and other pressing issues in the Middle East. Last Sunday, Syrian rebel groups toppled the Assad regime after a swift offensive of under two weeks, ending a decadeslong reign of brutal oppression. While many Syrians celebrate Assad's departure, uncertainty looms over the nation's future. The Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the dominant faction among opposition forces, is rapidly consolidating power. At the same time, foreign actors are vying for influence with the nascent government or seeking to limit its potential as a security threat. Syria’s nearly 14-year civil war claimed 500,000 lives and displaced half of its 23 million prewar population. Millions of Syrians fled to neighboring countries such as Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon, with many continuing their journey to Europe in search of safety.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-travels-to-mideast-as-syria-navigates-post-assad-path/7897415.html	2024-12-11T06:46:50-08:00	
Chad military frees abducted Cameroonians, while troops deployed to secure border	Yaounde, Cameroon — Chad's military says it has deployed several hundred troops along the border with Cameroon to stop rebels from abducting civilians after armed men kidnapped a dozen Cameroonians, including a popular traditional ruler this week. Chad’s military has freed the kidnap victims but says troops need civilian help to stop a wave of local intercommunal violence. The latest wave of violence between the Moussey and Massa communities erupted in border areas late last month. Officials in Cameroon say that since then, several hundred civilians have been reluctant to return to the Gobo district, located along the central African state's northern border with Chad. Many civilians have fled to safer towns and villages. Forty-three-year-old cattle rancher Timothe Woundai is one of the displaced civilians. He said he, his wife and three children found refuge the Gobo district village of Yakreo. Woundai said tensions degenerated into ongoing violence after a member of the Moussey community was killed and had his goats stolen. He said Moussey community members launched attacks on their Massa community neighbors using weapons including guns, machetes and bow and arrows to kill civilians. He said Moussey community members also accuse Massa community members of regularly stealing cattle. Military officials in Cameroon say at least five people have been killed and scores wounded amid the violence between the two communities. Both communities say about 13 people have died so far, with several dozen houses torched. When the conflict began, civilians said Voutsou Tairia, the traditional ruler of Bougoudoum village, and a dozen civilians were abducted and taken to Chad. Chadian officials say Voutsou was rescued from captivity by government troops, flown to Cameroon in a Chadian military helicopter and handed to Cameroon’s military and government officials this week. Authorities in Chad have provided no details about where and how the traditional ruler and the others were rescued. Officials say Voutsou and the freed civilians were given free medical care. Abdelkerim Seid Bauche is governor of Mayo-Kebbi East, an administrative region in Chad. He said Chad deployed troops on its side of the border Wednesday to stop rebels and armed gangs from abducting civilians and crossing with weapons into Mayo-Kebbi East. Abdelkerim said after handing Voutsou to Cameroon officials he is launching a fervent appeal to civilians on both sides of the Chad-Cameroon border to help restore peace by reporting armed men and strangers hiding among civilians in towns and villages to government troops and administrative officials. Abdelkerim added that Chad is very concerned about the ongoing violence because weapons are illegally circulating across the porous border and can be used by armed gangs to destabilize communities. Meanwhile, Midjiyawa Bakari, the governor of Cameroon's Far North Region, said troops have also been deployed on the Cameroon side of the border to make sure that armed gangs and criminals escaping Chad's military onslaught do not find safety on Cameroon’s territory. He said armed men responsible for the fresh wave of violence along the border will be punished. Accusations of cattle stealing and violence have plagued relations between the Massa and Moussey communities for years. Cameroon says President Paul Biya has dispatched a delegation to negotiate peace between the two communities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-military-frees-abducted-cameroonians-while-troops-deployed-to-secure-border/7897417.html	2024-12-11T06:34:08-08:00	
Biden approves national security memo on China, Iran, North Korea and Russia ahead of Trump's return	Washington — President Joe Biden has approved a new national security memorandum ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House that could serve as a road map for the incoming administration as it looks to counter growing cooperation among China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, the White House said Wednesday. Biden administration officials began developing the guidance this summer. It was shaped to be a document that could help the next administration build its approach from Day 1 on how it deals with the tightening relationships involving America's most prominent adversaries and competitors, according to two senior administration officials. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said the classified memorandum would not be made public because of the sensitivity of some of its findings. The document includes four broad recommendations: improving U.S. government interagency cooperation, speeding up the sharing of information with allies about the four adversaries, calibrating the U.S. government's use of sanctions and other economic tools for maximum effectiveness, and bolstering preparation to manage simultaneous crises involving the adversaries. The U.S. for many years has been concerned about cooperation among the four countries. Coordination has accelerated between the countries in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The officials noted that as Russia has become more isolated by much of the world, Moscow has turned to Iran for drones and missiles. From North Korea, the Russians have received artillery, missiles and even thousands of troops that have traveled to help the Russians try to repel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region. China, meanwhile, has supported Russia with dual use components that help keep its military industrial base afloat. In return, Russia has sent fighter jets to Iran and assisted Tehran as it looks to bolster its missile defense and space technology. North Korea has received from Russia much-needed fuel and funding to help build out its manufacturing and military capabilities. The officials added that Russia has 'de facto accepted North Korea as a nuclear weapon state.' China, meanwhile, is benefiting from Russian know-how, with the two countries working together to deepen their military technical cooperation. The two nations are also conducting joint patrols in the Arctic region. Biden and Trump have sharply different worldviews, but officials in both the incoming and outgoing administrations said they have sought to coordinate on national security issues during the transition. One of the officials said that the Biden White House memo 'isn't trying to box (the Trump administration) in or tilt them toward one policy option or another.' The official said the document is intended to help the next administration build 'capacity' as it shapes its policies on some the most difficult foreign policies it will face.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-approves-national-security-memo-on-china-iran-north-korea-and-russia-ahead-of-trump-s-return/7897334.html	2024-12-11T05:37:39-08:00	
Russia monitoring situation in Syria, highlights need to protect its military bases	Russia said Wednesday it is closely monitoring the situation in Syria and is in contact with 'those who are currently controlling the situation.' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov highlighted Russia’s need to ensure the security of its diplomatic facilities and its military bases in Syria, where Russian troops were based for years supporting the Syrian military in the country’s civil war. Peskov’s comments came days after Syrian rebels moved into Damascus and forced President Bashar al-Assad from power. Assad fled to Russia, where Russian officials said he was granted asylum. Assad’s fall also dealt a blow to Iran’s interests in the region, cutting off a land delivery route for weapons to the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon as well as territory in which Iranian militias could operate. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday rejected the idea of weakened Iranian network in the region, which includes its support of Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, militias in Iraq and Houthi militants in Yemen. Khamenei also said what happened in Syria was the result of a U.S.-Israeli plan, and that a 'neighboring state' of Syria played a role in Assad’s ouster. He did not name the neighboring country, but Turkey, which borders Syria, was a main supporter of groups that opposed Assad. As Syrians work to establish the future of their country, Pope Francis said Wednesday he hoped for a political solution that promotes 'the stability and unity of the country.' 'I pray... that the Syrian people may live in peace and security in their beloved land and the different religions may walk together in friendship and mutual respect for the good of that nation afflicted by so many years of war,' the pope said. A day after announcing he had been selected to lead an interim government, Mohammed al-Bashir called on Syrians who fled the country to return home. In an interview with Italy’s Corriere della Sera, Bashir said bringing back millions of Syrian refugees was an early goal, and that their talents and experience 'will allow the country to flourish.' There are about 5 million Syrian refugees living in neighboring countries, according to the United Nations. U.N. special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen cautioned at a Tuesday briefing against rushing to bring refugees home, describing the humanitarian situation in Syria as 'disastrous' and the economy as 'collapsed.' Some information for this report was provided by from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-monitoring-situation-in-syria-highlights-need-to-protect-its-military-bases/7897240.html	2024-12-11T04:15:22-08:00	
Officials: Fighting breaks out between Somalia's Jubbaland region and federal government	MOGADISHU/GAROWE, Somalia — Fighting erupted on Wednesday between Somalia's semi-autonomous Jubbaland region and federal government forces after Jubbaland held an election against the advice of authorities in Mogadishu, officials said. The clashes will raise concerns that internal rivalries are diverting attention from the fight against the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab group just as the mandate of an African Union peacekeeping force expires. 'This morning, federal forces from Mogadishu in Ras Kamboni, using drones, attacked Jubbaland forces,' Adan Ahmed Haji, assistant security minister of Jubbaland, told a press conference in the regional capital Kismayu. Somalia's Defense Minister Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur said the Jubbaland forces initiated the clashes. 'Early this morning (Wednesday), Jubbaland forces attacked the Somali federal military troops that were deployed in Lower Jubba to take bases withdrawn from by ATMIS,' he said in a statement. In late November, Jubbaland - which borders Kenya and Ethiopia and is one of Somalia's five semi-autonomous states - re-elected regional president Ahmed Mohamed Islam Madobe to a third term. The national government in Mogadishu, led by President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, opposed the election, saying it was held without federal involvement. As the election dispute escalated, the federal government issued an arrest warrant for Madobe, while Jubbaland issued a reciprocal one for President Mohamud. Major Aden Nur, a federal army officer in Mogadishu, said Wednesday's fighting was in an area 20 km from Ras Kamboni, a town where federal troops have increased their numbers since the election. 'So far federal forces captured four technical (gun-mounted pickup) vehicles from Jubbaland forces. Fighting is going on far from Ras Kamboni. There are casualties on both sides but no exact figure,' Nur told Reuters. In the wider fight against al Shabaab, the mandate of the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) expires in less than three weeks and no agreement has been reached on which countries will contribute to the follow-on peacekeeping mission or how it will be financed. Jubbaland is seen as the breadbasket of Somalia and Kismayu is an important port. Its shoreline delineates a contested maritime zone, with potential oil and gas deposits. In 2021, Kenya rejected a U.N. court ruling that decided mostly in favor of Somalia in the row but said it would pursue a diplomatic solution.	https://www.voanews.com/a/officials-fighting-breaks-out-between-somalia-s-jubbaland-region-and-federal-government/7897185.html	2024-12-11T03:17:30-08:00	
Syrian former prisoners speak out on Assad regime's collapse	As Syrians danced in the streets over President Bashar al-Assad's fall from power, Anwar Etnesh drove his car into the dense traffic clogging the route from his hometown Daraa north to Damascus. Hordes of Syrians like Etnesh were heading to Syria's capital to celebrate the end of the Assad family's rule. But Etnesh was on a mission to find his 55-year-old cousin, whom Assad soldiers arrested in Daraa 13 years ago during anti-government protests. He was never seen or heard from again. Since Assad fled to Russia, according to Russian state media, the militias who overthrew his rule, led by former al-Qaida affiliate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, have been freeing thousands of prisoners. 'I don't know if he's alive,' Etnesh relayed to VOA Mandarin by video call from Damascus. 'I went to the mosque at 7 a.m. and then have been from prison to prison to prison searching. Nine prisons so far. I don't even know what prison he's in.' He is one of the estimated nearly 137,000 Syrians whom rights groups say disappeared into military prisons during the civil war. The Britain-based Syrian Network for Human Rights says Syrian government interrogators have tortured more than 15,000 prisoners to death since 2011. 'What was our crime?' Basheer Mansour, who spoke to VOA Mandarin by phone messaging application and email, is one of the lucky prisoners who survived. He said that in 2011, regime soldiers opened fire on him and his university friends as they attempted to deliver critical medicine and food to Daraa residents living under a government siege. Mansour said two friends were shot to death beside him. He and other survivors were forced into trucks, blindfolded, beaten and corralled into a small toilet space where he said they were held captive and tortured with brutal beatings and sleep deprivation that left some prisoners dead. 'They used an electric rod in my abdominal area and whipped my head,' Mansour said. 'They removed fingernails and burned my body with cigarettes. I wished I would die just to get rid of the torment. They did many things I cannot to this day talk about. What was our crime?' The most extreme torture, said Mansour, was inflicted by hospital staff in a Damascus-area military prison, where he was admitted after suffering severe wounds inflicted during torture. He said he was blindfolded and handcuffed throughout his 10-day hospital stay. 'The last day at the hospital they removed the handcuffs from my hands and feet and asked me to move my legs,' Mansour recalled. 'I tried to move my legs and hands but couldn't. I couldn't move a single part of my body. I started to cry … and begged them to kill me because I did not want to live paralyzed. They took everything from me and stole my life and my future.' Soon after, his captors phoned his father to come get him, he said. 'Now we can go back' Today Mansour uses a wheelchair and lives in North Carolina, where he works at the airport and studies computer programming. He is closely following events unfolding in Syria. 'My family is scattered around the world,' he told VOA Mandarin. 'Some are in Germany, some in Holland, some in France and in Kuwait. I haven't seen them for 11 years. I would love to go back to Syria just to gather with them and see them. I'm happy the regime is gone. Now we can go back to Syria.' But returning to Syria may not be easy. The conglomerate of militias led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham on Tuesday announced an interim prime minister but have not yet made public their detailed plans for governance of Syria. Meanwhile, inside the country, locals — including those like Etnesh who are still looking for imprisoned relatives — are enjoying the new reality — a Syria without rule by Assad. 'I'm in shock. This is a dream. The regime is over. There aren't any Syrian troops anywhere. People are crying, they're happy. … It's disbelief,' Etnesh said. 'And we're all waiting for news of relatives. Most Syrians have someone they know in prison.' As of midday Monday in Damascus, Etnesh had not received any word on his cousin. He told VOA Mandarin he'll search for another week before returning home to Daraa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-former-prisoners-speak-out-on-assad-regime-s-collapse/7896676.html	2024-12-11T01:45:07-08:00

UN General Assembly considers resolution calling for immediate Gaza ceasefire	The U.N. General Assembly is set to consider a draft resolution Wednesday calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as well as the release of all hostages still being held by militants. The meeting comes weeks after the United States voted against a similar measure at the U.N. Security Council. The General Assembly has previously approved a ceasefire call, but its resolutions are non-binding, unlike the Security Council. The draft under consideration also demands that Palestinian civilians in Gaza be given immediate access to aid necessary to survival, including unhindered access for humanitarian deliveries throughout the Gaza Strip. U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Tuesday that aid to northern Gaza has been largely blocked for two months, leaving 65,000 to 75,000 Palestinians without access to food, water, electricity or health care. Israeli forces carried out airstrikes in northern and central Gaza on Wednesday that Palestinian health officials said killed at least 26 people. At least 19 of the dead were killed in a strike that hit a house in Beit Lahiya, the officials said. Another airstrike hit a house in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza, killing at least seven people. Hamas set off the war with its October 2023 attack on southern Israel during which the militants killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,700 people, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The conflict sparked fighting at the Israel-Lebanon border as Hamas ally Hezbollah launched cross-border attacks on northern Israel. The two sides carried out low-scale attacks for months before the conflict erupted in September with Israeli ground operations in southern Lebanon and airstrikes that killed a number of Hezbollah leaders. A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has been in place since late November. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, United Kingdom and other Western countries.

Atmospheric river and potential bomb cyclone bring chaotic winter weather to East Coast	PORTLAND, Maine — The U.S. East Coast was beginning a whiplash-inducing stretch of weather on Wednesday that was rainy, windy and potentially dangerous, due in part to an atmospheric river and developing bomb cyclone. Places like western Maine could see freezing rain, downpours, unseasonably high temperatures and damaging winds — all in the span of a day, said Derek Schroeter, a forecaster with the National Weather Service. The heavy rain and fierce winds will last until Wednesday night in many areas, and flooding is possible in some locales, forecasters said. Utilities were also gearing up for potential power outages from damage caused by winds that could exceed 97 kph in some areas. One of the key factors driving the weather is an atmospheric river, which is a long band of water vapor that can transport moisture from the tropics to more northern areas, said Schroeter, who's based in Gray, Maine. The storm has the ability to hit New England hard because it could tap moisture from the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the U.S. Southeast, and transport it to places like Maine. The state was preparing for a 'multifaceted storm' that could bring two to three inches of rainfall in some areas, Schroeter said. Similar conditions had been possible elsewhere from Tuesday night to Wednesday night. 'We're looking at the risk of slick travel (Tuesday night) with the freezing rain,' Schroeter said, 'and we are going to be watching for the potential for flash flooding and sharp rises on streams as temperatures rise into the 50s (10-15 Celsius).' Forecasters also said the storm had the potential to include a process that meteorologists call bombogenesis, or a 'bomb cyclone.' That is the rapid intensification of a cyclone in a short period of time, and it has the ability to bring severe rainfall. Parts of the Northeast were already preparing for bad weather. In Maine, some schools operated on a delay on Tuesday, which began with a few inches of snow. A flood watch for Vermont runs from Wednesday afternoon to Thursday morning. The city of Montpelier, Vermont, was advising residents to prepare for mild flooding in the area and to elevate items in basements and low areas that are prone to flooding. The city said Tuesday that it has been in contact with the National Weather Service and Vermont Dam Safety and 'will be actively monitoring the river levels as this storm passes through.' Ski resorts around the Northeast were preparing visitors for a potentially messy day on Wednesday. Stratton Mountain Resort, in southern Vermont, posted on its website that patrons 'make sure to pack your Gore-Tex gear because it’s going to be a wet one.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/atmospheric-river-and-potential-bomb-cyclone-bring-chaotic-winter-weather-to-east-coast-/7897121.html	2024-12-11T00:44:36-08:00	
Hundreds of arrests and mysterious beatings as Georgia cracks down on pro-EU protests	TBILISI, Georgia — Seventy-five-year-old Marina Terishvili's teenage son Mamuka was shot dead at a nationalist rally in Georgia in 1992. Now her other son, Giorgi, has been arrested for his role in protests against perceived Russian influence in their homeland. Seven police cars pulled up at her house in the capital Tbilisi on Friday and took Giorgi, a 52-year-old taxi driver, into custody, she said. He was placed in pre-trial detention for two months for 'participating in group violence' according to a rights group and local media, and faces up to six years in prison if convicted, part of a broad crackdown on demonstrators who have clashed nightly with police for almost two weeks. The Georgian Young Lawyers' Association rights group said he had not yet entered a plea and Marina Terishvili said she did not know why he had been detained. 'I can't deny that he went to the rallies, because he has a brother who died on Feb. 2, 1992, and he went there in honor of his soul,' Marina said, adding that Giorgi could not tolerate the idea that his younger brother had died in vain. Mamuka was 17 when he was killed during the brief civil war that followed Georgia's 1991 exit from the Soviet Union, which ended 200 years of rule by Russia. Giorgi is among more than 400 people who authorities and rights groups say have been arrested during protests against government moves to delay the South Caucasus country's longstanding bid to join the European Union. Around 30 face criminal charges, mostly relating to allegations of 'group violence' aimed at overthrowing the government. Among those jailed are two leaders of the country's pro-EU opposition. Rights groups say the crackdown is without recent precedent in Georgia, a country that had been seen as among the most pro-Western and democratic of the Soviet Union's successor states. Fireworks Some protesters have thrown fireworks and other projectiles at police, arguing that they are defending themselves against tear-gas and baton attacks. The interior ministry said on Monday that more than 150 police officers have been injured. The Georgian Dream party, which officials say won elections in October the opposition says were tainted by fraud, provoked widespread anger in the country of 3.7 million when it announced last month that it was suspending EU accession talks until 2028. Georgian Dream says it favors a pragmatic policy with Russia, which backs two regions which split from Georgia after it left the Soviet Union. The party says its aim is to safeguard peace amid the war in Ukraine, which has been shattered by Russian invading forces since early 2022. Western countries have condemned the crackdown, and the EU's ambassador to Georgia said on Monday that it merits sanctions. Georgia's ombudsman Levan Ioseliani, an ex-opposition politician appointed by Georgian Dream, said on Tuesday that his office has visited 327 detainees, of whom 225 said they were mistreated and 157 had visible injuries. Police reported finding fireworks and items for making petrol bombs at two opposition party headquarters. Both parties said the items had been planted. At a briefing on Monday, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze called the parties' premises a 'hotbed of violence' and said their attempt to seize power had failed. Masked men in black Gangs of masked men in black have begun attacking opposition politicians, activists and some journalists in recent days. Opposition supporters refer to the gangs as 'titushky,' a Ukrainian word for thugs who attacked opponents of a pro-Russian government before that country's 2014 Maidan revolution which drove the president to flee to Moscow. Two journalists from a pro-opposition television channel suffered visible head injuries in an attack on Dec. 7 captured in their live broadcast from a protest. The same day, Koba Khabazi, a prominent member of the Coalition for Change opposition party, was left with extensive head injuries after being attacked inside the building that houses his party's headquarters. CCTV footage obtained by Reuters shows around 15 black-clad men entering the building and confronting Khabazi, who they push down a staircase, before punching and kicking him in the head as he lies on the ground, motionless. Speaking to Reuters two days later, Khabazi, a 57-year-old former lawmaker, blamed the Georgian government for the attack. 'Of course, the government is behind this,' said Khabazi, his head still swathed in bandages. 'This government is built on violence.' Georgian authorities have said they are not involved in the attacks, and condemn them. Ruling party officials have suggested they are carried out by the opposition to frame Georgian Dream.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-of-arrests-and-mysterious-beatings-as-georgia-cracks-down-on-pro-eu-protests/7897114.html	2024-12-11T00:37:02-08:00	
Human trafficking rises sharply after dropping during pandemic, UN says	VIENNA — Human trafficking has risen sharply due to conflicts, climate-induced disasters and global crises, according to a United Nations report published on Wednesday. In 2022, the latest year for which data is widely available, the number of known victims worldwide rose to 25% above 2019's pre-pandemic levels, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's Global Report on Trafficking in Persons said. A sharp fall in 2020 had largely disappeared by the following year. 'Criminals are increasingly trafficking people into forced labor, including to coerce them into running sophisticated online scams and cyberfraud, while women and girls face the risk of sexual exploitation and gender-based violence,' the report said, adding that organized crime was mainly responsible. Children accounted for 38% of detected victims, compared to 35% for figures for 2020 which formed the basis of the previous report. The latest report showed adult women remain the largest group of victims, representing 39% of cases, followed by men at 23%, girls at 22% and boys at 16%. The most common reason by far for women and girls being trafficked was sexual exploitation at 60% or more, followed by forced labor. For men, it was forced labor and for boys, it was forced labor and 'other purposes' in roughly equal measure. Those other purposes include forced criminality and forced begging. The report said the growing number of boys identified as victims of trafficking could be linked to rising numbers of unaccompanied minors arriving in Europe and North America. The region of origin that accounted for the largest number of victims was sub-Saharan Africa with 26%, though there are many different trafficking routes. While improved detection could account for the growing numbers, the report said it was likely a combination of that and more trafficking in general. The biggest increases in cases detected were in sub-Saharan Africa, North America and the 'western and southern Europe' region, according to the report, with migration influxes being a significant factor in the latter two.	https://www.voanews.com/a/human-trafficking-rises-sharply-after-dropping-during-pandemic-un-says/7897104.html	2024-12-11T00:26:55-08:00	
BHP, Rio Tinto face sexual harassment class actions in Australia	Melbourne, Australia — Global mining giants BHP Group and Rio Tinto are facing class actions alleging widespread and systemic sexual harassment at Australian mine sites, law firm JGA Saddler said on Wednesday. JGA Saddler said women who spoke out about the harassment were allegedly discriminated against by the miners and that it expects 'thousands of female workers' at the two companies to join the class actions. BHP issued a statement on Wednesday saying it apologized to anyone who has ever experienced any form of harassment at BHP. 'Sexual harassment has no place in our workplaces or indeed anywhere. We are committed to providing a safe and respectful workplace for everyone,' said BHP. A Rio Tinto spokesman said the miner was aware that a claim had been filed in the Federal Court on Wednesday. 'We treat all such claims with the utmost seriousness. We do not tolerate any form of sexual harassment or sex-based harassment. We take all concerns about workplace safety, culture and breaches of our values, or our code of conduct extremely seriously,' the spokesman said. In 2022, a Western Australia state government review into abuse at mining sites found unsafe working conditions for women in the industry, who had to frequently deal with sexual harassment and sexual assault. 'BHP and Rio Tinto have sent female staff to these sites knowing there was a high risk of personal danger, and then punished them with demotion, dismissal or discrimination when they reported it,' JGA Saddler lawyer Joshua Aylward said in a statement. The class actions are being funded by litigation financier Omni Bridgeway. The lead applicant in the class action against Rio Tinto, who JGA Saddler said has requested to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, alleged she suffered sexual harassment on a weekly basis while working as a security guard on Rio Tinto’s Australian sites. 'I was sent unsolicited sexually explicit messages, videos and pictures from a colleague including pictures and videos of him masturbating in his on-site room. Rio Tinto allowed him to resign but after my complaint I was overlooked for opportunities to upskill,' she said in a statement detailing her allegations. The lead BHP applicant, who requested anonymity for the same reason, listed incidents of harassment in a statement and said she was often afraid to report the abuse. 'There have been times I haven’t reported an incident for fear of what might happen to my career, my job and my personal safety,' she said. The class actions were previously reported by the country's national broadcaster, the ABC.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bhp-rio-tinto-face-sexual-harassment-class-actions-in-australia/7897102.html	2024-12-11T00:22:03-08:00

Russian officials report damage from Ukrainian air attacks in Bryansk, Rostov	Russian officials said Wednesday that Ukrainian aerial attacks caused damage in two regions along the Russia-Ukraine border. Bryansk Governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram that a drone attack caused a fire at a factory that was later extinguished. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it destroyed 14 Ukrainian aerial drones launched in overnight attacks. In the Rostov region, acting governor Yuri Slyusar said Wednesday a missile attack damaged an industrial facility and more than a dozen cars at the port of Taganrog. Slyusar said on Telegram that preliminary information indicated no one was hurt in the attack. In Ukraine, Zaporizhzhia Governor Ivan Fedorov said Wednesday the death toll from a Russian missile strike on the city of Zaporizhzhia a day earlier had risen to six people, with another 22 wounded. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after the attack that his government was talking with allies about getting additional air defense aid. 'Right now, we do not have enough systems to protect our country from Russian missiles,' Zelenskyy said in his nightly address. 'However, our partners have these systems. Once again, we reiterate: air defense systems should save lives, not gather dust in storage facilities.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-officials-report-damage-from-ukrainian-air-attacks-in-bryansk-rostov/7897068.html	2024-12-10T22:36:50-08:00	
Sudan again tops International Rescue Committee crises watchlist	UNITED NATIONS — Sudan - for the second year in a row - topped a 2025 watchlist of global humanitarian crises released Wednesday by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) aid organization, followed by Gaza and the West Bank, Myanmar, Syria and South Sudan. The New York-based IRC began the watchlist more than 15 years ago as an internal planning tool to prepare for the year ahead, but chief executive David Miliband said it now also served as a call to action globally. The report said 305.1 million people around the world are in humanitarian need - up from 77.9 million in 2015 - and that the 20 countries on the IRC watchlist account for 82% of them. Miliband described the numbers as 'crushing.' 'There are more resources to do more good for more people than at any time in history. This makes it all the more bewildering that the gap between humanitarian need and humanitarian funding is also greater than ever,' he wrote in the watchlist report. The report said the humanitarian crisis in Sudan was the largest since records began and that the country accounts for 10% of all people in humanitarian need, despite being home to just 1% of the global population. War erupted in April 2023 from a power struggle between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule, and triggered the world's largest displacement crisis. The remaining 15 countries on the IRC watchlist are: Lebanon, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Mali, Somalia, Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Niger, Nigeria, Ukraine and Yemen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-again-tops-international-rescue-committee-crises-watchlist/7897060.html	2024-12-10T22:27:25-08:00	
Myanmar's economy to shrink as floods compound crisis, says World Bank	Myanmar's economy is expected to shrink by 1% in the current fiscal year, the World Bank said Wednesday, sharply downgrading its economic forecast as severe floods compounded the challenges facing the conflict-torn country. In June, the bank had projected Myanmar's economy would grow 1% during the current fiscal year, which ends in March 2025, but warned of increasing poverty and escalating violence. The country of 55 million people has been in turmoil since 2021 when the military seized power from the elected civilian government triggering a nationwide protest movement that evolved into an armed rebellion against the junta. The coup abruptly ended a decade of tentative democratic and economic reform in Myanmar, with Western investors pulling out of the country and sanctions disrupting trade. 'The level and intensity of armed conflict remains high, severely affecting lives and livelihoods, disrupting production and supply chains, and heightening uncertainty around the economic outlook,' the World Bank said in its report released on Wednesday. The bank said multiple sectors of the economy were struggling, and that agricultural production was likely to drop as a result of Typhoon Yagi, which struck in September and caused widespread flooding. 'The manufacturing and services sectors are projected to contract slightly, given persistent shortages of raw materials, imported inputs and electricity, weak domestic demand, and the ongoing impacts of conflict and economic uncertainty,' it said. A junta spokesman did not respond to a call from Reuters seeking comment. About 25% of Myanmar's population is experiencing acute food insecurity due to inflation and supply shortages exacerbated by the war, the World Bank said. It said inflation was expected to remain at 26% in annual average terms this fiscal year, slightly lower than 27.5% in 2023-24. The expanding civil war, where a coalition of new armed groups and established ethnic armies have beaten back the well-armed junta, has now engulfed more than half of Myanmar's 330 townships and forced 3.5 million people from their homes, according to the report. 'Even assuming no further escalation in conflict, growth is expected to remain subdued the following year,' the World Bank said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-s-economy-to-shrink-as-floods-compound-crisis-says-world-bank/7897046.html	2024-12-10T21:24:28-08:00	
Ex-defense chief in South Korea tried to kill himself after being arrested over martial law case	SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s previous Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun was stopped from attempting suicide while in detention over last week's martial law, officials said, as police were reported to be raiding President Yoon Suk Yeol’s office Wednesday in their intensifying investigation. The main liberal opposition Democratic Party also plans to submit a new motion to impeach Yoon for his Dec. 3 declaration that imposed martial law. Yoon’s ill-conceived power grab has paralyzed South Korean politics, frozen its foreign policy, and rattled financial markets, greatly reducing his chances of completing his five-year term and casting a turbulent shadow over one of Asia’s most robust democracies. Shin Yong Hae, commissioner general of the Korea Correctional Service, told lawmakers Wednesday that Kim tried to kill himself at a detention center in Seoul. He said that Kim's suicide attempt failed after center officials stopped him and that he is in a stable condition now. At the same parliament committee meeting, Justice Minister Park Sung Jae confirmed Kim's failed suicide attempt. Kim was arrested earlier Wednesday after a Seoul court approved a warrant for him on allegations of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power. Kim became the first person formally arrested over the Dec. 3 martial law decree. Later in the day, National Police Agency Commissioner General Cho Ji Ho and Kim Bong-sik, head of the metropolitan police agency of the capital, Seoul, were detained over their actions during martial law. They are being investigated for their roles in deploying police forces to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting to lift Yoon’s martial law decree. South Korean police also searched Yoon's office Wednesday over his martial law decree, Yonhap news agency reported. Other South Korean media also carried similar reports. but Yoon's office and police have not immediately confirmed the search. The country’s main law enforcement institutions are focusing on finding whether Yoon and others involved in imposing martial law committed the crime of rebellion. Yoon survived an impeachment attempt last Saturday when the ruling party boycotted the vote, but the Democratic Party is aiming to put the new motion to a vote on Saturday. After last week’s impeachment motion fell through, the leader of Yoon’s conservative party pledged to arrange his stable exit from power, saying the party will coordinate with Cabinet members over state affairs and that Yoon will be sidelined from duties during a transition to an early election. However, the plans have been widely criticized as unrealistic and unconstitutional. The constitution explicitly states that impeachment is the sole method for suspending presidential powers and that the authority to command the military rests solely with the president. The Defense Ministry said this week that Yoon remains in charge of the country’s military forces. The Assembly was also encircled by heavily armed troops, which military commanders say were deployed on the orders of the former defense minister. But enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber and unanimously rejected Yoon’s decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on Dec. 4. During a parliamentary hearing Tuesday, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command whose troops were sent to parliament, testified that he received direct instructions from Kim Yong Hyun to obstruct lawmakers from entering the Assembly’s main chamber. Kwak said the purpose of Kim’s instructions was to prevent the 300-member parliament from gathering the 150 votes necessary to overturn Yoon’s martial law order. Kwak said Yoon later called him directly and asked for the troops to 'quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.' Kwak said he discussed Yoon’s order with the commander at the scene and that they concluded there was nothing that could be done, ruling out the possibility of threatening the lawmakers by shooting blanks or cutting off electricity. At the same hearing, senior officer Kim Dae-woo of the military’s counterintelligence agency said his commander, Yeo In-hyung, asked him if an army bunker in Seoul had space to detain politicians and other figures after martial law was imposed. Yeo is considered a close associate of Kim Yong Hyun. Last week, Hong Jang-won, a deputy director of the country’s spy agency, said Yoon ordered him to help Yeo’s command to detain some of his political rivals but he ignored the president’s order. Kwak and Yeo are among those who face opposition-raised rebellion charges along with Yoon and Kim, and the Defense Ministry suspended them last week. If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If he is dismissed from office, a new presidential election would be required. Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during 'wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states' and South Korea wasn’t in such a situation. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the South Korean Constitution doesn’t allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation. In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed a need to rebuild the country by eliminating 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces,' a reference to his liberal rivals who control parliament. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has had near-constant friction with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which introduced motions to impeach some of his top officials and launched a political offensive over scandals involving Yoon and his wife. On Wednesday, North Korea’s state news agency for the first time reported about the political turmoil and street protests triggered by Yoon’s martial law decree. The report mostly attempted to explain the South Korean events though it used its typical abusive language like calling Yoon 'a traitor' and his military 'gangsters.' Many experts say North Korea is sensitive to the domestic spread of news on massive anti-government protests in foreign countries because its own people have no official access to international news and could be affected by such events.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ex-defense-chief-in-south-korea-tried-to-kill-himself-after-being-arrested-over-martial-law-case/7897028.html	2024-12-10T20:03:06-08:00	
White House wants Syrian-led process for new government after Assad’s ouster	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration says it is in touch with all rebel groups in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad and wants the process of forming a new government to be led by Syrians. White House national security communications adviser John Kirby spoke with VOA Turkish’s White House correspondent Begum Donmez Ersoz and said whatever governance comes out of the process, Washington wants to make sure it meets the aspirations of the Syrian people. Kirby says it’s too soon to tell whether Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Sunni Islamic al-Qaida offshoot that the United States has designated a terror group, and its leader, Mohammed al-Golani, have undergone an ideological transformation. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: Did Israel give the United States prior notification of their strikes on the Golan Heights and their deeper push into Syria? John Kirby, White House national security communications adviser: I’m going to let the Israelis speak to their operations, and I'm not going to speculate about what they're doing. I would just tell you that they certainly have the right to self-defense. We recognize that they see threats across that border as things unfold in Syria, and they've taken some actions. ... We, too, share a concern that the Israelis have over chemical weapons and the possibility of stockpiles in Syria and the potential use ... so we're in constant communication with the Israelis about what they're doing, and that will continue. VOA: Does the U.S. believe that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has undergone an ideological transformation? Kirby: I think it's too soon to tell. Mr. al-Golani is saying the right things about inclusiveness, about not being interested in persecuting either minorities or other groups. But I think, you know, we have to wait and see what they actually do in terms of trying to establish good governance. ... They are still a designated terrorist group. ... Whatever kind of governance comes out of this, we want to make sure it meets the aspirations of the Syrian people, that they have a vote and a voice in their future. So, we want it to be a Syrian-led process, and the United States will continue to support that kind of process. VOA: There is a concern in Turkey about the potential of an independent Kurdish state in northern Syria. How will the United States mitigate Turkey’s concerns? Kirby: They have legitimate concerns in terms of the safety and security of people inside Turkey. I know right now, Syria is kind of coming to the fore because of the news over the weekend, but it's not as if we haven't continually, over the last four years, had conversations with the Turks about their concerns along that border. And quite frankly, sharing with them our concerns about what we're trying to do against ISIS, partnering with the Syrian Democratic Forces. So, where those two levels of concerns overlap, or maybe conflict, we have the ability and have executed the ability to have conversations with the Turks to try to sort all this out. VOA: The United States is talking to Turkey for information on the whereabouts of journalist Austin Tice. Can you share more on those talks? Kirby: I won't get into the details of the discussions. ... We're still trying to get more context and information about Austin — where he is, what condition he might be in. We obviously talked to the Turks about this ... but we also talked to other counterparts in the region. Those conversations are ongoing. As the president said on Sunday, we want to see him back home with his family where he belongs, and we'll continue to have the level of engagement in the region to see if we can bring about that outcome. VOA: President-elect Donald Trump has signaled a hands-off approach in Syria. What would be the danger of that for U.S. interests in the region? Kirby: Well, we'll let Mr. Trump speak to his plans when he comes into office. We believe there are two things keenly in America's national security interest. Number 1 is the transition, peaceful transition, to legitimate governance in Syria that is a Syrian-led process. ... The second thing that's very much in our national security interest is making sure that ISIS cannot regenerate the capabilities like it had in 2014 and cannot exploit the current uncertainty in Syria to their own advantage. VOA: Syria was an important playground for Iran and the Shia Crescent. That has been broken now. Do you think Iran's ambitions over the Middle East are over? Kirby: I think only [the] supreme leader can answer that particular question. ... As Iran wakes up and looks at the region, it is different, and their axis of resistance has been broken in many, many places. ... And they, too, have been weakened as a military and as a capability, just in terms of, for instance, air defense. ... That said, I can't tell you that, as we look at the world today, that we see Iran giving up on their hegemonic ambitions in the region. They certainly are not as capable of executing those visions and that ambition, but I haven't seen anything that would indicate that that they're turning a blind eye to trying to pursue those kinds of ambitions. VOA: Would the United States accept a hard-line government under HTS in Syria that would contain Iran, as Golani alluded to in his speech? Kirby: What we want to see in terms of governance in Syria is governance that is seen as credible and legitimate, that is sustainable, that meets the aspirations of the Syrian people, and that is the result, the product, of a Syrian-led process to get them to that point. I think it's too soon to know exactly how it's all going to unfold, and we're watching this real, real close.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-wants-syrian-led-process-for-new-government-after-assad-s-ouster-/7897018.html	2024-12-10T19:07:50-08:00	
Bill to protect journalists fails in US Senate	WASHINGTON — A shield law known as the PRESS Act that would give journalists greater federal protections failed to pass the Senate on Tuesday evening after it was blocked by Senator Tom Cotton. Shield laws protect journalists from being forced by the government to disclose information such as the identities of sources. The PRESS Act would also limit the seizure of journalists' data without their knowledge. Nearly every U.S. state and the District of Columbia has either a shield law or court recognition of qualified privilege for sources, but no federal law is in place. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives unanimously passed the PRESS Act in January. But an attempt to pass the bill in the Senate via unanimous consent failed Tuesday evening after being blocked by Cotton. Any single senator has the power to halt a bill put forward by a unanimous consent request. In a speech, Cotton, a Republican, said he was blocking the bill over national security concerns. 'Passage of this bill would turn the United States Senate into the active accomplice of deep-state leakers, traitors and criminals, along with the America-hating and fame-hungry journalists who help them out,' Cotton said. 'Contrary to what members of the press may think, a press badge doesn't make you better than the rest of America,' Cotton later added. The PRESS Act makes exceptions for terrorism and other emergencies. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden made a rebuttal after Cotton's speech. 'I understand that we don't have unanimous consent today. I think it's unfortunate. I think America would be stronger and freer if we were passing this legislation today. But we'll be back,' Wyden said. 'This is about as important as it gets. Free speech is fundamental to what makes our country so special,' Wyden said later. Press freedom groups expressed disappointment over the bill's failure to pass. 'This is a commonsense bill with broad bipartisan support,' Gabe Rottman, policy director at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, told VOA. 'It's time to get it across the finish line.' After President-elect Donald Trump won election to the White House in November, several press freedom groups said they were making a final push to get the bill through Congress and signed into law before President Joe Biden left office. Trump has previously threatened to jail journalists if they don't reveal sources in stories he believes have national security implications. And last month, he called on Republicans to 'kill this bill' in a post on Truth Social. Now, the only way that the PRESS Act could pass the Senate is either by attaching it to a year-end spending bill or bringing it up for a stand-alone vote, according to the Freedom of the Press Foundation, or FPF. 'We need more than speeches about the PRESS Act's importance. We need action. Senate Democrats had all year to move this bipartisan bill, and now time is running out,' FPF's advocacy director Seth Stern said in a statement. 'Hopefully, today was a preview of more meaningful action to come,' Stern said. The PRESS Act's failure comes on the same day that a Justice Department report revealed that federal prosecutors ignored Justice Department rules when they seized journalists' phone records as part of a media leak investigation during the Trump administration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bill-to-protect-journalists-fails-in-senate/7897008.html	2024-12-10T19:01:51-08:00	
ICC prosecutor to Myanmar: Obey international law or face justice	WASHINGTON — International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan has warned that if violations of international law continue to escalate in northern Rakhine, a region in western Myanmar bordering Bangladesh, those responsible could face prosecution by the ICC. The ICC investigation primarily focuses on past violations committed by Myanmar's military, particularly the crimes against the Rohingya population during the 2016-2017 crackdown. However, Khan emphasized that the ICC’s mandate also extends to addressing ongoing violations. The Arakan Army's current activities in Rakhine may not fall under the ICC’s jurisdiction unless they are linked to international crimes within the court's scope. In an exclusive interview with VOA via Zoom on Monday, Khan confirmed additional applications because he had already applied for an arrest warrant against Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on November 27. While the current investigation focuses on crimes against the Rohingya, primarily in Rakhine, Khan's reference to additional applications indicates the ICC may also address other crimes. Khan pointed out that while Myanmar is not a state party to the Rome Statute, the ICC has jurisdiction in the Rakhine cases because many victims have sought refuge in Bangladesh, which is a state party. The Rohingya, a Muslim minority, endured decades of persecution in Myanmar, with a military crackdown in 2017 forcing over 700,000 to flee to Bangladesh. Myanmar’s military was already under investigation for war crimes prior to the 2017 crackdown. The ongoing investigation by the ICC focuses on alleged crimes committed during that period, including atrocities against the Rohingya. Since 2019, the ICC has been investigating crimes against humanity, focusing on the 2016-2017 violence against the Rohingya. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: This arrest warrant for Senior General Min Aung Hlaing is the first to be sought for a high-ranking Myanmar official. How significant is this step in addressing impunity in Myanmar? ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan: I think it’s very important that the victims, the Rohingya people, and many Burmese throughout Myanmar want justice and accountability. This is an issue the office has been examining since 2019. It's the first time my office has applied for arrest warrants in Southeast Asia, and the first warrant in the Myanmar-Bangladesh situation. I believe this demonstrates our commitment to doing the best we can, with the resources available, to treat every human life equally. It doesn’t matter the color of someone's skin, their religion, nationality or where they are from. We are doing our best to apply the law equally and ensure accountability for those responsible for the enormous suffering the victims have endured, and continue to endure, due to the very serious crimes we allege took place. VOA: Are further actions expected to be taken against others? ICC Prosecutor Khan: Yes, absolutely. When I announced the application for arrest warrants, I also informed the Rohingya community and stated more broadly that additional applications would follow. I believe this is necessary because the scale of the alleged criminality is vast. Many individuals may be involved, and we need to send a clear message that we follow the evidence. In relation to ongoing violations, people have a choice: they can either comply with the law or continue ignoring the rights of individuals and the principles of international law. If they choose the latter, we have the International Criminal Court, and we have jurisdiction because Bangladesh is a state party. VOA: How does the ICC address jurisdictional challenges, given that Min Aung Hlaing has rejected the ICC's jurisdiction, citing Myanmar's non-membership and opposing the application? ICC Prosecutor Khan: That's a great question. As you mentioned, Myanmar is not a state party to the Rome Statute and has not signed up. This means our jurisdiction is limited. However, our jurisdiction arises because its neighboring country, Bangladesh, is a state party. The judges of the International Criminal Court determined that when one of the elements of an offense takes place on the territory of a state party — like Bangladesh — we have jurisdiction. In this case, we have jurisdiction because Bangladesh is a state party, and we are alleging the crimes of persecution and deportation. Deportation involves the crossing of international borders into the territory of another state, in this case, Bangladesh. This is what gives rise to our jurisdiction in this case. VOA: You also highlighted the role of evidence from the Rohingya community and international partners. So how does this collaboration enhance your case’s credibility? ICC Prosecutor Khan: Well, that relationship is basic and fundamental. The Rohingya community has endured so much for many years -- from 1978 to 1991, in 1992, and, of course, during the events of 2016 and 2017. We have done as much as we can to build and strengthen bonds with the Rohingya community, both in Bangladesh and around the world. The Rohingya have been displaced and have fled to many other parts of the globe, so we’ve worked to build strong partnerships with states, state parties, non-state actors and civil society organizations. There have been tremendous hurdles because, despite their experiences and suffering, the Rohingya believe that the ICC can help bring justice and vindicate their rights. They have actively engaged in the International Court of Justice case brought by The Gambia and the OIC, and they’ve been very active in working with my team here at the Office of the Prosecutor. It’s important to remember their stamina, their determination, and their belief that justice is their birthright -- it’s key to everything we do. What was very touching when I visited the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox's Bazar was that the women I spoke with gave me a bag, and I shared a short video when I made the announcement. What they said was simple but profoundly deep: 'We belong to Myanmar. We, the Rohingya, belong to Myanmar. We want justice.' These hand-sewn letters with such powerful words send an important message, one that we amplify in our applications for arrest warrants, which we’ve now submitted to the independent judges of the International Criminal Court. We ask the Rohingya community to continue engaging with us and to remain patient, as they have. We still have a long way to go, but an important step has been taken by making these applications public. Now, we must wait and see what the judges do, while we continue our work on other matters. VOA: What message does this collaboration send to victims of atrocities around the world? ICC Prosecutor Khan: I think the main message is that the law exists, and it doesn't belong to prosecutors like me, judges of the court, or lawyers. Justice is the birthright of every baby, every woman and every man around the world. Justice is the birthright of the Rohingya, just as it is for people in Latin America, other parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East or Europe. It flows from being a member of the human race. This is a message to people with power, with guns, with weapons, and the ability to cause great harm: you don’t have a license to do whatever you want. You have an obligation to comply with minimum standards of behavior -- standards that prohibit genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. This is not only a message to the alleged perpetrators of the crimes we are investigating or applying warrants for. It’s a message to people in different parts of the world right now. If you think you are above the law because you have power, guns, men, resources, or civilians under your control, think again. The law is in force. The law must apply to all. We will do our part, along with our partners, to make the law stronger, more effective, and more comprehensive. We’ll do our best to ensure that it is applied more equally than it has been in the past. Achieving this requires a community of action. It requires partnerships and everyone — including your viewers and listeners — to realize that we cannot be mere spectators. Don’t leave it to the Office of the Prosecutor. Don’t leave it to the International Criminal Court alone. Raise your own voice and be defenders of humanity. If we all feel that we are our brother’s and sister’s keeper — that we are citizens of this beautiful planet — we can make a difference. But if we succumb to despair and despondency, we will witness more and more catastrophes around the world. The relevance of the law is clear as we see so many situations unraveling and worsening globally. This is an important message for your viewers: to join hands with people they may never meet, who are suffering from these blights of inhumanity in far too many places to count.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-prosecutor-to-myanmar-obey-international-law-or-face-justice/7897010.html	2024-12-10T18:56:31-08:00	
Trump’s signals hands-off Syria approach. Can he deliver?	Donald Trump has signaled he wants to avoid involvement in Syria following an insurgent group's ouster of President Bashar al-Assad. However, as White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara reports, the president-elect might need to balance his stance with U.S. goals of protecting Israel, isolating Iran, and dealing with Russia, Turkey and other actors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-signals-hands-off-syria-approach-can-he-deliver-/7896993.html	2024-12-10T18:30:34-08:00	
How US foreign policy is made	WASHINGTON — When most people think of U.S. foreign policy, they picture the president. The president, to be sure, is the nation's chief executive and its chief foreign policy architect. But he is not the only one calling the shots, and his power has limits. Consider what U.S. presidents can and cannot do. They can deploy the U.S. military around the world but cannot declare war — that power rests with Congress. They can enter into executive agreements with other countries but not treaties, which require Senate approval. They can establish ties with a foreign government but cannot send a dime's worth of aid without Congressional appropriation. Presidents often find their powers tested after they enter office. During his first term in office, then-President Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris agreement on climate change and a nuclear deal with Iran, but his campaign pledge to rein in North Korea's nuclear weapons program and end 'endless wars' in the Middle East remained unfulfilled. President Joe Biden's administration then rejoined the Paris agreement and pulled U.S. troops out of Afghanistan, but he failed to revive the Iran nuclear deal. 'There are limits to what a president can do and that is because of the number of actors that are involved and the number of checks and balances that do exist,' said David McKean, former director of policy planning for the State Department and staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who served as ambassador to Luxemburg. Historically, foreign policy was the president's domain, with significant Congressional input, according to Thomas Schwartz, a historian of U.S. foreign policy at Vanderbilt University. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the State Department was small, and the executive bureaucracy limited. As the U.S. grew in power in the 20th century, so did its foreign policymaking apparatus. 'Today's foreign policy machinery is enormous, committed to billions of dollars and thousands of persons involved, in the military, political, economic arms of the United States,' Schwartz told VOA. 'The one thing that probably is consistent is that the role of the president ... is now much more in the forefront.' A model of the U.S. foreign policymaking process, developed by the late political scientist Roger Hilsman, includes three circles: The inner circle: The president and his close advisers, including his national security adviser who usually heads National Security Council meetings The middle circle: Key executive branch departments and agencies – the departments of State and Defense, the military's high command, the intelligence community The outer circle: Congress and a variety of other actors, including interest groups, corporations, think tanks, foreign governments – all vying for influence 'There is no doubt that the institutional architecture of foreign policy has gotten much, much bigger,' McKean said. For example, the State Department, a small agency with 700 employees in the 1930s, has expanded to a 70,000-strong bureaucracy, McKean noted. The NSC The NSC is the nerve center of the foreign policymaking machinery. Created in 1947, the office, located next door to the White House, has expanded in size and scope. Its principal members include the president, the vice president, the secretaries of state and defense and other top officials. McKean calls this the 'president's own foreign policy team.' The national security adviser's influence has changed from administration to administration. However, the adviser, McKean said, has the ear of the president while the secretary of State is often traveling.' When a crisis erupts, such as the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, the NSC swings into action. To help the president decide on a course of action, the national security adviser calls an emergency 'principals meeting,' while NSC staff put together options for discussion. 'When you're dealing with an immediate crisis like Assad, you've got no time, you've got negative time,' said Gordon Adams, an emeritus professor of international relations at American University who served on the NSC in the 1990s. 'Cars have to pick up principles and whisk them to the White House, and those meetings start at any hour of the day or night and happen with great urgency.' Congress With the president in charge of foreign policy, a change in administration can result in significant policy shifts. But often there is more continuity than change. That is because the president is not the only actor shaping foreign policy. As a co-equal branch of government, Congress plays an important role. Though not given a specific role in foreign affairs, Congress can provide oversight of policy decisions and pass legislation to shape policy. Most importantly, Congress controls the budget, Adams said. This means it can influence how much money is spent on foreign aid, military operations and other international initiatives. For example, President-elect Trump has promised a mass deportation of undocumented migrants, but he'll need congressional funding to make it happen. 'Congress is going to have a voice in what the legislative term language is around that process and around the money that is actually appropriated for that process,' Adams said. Other actors As the foreign policy machinery has grown over the years, so too has the influence of outside actors. These include corporations, interest groups, think tanks, foreign governments, the media and the public. 'That is also an area where I think there's been a huge increase in influence so that corporations increasingly play a big role in foreign policy because so much of what goes on in terms of trade involves multinational corporations,' McKean said. Foreign allies can also influence U.S. foreign policy, though this varies from issue to issue and administration to administration, Adams said. He noted that in the 1990s, then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair persuaded a reluctant President Bill Clinton to intervene in the Balkans. With so many actors involved in the U.S. foreign policymaking process, the system can seem bewildering to policymakers in other Western democracies, Adams said. 'They don't have this kind of sloppy all-over-the-place set of display of interests and the ambitions and agendas that we have in the American policy process,' Adams said. 'So in a way, we have one of the least efficient policy processes of Western democracies.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-us-foreign-policy-is-made-/7896988.html	2024-12-10T18:20:05-08:00	
UN official: More political will needed to get aid to Palestinians	NEW YORK — The senior United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Gaza said Tuesday that the situation is 'utterly devastating,' and more political will is urgently needed to get enough aid to desperate Palestinians in Gaza. 'I have said this to the [Security] Council — there's no substitute, no system can and will substitute or compensate for an absence or lack of political will,' Sigrid Kaag said. 'This is political — political will and political choice. This you cannot ask of the U.N., of the humanitarians. This is where member states and the parties are at play.' Kaag spoke to reporters after a more than two-hour closed-door meeting with the U.N. Security Council about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. She said her office has constant engagement with the Israeli government at all levels. It has negotiated and organized supply routes from Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan and Israel. It has worked out technical and logistical systems. But getting lifesaving aid through crossing points is still not enough if it does not reach the people who need it. She said Palestinians in Gaza feel forgotten by the international community and are living between 'a little bit of hope and ultimate despair,' hoping for a ceasefire. Agencies face obstacles Aid agencies have said for months that they face severe access constraints due to Israeli restrictions and denials, and lawlessness and looting by armed Palestinians and desperate civilians. The situation is most severe in northern Gaza, which has been essentially cut off from aid for the past two months after Israel’s army relaunched an intense offensive to neutralize what it says are resurgent Hamas elements. Food security experts say famine is imminent in that part of Gaza. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Monday that the Israeli authorities denied the organization’s requests to bring food and water to the northern towns of Jabalya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya. The World Food Program said last week that barely any food had entered those three areas for more than 50 days. In central and southern Gaza, the situation is not significantly better. WFP said fresh food and meat are rare, and when available, prices are exorbitant. Kaag said the commercial sector needs to restart. 'But we cannot meet the needs of civilians in Gaza even through a humanitarian pipeline as much as it can be ramped up and scaled up without the commercial sector,' she said. 'It is simply not possible.' 15 bakeries remain closed On Tuesday, Dujarric told reporters that U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organizations are prioritizing flour distribution to families in the southern and central parts of Gaza, providing each family with a 25-kilogram sack of wheat flour as it becomes available. In central Gaza, he said a bag of wheat flour can cost as much as $280, and in the south around $245. Dujarric also said fuel was delivered to some bakeries on Friday and Sunday, allowing four to resume full capacity, but 15 others remain closed due to hostilities, flour shortages and safety concerns caused by overcrowding. On November 30, two girls and a woman died during a crowd surge at a WFP- supported bakery in Deir al Balah. The food agency said the tragedy highlighted the severe food shortages driving people into desperation and urged authorities to ensure secure conditions for aid delivery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7896977.html	2024-12-10T17:57:01-08:00	
Trump picks Andrew Ferguson to chair FTC	New York — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday tapped Federal Trade Commissioner Andrew Ferguson to lead the federal consumer protection and antitrust agency. Ferguson has said the agency should tackle perceived censorship of conservative viewpoints online. If social media platforms collaborate to suppress such views or advertisers coordinate to pull business from platforms such as Elon Musk's X, they should be charged with violating U.S. antitrust law, Ferguson has said. 'We must vigorously enforce the antitrust laws against any platforms found to be unlawfully limiting Americans' ability to exchange ideas freely and openly,' Ferguson said in a recent statement. The agency became a political flashpoint under FTC Chair Lina Khan, who promoted antitrust enforcement as a check on corporate power. Her efforts won fans among some Republicans, including Vice President-elect JD Vance, but drew criticism as overly aggressive from some antitrust lawyers and business groups. Her successor will inherit a full slate of cases against Big Tech companies, a lawsuit against the three largest pharmacy benefit managers, and at least a half dozen lawsuits by companies arguing it has outstripped its authority. It is unclear whether the incoming chair will continue with unfinished probes, including into practices at Microsoft that competitors have complained keep customers from switching to other cloud service providers, and potential privacy concerns involving OpenAI. New leadership could also shift course in two major FTC cases against Amazon.com. One takes aim at practices the agency says keep sellers bound to its platform and help Amazon unlawfully dominate the landscape for online marketplaces, and another targets practices allegedly meant to trick Prime subscribers out of canceling service. The new FTC chair would also oversee a case brought against Meta Platforms, then known as Facebook, in 2020, during Trump's first term. The agency is seeking to unwind its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp. But the judge overseeing the case has cast doubt on whether the agency can prevail at trial in April. Trump also picked Tom Barrack, a onetime private equity executive and fundraiser for the president-elect, to be U.S. ambassador to Turkey.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-picks-andrew-ferguson-to-chair-ftc/7896959.html	2024-12-10T16:56:24-08:00	
US moves to save once-common monarch butterflies from extinction	washington — The United States is moving to grant federal protections to the monarch butterfly — a once-common species recognizable by its striking black and orange patterns that has faced a dramatic population decline in recent decades. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) said Tuesday it has initiated a public comment period to consider listing the insect under the Endangered Species Act. But the looming presidency of Donald Trump, who rolled back numerous wildlife protections during his first term, casts uncertainty over the decision. 'The iconic monarch butterfly is cherished across North America, captivating children and adults throughout its fascinating lifecycle,' said FWS Director Martha Williams in a statement. 'Despite its fragility, it is remarkably resilient, like many things in nature when we just give them a chance.' The proposed listing comes at a critical time for the species, which has been designated as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature since 2022. Monarchs are divided into two migratory populations in North America. The larger eastern group has declined by approximately 80% since the 1980s, while the western population has plummeted by 95%. According to the FWS, the species faces a host of threats, including the loss and degradation of its breeding, migratory and overwintering habitats; exposure to insecticides; and the growing impacts of climate change. As part of its conservation efforts, the FWS is also recommending the designation of critical habitat at specific overwintering sites along California's coast. These habitats serve as vital winter refuges, providing monarchs the resources needed to rest and prepare for spring breeding. 'The fact that a butterfly as widespread and beloved as the monarch is now the face of the extinction crisis is a tri-national distress signal warning us to take better care of the environment that we all share,' said Tierra Curry, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. 'For 30 years, we've watched the population of monarch butterflies collapse. It is clear that monarchs cannot thrive — and might not survive — without federal protections,' added Dan Ritzman, director of conservation at Sierra Club. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is widely credited with saving iconic American species such as the gray wolf, bald eagle and grizzly bear. During Trump's first administration, however, key provisions of the law were weakened. These changes, later reversed by President Joe Biden, included measures that allowed industrial projects such as roads, pipelines and mines in areas designated as critical habitat for vulnerable species. Trump's administration also removed endangered species protections for gray wolves across most of the United States and slashed critical habitat designated for northern spotted owls.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7896958.html	2024-12-10T16:55:30-08:00	
US says review of Nippon-US Steel tie-up ongoing as US Steel shares tumble	A national security review of Nippon Steel's $15 billion bid for U.S. Steel is ongoing and President Joe Biden will see what it yields before making a decision on whether to block it, the White House said on Tuesday, cautioning he still opposes the tie-up. The statement comes after shares of U.S. Steel tumbled more than 10% on Tuesday afternoon following a Bloomberg report suggesting the deal would be killed in short order. CFIUS, a powerful committee charged with reviewing foreign investments in U.S. firms for national security risks, has until December 22 to make a decision on whether to approve, block or extend the timeline for the deal's review, Reuters has reported. 'The President's position since the beginning is that it is vital for U.S. Steel to be domestically owned and operated,' Saloni Sharma, a White House spokesperson said in a statement. 'As we have said before, the President will continue to see what the CFIUS process yields. We have not received any CFIUS recommendation. The CFIUS process was and remains ongoing.' Bloomberg's initial headline read that Biden was 'set to' block the deal, suggesting a final decision had been made, but the outlet later updated it to say he 'plans to' kill it, echoing prior comments and leaving the door open to a last-minute change. CFIUS declined to comment. Japan's Nippon Steel said it was inappropriate that politics continued to outweigh true national security interests. 'Nippon Steel still has confidence in the justice and fairness of America and its legal system, and — if necessary — will work with U.S. Steel to consider and take all available measures to reach a fair conclusion,' it added in a statement. U.S. Steel said the transaction should be approved on its merits. 'The benefits are overwhelmingly clear,' it said in a statement. 'Our communities, customers, investors, and employees strongly support this transaction, and we will continue to advocate for them and adherence to the rule of law.' The two companies are poised to pursue litigation over the process if Biden decides to block the merger. The acquisition has faced opposition within the U.S. since it was announced last year with both Biden and his incoming successor Donald Trump both publicly indicating their intention to block it. CFIUS told the two companies in September the deal would create national security risks because it could hurt the supply of steel needed for critical transportation, construction and agriculture projects. Despite opposition, including from the United Steelworkers union, Japan's Nippon has pressed on in pursuit of a deal, promising to not transfer any U.S. Steel production capacity or jobs outside the U.S. if the merger succeeds. Nippon has also said it would not interfere in any of U.S. Steel's decisions on trade matters, including decisions to pursue trade measures under U.S. law against unfair trade practices. In a bid to win over support from workers, Nippon Steel said on Tuesday it planned to give employees $5,000 each if the deal with U.S. Steel closed. It also pledged $3,160 closing bonuses to employees in Europe, which would result in a nearly $100 million total payment to employees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-review-of-nippon-us-steel-tie-up-ongoing-as-us-steel-shares-tumble/7896955.html	2024-12-10T16:44:33-08:00	
Syrian former prisoners speak out on Assad regime's collapse	As Syrians danced in the streets over President Bashar al-Assad's fall from power, Anwar Etnesh drove his car into the dense traffic clogging the route from his hometown Daraa north to Damascus. Hordes of Syrians like Etnesh were heading to Syria's capital to celebrate the end of the Assad family's rule. But Etnesh was on a mission to find his 55-year-old cousin, whom Assad soldiers arrested in Daraa 13 years ago during anti-government protests. He was never seen or heard from again. Since Assad fled to Russia, according to Russian state media, the militias who overthrew his rule, led by former al-Qaida affiliate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, have been freeing thousands of prisoners. 'I don't know if he's alive,' Etnesh relayed to VOA Mandarin by video call from Damascus. 'I went to the mosque at 7 a.m. and then have been from prison to prison to prison searching. Nine prisons so far. I don't even know what prison he's in.' He is one of the estimated nearly 137,000 Syrians whom rights groups say disappeared into military prisons during the civil war. The Britain-based Syrian Network for Human Rights says Syrian government interrogators have tortured more than 15,000 prisoners to death since 2011. 'What was our crime?' Basheer Mansour, who spoke to VOA Mandarin by phone messaging application and email, is one of the lucky prisoners who survived. He said that in 2011, regime soldiers opened fire on him and his university friends as they attempted to deliver critical medicine and food to Daraa residents living under a government siege. Mansour said two friends were shot to death beside him. He and other survivors were forced into trucks, blindfolded, beaten and corralled into a small toilet space where he said they were held captive and tortured with brutal beatings and sleep deprivation that left some prisoners dead. 'They used an electric rod in my abdominal area and whipped my head,' Mansour said. 'They removed fingernails and burned my body with cigarettes. I wished I would die just to get rid of the torment. They did many things I cannot to this day talk about. What was our crime?' The most extreme torture, said Mansour, was inflicted by hospital staff in a Damascus-area military prison, where he was admitted after suffering severe wounds inflicted during torture. He said he was blindfolded and handcuffed throughout his 10-day hospital stay. 'The last day at the hospital they removed the handcuffs from my hands and feet and asked me to move my legs,' Mansour recalled. 'I tried to move my legs and hands but couldn't. I couldn't move a single part of my body. I started to cry … and begged them to kill me because I did not want to live paralyzed. They took everything from me and stole my life and my future.' Soon after, his captors phoned his father to come get him, he said. 'Now we can go back' Today Mansour uses a wheelchair and lives in North Carolina, where he works at the airport and studies computer programming. He is closely following events unfolding in Syria. 'My family is scattered around the world,' he told VOA Mandarin. 'Some are in Germany, some in Holland, some in France and in Kuwait. I haven't seen them for 11 years. I would love to go back to Syria just to gather with them and see them. I'm happy the regime is gone. Now we can go back to Syria.' But returning to Syria may not be easy. The conglomerate of militias led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham on Tuesday announced an interim prime minister but have not yet made public their detailed plans for governance of Syria. Meanwhile, inside the country, locals — including those like Etnesh who are still looking for imprisoned relatives — are enjoying the new reality — a Syria without rule by Assad. 'I'm in shock. This is a dream. The regime is over. There aren't any Syrian troops anywhere. People are crying, they're happy. … It's disbelief,' Etnesh said. 'And we're all waiting for news of relatives. Most Syrians have someone they know in prison.' As of midday Monday in Damascus, Etnesh had not received any word on his cousin. He told VOA Mandarin he'll search for another week before returning home to Daraa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7896676.html	2024-12-10T16:40:55-08:00	
As climate change intensifies, vulnerable states seek legal redress against polluters	At a landmark hearing Tuesday on climate change law at the United Nation’s top court in The Hague, Britain argued that only existing climate treaties should have any bearing on a state’s obligations to address the crisis, echoing calls from other big economies. Small island states have told the court that global warming poses an existential risk, arguing that international human rights laws must apply, in addition to any negotiated climate agreements. Such an outcome could pave the way for compensation claims against big polluting nations. The hearing at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is one of several legal cases that has the potential to reframe global climate change negotiations. Some 99 countries are participating in the two-week hearing at the ICJ, making it the largest case in the court’s history. It has pitted small island nations against big polluters and fossil fuel producers. At the heart of the case is whether international law obliges nation states to prevent climate change and pay for the damage caused by their greenhouse gas emissions. Britain argued that the only legal obligations are derived from existing climate treaties such as the 2015 Paris Agreement, which set a target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 'The climate crisis can only be met by states working together,' British Attorney General Richard Hermer told the court on Tuesday. 'The most constructive, the most concrete, and thus the most legally effective way is through the legally binding agreements setting out states’ obligations to tackle the challenges of climate change. ... At the heart of the global response to climate change is the landmark Paris Agreement.' ‘Escape accountability’ Critics accused Britain of trying to avoid legal responsibilities. 'The United Kingdom laid out contemptuous arguments in front of the International Court of Justice with one key goal: escape accountability and responsibilities for decades of climate harms,' Sébastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Washington-based Center for International Environmental Law, said in a statement sent to VOA. 'By claiming that the Paris Agreement contains the sum total of States’ legal obligations on climate change, the U.K. effectively asked the Court to ignore both science and history: decades of fossil-fueled emissions, and the ample evidence that they knew far too well that such conduct would push the world to the brink of a catastrophe,' Duyck added. Island states Small island and coastal states, led by Vanuatu, have argued that rising sea levels caused by global warming threaten their existence — and therefore international human rights laws must be relevant, in addition to the binding agreements made in negotiated climate treaties. 'The conduct responsible for this existential harm cannot, I repeat, cannot be lawful under international law,' Vanuatu Attorney General Arnold Kiel Loughman told the court last week. The 15 judges will offer an advisory opinion that has the potential to reframe climate change negotiations, according to analyst Elena Kosolapova of the International Institute for Sustainable Development. 'The expectation is for the court’s advisory opinion to provide a clear legal benchmark and remove any ambiguity around countries’ obligations under international law. And U.N. negotiations would certainly benefit from legal clarity,' Kosolapova told VOA. Global hearings Scientists say climate change is driving extreme weather events around the world. That has put the spotlight on the rights of the communities affected. The ICJ hearing is one of three international courts asked to provide legal clarity on climate change. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights held hearings in Brazil and Barbados earlier this year and is expected to give its opinion on nation states’ legal obligations in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, judges at the Hamburg-based International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled in May that greenhouse gas emissions are subject to international law, and that all states are obliged to limit global warming and protect marine environments. 'If a state fails to comply with this obligation, international [legal] responsibility would be engaged for that state,' Judge Albert Hoffmann explained at the time of the ruling. Small island states praised that advisory opinion, claiming it gave teeth to climate change laws. The hearing at the ICJ is due to finish on Friday. The judges are expected to take several more weeks to issue their opinion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-climate-change-intensifies-vulnerable-states-seek-legal-redress-against-polluters-/7896942.html	2024-12-10T16:20:23-08:00	
Report on attempts to kill Trump urges Secret Service to limit protection of foreign leaders	washington — A congressional task force investigating the attempts to kill Donald Trump during his presidential campaign is recommending changes to the Secret Service, including protecting fewer foreign leaders during the height of election season and considering moving the agency out of the Homeland Security Department. The 180-page report by the bipartisan task force released Tuesday is one of the most detailed looks so far into the July assassination attempt against Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania and a second attempt in Florida two months later. Like the series of other investigations and reports, the task force railed at the agency tasked with protecting the top echelon of America's democratic leaders. 'The events of July 13, 2024, were tragic and preventable, and the litany of related security failures are unacceptable,' the authors wrote. 'The Secret Service's zero fail mission allows no margin for error, let alone for the many errors described in this report.' In the July shooting, a gunman opened fire from the roof of a nearby building, wounding Trump in the ear, killing one rallygoer and wounding two others. He was killed by a counter sniper. In another assassination attempt in September, a gunman waited for hours for Trump to appear at his golf course in Florida, but a Secret Service agent thwarted the attack by spotting the firearm poking through some bushes. Here are the highlights of the new report and its recommendations: Reducing the number of people protected — specifically foreign leaders The report's authors noted that the number of people the agency is tasked with protecting has 'greatly expanded.' At the same time, the presidential campaign season is getting longer and more intense. The agency is also tasked with protecting foreign dignitaries during the U.N. General Assembly, when heads of state and government flood into New York. That event happens every September, which comes at the 'height of campaign season,' the report noted, adding to the agency's staffing crunch. 'Congress, DHS, and the USSS should jointly consider the protective role the USSS plays for foreign leaders and consider whether such duties can be transferred or abrogated in order to focus on the USSS's primary duty: to protect the President and other critical U.S. leaders,' the report said. Drop some investigative work, especially during elections The Secret Service is known for its high-profile work of protecting the president, the vice president, presidential candidates, their families and others. But agents also carry out a wide range of investigations not related to their protective mission — investigating fraud and financial crimes, for example. Stemming from when the agency was part of the Treasury Department, those investigations are an important part of training Secret Service officers for skills they'll need on protective details, agency leaders say. But the task force recommended reviewing these investigative responsibilities — especially during campaign season — so the agency 'can prioritize the protection of U.S. leaders and candidates running for office.' Questioning whether the Secret Service should stay in the Homeland Security Department After DHS was created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Secret Service was moved there from the Treasury Department. The task force suggested reevaluating that move. During the time Secret Service has been in the Homeland Security Department, 'USSS has not benefited from stable leadership,' the lawmakers said. They said the structure 'potentially weakens USSS, a small but critically important agency, in advocating for its budget and other priorities inside a much larger entity.' Staffing problems The task force said the gunman in Butler, Pennsylvania, Thomas Crooks, exploited gaps in protection because of a lack of assets and staff. Specifically, the panel noted that the Secret Service, already dealing with the increased tempo of a presidential campaign, was protecting not one but two high-profile people that day in close vicinity to each other, with first lady Jill Biden at a nearby event. In one example highlighting the lack of resources at the Trump rally, the task force said there should have been a counter-surveillance unit in Butler, and if there had been one assigned that day, it might have spotted the shooter earlier. Such a counter-surveillance team was in place for the Biden event, the report noted, although that event was indoors. 'From interviews with special agents on the ground, it appears that the main factor in the decision to not request [the counter-surveillance unit] was an assumption that the request would be denied due to the protectee's status as a former President at the time of the event,' the report said. Pointing to bad communication, faulty planning Much of the criticism in the aftermath of the July assassination attempt has centered on how the shooter could have gotten access to a roof with a clear line of sight to Trump and why there was such poor communication between the Secret Service and local law enforcement. The Secret Service often relies on local law enforcement to secure large events. The report detailed how local law enforcement had one idea of its responsibilities while the Secret Service had another. But the task force emphasized that ultimately the Secret Service is responsible for ensuring that coordination runs smoothly. 'The Secret Service must own responsibility for the security of the site,' the report said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-on-attempts-to-kill-trump-urges-secret-service-to-limit-protection-of-foreign-leaders-/7896665.html	2024-12-10T15:21:09-08:00	
Suspect in killing of CEO struggles, shouts while entering courthouse	ALTOONA, PENNSYLVANIA — The suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO struggled with deputies and shouted while arriving for a court appearance Tuesday in Pennsylvania, a day after he was arrested at a McDonald's and charged with murder. Luigi Nicholas Mangione emerged from a patrol car, spun toward reporters and shouted something partly unintelligible referring to an 'insult to the intelligence of the American people' while deputies pushed him inside. Prosecutors were beginning to take steps to bring Mangione back to New York while new details emerged about his life and how he was captured. The 26-year-old Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland real estate family was charged with murder hours after he was arrested in the Manhattan killing of Brian Thompson, who led the largest U.S. medical insurance company. At the brief hearing, defense lawyer Thomas Dickey informed the court that Mangione will not waive extradition to New York but instead wants a hearing on the issue. Mangione was denied bail after prosecutors said he was too dangerous to be released. Mangione, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, mostly stared straight ahead at the hearing, occasionally consulting papers, rocking in his chair or looking back at the gallery. At one point, he began to speak to respond to the court discussion but was quieted by his lawyer. A law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press said that at the time of his arrest, Mangione was carrying a handwritten document expressing anger with what he called 'parasitic' health insurance companies and a disdain for corporate greed and power. He wrote that the U.S. has the most expensive health care system in the world and that profits of major corporations continue to rise while 'our life expectancy' does not, according to the bulletin. In social media posts, Mangione called 'Unabomber' Ted Kaczynski a 'political revolutionary,' according to the police bulletin. Kaczynski carried out a series of bombings while railing against modern society and technology. Mangione remained jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. Manhattan prosecutors have obtained an arrest warrant, a step that could help expedite his extradition from Pennsylvania. McDonald's customer recognizes suspect Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania — about 370 kilometers (about 230 miles) west of New York City — after a McDonald's customer recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said. Officers found him sitting at a back table, wearing a blue medical mask and looking at a laptop, according to a Pennsylvania police criminal complaint. He initially gave them a fake ID, but when an officer asked Mangione whether he'd been to New York recently, he 'became quiet and started to shake,' the complaint says. When he pulled his mask down at the officers' request, 'we knew that was our guy,' Officer Tyler Frye said. Images of Mangione released Tuesday by Pennsylvania State Police showed him pulling down his mask in the corner of the McDonald's while holding what appeared to be hash browns and wearing a winter jacket and beanie. In another photo from a holding cell, he stood unsmiling with rumpled hair. New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said Mangione was carrying a gun like the one used to kill Thompson and the same fake ID the suspected shooter had used to check into a New York hostel, along with a passport and other fraudulent IDs. New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Mangione also had a three-page, handwritten document that shows 'some ill will toward corporate America.' A law enforcement official who wasn't authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity said the document included a line in which Mangione claimed to have acted alone. 'To the Feds, I'll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn't working with anyone,' the document said, according to the official. It also had a line that said, 'I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming.' Thompson, 50, was killed last Wednesday as he walked alone to a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. Police quickly came to consider the shooting as a targeted attack by a gunman who appeared to wait for Thompson, came up behind him and fired a 9 mm pistol. Investigators have said 'delay,' 'deny' and 'depose' were written on ammunition found near Thompson's body. The words mimic 'delay, deny, defend,' a phrase used to criticize the insurance industry. From surveillance video, New York investigators determined the shooter quickly fled the city, likely by bus. Suspect's family prays for victim's family A grandson of a wealthy, self-made real estate developer and philanthropist, Mangione is a cousin of a current Maryland state legislator. Valedictorian at his elite Baltimore prep school, he went on to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer science in 2020 from the University of Pennsylvania, a spokesperson said. 'Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi's arrest,' Mangione's family said in a statement posted on social media late Monday by his cousin, Maryland Delegate Nino Mangione. 'We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved.' From January to June 2022, Luigi Mangione lived at Surfbreak, a 'co-living' space at the edge of touristy Waikiki in Honolulu. Like other residents of the shared penthouse catering to remote workers, Mangione underwent a background check, said Josiah Ryan, a spokesperson for owner and founder R.J. Martin. 'Luigi was just widely considered to be a great guy. There were no complaints,' Ryan said. 'There was no sign that might point to these alleged crimes they're saying he committed.' At Surfbreak, Martin learned Mangione had severe back pain from childhood that interfered with many aspects of his life, from surfing to romance, Ryan said. Mangione left Surfbreak to get surgery on the mainland, Ryan said, then later returned to Honolulu and rented an apartment. Martin stopped hearing from Mangione six months to a year ago.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7896650.html	2024-12-10T15:16:06-08:00	
Somali migrants recount ordeal of 16 days helpless, drifting at sea	In the early evening of November 11, after four days at sea, the passengers of two boats carrying 75 Somali migrants spotted distant lights and a hill. They could hear the muezzin calling for the Maghreb, Muslim evening prayers. Their destination, Mayotte, a French island in the Indian Ocean, was finally in sight. The lead skipper confirmed what they saw and heard — they were close to shore. However, he expressed a concern. He said he feared that gangsters on the beach might attack them. He decided to stop the boats and informed the passengers they would spend the night at sea and go ashore in the morning, according to a Swahili-speaking migrant who served as the interpreter. Little did the migrants know their journey, so close to a successful ending, was about to descend into unspeakable horror. The skippers, who were also human traffickers, had been with the passengers since November 7, when they set off in the two boats from a mothership anchored off Kenya’s southern coast, near Mombasa. The skippers’ role was to take Somalis on the final leg of their journey to Mayotte, the French island off the northwest coast of Madagascar that has recently become a magnet for asylum seekers hoping to reach Europe. However, the skippers were not happy with their compensation. The smuggler told the interpreter that he had been contracted to transport 40 people, but now there were 75. 'The money I was given is not enough,' he complained, according to boat passenger Luul Osman Mohamed, who overheard the conversation. The smuggler wanted the passengers to hand over more. Soon after, the smuggler briefly turned the boat’s engine on, revved it in the water, and then shut it off again, perhaps as a tease or a warning to the passengers. The other boat did the same. 'Sometimes they moved farther out to sea, and other times they came closer to shore,' Luul told VOA’s Horn of Africa Service. But after two rounds of this, she said, 'the engine on the other second boat broke down. Then, our engine failed too.' That night, the migrants and the two smugglers spent the night adrift on the two boats, just off the coast. One boat carried 37 people, mostly women and two children — a 2-year-old boy and an 8-year-old girl — while the second boat carried 38 passengers. November 12 Early the next morning, two men rendezvoused with the ships in a boat, seemingly responding to phone calls made by the smugglers. The first smuggler announced that he would leave with the men to repair his boat's engine. He never returned. The passengers and the second smuggler remained stranded. The two boats drifted aimlessly in the open sea under the scorching sun, with no shelter to protect them. Desperate to cool off, the passengers resorted to splashing seawater on themselves. November 13 The waves rocked the boats back and forth, but the passengers managed to sleep peacefully. One challenge, however, was that they couldn’t communicate with the second smuggler, as he spoke a language they didn’t understand. This became a minor issue compared to what lay ahead. The next morning, fishermen arrived and communicated with the second smuggler. Together, they managed to repair the engine on the second boat. They agreed the boat with the working engine would tow the other one, and it seemed to work at first. As the engine roared to life, they began moving — only in the wrong direction, further out to sea. For some reason, the skipper steered toward Comoros instead of Mayotte. They continued for three to five hours, Luul recalls, until the only working engine failed once again. 'After taking us deep into the sea, he took the navigation system with him and left on the fishing boat,' Luul said. The second skipper disappeared and never returned. 'When the smugglers were with us, we felt calm. They were with us, and whatever happened to them, we knew would happen to us,' said Anas Ibrahim Abdi, 21. Now, with both smugglers gone, the migrants were at the mercy of the sea and the elements. November 14 The 75 migrants drifted in the ocean. They had run out of the dates, fried chicken and bread they had received from the mothership a week earlier. The boats and the migrants were stranded in no-man’s sea, not knowing where to go — or how. Passengers tied the two boats together, to stay connected, says Luul. But when strong waves battered the vessels, they untied the ropes, fearing that if one boat were to sink, the other would go down, too. About six men who knew how to swim came over to the women’s boat, just in case there was an accident. Anas, who was in the first boat, moved the other way. 'My energy was low, I was sick. Because lots of people come on board, it was not balanced, so I moved to the other boat,' he says. For three days, the passengers tried to make the boats move, without success. During these days the first death occurred — a young man who was a diabetic. 'We read Fatiha for him. He died in an evening,' Anas said. Sometimes, the waves would bring the passengers close to land, only to drag them back to sea. After 10 days adrift, another passenger, a woman named Fatima, passed away. 'It was hot, she was hungry. She was sitting at the front. Her brother was with her. She was shocked for about two days before she died,' Luul said. The following day, another passenger died — the 2-year-old boy. 'We had milk for him. When we mix milk with sea water he refuses. When he sucks milk from his mother she faints, she finds it hard to breathe because she has not eaten. Later we started to mix milk with her urine... That kept him alive for two days,' says Luul. Days later the boy’s mother died, too. As one passenger after another died from hunger and thirst, others suffered hallucinations. Luul says her friend Fathi was one of them. 'She was saying this is Lido beach, let us get off the boat, let us take Bajaj [rickshaw],' she says. 'She was ripping off her clothes.' At times, a swarm of fish hit the boats. Inventive passengers used their sarongs to catch a few, giving them some welcome nutrition. 'We were also eating green grass, salty, that was brought by the waves from the beach,' Luul said. The only other protein came from a bird that came hovering over a body on the boat. It was caught and eaten too. November 23 On the first boat, 17 people died, 14 of them women. Ten others died on the second boat. One boy, realizing the boat was going nowhere, jumped into the water, confident in his ability to swim. He was seen swimming away, but moments later, the waves carried him in the opposite direction. He was never seen again. The last three days, as everyone lost energy, the boats moved swiftly, carried by strong winds. Rain gave the drifting migrants some desperately needed water, but most were losing hope of survival. Then, after a dark night with no moon, Anas recalls, 'At dawn, there was light, we saw the mountain and then a coastline.' Madagascar. After 16 days at sea, the migrants had finally reached land. The migrants were able to guide the boats close to shore and staggered onto the beach. Nearby fisherman shied away at first, Anas said. Then they saw the bodies in the boats. 'They were moved. They gave us water, rice and fruits,' Luul said. The fishermen made a phone call. Another boat came. They tied their boat to the migrants’ and pulled them onto the beach. 'They were good people, they helped us, they changed our clothes, they gave us warm water to get our energy,' Luul said. The migrants were transferred to authorities in Madagascar. Luul, the 31-year-old mother of five, was the only person from her family on the boat. She says she survived because 'everyone has their time to die' — and this wasn’t hers, although she felt it was close. 'I was thirsty, I was hungry; my voice has changed, the last day my throat was not opening, it was swollen. I had lots of spots, and from sitting on the boat. I was weak,' she said. Out of the 75 passengers, 47 survived the grim journey. The Somali Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on the social media platform X that it chartered a plane for the survivors, including Luul and Anas, and brought them back to Mogadishu on Saturday. This story originated in VOA’s Horn of Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-migrants-recount-ordeal-of-16-days-helpless-drifting-at-sea/7896601.html	2024-12-10T14:17:15-08:00	
US Treasury transfers $20 billion in Ukraine loan funds to World Bank	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday said it transferred the $20 billion U.S. portion of a $50 billion G7 loan for Ukraine to a World Bank intermediary fund for economic and financial aid. The Treasury Department said the disbursement makes good on its October commitment to match the European Union's commitment to provide $20 billion in aid backed by frozen Russian sovereign assets alongside smaller loans from Britain, Canada and Japan to help the Eastern European nation fight Russia's invasion. The disbursement prior to President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration in January is aimed at protecting the funds from being clawed back by his administration. Trump has complained that the United States is providing too much aid to Ukraine and said he will end the war quickly, without specifying how. The $50 billion in credit for 30 years will be serviced with the interest proceeds from some $300 billion in frozen Russian sovereign assets that have been immobilized since Russia invaded in February 2022. The Group of Seven democracies have been discussing the plan for months and agreed on terms in October, prior to Trump's election. President Joe Biden's administration initially sought to split the $20 billion loan in half, with $10 billion to be used for military aid and $10 billion for economic aid, but the military portion would have required approval by Congress, a task made more difficult by Republicans' sweeping election victory. With Tuesday's transfer, the full amount will be devoted to nonmilitary purposes. The Treasury said the funds were transferred to a new World Bank fund called the Facilitation of Resources to Invest in Strengthening Ukraine Financial Intermediary Fund. The global lender's board approved the creation of the fund in October with only one country, Russia, objecting. The bank, whose charter prevents it from handling any military aid, has run a similar humanitarian and economic intermediary fund for Afghanistan. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen personally oversaw staff executing the wire transfer of the $20 billion to the World Bank fund, a department official said. 'These funds — paid for by the windfall proceeds earned from Russia's own immobilized assets — will provide Ukraine a critical infusion of support as it defends its country against an unprovoked war of aggression,' Yellen said in a statement. 'The $50 billion collectively being provided by the G7 through this initiative will help ensure Ukraine has the resources it needs to sustain emergency services, hospitals and other foundations of its brave resistance,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-treasury-transfers-20-billion-in-ukraine-loan-funds-to-world-bank/7896569.html	2024-12-10T13:18:15-08:00	
Somali president, Ethiopian prime minister set talks over Somaliland	WASHINGTON — Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed are set to meet in person in Ankara, Turkey, Somali officials said Tuesday. Sources close to the Somali presidency confirmed the talks, telling VOA, 'Ethiopia requested the meeting, and the Somali president accepted.' The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said the meeting is scheduled to take place Wednesday. They added that Somalia's president arrived in Turkey at the invitation of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. There was no immediate confirmation of the meeting from Ethiopian officials. If the meeting occurs, it will be the first between the two leaders since Ethiopia and Somalia became embroiled in a dispute over a maritime agreement that Ethiopia signed with the breakaway republic of Somaliland on January 1. The agreement grants Ethiopia access to a 20-kilometer stretch of Red Sea coastline near the Gulf of Aden in return for potential recognition of Somaliland's independence. The Somali government has called the agreement illegal and a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Mogadishu sees Somaliland as a part of Somalia. Ethiopia maintains that it does not infringe on Somalia's sovereignty. Somaliland is a self-governing territory that declared independence in 1991 but has yet to win international recognition. Somalia is expecting all Ethiopian troops to leave the country by the end of this month as the mandate of an African Union Transition Mission in Somalia expires. Previous attempts In July and August, two rounds of talks between Ethiopia and Somalia, mediated by Turkey, failed to solve the dispute over Somaliland, with Somalia demanding Ethiopia withdraw from the deal. The issue has raised fears of fresh conflict in the Horn of Africa region. In September, Mohamud rejected an offer to meet with Abiy while they were attending a forum on China-Africa cooperation in Beijing, according to diplomatic sources. They say the Somali president made the meeting conditional on Ethiopia first withdrawing from the agreement it signed with Somaliland. The presidents of Djibouti and Mauritania, along with former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was the special envoy to the African Union, tried to arrange a meeting, but were unsuccessful. Additionally, an attempt by the Kenyan government to bring the two leaders together failed. Kenyan President William Ruto recently said that he and the president of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, were willing to mediate between Somalia and Ethiopia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-president-ethiopian-prime-minister-set-talks-over-somaliland-/7896554.html	2024-12-10T13:05:19-08:00	
Syria post-Assad: Alawite minority faces uncertainty under Islamist rebel control	Washington — Calls are mounting around the world to safeguard Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities following the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime by Islamist rebels. Concerns particularly focus on the future of the Alawite community, a sect from which the Assad family originates. The swift offensive that led to the capture of Damascus was headed by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, and other Turkish-backed Islamist rebels. HTS, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, has pledged to respect the rights of Alawites and other ethnic and religious minorities. Rights groups note that these promises have largely been upheld so far. However, concerns persist that once the rebels solidify their control over the country, they may turn against the Alawite community because of its perceived ties to the former Syrian regime. Members of the Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, make up about 10% of Syria’s population of 24 million people and are primarily concentrated in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus, but a significant number of Alawites also reside in Damascus and Homs. Since coming to power in 1970, the Assad dynasty heavily relied on Alawites, who came to fill many high-ranking military and intelligence positions. Anwar al-Bunni, a prominent Syrian human rights lawyer, told VOA that decades of brutal rule under Bashar’s father, Hafez al-Assad, created 'severe tensions and even mobilization toward the Alawite community.' Bunni, however, said recent statements by HTS chief Abu Mohammad al-Golani have been well-received among the Alawites. Golani told CNN on Friday, 'No one has the right to erase another group. These sects have coexisted in this region for hundreds of years, and no one has the right to eliminate them.' 'Alawite community leaders have also said positive things after the fall of the regime, but it is still the beginning,' Bunni said. 'They might have a different position when the process of accountability and transitional justice starts.' Bunni noted that the real test for the Alawite stance would be when officials of the former regime are brought to justice for their crimes against civilians. 'Whether the Alawite community leadership supports future accountability initiatives could ultimately determine how other Syrians will view them in the context of a democratic and free Syria,' he said. Dozens of prominent figures from Qardaha, Assad’s hometown in Latakia province, issued a statement Monday declaring their support for the new rulers in Damascus and pledged full cooperation. Shortly after, videos posted on social media showed statues of Assad being removed from Qardaha. A resident in Latakia told VOA that a meeting took place Monday in Qardaha between rebel delegates and Alawite community leaders. An Alawite activist, who requested anonymity for security reasons, confirmed the meeting, noting that it has been received positively among the local community. 'It is important for both sides to keep meeting in order to create an environment of trust,' the activist said. 'Not all Alawites supported the former regime, and Syrians elsewhere need to understand this.' David Adesnik, vice president of research at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said HTS understands the importance of projecting an image of moderation. 'A key question is whether HTS considers Assad’s identity as an Alawite to be a cause of his extreme brutality. If not, there is little reason to blame the Alawite community and take vengeance,' he told VOA. 'In contrast, HTS and other rebels clearly see Assad’s enduring alliances with Russia and Iran as inherently problematic.' Adesnik also noted that 'HTS and others may find it difficult to ever trust the Alawite community or individual Alawite leaders, but marginalizing them may be sufficient to address such concerns, rather than resorting to violence.' There have been some voices within the Alawite community calling for the establishment of an autonomous region along Syria’s coast. But the Latakia-based activist said such calls were not serious. Adesnik said autonomy for Alawites was not a likely option, adding, 'The coast in particular is strategic terrain because it provides access to the Mediterranean. 'Granting special privileges to the Alawites would also open the door for numerous other minorities to seek special arrangements, which undermine the ability of Damascus to exert control,' he said. 'Some arrangement with the Kurdish region may be inevitable, but I doubt any Syrian government would want to replicate it elsewhere.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-post-assad-alawite-minority-faces-uncertainty-under-islamist-rebel-control/7896499.html	2024-12-10T12:29:27-08:00	
Biden designates national monument at site of Carlisle Indian school	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden has created a new national monument on the grounds of a former Indian boarding school in Pennsylvania, which served as the blueprint for hundreds of similar institutions across the United States. 'I want everyone to know,' Biden said. 'I don't want people forgetting, 10, 20, 30, 50 years from now.' Indian children from 140 tribes were taken from their families, tribes and homelands and forced to spend years at the school in the borough of Carlisle, he noted. 'It was wrong, and by making the Carlisle Indian School a national monument, we make clear that [that's] what great nations do. We don't erase history. We acknowledge it. We learn from and we remember, so we never repeat it again.' Biden told the 2024 Tribal Nations Summit in Washington Monday that the monument will encompass 10 hectares (24.5 acres) inside what is today the Carlisle Army Barracks, including historic buildings and structures that once made up the school’s campus. These will include the brick and marble gateposts at the school’s entrance, which Carlisle students built by hand in 1910. The U.S. Army will maintain operational control over the site, which is now home to the U.S. Army War College. The Army will collaborate with the National Park Service to oversee the planning and management of the new national monument, consulting with federally recognized tribes to ensure that the monument accurately reflects historic and contemporary impacts of the boarding school system on tribal members and communities. 'This addition to the national park system that recognizes the troubled history of U.S. and Tribal relations is among the giant steps taken in recent years to honor Tribal sovereignty and recognize the ongoing needs of Native communities, repair past damage and make progress toward healing,' said National Park Service Director Chuck Sams, a citizen of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Northeast Oregon. The announcement comes just six weeks after Biden’s visit to the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona. There, he gave a long-awaited apology to Native Americans for the boarding school era, calling it 'one the most consequential things I've ever had an opportunity to do in my whole career as president of the United States.' Earlier Monday, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland opened the summit with a speech focusing on the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative she launched in May 2021. The initiative resulted in a two-volume report that documented the history of the school system, accounting for 417 known schools and confirming more than 900 child deaths. The initiative also included The Road to Healing, in which Haaland and Assistant Interior Secretary Bryan Newland traveled to 12 Native communities, giving survivors and their descendants an opportunity to share their boarding school experiences. 'So many of you spoke bravely and forthright[ly] … about the horrors you endured or the trauma that was passed down over generations. Those stories must continue to be told,' Haaland told the summit leaders. As part of the initiative, the Interior Department engaged the National Native Boarding School Healing Coalition to conduct video interviews with boarding school survivors to create a permanent oral history collection. Haaland announced that the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History will partner to preserve their accounts for the public.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-designates-national-monument-at-site-of-carlisle-indian-school/7896427.html	2024-12-10T12:26:25-08:00

Judge could permanently halt Trump's hush money case while upholding his conviction	Prosecutors are urging a judge not to throw out President-elect Donald Trump's hush money criminal conviction but suggesting a willingness to end the case in a way that would preserve the verdict while avoiding punishment or a protracted legal fight. In court papers made public on Tuesday, the Manhattan district attorney's office proposed an array of options for keeping the historic conviction on the books, including asking Judge Juan M. Merchan to consider treating the case the way he would when a defendant dies. That would effectively put the case into a permanent state of suspended animation. Trump's conviction would stand, but everything would freeze, including any appeal action. It is unclear if that option is viable under New York law. 'As applied here, this Court could similarly terminate the criminal proceeding by placing a notation in the record that the jury verdict removed the presumption of innocence; that defendant was never sentenced; and that his conviction was neither affirmed nor reversed on appeal because of presidential immunity,' prosecutors wrote in an 82-page filing. Among the other options prosecutors proposed was delaying sentencing until after Trump leaves office in 2029. However, they were adamant that the conviction should stand, arguing that Trump's impending return to the White House should not upend a jury's finding. The filing expands on the position the prosecutors laid out last month. Since then, Trump's lawyers have pressed Merchan to dismiss the case altogether in light of his election. The Trump team argues that letting the case continue would present unconstitutional 'disruptions' to his upcoming presidential term. The attorneys also cited President Joe Biden's recent pardon of his son Hunter Biden, who had been convicted of tax and gun charges. Biden complained that his son was unfairly prosecuted for political reasons — and Trump's lawyers say he was, too. It's unclear how soon Merchan may decide what to do next with the case. Trump, a Republican, takes office Jan. 20. He had been scheduled for sentencing late last month. But following Trump's Nov. 5 election victory, Merchan halted proceedings and indefinitely postponed the former and future president's sentencing so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the case. Merchan also delayed a decision on Trump's prior bid to dismiss the case on immunity grounds. Trump has been fighting for months to reverse his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors said he fudged the documents to conceal a $130,000 payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to suppress her claim that they had sex a decade earlier. He says they did not and denies any wrongdoing. Trump portrays the case as a political attack ginned up by D.A. Alvin Bragg and other Democrats. A dismissal would erase Trump's historic conviction, sparing him the cloud of a criminal record and possible prison sentence. Trump is the first former president to be convicted of a crime and the first convicted criminal to be elected to the office. Merchan could also decide to uphold the verdict and proceed to sentencing, delay the case until Trump leaves office, wait until a federal appeals court rules on Trump's parallel effort to get the case moved out of state court or choose some other option. The hush money case was the only one of Trump's four criminal indictments to go to trial. Since the election, special counsel Jack Smith has ended his two federal cases, which pertained to Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss and allegations that he hoarded classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. A separate state election interference case in Fulton County, Georgia, is largely on hold. Trump denies wrongdoing in all.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-could-permanently-halt-trump-s-hush-money-case-while-upholding-his-conviction-/7896479.html	2024-12-10T12:17:34-08:00	
UN digital program seeks to empower Africa's public workers	NAIROBI, KENYA — The United Nations, Microsoft and Kenya’s Ministry of Information last week launched a digital and artificial intelligence center in Nairobi to train African public servants and accelerate the development and use of online services. Officials said the program — the Timbuktoo GreenTech Hub and Africa Centre for Competence for AI and Digital Skilling — aims to improve the skills of 100,000 government workers. U.N. Development Program Regional Director Ahunna Eziakonwa said at the launch that better digital skills and resources will enable Africa to achieve technological progress. 'An inclusive public sector digital transformation drives efficiency and effectiveness and helps governments to enhance coordination of resources and information and strengthen data and code policymaking and implementation,' she said. Kenyan President William Ruto said that more than 20,000 government services can be accessed online and that the digital transformation has made government work easier. 'This will help us streamline public service delivery and enhance transparency and efficiency, minimize opportunities for corruption and maximize visibility and mobilization of public revenue,' he said. 'The transformative impact of this single initiative on citizens' experience in accessing public services, along with the government's capacity to effectively manage public resources, clearly illustrates the immense value of digital transformation.' Governance experts say digital services offered online have improved citizens' trust in public services and made the work of government employees faster, more accurate and more transparent. However, the frequent power and internet blackouts that plague some African countries sometimes force government workers to resort to traditional paper and file systems. Some workers have little experience with computers and feel that online glitches are slowing them down. Michael Niyitegeka, team leader at Refactory, a software academy in Uganda that prepares youth for global tech work, said authorities must push workers to use the technology. 'Leadership has to be extremely firm in knowing how they want to use these technologies and invest in ensuring that people are working with it,' Niyitegeka said. 'We need to work on the entire system so the citizens can be brought to speed, and different users of these technologies as we are building need to be brought on board so that we are building together,' he said. 'Otherwise, it will probably become a white elephant.'

With Assad out, Turkey steps up assault on Syria’s Kurds	Following the ouster of Bashar al-Assad, a Turkish-backed Syrian militia is moving against Kurdish forces of the YPG in Syria, which the U.S. supports.

Sub-Saharan officials say reducing fish imports creates local jobs	Yaounde, Cameroon — Officials in Sub-Saharan Africa countries have agreed it is important to reduce over-dependence on imported fish and seafood from North Africa and the European Union and instead they should strive to cultivate fish-farming, which will create jobs for unemployed youth. The officials, meeting in Cameroon, said their goal is to invest some of what they collectively spend on importing fish each year, and put that funding into developing local fish farms. They hope to re-direct to local fish farmers a large amount of the $7 billion spent annually on importing seafood. Fish farmer Tanyi Hubert demonstrates how every day he catches and sells at least 10 kilograms of fresh fish from his pond in Nkolbisson, a neighborhood in Cameroon's capital, Yaounde. He told government officials from 12 African countries, who were in Cameroon on Monday, that he makes at least $40 each day since he started selling fish one year ago from his riverside fish pond, in which he farms fish. Hubert said he is one of several hundred youths the government of Cameroon trained, and provided financial assistance of about $4,000 each, to begin a fish farming business. Eta Collins Ayuk is the director of the Limbe National Institute of Fisheries and Aquaculture created by the government of Cameroon to train fish farmers. He said several hundred unemployed Cameroonians who have received training in fish farming are today supplying fish to local markets and raising enough money to take care of their families. 'The catch we get from the wild is rapidly declining and the only way to ensure fish and fish products availability for local consumption should be through the farming of fish, which is aquaculture. We train people to create jobs. We don't train people to go and search for employment,' said Collins. Eta said efficient local fish farming will reduce the large amounts of money Cameroon spends each year on importing fish from North Africa and Europe. The government of this central African country says it has spent about $200 million in 2024, to import 60% of the 550,000 tons of fish and seafood it needs this year to feed its 30 million civilians. Officials and fish farmers from Sub-Saharan African countries meeting in Yaounde on Monday said Africa alone accounts for close to 13% of the world's total fish imports. The continent spends close to $7 billion to import fish and seafood from Europe and North African countries, including Morocco, Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia, officials said. Olodayo Ganiyu, chief executive officer of Aquapet Ventures, a Nigerian company that promotes local fish farming, said it is unfortunate that, despite its huge potential of abundant natural resources including oceans, rivers, lakes, waterways and coasts, Africa still spends huge sums of money to import fish. 'We [Nigeria] import thousands of tons of fish every year, that cost us $1.2 billion. Now the government of my country is encouraging so many people to come into fish farming. A time will come in Nigeria when you will not see any imported fish again. Many people are now encouraged to invest more in aquaculture so that the scarce dollars used in importation of frozen fish into the country will be channeled into health, education and other infrastructure,' he said. Olodayo said participants at the Yaounde meeting this week agreed to try to guide their countries to soon invest about 60% of the money they normally use to import fish, to instead pursue local fish farming development and production. The plan aims to create jobs for African youths who, due to widespread poverty and joblessness, are leaving their countries to seek work in Europe. The participants said Africa has over 30,000 kilometers of untapped coastline to gradually expand the fishing industry, which has the potential to drive economic growth, ensuring food security and creating jobs. Cameroon’s livestock minister, who goes by only one name, Taiga, said the African Continental Free Trade Area, alongside global initiatives, has prepared a blueprint for Africa to use its vast fishing resources to fight hunger and propel development. Taiga said Cameroon and Sub-Saharan countries will succeed to stop the importation of fish and seafood from North Africa and Europe, just as they succeeded to stop the importation of frozen chicken and pork from developed countries. He said the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development is presently assisting African countries to produce fish locally and reduce dependence on imports. Taiga spoke on Cameroon state TV. He said African nations are fighting to stop illegal fishing on their coastal waters but did not say how. The United Nations reports that Africa this year accounted for 13.1 million tons of fisheries and aquaculture production, which is six percent of the world’s annual total. At the conference Monday, officials said they hope that by 2026, some 60% of money they use to import fish will be invested in local production.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sub-saharan-officials-say-reducing-fish-imports-creates-local-jobs/7896428.html	2024-12-10T11:42:47-08:00

Syrian minorities want say in country's future	Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities, long repressed under President Bashar al-Assad’s leadership, say they hope for inclusion in political decision-making on the war-ravaged country’s future. Bassam Said Ishak, president of the Syriac National Council of Syria, is calling for what he calls inclusive negotiations. His organization, based in northeast Syria, aims to defend the rights of Christians and all minorities in a post-Assad government in the hope of building a new Syria that is democratic, secular, and pluralistic with equal rights for all citizens. 'I would like to see real negotiations in Syria over a new constitution because the rebels said they want to start such negotiations. What I mean by real negotiations is that nobody is excluded,' Ishak said. 'All groups who have a say about the future of Syria and have their own concerns, visions, and hopes to sit and voice what’s on their hearts and minds without intervening from outside powers to decide who can sit or not sit in these negotiations.' Meanwhile, Sheikh Hikmat Al-Hijri, the spiritual leader of Syria’s Druze community, issued a statement urging all Syrians to maintain vigilance, saying 'the journey ahead is long and the battle is not over.' He said his group is calling on 'everyone to protect both public and private property as a national and moral duty, prevent acts of vandalism and block any attempt to undermine security and stability in Sweida.' Mazloum Abdi is commander of Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led armed group that includes Christian fighters instrumental in taking down Islamic State militants. He expressed hope in a new leadership. 'This change presents an opportunity to build a new Syria based on democracy and justice that guarantees the rights of all Syrians,' he said in a statement. The rebel offensive begun on November 27, led by Abu Mohammed al-Golani’s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, ended the five-decade rule of the Assad government characterized by violent suppression to crush dissent. The U.S. and other countries designated HTS a terrorist group because it was once part of al-Qaida, but the Islamist group has since broken away and appears to have moderated its stance. Since its takeover of Aleppo and other areas, it announced that it would protect Syria’s minority populations. But that might not be the case with other rebel groups. Nadine Maenza, president of the Washington-based International Religious Freedom Secretariat, said she received eyewitness accounts of atrocities committed against a dozen Syrian religious and ethnic minorities in recent days in the Shebha region outside of Aleppo. She will present the concerns in a report to the U.S. Congress. 'Our concern is for the safety of all religious and ethnic minorities,' Maenza said. 'With the track record of both HTS and the Turkish-backed militias having a history of severe religious violations against these groups. Atrocities are continuing against Kurds, Yazidis, Christians, and other religious minorities, but particularly we are seeing them from the Turkish-backed Islamist militias.' Julien Barnes-Dacey, director of the European Council of Foreign Relations Middle East program, said, concerns are already emerging about what comes next in Syria with fears about the HTS and the prospect of new chaos, violence and fragmentation amid a possible contested transition. 'There are also concerns that the conflict between Turkey and Syrian Kurds could give ISIS new space to exploit,' Barnes-Dacey said, in a written statement. But he added that 'the biggest hope should lie in the agency of Syrians themselves.' 'They, more than any outsiders, long for a stabilizing transition, having already internalized the cost of conflict,' he wrote. Assad’s brute force against pro-democracy demonstrations in 2011 ignited a 13-year civil war along sectarian lines resulting in 500,000 Syrian deaths and the displacement of half of Syria’s pre-war population of 23 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-minorities-want-say-in-country-s-future/7896410.html	2024-12-10T11:29:29-08:00

VOA Russian: Chechen wars and the formation of the political model of the Russian state	December 11th will mark 30 years since the beginning of the First Chechen war. The initial Russian assault on Chechnya signaled not just the start of a merciless conflict that killed tens of thousands of civilians in Chechnya, but also the end of Russia’s liberal dream. As Russia’s first war after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the First Chechen war served as a prologue to other conflicts unleashed by the Kremlin, including the war in Ukraine. The bloody campaign continued with varying success until the end of August 1996, followed by Second Chechen war, which cemented Russian President Vladimir Putin’s power. Experts spoke to VOA Russian on the lessons of the Chechen wars and their tragic consequences for Russian democracy.

Belarus says it has dozens of Russian nukes, is ready for new missile	MOSCOW — Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko said Tuesday his country is hosting dozens of Russian nuclear weapons and will prepare facilities for the planned deployment of Moscow's newest hypersonic ballistic missile. His remarks came after he and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a treaty last week that gave security guarantees to Belarus, Moscow's closest ally, including the possible use of nuclear weapons to help repel any aggression. The pact follows Moscow's revision of its nuclear doctrine, which for the first time placed Belarus under the Russian nuclear umbrella amid the tensions with the West over the conflict in Ukraine. 'I have warned all my enemies, 'friends' and adversaries: If you step on the border, the answer will be momentary,' Lukashenko said. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for over 30 years and has relied on Kremlin subsidies and support, allowed Russia to use his country's territory to send troops into neighboring Ukraine in 2022 and to host some of its tactical nuclear weapons. Unlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful. Russia hasn't disclosed how many, but Lukashenko said Tuesday that his country currently has several dozen of them. 'I have brought nuclear warheads here, and not just a single dozen of them,' Lukashenko said in an apparent reference to the tactical weapons, adding that the West failed to track their deployment. 'They haven't even noticed when we brought them here,' he said. Earlier this year, Russian and Belarusian militaries held joint nuclear drills. They involved Belarus' Russia-supplied Iskander short-range ballistic missiles that can be fitted with nuclear warheads and warplanes equipped to carry nuclear bombs. The deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly if Moscow decides to use them. It also extends Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe. During the signing of the security pact on December 6, Lukashenko asked Putin to deploy more advanced weapons in Belarus, including the Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile that Russia used for the first time last month against Ukraine. Putin responded that Oreshnik missiles could be deployed to Belarus in the second half of 2025, adding that they will remain under Russian control but that Moscow will allow Minsk to select the targets. 'We will determine targets for them here in Belarus, not the Russians,' Lukashenko said Tuesday. 'And we will push the button together if needed, God forbid.' He noted that Belarus has about 30 facilities for nuclear-capable ballistic missiles left over from the Cold War era, when it was part of the USSR and hosted Soviet nuclear weapons. He added that a Belarus manufactures the large vehicles that serve as mobile launchers for Russian ballistic missiles, including Oreshnik. Putin has hailed Oreshnik's capability, saying its multiple warheads that plunge to a target at Mach 10 are immune from interception and are so powerful that the use of several of them in one conventional strike could be as devastating as a nuclear attack. Speaking Tuesday, Putin charged that 'a sufficient number of these advanced weapon systems simply makes the use of nuclear weapons almost unnecessary.' Russia's missile forces chief declared that the missile, which can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, has a range allowing it to reach all of Europe. The revamped nuclear doctrine that Putin signed last month formally lowered the threshold for Russia's use of its nuclear weapons, a move that follows U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russian territory with American-supplied longer-range missiles. The doctrine says Moscow could use nuclear weapons 'in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction' against Russia or its allies, as well as 'in the event of aggression' against Russia and Belarus with conventional weapons that threaten 'their sovereignty and/or territorial integrity.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/belarus-says-it-has-dozens-of-russian-nukes-is-ready-for-new-missile/7896357.html	2024-12-10T10:57:32-08:00

Syrian rebels who overthrew Assad name interim government leader	The Syrian rebels who overthrew longtime iron-fisted ruler Bashar al-Assad on Tuesday appointed a transitional head of government to run the country until March 1. After a cabinet meeting in Damascus of rebel leaders and ousted officials from Assad’s government, Mohammed al-Bashir, a figure little known across most of Syria who previously ran an administration in a small pocket of the northwest controlled by rebels, said he was picked to lead the interim government. 'The meeting was under the headline of transferring the files and institutions to caretake the government,' Bashir said. He stood in front of two flags: the green, black and white flag flown by opponents of Assad throughout the civil war, and a white flag with the Islamic oath of faith in black writing, typically flown in Syria by Sunni Islamist fighters. There was some sense of normalcy returning to the Syrian capital, with a notable decrease in the number of armed people on the streets. Sources close to the rebels said commanders had ordered fighters to withdraw from cities and for police and internal security forces affiliated with the main rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, to deploy instead. Banks and shops reopened for the first time since Assad's overthrow on Sunday and his flight to asylum in Russia. Traffic returned to the roads, construction workers were back fixing a roundabout in the Damascus city center and street cleaners swept roadways. The signs of Middle East conflict remained, however. Israel launched airstrikes against Syrian army bases, whose forces had melted away in the face of the lightning rebel advance that ousted Assad over a two-week period. Israel sent forces across the border into a demilitarized zone inside Syria, saying its airstrikes were aimed at keeping weapons from falling into hostile hands. It denied reports that its forces had advanced beyond the buffer zone into the countryside southwest of Damascus. Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the Islamist leader who headed the offensive that forced Assad out, vowed to pursue former senior government officials responsible for torture and war crimes. 'Rewards will be offered to those who will provide information about senior army and security officers involved in war crimes,' Golani said in a statement. The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham he leads is rooted in Syria's al-Qaida branch and is designated by many Western governments as a terrorist organization, though it has sought to moderate its rhetoric. Geir Pedersen, the United Nations envoy for Syria, said in Geneva that the groups that forced Assad to flee must transform their 'good messages' into actions on the ground. 'They have been sending messages of unity, of inclusiveness,' Pedersen said, adding that in Aleppo and Hama, 'we have also seen ... reassuring things on the ground.' But 'what we need not to see is of course that the good statements and what we are seeing on the ground at the beginning, that this is not followed up in practice in the days and the weeks ahead of us.' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement, 'The United States reaffirms its full support for a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition. This transition process should lead to credible, inclusive, and non-sectarian governance that meets international standards of transparency and accountability.' 'The Syrian people will decide the future of Syria,' the top U.S. diplomat said. 'All nations should pledge to support an inclusive and transparent process and refrain from external interference.' A German government statement late Monday said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the end of the Assad regime, and said they are 'prepared to work together with the new rulers on the basis of fundamental human rights and the protection of ethnic and religious minorities.' Scholz and Macron emphasized the importance of maintaining Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the statement said. The United Nations has expressed concerns about Israel’s deployment of troops across a demilitarized buffer zone in the Golan Heights, which Israel says is necessary to protect its own security. U.N. envoy Pederson said Tuesday that the world body is continuing to see Israeli movements and bombardments into Syrian territory. 'This needs to stop,' Pederson said. Israeli troops were on the Syrian side of the buffer zone Tuesday, about 25 kilometers southwest of Damascus, according to several security sources cited by Reuters and the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Avichay Adraee said reports that Israeli forces were approaching Damascus were incorrect. He said Israeli troops were located inside the buffer zone and at defensive points close to the border. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday that Israeli forces had struck suspected chemical weapons sites as well as long-range rockets as part of an effort to prevent them from ending up in the possession of hostile actors. Saudi Arabia condemned Israel’s actions in Syria, saying in a statement Tuesday that they violate international law and 'sabotage Syria’s chances of restoring its security, stability and territorial integrity.' Some material in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-rebels-who-overthrew-assad-name-interim-government-leader/7896304.html	2024-12-10T10:19:32-08:00	
Homes burn in California as wind-driven wildfire prompts evacuations	MALIBU, CALIFORNIA — Thousands of Southern California residents were under evacuation orders and warnings Tuesday as firefighters battled a wind-driven wildfire in Malibu that burned near seaside mansions and Pepperdine University, where students sheltering at the school's library watched as the blaze intensified and the sky turned deep red. A 'minimal number' of homes burned, but the exact number wasn't immediately known, Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony Marrone said. More than 8,100 homes and other structures were under threat, including more than 2,000 where residents have been ordered to evacuate. Some 6,000 more people were warned to be prepared to evacuate at a moment's notice. Ryan Song, a resident assistant at Pepperdine University, said he first noticed the power went out at his dorm late Monday and then looked out the window and saw a huge pink glow. 'I thought, ‘This is too bright,’ and it got bigger and bigger,' the 20-year-old junior said. 'I immediately went outside and saw that it was a real fire.' Song and the other resident assistants went door to door, evacuating students. Most were calm and followed instructions, he said; a few who were scared rushed to their cars to get off campus. Song spent the next few hours racing back and forth in the dark between his dorm and the main campus to ensure no one was left behind as fire raged down a mountain, he said. 'It felt really close,' he said, adding he was probably less than a mile away. 'Seeing the fire rampaging down the hill is obviously scary for students, but I felt like our staff was prepared.' The university later said the worst of the fire had pushed past campus. It was not immediately known how the blaze, named the Franklin Fire, started. County officials estimated that more than 9 square kilometers of trees and dry brush had burned. There was no containment. The fire burned amid dangerous conditions because of notorious Santa Ana winds expected to last into Wednesday. Marrone said at least a thousand firefighters would be scrambling to get a handle on the blaze before 2 p.m., when winds were expected to regain strength. 'Time is of the essence for us to grab ahold of the fire and start getting some containment,' the chief said at a morning news conference. The fire erupted shortly before 11 p.m. Tuesday and swiftly moved south, jumping over the famous Pacific Coast Highway and extending all the way to the ocean, where large homes line the beach and inland canyons are notoriously fire prone. At one point, it threatened the historic Malibu Pier, but the structure was protected and is intact, officials said. Pepperdine canceled classes and finals for the day and there was a shelter-in-place order on campus. Helicopters dropped water collected from lakes in the school's Alumni Park onto the flames. Firefighters with flashlights and hoses protected nearby homes overnight, ABC 7 reported. As the sun came up Tuesday, smoke billowed over the campus and the adjacent mountains that plunge toward the coast. North to northeast winds were forecast to increase to 48 to 64 kph with gusts up to 105 kph expected, the National Weather Service's office for Los Angeles posted on social media platform X. Power to about 40,000 customers had been shut off by Monday night, including 11,000 in Los Angeles County, as Southern California Edison worked to mitigate the impacts of the Santa Ana winds, whose strong gusts can damage electrical equipment and spark wildfires. Email and phone messages were left with Edison inquiring whether electricity had been turned off in Malibu before the fire started. The Woolsey Fire that roared through Malibu in 2018, killing three people and destroying 1,600 homes, was sparked by Edison equipment. Santa Anas are dry, warm and gusty northeast winds that blow from the interior of Southern California toward the coast and offshore. They typically occur during the fall months and continue through winter and into early spring.	https://www.voanews.com/a/homes-burn-in-california-as-wind-driven-wildfire-prompts-evacuations/7896280.html	2024-12-10T10:00:59-08:00	
US Justice Department ignored some policies when seizing reporters' phone records, watchdog finds	WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors sidestepped some Justice Department rules when they seized the phone records of reporters as part of media leak investigations during the Trump administration, according to a new watchdog report being released as the aggressive practice of hunting for journalists' sources could again be resurrected. The report Tuesday from the Justice Department inspector general's office also found that some congressional staffers had their records obtained by prosecutors by sheer virtue of the fact that they had accessed classified information despite that being part of their job responsibilities. Though the report chronicles Justice Department actions from several years ago, the issue has new resonance as President-elect Donald Trump's pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, has spoken of his desire to 'come after' members of the media 'who lied about American citizens' and his belief that the federal government should be rid of 'conspirators' against Trump. Those comments raise the possibility that the Justice Department under new leadership — Trump has picked former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi to serve as his attorney general — could undo a three-year-old policy that, with limited exceptions, prohibits prosecutors from secretly seizing reporters' phone records during investigations into leaks of sensitive information. The action from Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2021 followed an uproar over revelations that the Justice Department during the Trump administration had obtained records belonging to journalists at The Washington Post, CNN and The New York Times as part of investigations into who had disclosed government secrets related to the investigation into Russian election interference and other national security matters. The inspector general found that the Justice Department didn't follow certain department rules that had been implemented years earlier when seeking reporters' records in 2020, including having a News Media Review Committee review the request, according to the report. The committee is meant to ensure that officials other than prosecutors, including the head of the department's office of public affairs, are able to weigh in on such efforts. Then-Attorney General William Barr, who authorized obtaining the records from CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post, did not expressly sign off on the use of non-disclosure agreements that were sought — as was required under department policy, according to the report. The Justice Department also seized data from the accounts of some Democratic members of Congress over leaks related to the Russia investigation, and sought records through Apple from then-White House counsel Don McGahn. The department went after records of two members of Congress and 43 congressional staffers, according to the report. The inspector general found no evidence of 'retaliatory or political motivation by the career prosecutors' who initiated the requests. The staffers were considered suspects in most cases merely because of the close proximity between the time they accessed classified material as part of their job responsibilities and the publication of news articles containing secret information, according to the report. Garland's new policy laid out several scenarios under which the Justice Department still could obtain reporters' records, including if the reporters are suspected of working for agents of a foreign power or terrorist organizations, if they are under investigation for unrelated activities or if they obtained their information through criminal methods like breaking and entering. The Justice Department during both Democratic and Republican leadership has struggled with how to balance its determination to protect press freedom and its determination to safeguard national security secrets. President Barack Obama's first attorney general, Eric Holder, announced revised guidelines for leak investigations after an outcry over actions seen as aggressively intrusive into press freedom, including the secret seizure of phone records of Associated Press reporters and editors. And Jeff Sessions, Trump's first attorney general, announced in 2017 a leak crackdown following a series of disclosures during the investigation into Russian election interference.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-justice-department-ignored-some-policies-when-seizing-reporters-phone-records-watchdog-finds/7896172.html	2024-12-10T09:07:04-08:00	
Pakistan's ex-spy chief indicted on political interference, other charges	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan’s military said Tuesday that the former head of the country’s main intelligence agency has been charged with multiple criminal offenses, including political interference, during ongoing court-martial proceedings. The announcement was made four months after Faiz Hamid, a former lieutenant general, was taken into custody by military authorities to undergo an investigation and legal proceedings. The military’s media wing reported that Hamid, who formerly led the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, or ISI, 'has been formally arraigned on charges of engaging in political activities, violations of the Official Secrets Act … misuse of authority and government resources.' The charges carry a potential prison sentence of up to 14 years. The statement noted the former ISI chief is also being investigated in connection with the May 2023 attacks on Pakistani military properties and installations, which officials blamed on supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan. Hamid 'is being afforded with all legal rights as per the law,' the military stated. It was not possible to contact the detainee for comment, as is the case with other suspects in military custody. Hamid served as director general of the ISI from 2019 to 2021, when Khan was in power. In April 2022, the cricket star-turned-prime minister was ousted through an opposition vote of no-confidence in parliament. Khan said his desire to retain Hamid as ISI chief for an extended period had strained his relations with then-military chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, eventually leading to the fall of his government. The 72-year-old deposed Pakistani leader accused Bajwa of orchestrating his ouster, charges the former army chief rejected. Khan has been in jail since August 2023 and faces dozens of criminal charges he says are orchestrated by the military to keep him from returning to power. Army officials deny the charges. The arrest and subsequent court-martial proceedings of an ISI chief or a high-profile officer are unprecedented in Pakistan, where the military has staged three coups against elected governments and ruled the country for more than three decades since it gained independence in 1947. Khan and his predecessors assert that generals retain influence over government affairs even when not in power and orchestrate the removal of elected prime ministers who fall out with the military. Maleeha Lodhi, a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington and the United Nations, echoed those claims in an article published in the Dawn newspaper on Monday. She suggested that the military’s role in civilian matters has increased since Khan's removal. 'The past two years have seen a decisive shift in the civil-military power balance in the latter’s favor, with its role in governance even extending to economic policy,' Lodhi stated. 'This is unprecedented even by the country’s past record of the military’s sway over government affairs. … Pakistan’s democratic future and prospects of political stability are clouded by increasing autocratization,' she added. In a nationally televised address to families of fallen soldiers just days before stepping down from office, Bajwa acknowledged that the military had been meddling in national politics for decades. Addressing growing public criticism of the institution, the former Pakistani army chief said, ''I believe the major reason has been the military’s interference in politics for the past 70 years, which is unconstitutional.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-s-ex-spy-chief-indicted-on-political-interference-other-charges/7896160.html	2024-12-10T09:05:33-08:00	
South Korea's ex-defense minister formally arrested over martial law imposition	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A former South Korean defense minister was formally arrested Wednesday over his alleged collusion with President Yoon Suk Yeol and others in imposing martial law last week, as authorities investigate whether their acts amount to rebellion. Martial law, the first in more than 40 years, lasted only about six hours but has triggered a domestic firestorm and large street protests. Yoon and his associates face criminal investigations and impeachment attempts. The Justice Ministry has banned Yoon and eight others from leaving the country as authorities see them as key suspects in the martial law case. It's the first time that a sitting president in South Korea has received a travel ban. The Seoul Central District Court said it approved an arrest warrant for former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun on charges of rebellion and abuse of power. Kim has been detained since Sunday. Prosecutors have up to 20 days to determine whether to indict him. A conviction on the charge of rebellion carries a maximum death sentence. Kim became the first person arrested over the case. He has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber and unanimously rejected Yoon's decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on Dec. 4. Kim said in a statement Tuesday that he 'deeply apologizes for causing significant anxiety and inconvenience.' He said all responsibility for the imposition of martial law rests solely with him and pleaded for leniency for soldiers deployed to enforce it, saying they were only following his order. Prosecutors reportedly accuse Kim of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power by staging a riot to disrupt the constitution in collaboration with Yoon and other military and police officers. Prosecutors' offices in Seoul couldn't immediately confirm the reports. The opposition-controlled parliament passed a bill Tuesday to appoint an independent special counsel to investigate Yoon and other top military officials over the martial law introduction. The main opposition Democratic Party had advocated for a special counsel investigation, arguing that public prosecutors cannot be trusted to conduct a thorough investigation of Yoon, a former prosecutor-general. During a parliamentary hearing Tuesday, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command whose troops were sent to parliament, testified that he received direct instructions from Kim Yong Hyun to obstruct lawmakers from entering the National Assembly's main chamber. Kwak said the purpose of Kim's instructions was to prevent the 300-member parliament from gathering the 150 votes necessary to overturn Yoon's martial law order. Kwak said Yoon later called him directly and asked for the troops to 'quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.' Kwak said he discussed Yoon's order with the commander at the scene and that they concluded there was nothing that could be done, ruling out the possibility of threatening the lawmakers by shooting blanks or cutting off electricity. At the same hearing, senior officer Kim Dae-woo of the military's counterintelligence agency said his commander, Yeo In-hyung, asked him if an army bunker in Seoul had space to detain politicians and other figures after martial law was imposed. Yeo is considered a close associate of Kim Yong Hyun. Last week, Hong Jang-won, a deputy director of the country's spy agency, said Yoon ordered him to help Yeo's command to detain some of his political rivals but he ignored the president's order. Kwak and Yeo are among those who face opposition-raised rebellion charges along with Yoon and Kim, and the Defense Ministry suspended them last week. Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during 'wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states' and South Korea wasn't in such a situation. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the South Korean Constitution doesn't allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation. In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed a need to rebuild the country by eliminating 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces,' a reference to his liberal rivals who control parliament. Yoon avoided impeachment on Saturday after most governing party lawmakers boycotted a floor vote in the National Assembly. The Democratic Party said it would prepare for a new vote on Yoon's impeachment on Saturday. The party on Tuesday submitted motions to impeach Yoon's police chief and justice minister as well. It pushed to impeach Kim Yong Hyun and the safety minister, but they resigned before parliament took a vote. If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If it voted for removal, a new presidential election would be required.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-ex-defense-minister-formally-arrested-over-martial-law-imposition/7896101.html	2024-12-10T08:50:47-08:00	
US sanctions Chinese cybersecurity firm for 'malicious' activities	WASHINGTON — The United States slapped sanctions on a Chinese cybersecurity company and one of its employees Tuesday, accusing it of compromising more than 80,000 firewalls in a 2020 attack. The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement that it had sanctioned Sichuan Silence Information Technology Company and an employee named Guan Tianfeng over the April 2020 attack, which targeted firewalls around the world, including critical infrastructure in the U.S. Over a three-day period, Guan exploited a vulnerability in a firewall product and proceeded to deploy malware against some 81,000 businesses around the world with the aim of stealing data, including usernames and passwords, while also attempting to infect the computers with ransomware, according to the Treasury Department. More than 23,000 firewalls were in the United States, of which 36 were protecting 'critical infrastructure companies' systems,' the Treasury said. 'Today's action underscores our commitment to exposing these malicious cyber activities ... and to holding the actors behind them accountable for their schemes,' Bradley Smith, Treasury acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. The Treasury, he said, 'will continue to leverage our tools to disrupt attempts by malicious cyber actors to undermine our critical infrastructure.' Alongside the sanctions, the Department of Justice has also unsealed an indictment against Guan and announced a reward of up to $10 million for information about the employee or company, according to the Treasury Department.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sanctions-chinese-cybersecurity-firm-for-malicious-activities/7896129.html	2024-12-10T08:35:55-08:00	
Taiwan says China has launched biggest maritime operation in decades	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Defense officials in Taiwan say China has deployed nearly 90 naval and coast guard vessels in waters stretching from islands in the south of Japan to the South China Sea. The deployment is the largest to regional waters in almost three decades, Taiwanese officials say, and part of what appears to be a military exercise. China has not yet commented on the movements or confirmed it is conducting exercises. Speaking at a regular press briefing on Tuesday, Taiwanese defense officials said Beijing’s operation is not only targeting Taipei but aimed at demonstrating its ability to prevent regional countries, including Japan and the Philippines, from coming to the island’s defense. 'The current scale is the largest compared to the previous four [Chinese war games],' Taiwanese Defense Ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang told journalists at the press conference. China claims democratically ruled Taiwan is part of its territory and has not ruled out the possibility of using force to achieve its goal of reunification. There is little to no support for unification with authoritarian China in Taiwan. Sun said the exercises were the largest since war games were held around the island in response to its first presidential elections in 1996. In recent days, Taiwan’s defense ministry said it has detected 21 Chinese vessels and 47 Chinese military aircraft operating in the immediate vicinity of the island. Hsieh Jih-sheng, a senior intelligence officer at Taiwan’s defense ministry, told journalists at the same press conference that China’s broader maritime deployment is aimed at blocking forces from Japan and the Philippines from coming to Taiwan’s aid in a potential Chinese military attack against the island. In addition to honing its capabilities to deny access to a broad swath around the island, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said China is also forming two 'walls' in the western Pacific, deploying large numbers of vessels to the eastern end of Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone and an area further out in the Pacific. Air defense identification zones are unilaterally established by a country’s air defense forces and are not underpinned by international treaty or law. 'With these two walls, they are sending a clear message: The Taiwan Strait is their internal waters, and cross-strait issues should be handled by the People's Liberation Army [PLA] and the People's Republic of China,' Taiwanese defense official Hsieh told journalists. Taiwan has been preparing for a potential Chinese military exercise around the island since President Lai Ching-te set off on his first overseas trip to the Pacific region, which included stopovers in the U.S. territory of Guam and state of Hawaii, on November 30. Throughout the trip, Taipei repeatedly warned about China potentially launching a new round of military drills near the island and urged Beijing not to 'send the wrong signals.' When asked about the movements of Chinese vessels on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning did not provide additional details. 'The Taiwan question is China’s internal affair. China will firmly defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,' she said during the regular press conference. One Chinese analyst, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue, told VOA that it is hard to say why Beijing hasn’t publicly announced any maritime operations around Taiwan. J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow with the Global Taiwan Institute, said Beijing may want to 'keep the Taiwanese side guessing' by not announcing its planned military operations. 'Telegraphing one’s intentions only goes so far. Beijing may want to be more flexible and less predictable than it has been in the past,' he told VOA in written response. Stephen Nagy, a professor of politics and international studies at Tokyo’s International Christian University, said maintaining ambiguity makes it difficult for Taiwan and regional countries to respond to Chinese military operations in the region. 'Ambiguity creates challenges for Taiwan and neighboring stakeholders, such as Japan, the United States and the Philippines, to know what the Chinese are doing and what’s the best way to respond,' he told VOA in a phone interview. Despite the lack of clarity from Beijing, Cole in Taipei said the Taiwanese government’s efforts to 'proactively' disclose Chinese military activities in the region help to bring more international attention to the threats and pressure that democratically ruled Taiwan faces from China. 'Such public diplomacy makes the threat more palpable and turns an abstract concept into something that is real and that people can relate to,' he told VOA. On Monday, Taiwan launched a series of war-preparedness drills at strategic locations across the island and publicized information about the unannounced Chinese military operations. Those moves, Taiwanese experts say, have helped Taipei create an intelligence deterrence against Beijing. 'By swiftly disclosing Chinese military operations in the region and initiating its own countermeasures, Taiwan is trying to deter China from further escalating its military activities around the island,' Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research, told VOA by phone. While Taiwan has adopted some countermeasures, some analysts say Beijing is also 'routinizing' its coercion against Taipei by maintaining a constant military presence across the region. 'The People’s Liberation [Army] and Chinese coast guard are so big that they can maintain a constant presence near Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan at the same time,' said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and a former Pentagon official. 'Military operators may have a difficult time discerning when an attack is actually coming when every day looks like an attack,' he told VOA by phone. Nagy in Japan said as the United States prepares for a change in administrations over the next few weeks, he expects China to ramp up pressure against Taiwan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-says-china-has-launched-biggest-maritime-operation-in-decades/7896051.html	2024-12-10T08:34:30-08:00	
France flies 2 fighter jets from Chad to signal start of military withdrawal	PARIS — France flew out the two Mirage fighter jets it had stationed in Chad on Tuesday, signaling the beginning of the withdrawal of its military forces from the former French colony in Central Africa that last month broke off its defense cooperation agreement with Paris. The pair of Mirage 2000-D fighters took off after midday from a French base in the capital, N'Djamena, after Chadian military forces came to wish them farewell, and were returning to a French air force base in Nancy, in eastern France, French military spokesman Colonel Guillaume Vernet said. He added that negotiations with Chadian authorities were continuing on how and when France might withdraw other members of its 1,000-strong force in Chad, and whether all or just some of them will leave. In announcing the end of the defense cooperation agreement with France last month, the Chadian government described the decision as a historic turning point for the country that gained independence in 1960 and said that it would enable Chad to redefine its strategic partnerships in line with national priorities. Chad was one of the last countries in the region in which France maintained a large military presence, having been ousted in recent years from Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso after years of fighting Islamic extremists alongside regional troops. Those countries have inched closer to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel, the vast expanse below the Sahara Desert. Chadian authorities didn't specify when French troops must leave and said the end of the defense agreement in no way calls into question the countries' historical ties. They said they want to maintain relations in other areas of common interest. Last week, hundreds of people marched in N'Djamena to call for the withdrawal of French troops, chanting 'Chad for us, France out!' Some held banners that read, 'We do not want to see a single French person in Chad.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-flies-2-fighter-jets-from-chad-to-signal-start-of-military-withdrawal/7896073.html	2024-12-10T08:05:11-08:00	
New generation must take up fight against nuclear weapons, Nobel laureate group says	OSLO, NORWAY — Young people must take up the fight for a nuclear-free world, with such weapons many times more powerful than in the past, a representative for this year's Nobel Peace Prize laureate, an atomic bomb survivors' group, said Tuesday. Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots movement of survivors of the 1945 nuclear bombings of Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is campaigning for a world free of nuclear weapons using witness testimony. The average age of Japan's atomic bomb survivors is now 85, Terumi Tanaka, a co-chair of the group, said when accepting the prize at a ceremony held at Oslo City Hall attended by Norway's King Harald, Queen Sonja and other dignitaries. 'Any one of you could become either a victim or a perpetrator, at any time,' Tanaka, 92, told the audience. 'Ten years from now, there may only be a handful of us able to give testimony as firsthand survivors. From now on, I hope that the next generation will find ways to build on our efforts and develop the movement even further.' His group had 'undoubtedly' played a major role in creating the worldwide standard that it was unacceptable to use atomic weapons, or 'nuclear taboo,' he said. But that standard was being weakened, he added. 'In addition to the civilian casualties, I am infinitely saddened and angered that the 'nuclear taboo' risks being broken,' he said. Threats to use nuclear weapons have been made in the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Tanaka said, warning that 4,000 nuclear warheads were ready to be launched immediately around the world. Nihon Hidankyo was also represented at the ceremony by its two other co-chairs, Shigemitsu Tanaka, 84, and Toshiyuki Mimaki, 82. An estimated 210,000 people died, either immediately or over time, as a result of the bombs dropped in 1945 on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and August 9, respectively. Today's nuclear weapons are far more powerful than those used at that time. Tanaka was 13 years old at the time of the Nagasaki bombing, and although he survived the explosion almost unharmed at his home some 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) from ground zero, he lost five family members and recalled harrowing encounters. 'The deaths I witnessed at that time could hardly be described as human deaths. There were hundreds of people suffering in agony, unable to receive any kind of medical attention,' Tanaka told the audience. 'I strongly felt that even in war, such killing and maiming must never be allowed to happen.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-generation-must-take-up-fight-against-nuclear-weapons-nobel-laureate-group-says/7896005.html	2024-12-10T07:18:19-08:00	
Netanyahu assails media as he testifies for first time in corruption trial	TEL AVIV, ISRAEL — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the witness stand for the first time on Tuesday in his long-running corruption trial, saying he was being hounded for his hawkish security policies. Netanyahu, 75, is Israel's first sitting prime minister to be charged with a crime. He is testifying at the same time Israel is engaged in a war in Gaza and facing possible new threats posed by regional turmoil, including in Syria. Last week judges ruled that Netanyahu, indicted in 2019, must testify three times a week, forcing the longtime Israeli leader to juggle between the courtroom and the war room at Israel's Defense Ministry, minutes away from the courthouse. The leader of the right-wing Likud party, Netanyahu assailed the Israeli media for what he called its leftist stance and accused journalists of having hounded him for years because his policies did not align with a push for a Palestinian state. 'I have been waiting for eight years for this moment to tell the truth,' Netanyahu told the three-judge court. 'But I am also a prime minister. … I am leading the country through a seven-front war. And I think the two can be done in parallel.' Prosecutors accuse Netanyahu of granting regulatory favors worth about $500 million to Bezeq Telecom Israel in return for positive coverage of himself and his wife, Sara, on a news website controlled by the company's former chairman. He is also accused of negotiating a deal with the owner of Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper for better coverage in return for legislation to slow the growth of a rival paper. Netanyahu denies the allegations against him and has pleaded not guilty. He stood rather than sat in the witness box throughout his morning testimony. 'Had I wanted good coverage, all I would have had to have done would be to signal toward a two-state solution. ... Had I moved two steps to the left, I would have been hailed,' he said. In lengthy replies, he portrayed himself as a staunch defender of Israel’s security, withstanding pressures from international powers and a hostile domestic media. Netanyahu smiled confidently when he entered the Tel Aviv District Court around 10 a.m. The trial was moved from Jerusalem for undisclosed security reasons and convened in an underground courtroom. Before Netanyahu took the stand, his lawyer Amit Hadad laid out for the judges what the defense maintains are fundamental flaws in the investigation. Prosecutors, Hadad said, 'weren't investigating a crime, they were going after a person.' A few dozen protesters gathered outside the courthouse, some of them supporters and others demanding he do more to negotiate the release of some 100 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza. Israel has been waging war in Gaza against the Palestinian militant group for more than a year, during which Netanyahu had been granted a delay for the start of his court appearances. But last Thursday, judges ruled that he must start testifying. Charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu will testify three times a week, the court said, despite the Gaza war and possible new threats posed by wider Middle East turmoil. In the run-up to his court date, Netanyahu revived familiar prewar rhetoric against law enforcement, describing investigations against him as a witch hunt. He denies the charges and has pleaded not guilty. Before the war, Netanyahu's legal troubles bitterly divided Israelis and shook Israeli politics through five rounds of elections. His government's bid last year to curb the powers of the judiciary further polarized Israelis. The shock Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and the ensuing Gaza war swept Netanyahu's trial off the public agenda as Israelis came together in grief and trauma. But as the war dragged on, political unity crumbled. In recent weeks, while fighting abated on one front after Israel reached a ceasefire with Hamas' Lebanese ally Hezbollah, members of Netanyahu's cabinet, including his justice and police ministers, have clashed with the judiciary. His domestic legal woes were compounded last month when the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him and former defense chief Yoav Gallant, along with a Hamas leader, for alleged war crimes in the Gaza conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-assails-media-as-he-testifies-for-first-time-in-corruption-trial/7895981.html	2024-12-10T06:59:34-08:00	
Analysts urge Ghana's new president to manage expectations amid economic challenges	Accra, Ghana — Ghana's Electoral Commission declared former president and opposition leader John Mahama the president-elect Monday following Saturday’s general elections. His return to power sparked mixed reactions, with some celebrating a fresh start and others questioning his ability to address Ghana’s economic challenges. Supporters of Ghana’s opposition party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC), took to the streets of Accra chanting songs of victory to celebrate Mahama’s reelection. For Jeremiah Maclean, a staunch NDC supporter, his win was nothing short of monumental. 'This is an overwhelming victory, and we are really excited. The good people of Ghana have shown the exit way to the NPP for mismanaging the economy,' he said, referring to the New Patriotic Party of defeated President Nana Akufo-Addo. However, for Alexander Bonsu, a disappointed voter and supporter of the New Patriotic NPP, Mahama's return to power raises serious concerns. 'He was once the president of Ghana, and we saw what he did. We saw how bad the economy was, we saw how he canceled the nursing trainees’ allowances,' he said. For Bonsu, Mahama’s track record leaves little hope for the future. 'Someone who has cost me before, I will find it very difficult to give him another chance,' he added. Yet, NDC supporter Maclean remains optimistic. 'They have voted for a visionary leader, they have voted for a man that will change the fortunes of this country, they have voted for a man that will reset this country,' he said. Ghana’s Electoral Commission tally gave Mahama 56% of the vote. Analysts attribute his win to widespread discontent with the ruling government’s handling of the economy. Dr. Kwame Asah-Asante, a political analyst at the University of Ghana, believes the election results reflect deep-seated frustrations. 'It is a manifestation of the fact that there was a lot of mistrust that people had, the hopelessness with which people viewed the political and economic system that has existed so far,' he said. Mahama’s presidency from 2012 to 2017 left a mixed legacy. According to analyst Jonathan Asante Okyere, while Mahama was credited for infrastructure projects and inclusivity, he struggled with Ghana’s energy crisis. 'We had issues of power fluctuation, power instability but he was able to solve it before he left. Unfortunately, the ordinary citizen did not see that as a kind gesture, so they had to punish him at the polls.' he said. As Mahama prepares to take office, Asante Okyere cautions that the road ahead will be steep, given the nation’s economic challenges. 'The people have a high expectation of his promises,' he said. 'That for me will be the challenge that he is likely to face. If you look at the mess that we find ourselves in, especially as we are not able to service our debts, it feels like there are even deeper cracks than what meets the eye.' For many Ghanaians, the hope is that Mahama’s administration will stabilize the economy and create opportunities in the face of rising inflation and unemployment. Analysts have called for him to cut government expenditures and manage the country’s debt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-urge-ghana-s-new-president-to-manage-expectations-amid-economic-challenges/7895941.html	2024-12-10T06:24:34-08:00	
UN: Taliban's legitimacy hinges on respect for human rights in Afghanistan	Islamabad — The United Nations reported Tuesday that women and girls are bearing the brunt of a persistent 'dangerous erosion' of human rights in Afghanistan, attributing the crisis to an 'intentional failure' of the country’s radical Taliban leaders. 'With authority comes responsibility,' said Roza Otunbayeva, the head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, or UNAMA, referencing the August 2021 return of the formerly insurgent Taliban to power. 'The claim of the de facto authorities to be legitimate representatives of the Afghan people within the United Nations must be accompanied by genuine efforts to uphold and advance our shared norms and values,' she stated. The UNAMA statement, released in connection with International Human Rights Day, asserted that the human rights record of the Taliban had been particularly marked by their 'systematic discrimination' against Afghan women and girls. The Taliban government, which is not yet formally recognized by any country, has barred Afghan women from almost all aspects of every day and public life. Girls are banned from receiving education beyond the sixth grade, and most workplaces are not allowed to employ female staff except for a few sectors, such as health, police, and immigration. Women cannot undertake road or air trips unless accompanied by a male guardian. The restrictions stem from dozens of decrees the reclusive Taliban supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, has issued over the last three years based on his strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as Sharia. Tuesday’s statement reminded the Taliban that Afghanistan endorsed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly, on December 10, 1948. 'If Afghans, in particular women and girls, continue to be denied their rights, this constitutes a clear and intentional failure to protect and be responsible for the well-being of all who live in Afghanistan,' said Fiona Frazer, the country representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. Taliban leaders have ignored repeated U.N.-led international calls for them to reverse their sweeping curbs on women, saying their governance is in line with Sharia. The U.N. has repeatedly declined requests from the de facto Afghan authorities to represent the country due to their restrictions on women. Earlier this month, Afghan public health ministry authorities abruptly ordered medical institutions to stop enrolling female students nationwide, citing a new edict released by Akhundzada. The move has effectively closed one of the last available avenues for girls to seek higher education. The edict has drawn a global backlash and calls for its immediate reversal amid warnings it would leave millions of women without female nurses and midwives in a country where the Taliban have barred male doctors from treating female patients. The U.N. has warned the latest ban would exacerbate a deepening humanitarian crisis and health challenges facing poverty-stricken Afghanistan, reeling from years of war and natural disasters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-taliban-s-legitimacy-hinges-on-respect-for-human-rights-in-afghanistan/7895882.html	2024-12-10T05:49:57-08:00	
Medics: Israeli airstrikes kill 25 in northern Gaza	Palestinian medics said Tuesday that Israeli airstrikes killed at least 25 people in the Gaza Strip. The medics said strikes hit a multi-story building in the Beit Hanoun area in northern Gaza, and that most of those killed were from the same family. The latest attacks came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was an 'additional doorway' open to securing a deal with the Hamas militant group for the return of hostages seized in the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. Netanyahu said that pathway has been brought by Hamas being 'more isolated than ever' as a result of Israel’s military actions against Hamas ally Hezbollah in Lebanon and the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Hamas seized about 250 hostages during the attack in which it also killed 1,200 people. About 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, and at least one-third of them are believed to be dead. The health ministry in Gaza said Tuesday that Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed nearly 44,800 Palestinians. The Israel-Hamas conflict sparked cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which later spiraled into intense clashes with Israeli airstrikes killing a number of Hezbollah leaders. A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has been in place for about two weeks. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, United Kingdom and other Western countries. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/medics-israeli-airstrikes-kill-25-in-northern-gaza/7895772.html	2024-12-10T04:12:23-08:00	
Tensions peak as Bangladesh blames India for ‘spreading misinformation’	Tensions between India and Bangladesh have risen to alarming levels following the recent arrest of a Hindu monk in Dhaka and allegations that Hindus are being persecuted in the Muslim-majority nation. Hindu groups in India have staged anti-Bangladesh protests in recent weeks, but Bangladesh officials have said the accusations of persecution are unfounded. They said Indian news media and social media users are spreading misinformation and fueling friction. Diplomatic relations between the two countries have soured since August, when a student-led uprising ousted authoritarian prime minister Sheikh Hasina. She fled to India and took refuge in the country. Arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das Then on November 25, a Bangladeshi Hindu monk, Chinmoy Krishna Das, was arrested at the Dhaka airport on charges of sedition. He was accused of raising a saffron Hindu flag on top of a Bangladeshi national flag during an October rally in the coastal city of Chittagong. Das has been an advocate for religious minorities in the country. Until July, he been a member of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness or, ISKCON, also known as the Hare Krishna movement. He was expelled from ISKON after being accused of abusing children. Das’s sedition arrest sparked protests by his supporters, and a Muslim attorney was killed outside the Chittagong courthouse. Anger in India In neighboring India, protesters called for the release of Das, who remains in custody. His next bail hearing is scheduled to take place on January 2. Hindu groups have launched rallies and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to pressure Dhaka to release Das and to take action to stop attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh. On Wednesday, V Bhagaiah, national committee member of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological mentor of India’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, said that Hindus have become victims of 'genocide' in Bangladesh. 'While minority Hindus are being murdered and raped, and Hindu temples and properties are being destroyed, the (Muhammad Yunus-led) interim government is quietly watching the genocide,' Bhagaiah said at a rally in Hyderabad. Former Indian Army officer Major General Gagandeep Bakshi, who often appears on national TV channels in India as a security analyst, said that to end the persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh, 'the only solution' is to carve out a 'Hindu Nation' from within the Muslim-majority Bangladesh. 'Bangladesh under Mohd Yunis [Mohammad Yunus] has turned to radical jihadism. It wants to push out its Hindu minorities via genocide and seems itching for a fight,' he said on X. 'Divide Bangladesh in two parts. Make a separate country for Bangladeshi Hindus.' On Dec. 2, angry Hindu protesters ransacked the office of a deputy high commissioner of Bangladesh in the northeast Indian border state of Tripura. Response from Bangladesh Hindu temples and properties occasionally have been attacked in Bangladesh over the past years, allegedly by Islamist elements. The Yunus government agrees that Hindus faced violent attacks after Hasina’s ouster. But the violence was motivated by politics, not religion, officials said. The charge that the Hindu community is being violently targeted in Bangladesh, is 'completely baseless,' said Hasib Aziz, commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police. 'Not even a fraction of the allegations surfacing in Indian media that Hindus are facing persecution in Bangladesh is true. The allegation that Chinmoy Das was arrested because he is Hindu is baseless. He was charged under sedition and has been arrested as per law, for inciting violence and indulging in certain subversive activities,' Aziz told VOA. 'Nobody is being targeted in any orchestrated, anti-Hindu hate attack.' Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and others in India have launched a concerted misinformation campaign claiming that Hindus are 'facing a genocide' in Bangladesh, Bangladeshi former diplomat Khalilur Rahman told VOA. 'All they want is to destabilize Bangladesh,' said Khalilur Rahman, senior representative of the Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, who leads Bangladesh. He said the interim government in Bangladesh has emphasized the importance of improving the relationship between the two countries, based on mutual respect. 'Our foreign secretary met his Indian counterpart in Dhaka today. We hope to see efforts to carry forward our bilateral relations in a positive direction. It is in the best interest of both countries and the region,' Khalilur Rahman said. Meghmallar Basu, who is the president of Students’ Union, a left-leaning student organization at Dhaka University, said that to call the tensions and violence in Bangladesh 'genocide against Hindus' would be a 'shameless lie.' Basu, a Hindu, acknowledged the attacks on some Hindu temples and houses by certain 'anti-social forces' who took advantage of the collapse of the Hasina government. 'The misinformation that Hindutva activists in India are intentionally spreading on social media is worsening the relations between the two countries,’’ Basu said. ‘’The Hindu-Muslim relations in our country are also at the risk of worsening because of this propaganda.' Allegations of ‘fake news’ Many blamed India’s mainstream and social media for spreading 'fake news' and stoking the tension between the two countries. Sajjad Hossain Chowdhury, head of operations at the fact-checking organization Rumor Scanner, told VOA that the Indian media and Hindutva nationalist ‘X’ and Facebook accounts have been spreading 'fake news' about Bangladesh since the fall of Awami League government. 'Several Indian mainstream media outlets showed a video of the ritual of immersion of goddess Kali in India and claimed that it was the scene from a temple being vandalized by Islamists in Bangladesh. Using a video clip of a Hindu religious program in India — in which some women were trampled to death— many Indian Hindutva supporters wrote on X that they were Hindu women who had been raped and murdered by Islamists in Bangladesh,' Chowdhury said. 'We have identified more than a dozen rumors spread about Bangladesh, by at least 49 Indian media outlets, between Aug. 12 and Dec. 5.' Dhaka-based political analyst Zahed Ur Rahman said that the narrative that Hindus in Bangladesh are under persecution is consistent with the 'identity politics' of the current ruling party in India. 'So, the Indian authorities constantly try to label certain politically motivated attacks on some Hindus in Bangladesh as communal violence. And despite all the development the Indian media has undergone, it has morphed into a political propaganda mouthpiece of the BJP since they came into power in 2014,' he said. Zahed Ur Rahman added: 'The media ultimately feeds on the radical mindset that a significant number of Indians now possess. This is a result of living in an extremist political environment for too long.' Jon Danilowicz, a retired U.S. diplomat who has served in Bangladesh, said that it is difficult to fathom how the recent 'war of words' between India and Bangladesh serves either country’s interest. 'After mistakenly backing former PM Hasina past her expiration date, India appears to be stubbornly doubling down on its failed Bangladesh policy. The charges that Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus is leading an Islamist regime and unleashing genocide against the Hindu minority are ridiculously untrue,' he told the VOA. Danilowicz said that while the Indian right wing may see verbal and rhetorical attacks on post-Hasina Bangladesh as a 'smart domestic political strategy,' it does not serve India’s long-term regional interests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tensions-peak-as-bangladesh-blames-india-for-spreading-misinformation-/7895753.html	2024-12-10T03:54:25-08:00	
Zelenskyy says ‘decisiveness’ necessary to bring end to war	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that 'only decisiveness' can bring Russia’s war in Ukraine to an end and bring lasting peace. Days after talks with French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said working together to bring an end to the war is the top priority, and he expressed gratitude to Trump 'for his strong resolve to bring this war to a fair end.' The Ukrainian leader further said he told Trump that Russian President Vladimir Putin 'fears only him and perhaps China.' 'We know that America has the capacity to accomplish remarkable things—things that others have not been able to achieve,' Zelenskyy posted on X. 'To succeed in ending this war, we need unity—the unity of America, Europe, and everyone in the world who values security—as well as strong positions and guarantees for peace.' Zelenskyy’s comments come amid questions about the level of U.S. support for Ukraine as U.S. leadership transitions from President Joe Biden’s administration to a new Trump term next month. The United States under Biden has led efforts to organize billions of dollars in military aid for Ukraine, including ammunition and air defenses to defend against Russian attacks. Trump said after the meeting Sunday that there should be an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and the start of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.

Assad’s downfall marks the loss of Moscow’s main ally in the Middle East	Russian state media say Moscow has granted asylum to ousted Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad, who reports say landed in Moscow after escaping from Damascus Sunday. The Kremlin was a key supporter of Assad in his government's brutal attempts to defeat rebels, and that memory may make it difficult for Moscow to regain its foothold in Syria, which until a few days ago appeared unshakable. Elizabeth Cherneff narrates this report from Ricardo Marquina	https://www.voanews.com/a/assad-s-downfall-marks-the-loss-of-moscow-s-main-ally-in-the-middle-east/7895707.html	2024-12-10T02:13:25-08:00	
Syrian rebel leader pledges to release names of ousted government officials involved in war crimes	Syrian rebel commander Ahmad al-Sharaa, widely known as Abu Mohammad al-Golani, pledged Tuesday to release the names of senior officials from ousted President Bashar al-Assad’s government who were 'involved in torturing the Syrian people.' 'Rewards will be offered to those who will provide information about senior army and security officers involved in war crimes,' Golani said in a statement. The pledge came amid questions about Syria’s future governance following Assad’s departure. A German government statement late Monday said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the end of the Assad regime, and said they are 'prepared to work together with the new rulers on the basis of fundamental human rights and the protection of ethnic and religious minorities.' Scholz and Macron emphasized the importance of maintaining Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the statement said. The United Nations has expressed concerns about Israel’s deployment of troops across a demilitarized buffer zone in the Golan Heights, which Israel says is necessary to protect its own security. Israeli troops were on the Syrian side of the zone Tuesday, about 25 kilometers southwest of Damascus, according to several security sources cited by Reuters and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Avichay Adraee said reports that Israeli forces were approaching Damascus were incorrect. He said Israeli troops were located inside the buffer zone and at defensive points close to the border. The Britain-based Observatory, which has monitored the conflict in Syria, also said Tuesday that Israeli forces had conducted more than 300 airstrikes on Syrian territory since Assad’s ouster early Sunday. Journalists reported more airstrikes early Tuesday in the Damascus area. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Staar said Tuesday that Israeli forces had struck suspected chemical weapons sites as well as long-range rockets as part of an effort to prevent them from ending up in the possession of hostile actors. Saudi Arabia condemned Israel’s actions in Syria, saying in a statement Tuesday that they violate international law and 'sabotage Syria’s chances of restoring its security, stability and territorial integrity.' U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters Monday that U.N. peacekeepers 'informed the Israeli counterparts that these actions would constitute a violation of the 1974 Disengagement Agreement that there should be no military forces or activities in the area of separation, and Israel and Syria must continue to uphold the terms of that 1974 agreement and preserve stability in the Golan.' Syria’s U.N. envoy also said he had written to the United Nations to protest the Israeli move, as well as attacks on several military installations in the country. Political transition Syrian rebels said Golani met for the first time Monday with the outgoing prime minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali to 'coordinate a transfer of power.' Jalali told Sky News Arabia TV on Monday, 'We are working so that the transitional period is quick and smooth.' He said most Cabinet ministers are still working from offices in Damascus. However, the U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator for Syria, Adam Abdelmoula, told The Associated Press that some key government services had shut down as anxious state workers stayed home. At the United Nations, Syria’s ambassador, who was appointed by the Assad regime, told reporters that his delegation had received instructions from the new authorities to continue doing their job during the transition. 'We are with the Syrian people. We will keep defending and working for the Syrian people. So we will continue our work till further notice,' Koussay Aldahhak said. He said the country and people are witnessing a new era of change. 'Syrians are looking forward for establishing a state of freedom, equality, rule of law, democracy, and we will join efforts to rebuild our country, to rebuild what was destroyed, and to rebuild the future — better future of Syria for all Syrians,' he said. Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council met late Monday behind closed doors at the request of Russia, which supported Assad militarily during the nearly 14-year Syrian civil war. U.N. Syria envoy Geir Pedersen and U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix both provided briefings. 'The council, I think, was more or less united on the need to preserve the territorial integrity and unity of Syria, to ensure the protection of civilians, to ensure that humanitarian aid is coming to the needy population,' Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters after the meeting. 'The situation needs to be stabilized; there has to be an inclusive political process, and also there should not be a resurgence of terrorist forces,' China’s envoy Fu Cong told reporters. 'The U.N. has a big role to play in all of these.' VOA United Nations Correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report. Some information came from The Associated Press.

K-pop light sticks fire up impeachment protests in South Korea	SEOUL, South Korea — While South Korean protesters have long employed songs, dances and chants, customized light sticks popular with K-pop fans have emerged as an effective new tool for demonstrators calling for the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol. Tens of thousands of protesters have braved near sub-zero temperatures and gathered outside the National Assembly in the capital of Seoul since Yoon's failed martial law attempt last week. 'Impeach, impeach. Impeach Yoon Suk Yeol,' protesters chanted to the beat of K-pop group aespa's latest techno track 'Whiplash.' Videos of synchronized chanting and light stick movements in unison at the protests have gone viral on social media along with flags carrying messages and memes from mainly younger demonstrators. 'Give us geeks the freedom to only worry about geek things,' one meme flag carried on a flagpole at Saturday's protest read, capturing the mood among young people amid deepening political turmoil. One of the advantages of the light sticks is how sturdy they are, said Kim Do Heon, a Seoul-based music critic. 'It also shines very bright and comes in a size that is easy to carry around.' South Koreans are playing the long game, said Shin Jae-yun who came out to protest against Yoon with a light stick for K-pop boy band TREASURE, because protests are a 'very painful act' yet there is no guarantee things will improve right away. 'To endure such pain, you have to have something to enjoy in it so that people can stay hopeful for a long time even when it drags on,' Shin said. Playlists of popular K-pop protest songs are also being shared on X. Kim Byung-joo, a lawmaker from the main opposition Democratic Party, jumped on the trend on Monday and posted a playlist on the platform: 'Impeach Yoon Suk Yeol, ringleader of treason!...from folk songs to K-pop.' South Korea has a rich history of protest since democracy took root in the 1980s after a series of military interventions. Demonstrations over worker rights, threats from neighboring North Korea and perceived government failings have sometimes turned violent in the past. Lee Seul-gi, a 36-year-old woman who is a fan of K-pop boyband ATEEZ, said the impeachment protests this time around have become more accessible. 'Previous rallies might have been a bit violent and scary. But the light sticks and K-pop have lowered the barrier,' Lee said. Candle upgrade Until 2016, candles were prominent at many protests and played a central role in the rallies that led to the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye. Park was ousted over a graft scandal and was later jailed over the scandal that exposed webs of corruption between political leaders and the country's conglomerates. 'So many people were holding candles, putting paper cups over them and carrying them out so they wouldn't go out. But now the age of the light sticks is here, not candles,' music critic Kim said. Stephanie Choi, a researcher at the State University of New York at Buffalo, said the light sticks still reflect the 'power of solidarity while maintaining the original meaning of non-violence.' While men and women from all age groups are gathering and calling on parliament to impeach Yoon, young women are outnumbering their male peers at the protests. Yoon vowed to abolish the gender equality ministry before taking office and was an unpopular candidate with women voters in their 20s in the 2022 presidential election. He won office in 2022 by the slimmest margin in South Korean history but his party suffered a landslide defeat in parliamentary elections earlier this year. The K-pop industry is notoriously apolitical and so are the lyrics of many K-pop songs playing at the impeachment protests. In South Korea, celebrities expressing political opinions are often frowned upon. But experts say fans are conscious of K-pop's power and the underlying messages of female empowerment it carries. 'K-pop is a female-dominant space...and their feminist demands have shaped K-pop’s esthetics and performances today,' Choi said. Kim Da-in, a 19-year-old fan of virtual idol group Plave, said the impeachment protests are uniting all K-pop fandoms. 'Here, I feel that we are citizens of South Korea first before we are idol fans.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/k-pop-light-sticks-fire-up-impeachment-protests-in-south-korea/7895682.html	2024-12-10T00:37:17-08:00

VOA Turkish: How developments in Syria may affect relations between Turkey, Kurds	Following the overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria, all eyes turned to the actors in the country, especially the Kurds. While Turkey is again seeking a solution to its Kurdish issue, how will the latest situation in Syria affect this process? Turkey views the Kurdish-led and U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces as an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Turkey, the U.S. and EU have designated PKK as a terrorist organization. VOA Turkish talked to experts closely following the region, who emphasized that Turkey's approach to the Kurds in Syria depends on the resolution of its own internal Kurdish issue.

South Korea’s leadership crisis jeopardizes US efforts to counter China	WASHINGTON — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s uncertain political future from his martial law backlash could imperil the next Trump administration’s trilateral coordination with the country and Japan in countering China, analysts say. Yoon faces an investigation for treason after declaring martial law and rescinding it hours later last week. Although he survived an impeachment vote on Saturday, the main opposition Democratic Party said the following day it would seek an impeachment vote again. Uncertainty surrounds Yoon’s leadership and the future leadership of South Korea amid rapidly evolving political disarray and confusion. Key government officials have resigned over the martial law controversy, and the head of the ruling People Power Party (PPP), Han Dong-hun, said Sunday that Yoon would resign soon and would no longer be involved in conducting state affairs. In the meantime, the Defense Ministry said Monday that Yoon still had the control of the South Korean military. The South Korean political crisis poses risks to the security of the region, where countries such as North Korea, China and Russia lie in wait to take advantage of the situation, analysts say. 'The resulting political turmoil raises uncertainty over the future direction of the country’s policies and ability to implement them,' said Bruce Klingner, the senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation. 'The incoming U.S. administration will be focused on countering the multifaceted Chinese threat to the region and urging allies and partners to assume larger roles,' he said. 'Yoon’s actions will trigger doubts as to the viability of Seoul’s roles and contributions.' 'Coupled with the Japanese leadership change and loss of legislative majority by the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party], the United States now has two weakened allies in Northeast Asia,' Klingner said. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba assumed office in October. The same month, Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority in parliament. On Monday, Daniel Kritenbrink, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts to discuss regional security, underscoring the importance of maintaining close trilateral cooperation. The trilateral ties were consolidated after Yoon extended an olive branch to then- Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida after years of frayed relations between the two countries over colonial wartime issues. The two countries' mending of bilateral ties and their subsequent trilateral summit with the U.S. at Camp David in August 2023, viewed as historic in Washington, is frowned upon by South Korea's main opposition party, which is considered anti-Japan and pro-China. If the Democratic Party files another impeachment motion and manages to get two-thirds of the 300-seat National Assembly and six of nine constitutional court judges to vote in favor, the country will hold a special election to choose a new president. If Yoon resigns or impeachment votes by the parliament and court pass, the main opposition party has a shot at the country’s next leadership. However, how the process will unfold is uncertain as the PPP boycotted the first impeachment vote and the constitutional court has three vacancies. Terence Roehrig, a Korea expert and professor of national security at the U.S. Naval War College, said, 'If Yoon leaves office, either through impeachment or resignation, the special election that follows will undoubtedly select a Democratic Party president.' He continued: 'As a result, there is likely to be a shift in South Korean policy toward China and in maintaining trilateral ties with Japan and the United States. Much has been done in the past two years to institutionalize trilateral relations, but these efforts will be tested with Yoon’s departure along with the incoming Trump administration.' The PPP criticized Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung for what it described as his 'subservient' attitude toward China when he met with then-Chinese Ambassador to South Korea Xing Haiming in March. Lee said at the meeting that South Korea should not be involved in the cross-strait issue involving Taiwan. China considers the independent island nation as its own sovereign territory. Xing in 2023 accused Yoon’s government of tilting too much toward the U.S. and damaging South Korea’s relations with China. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press briefing in Beijing on Monday that she will 'not comment on the ROK’s internal affairs,' referring to South Korea by its official name, the Republic of Korea. Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea foundation chair in Korea Studies at the Brookings Institution, said it would not be surprising for China 'to hope for a DP to come back in office,' as during the previous Moon Jae-in government before Yoon, because the main opposition party is 'more open to engaging China.' Yeo said that based on President-elect Donald Trump's key Cabinet position picks, such as Representative Mike Waltz for national security adviser and Senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state, both viewed as China hawks, countering China will be a key focus, and good ties between Seoul and Tokyo would be 'desirable.' At the same time, Trump’s preference to deal bilaterally rather than with alliances, makes the future of the trilateral ties a bit uncertain, Yeo said. 'I don’t think the Trump administration may be as active as the Biden administration was in trying to orchestrate and encourage alliances to work together,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-leadership-crisis-jeopardizes-us-efforts-to-counter-china/7895633.html	2024-12-09T21:18:00-08:00	
6 Guatemalans charged with human smuggling in deadly 2021 Mexico crash	AUSTIN, Texas — Six Guatemalans were arrested in Guatemala and in Texas Monday on human smuggling charges linked to a 2021 semitrailer truck crash in Mexico that killed more than 50 migrants, authorities said. The truck had been packed with at least 160 migrants, many of them Guatemalans, when it crashed into a support for a pedestrian bridge in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of the southern state of Chiapas. The arrests were announced on the three-year anniversary of the accident. According to an indictment unsealed Monday in Laredo, Texas, Guatemalan authorities arrested Tomas Quino Canil, 36; Alberto Marcario Chitic, 31; Oswaldo Manuel Zavala Quino, 24; and Josefa Quino Canil de Zavala, 42. Another man, Jorge Agapito Ventura, was arrested at his home in Cleveland, Texas, U.S. authorities said. Guatemalan officials noted a sixth arrest. A sixth name listed on the U.S. federal indictment was blacked out. The accused were charged with conspiracy, placing life in jeopardy, causing serious bodily injury, and resulting in death. It was unclear late Monday if those arrested had attorneys in the United States who could comment on their behalf. Justice Department officials did not immediately respond to an email Monday night. The indictment charges them with conspiring to smuggle migrants from Guatemala through Mexico to the U.S. for payment. In some cases that involved smuggling unaccompanied children, the defendants would provide scripts of what to say if apprehended, the indictment said. The smugglers would move migrants on foot, inside microbuses, cattle trucks and tractor trailers, the indictment said. It said the smugglers would use Facebook Messenger to request and deliver identification documents to the migrants to get them into the U.S. 'The tragedy that occurred three years ago today in Chiapas is further proof that human smugglers are ruthless, callous and dangerous, intending migrants should not believe their lives,' said U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. Guatemalan Interior Minister Francisco Jiménez said the defendants were part of a criminal structure called Los Quino, and that U.S. officials had requested extradition of the four arrested in Guatemala. Authorities executed 15 search warrants across Guatemala on Monday, Jiménez said. He said they had the support of the U.S. and Mexican governments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/guatemalans-charged-with-human-smuggling-in-deadly-2021-mexico-crash/7895630.html	2024-12-09T21:00:13-08:00	
Polygamous sect leader sentenced to 50 years in child sex scheme	PHOENIX — A polygamist religious leader who claimed more than 20 spiritual 'wives' including 10 underage girls was sentenced to 50 years in prison on Monday for coercing girls as young as 9 years old to submit to criminal sex acts with him and other adults, and for scheming to kidnap them from protective custody. Samuel Bateman, whose small group was an offshoot of the sect once led by Warren Jeffs, had pleaded guilty to a yearslong scheme to transport girls across state lines for his sex crimes, and later to kidnap some of them from protective custody. Under the agreement, Bateman pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit transportation of a minor for sexual activity, which carries a sentence of 10 years to life imprisonment, and one count of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, which is punishable by up to life imprisonment. He was sentenced to 50 years on each count, to be served concurrently. The rest of the charges were dismissed as part of the agreement. Authorities say that Bateman, 48, tried to start an offshoot of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints based in the neighboring communities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah. The fundamentalist group, also known as FLDS, split from the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after Mormons officially abandoned polygamy in 1890. U.S. District Court Judge Susan Brnovich sentenced Bateman after hearing statements in court by three teenage girls about the trauma they still struggle to overcome. Although they gave their names in court, The Associated Press does not name victims of sexual crime, and some appeared to still be minors. 'You should not have the opportunity to be free and never have the opportunity to be around young women, ' Brnovich told Bateman, noting that for a man of his age the 50-year sentence was effectively a life sentence. 'You took them from their homes, from their families and made them into sex slaves,' the judge said. 'You stripped them of their innocence and childhood.' A short competency hearing that was closed to the public was held just before sentencing to discuss a doctor's assessment of Bateman's mental health. The defense had argued that Bateman could have benefited from a maximum of 20 years of psychiatric treatment behind bars before being released. The girls told the court, sometimes addressing Bateman himself, how they grappled to develop relationships in high school, among other struggles. Now living with foster families, they said they had received much support from trusted adults outside their community. After the sentencing, the teens hugged and wept quietly. They were escorted out of court by a half dozen men and women in jackets with the slogan 'Bikers Against Child Abuse,' a group dedicated to protecting children from what it calls dangerous people and situations. A woman who sat with the teens said no one in the group would have a comment. There was no one in the courtroom who appeared to be a supporter of Bateman. The alleged practice of sect members sexually abusing girls whom they claim as spiritual 'wives' has long plagued the FLDS. Jeffs was convicted of state charges in Texas in 2011 involving sexual assaults of his underage followers. Bateman was one of Jeffs' trusted followers and declared himself, like Jeffs, to be a 'prophet' of the FLDS. Jeffs denounced Bateman in a written 'revelation' sent to his followers from prison, and then tried to start his own group. In 2019 and 2020, insisting that polygamy brings exaltation in heaven and that he was acting on orders from the 'Heavenly Father,' Bateman began taking female adults and children from his male followers and proclaiming them to be his 'wives,' the plea agreement said. While none of these 'marriages' were legally or ceremonially recognized, Bateman acknowledged that each time he claimed another 'wife,' it marked the beginning of his illicit sexual contact with the woman or girl. Federal agents said Bateman demanded that his followers confess publicly for any indiscretions and he imposed punishments that ranged from public shaming to sexual activity, including requiring that some male followers atone for their 'sins' by surrendering their own wives and daughters to him. Bateman traveled extensively between Arizona, Utah, Colorado and Nebraska and regularly coerced underage girls into his criminal sexual activity, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona said. Recordings of some of his sex crimes were transmitted across state lines via electronic devices. Bateman was arrested in August 2022 by state police as he drove through Flagstaff, Arizona, pulling a trailer. Someone had alerted authorities after spotting small fingers reaching through the slats of the door. Inside the trailer, which had no ventilation, they found a makeshift toilet, a sofa, camping chairs and three girls, 11 to 14 years old. Bateman posted bond but was soon arrested again, accused of obstructing justice in a federal investigation into whether children were being transported across state lines for his sex crimes. Authorities also took nine children from Bateman's home in Colorado City into protective custody. Eight of the children later escaped from foster care in Arizona, and were found hundreds of miles away in Washington state, in a vehicle driven by one of the adult 'wives.' Bateman also admitted his involvement in the kidnapping plot. Federal prosecutors noted that Bateman's plea agreement was contingent on all of his co-defendants also pleading guilty. It also called for restitution of as much as $1 million per victim, and for all assets to be immediately forfeited. Seven of Bateman's adult 'wives' have been convicted of crimes related to coercing children into sexual activity or impeding the investigation into Bateman. Some acknowledged they also coerced girls to become Bateman's spiritual 'wives,' witnessed Bateman having criminal sexual activity with girls, participated in illicit group sex involving children, or joined in kidnapping them from foster care. Another woman is scheduled to be tried Jan. 14 on charges related to the kidnappings. Two Colorado City brothers also face 10 years to life at their sentencings, on Dec. 16 and Dec. 20, after being convicted in October of charges including interstate travel to persuade or coerce a child to engage in sexual activity. Authorities say one bought Bateman two Bentley automobiles, while the other bought him a Range Rover. In court records, lawyers for some of Bateman's 'wives' painted a bleak picture of their clients' religious upbringings. One said his client was raised in a religious cult that taught sexual activity with children was acceptable and that she was duped into 'marrying' Bateman. Another said her client was given to Bateman by another man as if she were a piece of property, feeling she had no choice.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polygamous-sect-leader-sentenced-to-50-years-in-child-sex-scheme/7895626.html	2024-12-09T20:39:24-08:00	
Biden under pressure to commute federal death sentences	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden is facing growing calls to commute the death sentences of the more than three dozen federal inmates on Death Row before Donald Trump returns to the White House. Trump resumed federal executions during his last term in office, overseeing 13 by lethal injection during his final six months in power, more than any U.S. leader in 120 years. Biden campaigned for the White House as an opponent of the death penalty and the Justice Department issued a moratorium on its use at the federal level after he became president. During his re-election campaign against Kamala Harris, Trump spoke frequently of expanding the use of capital punishment to include migrants who kill American citizens and drug and human traffickers. There had been no federal inmates put to death in the United States since 2003 until Trump resumed federal executions in July 2020. A coalition of death penalty opponents submitted a letter to Biden on Monday asking him to commute federal death sentences to life in prison without parole. 'The only irreversible action you can take to prevent President-elect Trump from renewing his execution spree, as he has vowed to do, is commuting the death sentences of those on federal death row now,' the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and more than 130 other organizations said. 'Your ability to change the course of the death penalty in the United States will be a defining, legacy-building moment in American history,' they said. There are currently 40 prisoners — all men — convicted of federal crimes awaiting execution, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, including several in high-profile cases. They include: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 31, the 'Boston Bomber,' who was sentenced to death for the murders of two people in the April 15, 2013 bombing of the Boston Marathon. Dylann Roof, 30, an avowed white supremacist who shot dead nine Black parishoners during a June 17, 2015 Bible study meeting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. Robert Bowers, 52, an anti-Semitic Pennsylvania man who killed 11 Jewish worshippers during an October 27, 2018 attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. 'Commuted, changed' Nine of the inmates on federal Death Row were convicted of murdering fellow prisoners while one killed a prison guard. Four were sentenced to death for murders committed during bank robberies. There are also four inmates on the military's Death Row including Nidal Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who shot dead 13 people during a rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009. The U.S. military has not carried out an execution since 1961. Pope Francis, in his Sunday address at the Vatican, asked the crowd to pray for Death Row inmates in the United States and said their sentences should 'be commuted, changed.' Biden, who controversially pardoned his son Hunter this month for tax and gun crimes, has been barraged with clemency appeals from other religious leaders, former state and federal prison officials, ex-prosecutors and dozens of relatives of murder victims. Richard Branson, the Virgin Group founder, and Sheryl Sandberg, a former top executive at Facebook, were among the signatories of a letter from top business leaders urging Biden to exercise his clemency power. According to The Washington Post, the White House is considering 'taking steps to commute at least some federal death sentences.' 'No decision has been made, however, about the breadth or scope of such a possible move, including whether to do it at all,' the newspaper said. There have been 23 executions in the United States in 2024 and two more are scheduled before the end of the year. The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while six others — Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee — have moratoriums in place. Federal executions are carried out by lethal injection at a prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. The last one was on January 16, 2021, four days before Trump left office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-under-pressure-to-commute-federal-death-sentences/7895615.html	2024-12-09T20:15:12-08:00	
US military force posture unchanged in Syria after massive counter-Islamic State strike	The fall of Damascus has raised concerns about what’s next for U.S. troops based in the war-torn country, who have been working with allies to keep Islamic State from resurging.

UnitedHealthcare CEO was likely killed with a ghost gun that can be made at home	WASHINGTON — The brazen killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO was likely carried out with a ghost gun, one of the nearly untraceable weapons that can be made a home, police said Monday. A ghost gun is a firearm without a serial number, and police believe the one used in last week's shooting of Brian Thompson may have been made with a 3D printer. It was capable of firing 9 mm rounds. The man arrested in the crime, Luigi Mangione, also had a sound suppressor, or silencer, police said. Ghost guns have increasingly turned up at crime scenes around the U.S. in recent years. Here's a look at the weapons and efforts to regulate them: What are ghost guns? The firearms are privately made and have no serial numbers. Generally, firearms manufactured by licensed companies must have serial numbers — usually displayed on the frame of the gun — that allow officials to trace the gun back to the manufacturer, the firearms dealer and original purchaser. Ghost guns, however, are made of parts that the owner can assemble together. The critical component in building an untraceable gun is what is known as the lower receiver. Some are sold in do-it-yourself kits, and the receivers are typically made from metal or polymer. They include semiautomatic handguns and rifles. Are they legal? It is legal in the U.S. to build a firearm for personal use. Until about two years ago, ghost gun kits were available online that allowed people to assemble the weapons at home without background checks or age verification. As police found more ghost guns at crime scenes, the Biden administration moved to add age requirements and background checks in 2022. Buying one now is more like purchasing a regular gun at a gun shop. The number of ghost guns has since flattened out or declined in several major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Baltimore, according to court documents. But gun groups have challenged the regulation in court. The Supreme Court heard a case in October and seemed likely to uphold the regulation. It hasn’t yet handed down a ruling. Where else have ghost guns been used? The number of ghost guns recovered by law enforcement increased from 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 in 2021, according to Justice Department data. However, traditional guns are still used far more often in crimes. Ghost guns really popped into the public consciousness in 2013 when John Zawahri opened fire on the campus of Santa Monica College in California, killing six people, including his father and brother. Zawahri, who was later shot and killed by police, had assembled an AR-15-style weapon after failing a background check at a gun dealer. A gunman who killed his wife and four others in Northern California in 2017 built his own weapon to skirt a court order prohibiting him from owning firearms. In 2019, a teenager used a homemade handgun to fatally shoot two classmates and wound three others at a school in suburban Los Angeles. A mass shooting carried out with an AR-15-style ghost gun left five people dead in Philadelphia in 2023. A ghost gun was also used in a shooting that critically wounded two kindergartners at a tiny religious school in Northern California last week, police said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unitedhealthcare-ceo-was-likely-killed-with-a-ghost-gun-that-can-be-made-at-home-/7894581.html	2024-12-09T18:22:22-08:00	
Biden memorializes painful past of Native people	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Monday presided over his final White House Tribal Nations Summit by reaching into the nation’s dark past and establishing a new national monument to honor the suffering of thousands of Native children and their families in federal boarding schools in the last century. His proclamation starts a three-year clock to design a monument to be placed at the flagship Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. The Carlisle Indian Industrial School opened in 1879, with the stated mission to 'kill the Indian' to 'save the Man.' Schools like this removed children from their families and forced them to speak English, wear non-native clothing and eschew tribal customs. Earlier this year, Biden described the treatment of thousands of Native children at government boarding schools as 'a blot' on the nation’s history. 'The federal government mandated — mandated — removal of children from their families and tribes, launching what's called the federal Indian boarding school era, over a 150-year span, 150 years from the early 1800s to 1970 — one of the most horrific chapters in American history,' he said earlier this year. 'We should be ashamed.' The most recent U.S. Census found that the population of those who consider themselves wholly or partly Native is upward of nearly 9 million. The U.S. Department of the Interior says it serves 1.9 million American Indian and Alaska Natives, many in sovereign lands. That’s a shadow of the population that historians say thrived on the continent before European colonization. Native Americans were only granted universal U.S. citizenship in 1924 with the passage of the Indian Citizenship Act. Activists like Elveda Martinez of the Walker River Paiute Tribe say it’s remarkable how recent this history of dispossession and discrimination is. 'It's within our generation that Natives finally all had the right to vote,' she said. 'So, that's still a big thing now. We always tell people, you know, it was our parents and people in that generation that fought for the right to vote.' As a group, Native residents have the highest poverty rate in the country, and their youth lag behind other demographics in education, according to a study by a bipartisan research group. On Monday, Biden detailed his administration’s efforts to improve the livelihoods of descendants of the nation’s pre-colonial populations and to give communities more say, such as designating conservation areas. But he stressed that honoring the past is the way forward.'By making the Carlisle Indian School a national monument, we make clear what great nations do,' he said. 'We don’t erase history. We acknowledge it and learn from it, so we never repeat it again.' Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary, praised Biden’s work. 'President Biden has been the best president for Indian Country in my lifetime,' she said. 'This is a president and an administration that truly sees Indigenous people and has worked tirelessly to address the issues in Indian Country that have long been underfunded or outright ignored.' As a sign of her esteem, Haaland, who is a member of the Pueblo of Laguna, draped Biden in a personalized parting gift: a black-and-white version of a blanket designed by Pueblo artist Pat Pruitt, who says the motif, which depicts thunder and lightning in the desert, is meant to evoke 'the feeling of that calm before the storm that is filled with electricity and sound.' But as one tribe made clear Monday, America’s Native people are not a monolith. The Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians lashed out at the Biden administration for what the group says is a 'lack of tribal consultation' over a wave of proposed off-reservation casinos, including a recent approval for Oregon’s first off-reservation casino. 'It is performative to celebrate an administration’s contributions to Indian Country when the actions tell a very different story,' Cow Creek Umpqua Tribal Chairman Carla Keene said in a statement sent to VOA on Monday. 'We have been dismissed and ignored about policy that will devastate our social, cultural, and economic livelihood. There is time to do the right thing and put a stop to the pending decisions that will irreversibly harm Tribes across the Pacific Northwest and West Coast, which is a backwards step in American history, not forward.' The principal chief of the large and powerful Cherokee nation — which includes about 450,000 people — issued a careful, diplomatic statement Monday advocating for the summit to continue under the next administration. 'I’m looking forward to attending the White House Tribal Nation’s summit this week,' Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. posted on Facebook. 'Other than when the summit was not held (2017-2020), I’ve been attending since 2013. I hope it is a productive engagement and I hope it continues on in future years.' President-elect Donald Trump indicated that he views Native issues as intertwined with energy generation, by naming North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum as Interior secretary, while also serving as 'White House energy czar.' 'We're going to do things with energy and with land interior that is going to be incredible,' he said, but did not elaborate. As president, Trump angered Indigenous activists by lifting a ban on the Keystone XL pipeline that cuts through sovereign native lands on its path south from Canada to Texas. Biden revoked Trump’s permit for the oil pipeline on the first day of his term.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-memorializes-painful-past-of-native-people/7894575.html	2024-12-09T18:01:50-08:00

US wary of fissures, fragmentation as Syria looks to rebuild	washington — U.S. diplomats and military officials have intensified their outreach to groups vying to chart a new course for Syria, as well as to Syria’s neighbors, in an effort to ensure the fall of the regime of former President Bashar Assad does not give way to a more unstable and dangerous future. A number of key meetings took place Monday in Jordan, where senior U.S. diplomatic officials held consultations with their Jordanian counterparts following similar meetings a day earlier in Doha, Qatar. And U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said more diplomatic missions are in the works. 'Senior officials from this department are fanning out through the region as we speak, working with counterparts on how the United States can help support the Syrian people as they decide their own path for the future' Blinken told an audience at the State Department Monday. 'This moment presents a historic opportunity, but it also carries considerable risks,' he said. 'History shows how quickly moments of promise can descend into conflict and violence.' As evidence of the U.S. concern, the commander of U.S. Central Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle East, also engaged with allies in the region. General Michael 'Erik' Kurilla met in Amman with Major General Yousef Al-Hunaiti, the chairman of the Jordanian Joint Chiefs of Staff. According to a U.S. readout, Kurilla promised U.S. support for Jordan should the situation in Syria deteriorate. Other U.S. officials on Monday likewise emphasized the need for a calm and orderly transition in Syria. 'We want to make sure that our allies are safe and secure,' U.S. Deputy United Nations Ambassador Robert Wood told reporters at the U.N. in New York. 'We want to make sure that there isn't a humanitarian catastrophe,' Wood said. 'So, we're going to be working over the coming days and weeks to try to make sure that we can ensure all of those things happen.' But officials at the State Department and the Pentagon caution there is ample reason to worry that hopes for a better future for the Syrian people could disintegrate, with differences leading to new waves of violence and even migrations out of Syria. They say that while the words and actions of Syrian rebel leaders, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s Abu Mohammed al-Golani, seem promising, pledges for a new, inclusive government will be tested if tensions between rival groups continue to simmer or escalate. And the State Department officials said Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S.-designated terror group that grew out of the al-Qaida terror group’s Syrian affiliate before cutting ties, has yet to show that it deserves to have the terror designation removed. So too, there are concerns about the Islamic State terror group, which commands between 2,500 and 5,000 fighters across Syria and Iraq, and which has been growing stronger in recent months. 'ISIS will try to use this period to reestablish its capabilities, to create safe havens,' Blinken said Monday, using an acronym for the terror group, also known as IS or Daesh. 'We are determined not to let that happen.' U.S. allies on the ground in Syria, however, warn IS has already begun ramping up its attacks, seeking to take advantage of the collapse of Syrian regime forces over the past week. 'We are worried,' the U.S. representative for the political wing of the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) told VOA, pointing to an uptick in attacks across northeastern Syria. 'They are targeting our internal security forces,' said Syrian Democratic Council representative Sinam Mohamad, noting efforts by IS sleeper cells in places like Raqqa, Deir el-Zour and even Hasakah, home to one of the SDF-run prisons holding thousands of IS fighters captured after the fall of the terror group’s self-declared caliphate in 2019. She also warned of increased activity, and new escape attempts at al-Hol, a displaced persons camp that holds tens of thousands of IS wives and other family members, many of them children. Mohamad praised U.S. forces for lending support to the SDF but said there are indications of additional IS activity in areas abandoned by Syrian regime forces along with their Russian and Iranian allies. U.S. military officials hope a series of airstrikes, carried out Sunday at five locations across central Syria, will help to blunt the threat. The strikes are 'a way to certainly prevent them [IS] from taking advantage of the dynamics within Syria and the current situation,' said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh, briefing reporters at the Pentagon Monday. But U.S. counterterrorism officials have long warned that IS is capable of demonstrating both patience and resilience and is well-aware of the types of fissures that could still serve to derail a transition government in Syria. And perhaps nowhere are those tensions more palpable at the moment than in Syria’s northeast, where fighting has broken out between Kurdish militias and the Syrian National Army, or SNA, a coalition of Turkish-backed militias. Turkey has defended various efforts to strike at the SDF, claiming it is led by fighters with the People's Protection Units, or YPG, a Syrian-based offshoot of the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), labeled by both Ankara and Washington as a terrorist organization. The SDC and SDF, in return, have accused the SNA of attacking civilians in Manbij, and other nearby areas. 'The United States, now, they are trying to stop this,' the SDC’s Mohamad told VOA. 'There is some negotiation,' she said. 'We hope they [the U.S.] can succeed in that.' The State Department Monday said it has been clear with both sides, echoing warnings from the SDF that ongoing clashes could hurt the ability of the U.S.-backed force to contain IS. 'We don't want to see an escalation,' said spokesperson Matthew Miller of the clashes between Kurdish groups and the SNA. 'We don't want to see anyone take advantage of this period of instability to try, and further their own position.' Nike Ching, Margaret Besheer and Carla Babb contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7893559.html	2024-12-09T17:00:23-08:00	
Report: Media mogul Murdoch fails in bid to change family trust	Rupert Murdoch has lost a bid to change his family trust to consolidate control of his media empire in the hands of his son Lachlan, The New York Times reported Monday, citing a sealed court document. Nevada Commissioner Edmund Gorman concluded in a decision filed Saturday that Murdoch and his eldest son, Lachlan, who is the head of Fox News parent Fox Corp and News Corp, had acted in 'bad faith' in their effort to amend the irrevocable trust, the Times reported. The court docket indicates Gorman issued a recommendation or order Saturday, but the document is not publicly available. The trust currently would divide control of the company equally among Murdoch’s four oldest children — Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence — after his death. Rupert Murdoch proposed amending the family trust to solidify Lachlan's leadership of the family's media empire after his death, and block any interference by three of Lachlan’s siblings, who are politically moderate, the Times reported. Under one scenario, three of the heirs could technically outvote a fourth, setting up a battle over the future of the powerful media outlets, even as Lachlan Murdoch runs Fox and is sole chair of News Corp. In his opinion, Gorman said, the plan to change the trust was a 'carefully crafted charade' to 'permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch’s executive roles' inside the empire 'regardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries' of the family trust, the Times said. A lawyer for Rupert Murdoch, Adam Streisand, said they were disappointed with the ruling and intended to appeal, the Times reported. The commissioner's ruling is subject to approval by a district judge, whose decision could be challenged in court. The trust was set up in Nevada, which is prized for its strict confidentiality rules. A spokesperson for Rupert Murdoch, 93, could not immediately be reached for comment. Lachlan Murdoch did not respond to an email seeking comment. Lachlan's siblings issued a joint statement expressing hope that the family would focus on mending relationships. 'We welcome Commissioner Gorman’s decision and hope that we can move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members,' the siblings said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-media-mogul-murdoch-fails-in-bid-to-change-family-trust-/7893557.html	2024-12-09T16:56:40-08:00	
Haiti gang massacres around 180 people, targeting elderly	Around 180 people were killed over the weekend in Haiti's Cite Soleil area, Haiti's prime minister's office said Monday, after attacks that an NGO said were ordered by a gang leader who suspected his child had been made ill using witchcraft. 'A red line has been crossed,' the office said in a statement, adding it would 'mobilize all forces to track down and annihilate' those responsible, including Wharf Jeremie gang leader Monel 'Mikano' Felix, whom it accused of planning the attack. It said the victims were mostly elderly. The National Human Rights Defense Network (RNDDH), an NGO in Haiti that monitors state institutions and promotes human rights education, said Sunday at least 110 people — all aged over 60 — had been killed in Cite Soleil over the weekend. It later said the death toll could be higher and cited witnesses as saying that 'mutilated bodies were burned in the streets, including several young individuals who were killed [while] attempting to save residents.' RNDDH said Felix had ordered the violence after his child became sick, and after seeking advice from a voodoo priest who accused elderly people in the area of harming the child through witchcraft. The group said Felix's child had died Saturday afternoon. Reuters was not able to independently verify the events outlined by RNDDH. Felix did not immediately comment on the accusations. Cite Soleil, a densely populated slum by the port of the capital Port-au-Prince, is among the poorest and most violent areas of Haiti. Tight gang control, including the restriction of mobile phone use, has limited residents' ability to share information about the massacre. The government, riven with political infighting, has struggled to contain the gangs' growing power in and around the capital. The armed groups are accused of indiscriminate killings, gang rapes, ransom kidnappings and fueling critical food shortages. In October, the Gran Grif gang took responsibility for the killing of at least 115 people in Pont-Sonde, a town in Haiti's breadbasket Artibonite region. They said it was retaliation for residents helping a self-defense group hinder their road toll operations. Calls for U.N. peacekeepers A U.N.-backed security mission was requested by Haiti in 2022 and approved a year later but so far has just partially deployed and remains deeply under-resourced. Haitian leaders have called for the Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support mission to be converted into a U.N. peacekeeping force to ensure it is better supplied, but the plan stalled amid opposition from China and Russia in the Security Council. Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for the U.N. secretary-general, said the weekend's death count was at least 184, including 127 elderly people. 'The secretary-general reiterates his pressing call to Member States to provide the Multinational Security Support mission the financial and logistical support required to successfully assist the Haitian National Police,' he said. A White House security spokesperson echoed the call for urgent international support for the mission and said the United States was 'appalled.' Dujarric also called for an acceleration of the political transition within Haiti. Haiti's transitional government has said it plans to hold long-awaited elections in 2025, provided there is sufficient security for a free and fair vote. The security situation has, however, continued to deteriorate, and many countries have yet to deliver on pledges of support. Volker Turk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, urged countries to improve efforts to stop arms trafficking to Haiti. The U.N. estimates the gangs' increasingly modern arsenals are largely trafficked from the United States. 'These latest killings bring the death toll just this year in Haiti to a staggering 5,000 people,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-gang-massacres-around-180-people-targeting-elderly/7893554.html	2024-12-09T16:47:11-08:00	
Syrian refugees in Turkey gather at border crossings to return to their homeland	KILIS / IZMIRl, TURKEY — Hundreds of Syrian refugees lined up Monday at Turkey’s southern Oncupinar border crossing in Kilis province to return to their homeland after the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Syrians who spoke to VOA Turkish said they were happy to soon be back in their country, as they saw a new beginning there. Muhammed Taha, who crossed into Turkey in 2014, was among the Syrians in line at the crossing to return to his hometown of Aleppo with his five children, four of whom were born in Turkey. 'Justice has been served,' Taha said. 'I could not return to my country before because of the war. Thank God, the war is over. The clashes have ended.' He added, 'I will apply to go to my hometown, Aleppo, with my five children soon. I believe we will be more peaceful there. I will be reunited with my relatives and friends there.' Many Syrians expressed their wish to reconstruct their war-torn country after their return. Ahmed Mansur, who came to the border crossing from southern Gaziantep province with his parents and family of four, thanked Turkey for hosting them during the war in Syria, but stated that this is the time to return home. 'Assad destroyed our country. Thank God, he fled in the end. We will start everything from scratch in our country. We will repair our destroyed homes and try to hold on to life by working there,' Mansur told VOA Turkish. Before returning, Syrians must hand over to authorities the temporary identity cards they received in Turkey and sign the voluntary return form. Refugees from Aleppo Most of the Syrians at the border crossing were from Aleppo, which the rebel forces, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, captured in a lightning offensive last week. According to Turkey’s Presidency of Migration Management, 2.9 million Syrians were under temporary protection as of November 28, as Turkey does not give refugee status to Syrians, citing its geographical limitation to the 1951 Geneva Convention. Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said Monday that over 1.2 million Syrians in Turkey are from Aleppo. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced Monday that Turkey opened its Yayladagi border gate, which has been closed since 2013, to facilitate the safe and voluntary return of Syrians. 'We will also manage the processing of immigrants' voluntary returns in a way befitting our hosting,' Erdogan said. Concerns While the collapse of the 61-year-long Baathist regime was widely celebrated by Syrians in Turkey, returning is no longer that easy for some after more than a decade living abroad. Emine Afare, 36, is among the refugees who are undecided about returning. After leaving Aleppo in 2013, she now resides in the Basmane district of Izmir, which hosts a large Syrian and African immigrant community. Afare said she could not describe the joy she felt at the release of many of her relatives who were imprisoned by the Assad regime. However, she said she believed that a strong social and economic infrastructure was needed after the yearslong conflict. 'According to the news we received from Aleppo, 20% of education and health services are operating. It will take at least two years to complete this. Electricity and water must be provided. Our homes, hospitals and schools must be rebuilt. This requires a lot of work. I will then decide to return,' she told VOA Turkish. The mother of two children who were born in Turkey, Afare said her 8-year-old daughter does not speak Arabic, and Syria is now a foreign country to her. 'There is a generation born in Turkey. Since 2011, this generation has received education in Turkey and adopted Turkish culture. They are now foreigners to Syria,' she said. 'We are thinking about how these children will integrate into Syria.' Muhammed Salih Ali, head of the Association for Solidarity with Syrian Refugees in Izmir, reiterated Afare’s concerns about the younger generation. 'Social adaptation is now required for them to return to Syria. It is very difficult for this generation to return. But if their family has their own land, they will have to go with them. But they will have a hard time,' he said. Ali, who fled Al-Hasakah and settled in Turkey 25 years ago, believes that the number of people returning to Syria will increase from now on. 'I have waited for this moment for 25 years. I cannot describe my happiness that this oppression has ended,' he said. Ali thinks that more than half of the Syrian refugees in Turkey will return to Syria, as many of them are landowners. But he emphasized that there is a dire need for help to reconstruct the country. 'Syria alone does not have the means to do this. The Syrians will return. The people will start over, but many means need to be provided. We are calling on every country, asking them to help us,' he said.

Mozambique political unrest disrupts Eswatini sugar exports	Mbabane, Eswatini — In the wake of political turmoil and protests in Mozambique, Eswatini’s sugar industry has faced disruptions to supply chains and exports and has had to find alternative routes for its products. Eswatini's sugar industry depends heavily on a terminal at the port of Maputo, Mozambique, to send its raw sugar to the European Union and the United States. This terminal, jointly owned by Eswatini, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, has been vital for the country's sugar industry since the mid-1990s. Nontobeko Mabuza, with the Eswatini Sugar Association (ESA), warned that the unrest in Mozambique poses a grave threat to Eswatini's exports to regional and European markets. 'The option, however, is for us to move the sugar via the Durban [South Africa] port, but this would come at an additional cost,' Mabuza said. 'For consistency and safe delivery, our customers might choose to migrate to using the Durban port as the port from which we ship. This would, however, strain the transport infrastructure and potentially, as I said earlier, come at an additional cost, and it would possibly also cause longer turnaround times as the shipments are diverted' from Mozambique to South Africa. In 2023, the ESA generated $305 million from more than 26,000 tons of sugar exports to the United States and other markets via the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act. But according to Bhekizwe Maziya, chief executive of the national agriculture marketing board, Mozambique’s instability caused severe traffic congestion and delays at the borders with Eswatini. What was mainly happening, Maziya said, was closure of the Lebombo border post between South Africa and Mozambique. 'So transport had to be rerouted to Eswatini from South Africa and en route to Mozambique. The effects were the congestions at our borders and the delays that were experienced by importers and exporters.' The protests led by opposition presidential candidate Venancio Mondlane, who says he won the recent election, have resulted in a complete shutdown of traffic on Mozambique’s major roads, plus violent confrontations with security forces that have left more than 100 people dead. Mozambican political activist Solomon Mondlane said the instability could have far-reaching consequences for southern African economies as landlocked countries like Eswatini struggle to find other export routes for their goods. 'With the unrest showing no signs of abating, it is essential for neighboring countries to assess their own trade dependency on Mozambique and identify alternative routes if necessary to mitigate potential disruptions,' Mondlane said. Political analyst Sibusiso Nhlabatsi said the Southern African Development Community must strengthen its conflict management strategies in the face of internal conflicts within member states, like Mozambique, by establishing a framework for accountability and ensuring member states are responsible for their impact on regional stability.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-political-unrest-disrupts-eswatini-sugar-exports-/7893536.html	2024-12-09T16:18:48-08:00	
Ethnic armed group claims capture of key western Myanmar border	BANGKOK — One of the most powerful ethnic minority armed groups battling Myanmar’s army has claimed the capture of the last army outpost in the strategic western town of Maungdaw, gaining full control of the 271-kilometer (168-mile) border with Bangladesh. The capture by the Arakan Army makes the group’s control of the northern part of Rakhine state complete and marks another advance in its bid for self-rule there. Rakhine has become a focal point for Myanmar’s nationwide civil war, in which pro-democracy guerrillas and ethnic minority armed forces seeking autonomy battle the country’s military rulers, who took power in 2021 after the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Khaing Thukha, a spokesperson for the Arakan Army, told The Associated Press by text message from an undisclosed location late Monday that his group had seized the last remaining military outpost in Maungdaw on Sunday. Outpost commander Brigadier General Thurein Tun was captured while attempting to flee the battle, Khaing Thukha said. The situation in Maungdaw could not be independently confirmed, with access to the internet and mobile phone services in the area mostly cut off. Myanmar’s military government did not immediately comment. Maungdaw, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, has been the target since June of an Arakan Army offensive. The group captured Paletwa and Buthidaung, two other towns on the border with Bangladesh, earlier this year. Since November 2023, the Arakan Army has gained control of 11 of Rakhine’s 17 townships, along with one in neighboring Chin state. Ann, a town in Rakhine that hosts the strategically important military headquarters overseeing the western part of the country, appears to be on the verge of falling entirely to the Arakan Army. The group said in a statement posted on the Telegram messaging app late Friday that it had taken more than 30 military outposts, except the army’s western command, which controls Rakhine and the southern part of neighboring Chin state, as well as the country’s territorial waters in the Bay of Bengal. Recent fighting in Rakhine has raised fears of a revival of organized violence against members of the Muslim Rohingya minority, similar to what drove at least 740,000 members of their community in 2017 to flee to neighboring Bangladesh for safety. The Arakan Army, which is the military wing of the Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group in Rakhine state, where they are the majority and seek autonomy from Myanmar’s central government, denies the allegations, though witnesses have described the group’s actions to the AP and other media. Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for generations, but they are widely regarded by many in the country’s Buddhist majority, including members of the Rakhine minority, as having illegally migrated from Bangladesh. The Rohingya face a great amount of prejudice and are generally denied citizenship and other basic rights. The border between Myanmar and Bangladesh extends from land to the Naf River and offshore in the Bay of Bengal. The Arakan Army said Sunday it had ordered the suspension of transport across the Naf River because police and local Muslims affiliated with the army were attempting to escape by boat to Bangladesh. The rebel group has been accused of major human rights violations, particularly involving its capture of the town of Buthidaung in mid-May, when it was accused of forcing an estimated 200,000 residents, largely Rohingyas, to leave, and then setting fire to most of the buildings. It was accused of attacking Rohingya civilians fleeing fighting in Maungdaw in August. The Arakan Army is also part of an armed ethnic alliance that launched an offensive in northeastern Myanmar in October last year and gained strategic territory along the border with China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethnic-armed-group-claims-capture-of-key-western-myanmar-border/7893273.html	2024-12-09T15:39:20-08:00	
Zelenskyy says he is open to negotiated end to war with Russia	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday he is open to the possibility of a diplomatic resolution to the country’s war with Russia. 'Ukraine wants this war to end more than anyone else. No doubt, a diplomatic resolution would save more lives. We do seek it,' the Ukrainian president said Monday at a joint press conference in Kyiv with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz. Zelenskyy also said he is open to the possibility of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine to help his country end its war with Russia, a conflict that has been ongoing for nearly three years. 'But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the European Union and when Ukraine will be in NATO,' Zelenskyy said. On his Telegram channel, the Ukrainian leader said the deployment of troops to Ukraine would be a step forward for the Eastern European country’s quest to join NATO. Zelenskyy’s openness to a negotiated end to the conflict with Russia and the presence of Western troops in Ukraine coincides with Russia’s recent gains in Ukraine and the upcoming inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Trump met with Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris over the weekend. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said he plans to call U.S. President Joe Biden soon about Ukraine joining NATO. 'He is the current president, and a lot rides on his opinion. And there is no point in discussing with President Trump something that is not up to him today — while he is not yet in the White House,' Zelenskyy said. Trump has said he wants the war between Russia and Ukraine to end quickly and has called for a ceasefire and negotiations to end the largest conflict in Europe since World War II. However, Zelenskyy told the New York Post that while Trump wants a ceasefire, the two leaders have not discussed any details about that arrangement. Merz, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's challenger in the upcoming German election, said at the joint address with Zelenskyy that the 'basic consensus' in Germany is that Germany will continue to supply Ukraine with military aid. In his meetings with Zelenskyy, Merz did, however, note that Germany’s position on Ukraine differs from the stance that France, the U.S. and the U.K. have taken on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 'Our position is clear, as is that of my parliamentary group: We want to put your army in a position to reach military bases in Russia — not the civilian population, not the infrastructure — but the military targets from which your country is being fought,' he said. 'With this range restriction, we are forcing your country to fight with one hand behind its back,' he said. Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 18 drones that Russian forces deployed in overnight attacks. The Ukrainian air force said the intercepts took place over the Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Khmelnytsky, Odesa, Poltava, Rivne, Sumy, Ternopil and Vinnytsia regions. There were no reports of casualties or major damage. Ukrainian air defenses also shot down two Russian guided missiles, the military said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday its air defenses destroyed 13 Ukrainian aerial drones. Most of the drones were shot down near the Russia-Ukraine border in the Belgorod and Rostov regions. Two of the drones were destroyed over Astrakhan, located about 200 kilometers from the border. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-says-he-is-open-to-negotiated-end-to-war-with-russia-/7893258.html	2024-12-09T15:14:20-08:00	
Unemployment continues to plague China’s youth in 2024	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — FILE - A recruiter talks with an applicant at a booth at a job fair at a shopping center in Beijing, on June 9, 2023. A record of more than one in five young Chinese are out of work, their career ambitions at least temporarily derailed by a depressed job market as the economy struggles to regain momentum after its long bout with COVID-19 Melody Xie thought 2024 would be the year for her to start the next chapter of her life as an adult in China: finding a job, getting married and eventually having children. But after sending out hundreds of resumes and failing to pass two civil service exams, the 24-year-old college graduate remains unemployed and has had no choice but to move back in with her parents who live in the southern city of Guangzhou. 'It’s been a year since I graduated from university but I have no income, no savings and no social life,' she told VOA in a written response on November 28. Like Xie, hundreds of thousands of young people in China have struggled to find ideal full-time jobs throughout 2024. While the Chinese government has introduced some fiscal measures to boost the sluggish economy in October, China’s youth unemployment remains high. Since July, China’s unemployment rate for youth between 16 and 24 has remained above 17%. While some Chinese state media outlets claim the youth unemployment rate has improved since October, the economic downturn has been exacerbating China’s unemployment problem for several years, said Dali Yang, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Chicago. 'There is a backlog of youths who were supposed to be joining the labor force over the last two to three years, but they didn’t do very well in the job market,' he told VOA by phone. 'As a new cohort of youth graduating from college each year, that makes the job market very tough for the college graduates,' he added. In addition to the large number of unemployed college graduates in the job market, Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch, told VOA that poor working conditions in the country are also discouraging many educated young people in China from looking for full-time jobs. 'Many Chinese businesses will ask employees to work 12 to 16 hours a day, and they expect employees to work six or seven days a week,' Li said. 'Most young people in China are not willing to accept these jobs with tough working conditions, so that has also led to an increase in youth unemployment rate,' he told VOA by phone. Linda Liu, a 25-year-old former project manager at a tech company in China’s Guangxi province, said jobs in some rural towns in China often offer very poor pay and almost no benefits. 'After being laid off from my job at a tech company in Guangzhou at the beginning of 2023, I moved back to my hometown in Guangxi province and soon found a job there,' she told VOA in a written response. 'But since the pay was very low and I can only take four days off each month, I quit after less than six months,' Liu added. While some young Chinese are still looking for jobs, others have decided to 'lie flat' or quit without backup plans. 'After being laid off in 2021, I left Beijing and moved to the southwestern Yunnan province for two years,' Celine Liu, a 26-year-old former law firm clerk, told VOA in a recorded response. 'At the time, I wanted to pull myself away from the hectic lifestyle in the big city and figure out what I wanted to pursue in my life. But after moving back to Beijing earlier this year, I realized I could no longer adapt to life in the big city, and that has also affected my ability to do well in job interviews,' she added. The idea of 'lying flat' also denotes a laid-back lifestyle that rejects intense competition and societal expectations. In recent years, many young Chinese people have chosen to 'retire' to rural parts of the country with a lower cost of living to cope with the ongoing unemployment challenges. Some of them turn to e-commerce as a source of income. Others see quitting without a backup plan as an opportunity for them to slow down and enjoy life. 'Many young people in China, including myself, follow the typical pattern of entering college, finding a job after graduation, getting married and having children, but we often don’t know what kind of future we want,' said Victor Wang, a 26-year-old former engineer in the Chinese city of Zhejiang. 'After quitting without a backup plan, I finally have a chance to take care of my physical and mental health, and it finally feels like I’m in control of my life,' he told VOA in a written response. As the youth unemployment rate remains high in China, Ye Liu, an expert on international development at King’s College London, told VOA, young people in China might 'diversify' their work patterns. 'More young people [will engage] in freelancing, part-time employment and [work] multiple jobs,' she said. China will host an annual economic work conference this week and youth unemployment is expected to be one of several topics discussed by top Chinese officials during the event. Discussion of the topic remains sensitive on the internet in China and social media platforms. Last week, a commentary about China’s weak consumption, unemployment and 'dispirited' youth by Gao Shanwen, chief economist of China’s state-owned SDIC Securities, was removed by China’s internet censors. Additionally, access to Chinese economist Fu Peng’s video social media account was blocked after he commented on China’s weaker consumption at a conference in September. The Chinese government has introduced some measures to boost employment opportunities for college graduates, including rolling out campus recruitment activities and increasing job placement rates for unemployed youth. China’s state news outlet, People’s Daily Online, reported more than 1,000 employers from around the country 'are expected to offer more than 30,000 education-related positions.' However, Li at China Labor Watch said unless the Chinese authorities try to fundamentally improve working conditions and strengthen protection for workers’ benefits, China’s youth unemployment problem is unlikely to improve within the next five years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unemployment-continues-to-plague-china-s-youth-in-2024-/7892948.html	2024-12-09T14:29:33-08:00

At UN climate hearing, China rebuffs bid to clarify states’ legal obligations	After years of resisting international pressure to meet financial obligations for combating climate change, China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases —according to public data — is seeking to avoid legal accountability at the International Court of Justice, or ICJ, in The Hague. Since last week, more than 100 countries and organizations have presented arguments at the world’s highest court regarding states' responsibilities for climate change and whether high-emitting nations should be held accountable for the harm they have caused. Island nations and other climate-vulnerable countries — contributing little to global greenhouse gas emissions but losing territory to rising sea levels — are demanding legal accountability from polluting nations. Amid concerns that the court might establish new legal grounds for climate-related litigation, Ma Xinmin, China’s representative, argued against liability for global warming. 'GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions do not constitute internationally wrongful acts under general international law,' Ma stated. According to a report by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, more than 2,000 climate litigation cases have been filed worldwide, but most claimants face significant challenges in achieving favorable outcomes. 'If there was some finding in the advisory opinion that there was a liability that could spark litigation elsewhere presumably. 'said Alice Hill, a senior fellow for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former special assistant to President Barack Obama for climate change policies, in an interview with VOA. Earlier this year, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea issued a landmark advisory opinion clarifying states’ legal obligations to address marine pollution caused by climate change. This case set a significant precedent for future decisions on international legal duties. China, however, argued in a written submission that the tribunal lacked the authority to issue advisory opinions, stating, 'The Tribunal’s aforementioned reasoning is inconsistent with the rules of treaty interpretation.' In addition to China, the United States argued last week against new legal frameworks to deal with climate change obligations, marking a rare moment of alignment between the two geopolitical rivals on the global stage. 'Any other legal obligations related to climate change mitigation identified by the court should be interpreted consistently with states’ obligations under this treaty regime,' argued Margaret Taylor, a legal adviser to the U.S. State Department. 'Neither of them wants to have any new form of liability for emissions they may have caused.' said Hill of the Council on Foreign Relations. Nikki Reisch, climate and energy director at the Center for International Environmental Law, stated in an email to VOA, 'In its arguments before the ICJ, China has ultimately aligned itself with other major polluters,' she added. China benefiting from the status quo In 1992, when China was classified as a developing country under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, its historical emissions were about 41% of those of the EU. Today, China’s cumulative emissions have now caused more global warming than the 27 member states of the EU combined, according to a recent analysis by the U.K.-based climate website Carbon Brief. Under the current framework, including the agreement reached at last month’s COP29 U.N. Climate Summit, China is not required to make financial contributions to offset the global costs of its pollution but is merely 'encouraged' to do so. The country claims that since 2016, it has provided and mobilized more than $24 billion to help developing nations tackle climate challenges. Reisch noted that the weaknesses of existing climate mechanisms have worked to China’s advantage. 'The decades-old climate negotiations are a space that China can navigate to advantage, and use in a running battle with the West,' Reisch said. 'That, while rightfully focused on the historical responsibility of the world’s largest cumulative emitters, all too conveniently obscures China’s own role in the climate crisis today.' Reisch said. Ma Xinmin argued before the court that existing U.N. treaties should remain the cornerstone for determining states’ obligations. 'China hopes that the court will uphold the U.N. climate change negotiation mechanism as the primary channel for global climate governance,' Ma said. Dean Baker, senior economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, noted that China's emissions have peaked and are expected to decline in the coming years. He also highlighted the country is doing an enormous amount in terms of rapidly switching to electric vehicles and ramping up clean energy production. 'However, it does not want to tie itself to international commitments, even though it is likely to exceed any plausible green standards,' Baker told VOA in an email.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-climate-hearing-china-rebuffs-bid-to-clarify-states-legal-obligations/7893190.html	2024-12-09T13:55:46-08:00	
US making 'intensive efforts' to find journalist Austin Tice in Syria	WASHINGTON — In the aftermath of the fall of the Bashar al-Assad government in Syria, U.S. officials say they continue to work to locate American journalist Austin Tice, who has been detained in the country for more than 12 years. 'There are intensive efforts under way by the United States to find Austin Tice and bring him home to his family,' State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters Monday. He added that Roger Carstens, U.S. special envoy for hostage affairs, is currently in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, working to secure Tice’s release. 'We will not rest until [Tice] is returned home safely to his loved ones,' said Miller. The rapid ousting of Assad has fostered cautious hope among Tice’s family that he will be released soon. 'What we’re hoping is that as people that are coming into Damascus are opening the prisons, that by the power of God, they’ll open the one that Austin’s in,' Tice’s mother, Debra, told VOA on Sunday. 'We’re already believing that the door is going to be open.' Citing a source vetted by the U.S. government, she told VOA that her son is being held in a prison in Damascus. Debra Tice has for years criticized the U.S. government for what she says is a long-term failure to do enough to secure her son’s release. Led by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Syrian rebels declared that they had toppled Assad after seizing control of the capital, Damascus, on Sunday. The move prompted Assad to flee, ending his family’s decades-long autocratic rule, including more than 13 years of civil war. Over the past week, rebels took control of the major Syrian cities of Aleppo and Hama, and finally the capital. In those cities, thousands of prisoners have been released from prisons run by the now-deposed Assad government. The Syrian opposition plans to establish a commission to find Tice and others who disappeared under the Assad government, the coalition leader told NBC News. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States is working with regional partners to underscore to all parties the need to protect civilian populations. 'We continue to seek information about Austin Tice so that we can find him and bring him home to his family,' Blinken said Monday at the State Department. A Texas native and former U.S. Marine, Tice has been held in Syria since 2012, when he was detained at a checkpoint in Damascus. Aside from a brief video after his capture, little has been heard or seen of him since. President Joe Biden on Sunday also reaffirmed his commitment to securing Tice’s release from Syria. 'We remain committed to returning him to his family,' he said in remarks at the White House. 'We believe he is alive. We think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence of that yet,' the president added. In response to a question about a potential rescue operation to retrieve Tice, Biden said the U.S. first must identify where he is located. The FBI said Sunday that it is still offering a reward of up to $1 million for information that leads to Tice’s safe return. Tice is an award-winning freelance journalist and photographer who works for outlets that include The Washington Post, CBS and McClatchy. He is the longest-held American journalist abroad.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-making-intensive-efforts-to-find-journalist-austin-tice-in-syria/7893208.html	2024-12-09T13:51:59-08:00

Despairing Syrians search notorious Sednaya prison for missing relatives	SEDNAYA, Syria — As families desperately scoured the filthy cells of Syria's forbidding Sednaya prison on Monday for any sign of long-detained relatives after its gates were flung open by rebels, hope for finding missing loved ones began to fade. Thousands of prisoners spilled out of President Bashar Assad's pitiless detention system after he was toppled on Sunday, sometimes to tearful reunions with relatives who believed they had been executed years earlier. But countless families were still trawling dark corridors and hidden cells in the labyrinthine complex for a trace of loved ones detained for attending protests, defying authorities or simply voicing discontent. Ahmed Najjar had come to Damascus from Aleppo, hoping to find his brother's two children, seized by Assad's security forces in 2012. 'We're looking. They're saying there's an underground prison,' he said. Rumors spread on Sunday that thousands more inmates were still imprisoned in underground cells that could not be reached. The White Helmets rescue organization, which for years has dug through fallen buildings after airstrikes, deployed a team. 'They had a map from a defected Syrian army officer and broke down one wall and found nothing,' said one of the rescue workers. 'They broke a second and found a door.' But by Monday afternoon there was no sign of more prisoners. Outside, Intsar al-Jaber sat waiting for news. The 45-year-old's brother and cousin were imprisoned in Sednaya, but she had not been allowed to see them since 2014. 'They told me then that my brother was dead and not to come back. [They said,] 'Your brother is a terrorist, and he died, so there's nothing for you here. Don't come.'' But she continued to wait and hope. At a mosque on the road to the prison, people were registering names and phone numbers in case imprisoned relatives were found. One woman said she had seen her son in a screenshot of released prisoners on Sunday. Rights groups have reported mass executions in Syria's prisons, and the United States said in 2017 it had identified a new crematorium at Sednaya for hanged prisoners. Torture was widely documented. Videos have emerged of some shaven-headed, near-skeletal prisoners barely able to give their names or say where they were from. Reuters was not able to verify them all, but the large-scale freeing of prisoners is not in dispute. Inside the solitary confinement cells, there was water and mud on the concrete floors. Each had a single metal bowl for food. Excrement lay around. People searching the prison rifled through discarded papers and asked former inmates if they knew of routes to other stories, while others smashed down walls or drilled into the floor searching for hidden cells. Several times, a breakthrough revealed a hidden hallway, prompting bursts of gunfire from rebels to alert the thousands waiting. Each time, a crowd dashed forward. One woman screamed, 'My son, I'm coming, I'm coming,' while another pleaded, 'God, please don't disappoint me.' A man called Mazen said Assad's police had taken 10 of his relatives including his uncle, his brother-in-law, and siblings and cousins. 'We got a video here to a secret door. I gave it to the rescue workers. They are trying to dig, but they haven't got anything yet,' he said. Fadel Abdul Ghany, who heads the Syrian Network for Human Rights, said the fact that the prison doors had simply been flung open had made it harder to trace inmates, and set genuine criminals free alongside political prisoners. 'They need to run this as well, just like they’re trying to manage other things, keep things under control,' he said. Outside the prison, where traffic once passed quickly, with passengers' eyes averted, a long queue of cars waited to get in while others scrambled across the scrubby countryside on foot and cut barbed wire fences to join the crowds searching inside. One of those, Radwan Eid, called Sednaya 'the human butcher's shop.' 'The blood that was spilled here cannot just run,' he said. 'They must be held to account.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/despairing-syrians-search-notorious-sednaya-prison-for-missing-relatives/7893119.html	2024-12-09T12:38:41-08:00	
NY police say man arrested with weapon 'consistent with' gun in killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO	NEW YORK — Police have arrested a 26-year-old man with a weapon consistent with the gun used to kill the head of the largest U.S. health insurer, New York's police commissioner said Monday. The man was taken into custody after police got a tip that he had been spotted at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, said NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. 'They also recovered clothing, including a mask consistent with those worn by our wanted individual,' Tisch said. 'Also recovered was a fraudulent New Jersey ID matching the ID our suspect used to check into his New York City hostel before the shooting incident,' Tisch said. UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson, 50, was killed last Wednesday in what police said was a 'brazen, targeted' attack as he walked alone to the Hilton from a nearby hotel, where UnitedHealthcare's parent company, UnitedHealth Group, was holding its annual investor conference, police said. The shooter appeared to be 'lying in wait for several minutes' before approaching the executive from behind and opening fire, Tisch said. He used a 9 mm pistol that police said resembled the guns farmers use to put down animals without causing a loud noise. In the days since the shooting, police turned to the public for help by releasing a collection of photos and video — including footage of the attack, as well as images of the suspect at a Starbucks beforehand. Photos taken in the lobby of a hostel on Manhattan's Upper West Side showed the suspect grinning after removing his mask, police said. Investigators have suggested the gunman may have been a disgruntled employee or client of the insurer. Ammunition found near Thompson's body bore the words 'delay,' 'deny' and 'depose,' mimicking a phrase used by insurance industry critics. The gunman concealed his identity with a mask during the shooting yet left a trail of evidence, including a backpack he ditched in Central Park, a cellphone found in a pedestrian plaza, and a water bottle and protein bar wrapper that police say he bought at Starbucks minutes before the attack. Monday's development came as dogs and divers returned to New York's Central Park while the dragnet for Thompson's killer stretched into a sixth day. Investigators have been combing the park since the Wednesday shooting and have been searching at least one of its ponds for three days. On Friday, police found the backpack that they say the killer discarded as he fled from the crime scene to an uptown bus station, where they believe he left the city on a bus. Retracing the gunman's steps using surveillance video, investigators say the shooter fled into Central Park on a bicycle, emerged from the park without his backpack and then ditched the bicycle. He then walked a couple of blocks and got into a taxi, arriving at the George Washington Bridge Bus Station, which is near the northern tip of Manhattan and offers commuter service to New Jersey and Greyhound routes to Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. The FBI announced late Friday that it was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction, adding to a reward of up to $10,000 that the NYPD has offered. Police say they believe the suspect acted alone. Late Saturday, police released two additional photos of the suspect that appeared to be from a camera mounted inside a taxi. The first shows him outside the vehicle and the second shows him looking through the partition between the back seat and the front of the cab. In both, his face is partially obscured by a blue mask. Through the park search, the NYPD has taken steps to minimize disruption to visitors, leading to an odd juxtaposition of joggers, tourists and an active crime scene. On Monday, a small section of the park was cordoned off with blue and white police tape, giving divers searching a pond an area to change and get in the water. K-9 units sniffed leaf-covered planters between walking paths. At one point, a group of about 30 French-speaking tourists followed a guide down a path, but they couldn't go any further because of the police tape. Before turning back, many of them whipped out their phones to snap a photo of the divers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ny-police-say-man-arrested-with-weapon-consistent-with-gun-in-killing-of-unitedhealthcare-ceo-/7893051.html	2024-12-09T11:41:35-08:00	
Veteran Daniel Penny is acquitted in NYC subway chokehold case over Jordan Neely's death	New York — A Marine veteran who used a chokehold on an agitated subway rider was acquitted on Monday in a death that became a prism for differing views about public safety, valor and vigilantism. A Manhattan jury cleared Daniel Penny of criminally negligent homicide in Jordan Neely's 2023 death. A more serious manslaughter charge was dismissed last week because the jury deadlocked on that count. Penny, who had shown little expression during the trial, briefly smiled as the verdict was read. Both applause and anger erupted in the courtroom, and Neely's father and two supporters were ushered out after audibly reacting. Another person also left, wailing with tears. 'It really, really hurts,' Neely's father, Andre Zachery, said outside the courthouse. 'I had enough of this. The system is rigged.' Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, the Democrat whose office brought the case, said prosecutors 'followed the facts and the evidence from beginning to end' and respect the verdict. There was no immediate comment from lawyers for Penny, who rushed to a waiting car after the verdict. The anonymous jury, which had started deliberating Tuesday, was escorted out of court to a van. Penny's attorneys had said he was protecting himself and other subway passengers from a volatile, mentally ill man who was making alarming remarks and gestures. The case amplified many American fault lines, among them race, politics, crime, urban life, mental illness and homelessness. Neely was Black. Penny is white. There were sometimes dueling demonstrations outside the courthouse, including Monday, when chants could be heard through the courtroom window ahead of the verdict. High-profile Republican politicians portrayed Penny as a hero while prominent Democrats attended Neely's funeral. Penny, 26, served four years in the Marines and went on to study architecture. Neely, 30, was a sometime subway performer with a tragic life story: His mother was killed and stuffed in a suitcase when he was a teenager. As a younger man, Neely did Michael Jackson tributes — complete with moonwalks — on the city's streets and subways. But Neely also struggled with mental illness after losing his mother, whose boyfriend was convicted of murdering her. He subsequently was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia, was repeatedly hospitalized, and used the synthetic cannabinoid K2 and realized it negatively affected his thinking and behavior, according to medical records seen at the trial. The drug was in his system when he died. Neely told a doctor in 2017 that being homeless, living in poverty and having to 'dig through the garbage' for food made him feel so hopeless that he sometimes thought of killing himself, hospital records show. About six years later, he boarded a subway under Manhattan on May 1, 2023, hurled his jacket onto the floor, and declared that he was hungry and thirsty and didn't care if he died or went to jail, witnesses said. Some told 911 operators that he tried to attack people or indicated he'd harm riders, and several testified that they were afraid. Neely was unarmed, with nothing but a muffin in his pocket, and didn't touch any passengers. One said he made lunging movements that alarmed her enough that she shielded her 5-year-old from him. Penny came up behind Neely, grabbed his neck, took him to the floor and 'put him out,' as the veteran told police at the scene. Passengers' video showed that at one point during the roughly six-minute hold, Neely tapped an onlooker's leg and gestured to him. Later, he briefly got an arm free. But he went still nearly a minute before Penny released him. 'He's dying,' an unseen bystander said in one video. 'Let him go!' A witness who stepped in to hold down Neely's arms testified that he told Penny to free the man, though Penny's lawyers noted the witness' story changed significantly over time. Penny told detectives shortly after the encounter that Neely threatened to kill people and the chokehold was an attempt to 'de-escalate' the situation until police could arrive. The veteran said he held on as long as he did because Neely periodically squirmed. 'I wasn't trying to injure him. I'm just trying to keep him from hurting anyone else. He's threatening people. That's what we learn in the Marine Corps,' Penny told the detectives. However, one of Penny's Marine Corps instructors testified that the veteran misused a chokehold technique he'd been taught. Prosecutors said Penny reacted far too forcefully to someone he perceived as a peril, not a person. Prosecutors also argued that any need to protect passengers quickly ebbed when the train doors opened at the next station, seconds after Penny took action. Although Penny himself told police he'd used 'a choke' or 'a chokehold,' one of his lawyers, Steven Raiser, cast it as a Marine-taught chokehold 'modified as a simple civilian restraint.' The defense lawyers contended that Penny didn't consistently apply enough pressure to kill Neely. Contradicting a city medical examiner's finding, a pathologist hired by the defense said Neely died not from the chokehold but from the combined effects of K2, schizophrenia, his struggle and restraint, and a blood condition that can lead to fatal complications during exertion. Penny did not testify, but several of his relatives, friends and fellow Marines did — describing him as an upstanding, patriotic and empathetic man. The manslaughter charge would have required proving that Penny recklessly caused Neely's death. Criminally negligent homicide involves engaging in serious 'blameworthy conduct' while not perceiving such a risk. Both charges were felonies and carried the possibility of prison time. While the criminal trial played out, Neely's father filed a wrongful death suit against Penny.	https://www.voanews.com/a/veteran-daniel-penny-is-acquitted-in-nyc-subway-chokehold-case-over-jordan-neely-s-death/7893029.html	2024-12-09T11:31:35-08:00	
Turkey eyes bigger role in Syria after Assad’s ouster	Turkey is one of the principal backers of some of the Syrian rebels who ousted Bashar al-Assad and a likely winner as Ankara seeks to gain influence in the country. However, analysts warn much will depend on whether a stable government emerges after Assad’s departure.

Germany, other European countries suspend decisions on Syrians' asylum bids after Assad's fall	BERLIN — Germany and several other European countries said Monday they are suspending decisions on asylum claims by Syrian nationals because of the unclear situation in their homeland following the fall of Bashar Assad. Germany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees said Monday that more than 47,000 applications are currently pending. It said it would reassess the situation and resume decisions once things in Syria have stabilized. Interior Ministry spokesperson Sonja Kock noted that asylum decisions take account of the circumstances of each case, which involves assessing the situation in the applicant's country. She said the migration authority has the option of prioritizing cases from other places if a situation is unclear, as it currently is in Syria. More broadly, German officials said it's too early to tell what the fall of Assad will ultimately mean for the many Syrians who sought refuge in Germany in recent years, particularly in the mid-2010s. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said it's not yet possible to predict 'concrete possibilities to return' and 'it would be unserious to speculate about this in such a volatile situation.' Her ministry said that, as of Oct. 31, there were 974,136 Syrian nationals in the country, the majority of whom had some kind of refugee or other protected status. In neighboring Austria, Chancellor Karl Nehammer also tasked his interior minister with suspending decisions on current asylum applications by Syrians, the Austria Press Agency reported. 'It is important to first establish facts, to put asylum and family reunion procedures on hold,' Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said. 'We need to wait until the dust settles, so we can see what is happening, what the next points are.' Sweden's Migration Agency said it will also pause decisions on Syrian asylum cases, arguing that it isn't possible at present to assess applicants' reasons for seeking protection. It didn't specify how long the pause would last, but said a similar decision was made in connection with the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. In Finland, the director of the Department for International Protection at the Finnish Immigration Service, Antti Lehtinen, told public broadcaster YLE that decisions have been suspended there, and he can't immediately estimate when they will resume. In Norway, the Directorate of Immigration announced a similar decision, saying that it has put asylum applications from Syria on hold 'until further notice.' France says it was considering following Germany's example. 'We are working on a suspension of ongoing asylum files from Syria,' the French Interior Ministry said. 'We should reach a decision in the coming hours.' The ministry said 450 applications from Syrian citizens are pending in France.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-and-other-european-countries-suspend-decisions-on-syrians-asylum-bids-after-assad-s-fall-/7892855.html	2024-12-09T09:52:50-08:00	
China may use rare earth to retaliate against US, say analysts	NEW DELHI — China is seizing control of critical minerals including rare earth that go into the making of electric vehicles (EVs), its batteries and a range of electronic products for civilian and military uses, according to analysts. Chinese companies in recent months have stepped up efforts to procure the minerals from diverse places like Myanmar, Vietnam, Morocco and Congo, according to several reports. China’s quest for a larger share of critical minerals is significant because it is expected to use them as retaliatory tools against the U.S. if Washington decides to dramatically increase tariffs on Chinese goods, as President-elect Donald Trump has said he would do, according to analysts who spoke to VOA. 'Rare earths are a powerful tool China will use to retaliate against the Trump administration if the tariff war escalates,' Zhiqun Zhu, political scientist at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, told VOA in an emailed interview. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce recently announced tighter control over exporting several rare earth minerals to the U.S. In early December, China banned exports to the United States of the critical minerals gallium, germanium and antimony, which have widespread military applications, expanding curbs Beijing began rolling out in 2023. 'This is just the first step and a warning to the incoming administration in Washington. However, the doors are still open for negotiation to avoid a heightened tariff war,' Zhu said. Beatrix Keim, director of Germany-based Center Automotive Research, said, 'China controls the vast majority of refining capacity for rare earth and lithium, which is used for making batteries. China needs these minerals to feed its expanding new energy vehicle (NEV) sector.' 'At the same time, China is investing in relationships with several countries that supply these resources,' she added. China has 36% of the world’s rare earth reserves but controls 70% of the global supply from mines in different countries, according to Now-Gmbh, a government-run research organization in Germany. China also controls 77% of the refining capacity for rare earth, it said. 'Some of the other sources of rare earth [minerals] like Vietnam, Russia and Brazil could be considered allies of China,' Lourdes Casanova, director of Cornell University’s Emerging Markets Institute, told VOA in an email. The U.S. has significant rare earth resources at 1.8 million tons, according to U.S. Geological Survey estimates, besides being able to source from India and Australia, which have considerably higher resources. Chinese companies also control most of the mines producing cobalt, a crucial component of electric vehicle batteries and other electronics, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the London-based minerals research and pricing firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Congo accounts for 70% of the global supply of cobalt, according to International Shareholder Services (ISS) based in the U.S. state of Maryland. Myanmar tussle China is taking advantage of the clashes between the military junta and rebel groups in Myanmar to extend its influence in the rare earth mining areas of the country. Myanmar produces several types of rare earth minerals, including heavy rare earth elements, which are critical in so-called 'clean energy' technologies. The rebel group Kachin Independence Army (KIA) has taken control of the Myanmar town of Kanpaikti, on the country's border with China. Kanpaikti has rich sources of rare earth minerals. This means that China could potentially be the sole buyer, purchasing the minerals from rebel groups instead of the ruling military junta, Sreeparna Banerjee, an associate fellow at New Delhi’s Observer Research Foundation, told VOA. Chinese officials have been engaged in negotiations with rebel groups for a long time, she said. 'China stands to maintain its supply dominance by negotiating directly with the new power holders ... the Kachin Independence Army (KIA),' said Banerjee. 'This could potentially provide China with more favorable terms, as the KIA may prioritize securing revenue from a reliable buyer.' On the other hand, the ongoing conflict between the rebels and the military junta has resulted in disruption of supplies and a sharp rise in the prices of some rare earth materials, like dysprosium and terbium, Banerjee said. Bucknell’s Zhu said, 'It is not surprising that China has reached out to the rebels regarding continued mining and China's undisrupted purchase of rare earths from Myanmar.' Xi’s Morocco visit Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Morocco last month amid increasing investments by Chinese companies for manufacturing batteries used in electric vehicles. China’s Gotion High-Tech has committed $1.3 billion to build Africa’s first EV battery 'gigafactory' near Rabat, while two other Chinese companies are making battery components. 'I think China is planning to manufacture cars in Morocco that could be sold in Europe, which is a short distance away,' said Keim, of Center Automotive Research. 'That way, Chinese companies can evade high tariff rates in European countries.' In October, the European Union imposed heavy tariffs ranging from 17% to 35.3% for various types of China-made EVs. The EU justified the decision saying China subsidized its EV makers, allowing them to sell at extremely low prices in Europe. China has challenged the decision at the World Trade Organization, resulting in heightened trade tensions between Beijing and the EU. 'European EV makers are unable to compete with Chinese firms,' said Casanova, of Cornell University. 'The EU wants to protect its own companies, like the German Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW, the French Renault or the Italian Stellantis [formerly Fiat].'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-may-use-rare-earth-to-retaliate-against-us-say-analysts/7892877.html	2024-12-09T09:51:18-08:00	
Belarus' authoritarian ruler pardons 29 political prisoners amid claims of ongoing repression	TALLINN, Estonia — Belarus' authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, pardoned 29 political prisoners Monday amid what human rights groups describe as renewed oppression in the country. Belarusian officials did not provide the names of those released but said that the group included 11 women and 18 men. More than half of those pardoned had disabilities and chronic illnesses. 'All of those released repented for their actions and appealed to the head of state to be pardoned,' the presidential administration said in a statement. No prominent opposition figures, many of whom have not heard from for over a year, have been pardoned. They include Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, Siarhei Tsikhanouski, who planned to challenge Lukashenko at the ballot box in 2020 but was jailed before the vote, and Viktar Babaryka, who was also imprisoned after gaining popularity before the election. Other key figures, such as opposition activist Mikola Statkevich and lawyer Maxim Znak, who have had no contact with the outside world since the end of 2023, have also not been included. The latest announcement marks the seventh group pardon by Lukashenko in the last six months. In all, 178 political prisoners have been freed, according to Belarusian human rights group Viasna. Most were jailed following mass anti-government protests in 2020, when Lukashenko secured his sixth term in a vote widely condemned as fraudulent. The mass pardons come amid a new wave of repression as the authorities prepare to hold new presidential elections in January 2025, said Viasna spokesman Pavel Sapelka. 'Lukashenko is sending contradictory signals to the West, with twice as many people put in prison has have been pardoned,' Sapelka said. 'Repression in Belarus is still growing.' The Belarusian authorities engineer harsh conditions for political prisoners, denying them meetings with lawyers and relatives, and depriving them of medical care. At least seven political prisoners have died behind bars since 2020, according to Viasna. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for more than 30 years, is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies, allowing Russia to use his country's territory to send troops into Ukraine in February 2022 and to deploy some of its tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.	https://www.voanews.com/a/belarus-authoritarian-ruler-pardons-29-political-prisoners-amid-claims-of-ongoing-repression-/7892735.html	2024-12-09T08:36:36-08:00	
Altercation highlights chronic tension between Thailand, Myanmar over fishing rights	BANGKOK, THAILAND — A recent altercation between fishermen from Thailand and the Myanmar navy has publicized the long-running dispute between the two countries about overlapping fishing rights, experts say. In the early hours of November 30, Myanmar patrol boats fired on 15 Thai fishing vessels off Ranong province in southern Thailand. One Thai national was killed while four Thai crew members were detained along with 27 Myanmar nationals. One Thai fishing vessel, the Sor Charoenchai 8, was also seized. Thailand authorities have since been trying to negotiate with Myanmar over the release of the Thai sailors. Nikorndej Balankura, spokesman for the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters in Bangkok Friday that the four men were being taken to the town of Koh Song on the Thailand-Myanmar border. 'At this moment, the Thai township border committee is coordinating the relevant measures required to send the four crew members back to Thailand,' he said. 'It’s being discussed and aim to finalize this process as soon as possible. I sincerely hope there will be good news soon.' But as of Monday, the four still remained in Myanmar’s custody. Thai Defense Minister Phumtham Wechayachai confirmed the Thai national who died in the altercation had drowned after jumping into the sea when the Myanmar navy opened fire. The deceased was a 24-year-old who was on his first expedition, reports say. Phumtham told reporters on Monday that Thailand was still waiting for a reply from the Myanmar military government, and now is unsure of a timeline as to when the four remaining Thais will be freed. He previously said the firing of shots was an 'overreaction' from the Myanmar navy. But Myanmar’s military government maintained it acted correctly because boats were invading its waters. The regime, which is currently fighting a brutal conflict with pro-democracy resistance groups throughout the country, said it was also investigating materials found on the fishing trawler relating to Myanmar’s revolutionary groups. Thailand and Myanmar share land borders of more than 2,400 kilometers in Southeast Asia. They also share a maritime boundary of 263 kilometers in the Andaman Sea, which was officially established in 1980 through a bilateral agreement. But Thai trawlers have often crossed those maritime lines. Phil Robertson, director at Asia Human Rights Labour Advocates, says the Thai fishermen were illegally fishing. 'The Thai fishing fleets were up to their old lawless ways, conducting fishing in Myanmar’s territorial waters, and this time they got caught by the rights-abusing [Myanmar] navy that shoots first and asks questions later. This latest incident is really a repeat of previous practices on both sides,' he told VOA. Myanmar’s waters are attractive to Thai fishermen because of the rich fishing stocks available. Thailand’s fishery sector contributed to more than 2 percent of the country’s gross domestic product in 2023. Dominic Thomson, regional director of Southeast Asia for the Environmental Justice Foundation, says fishing disputes between the two countries have been going on for decades, but this incident is a first. 'Thailand and Myanmar have yet to fully resolve their maritime boundary in the Andaman Sea, leading to overlapping claims. 'The tensions over fishing rights dates back to the 1980s when Thailand massively expanded its fishing fleet due to high domestic demand for seafood, coinciding with a sharp decline in fish stocks within Thai waters. Overfishing in Thai waters therefore drove Thai fishing vessels into Myanmar’s Exclusive Economic Zone, often without permits,' he told VOA via email. Thailand was given a yellow card warning by the European Union in 2015 over its failure to combat illegal, underreported and unregulated, or IUU, fishing. The mechanism is the first step used by the EU to warn trade partners over their inaction over reducing illegal fishing. If a red card is shown to a country, it means that nation hasn't made enough progress and its fishing exports to the EU will be banned. Later that year, Thailand introduced new regulations that said Thai fishing vessels must have monitoring technology installed to warn them when they encroach on maritime border lines. It is not clear whether these warning systems were ignored, or not active when the vessels were fired at on November 30. 'There have been no reports of similar incidents since at least 2015. The nature of the incident, coupled with the detention of the fishing vessels and crew is unprecedented,' Thomson said. Robertson says questions remain over how this happened. 'Reliable sources report that there were many more Thai fishing boats engaged in this illegal fishing activity than reported, raising questions about why Thai marine regulatory agencies are failing to ensure their fishing fleets respect Burmese waters. The Thai fishermen look like victims here, but they are the core problem as well,' Robertson added. Thomson said Thailand must look at its monitoring systems to prevent a repeat incident. 'Thailand should ensure that its monitoring and control systems are adequately staffed, trained and resourced to ensure that Thai fishing vessels that stray into other countries’ waters are told to turn back as soon as possible. It is vital that there are appropriate sanctioning powers in place and consistent enforcement of these powers to deter similar intrusions in the future,' he added. Thailand is set to welcome Myanmar and other ASEAN nation members to Bangkok in a ministerial meeting on December 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/altercation-highlights-chronic-tension-between-thailand-myanmar-over-fishing-rights/7892721.html	2024-12-09T08:28:38-08:00	
China’s defense minister reappears, as military purge marches on	Taipei, Taiwan — Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun has reappeared in public after a media report claimed he was under disciplinary investigation. Analysts say that while his reappearance suggests Dong is politically safe, it does not mean China will stop its anti-corruption purge against the military. Dong attended a security forum in Shanghai last Thursday on the security situation in the Gulf of Guinea. This marked his first public appearance since taking part in a meeting with counterparts from Southeast Asian countries and the United States last month in Laos. During the forum, Dong met with heads of delegations from 18 African countries and expressed China’s willingness to strengthen maritime cooperation with regional countries and help maintain security in the Gulf of Guinea, China’s state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Prior to his re-emergence last week, the Financial Times reported on November 26 that Dong was facing an anti-corruption-related investigation, citing unnamed current and former U.S. officials. The Chinese defense ministry dismissed the report during a regular press conference on November 28, calling it a 'sheer fabrication' spread by rumor-mongers with evil motivations. However, a suspension and disciplinary investigation that the defense ministry announced November 28 against another official, Admiral Miao Hua, still raised questions about Dong’s fate. Analysts say Dong’s reappearance on December 5 signals that he is 'politically safe for now.' 'The Chinese government wants to show that Dong remains safe and, despite some changes at the top of the Chinese military, the Chinese leadership still maintains a certain level of control,' said Lin Ying-yu, an expert on the Chinese military at Tamkang University in Taiwan. Lin spoke with VOA in a phone interview. It remains unclear, however, whether Dong’s personal relationship with Miao might affect him later, said Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University, or ANU. 'Miao Hua’s role as head of political works [in the Central Military Commission] is in part akin to the Chinese military’s chief human resource officer and it means virtually any official whose career got fast-tracked over the last seven years will have to have Miao’s seal of approval,' he told VOA in a written response. He said the personal ties between Dong and Miao 'can be a big deal in political purges but can also be nothing.' Campaign intensifies Since Chinese President Xi Jinping took power in 2012, he has carried out a sweeping anti-corruption campaign against the People’s Liberation Army, or PLA. The campaign has intensified over the past year. The investigation into Miao is the latest case. At least nine generals in the PLA and several defensive industry executives have been removed from China’s national legislative body due to corruption-related charges. In June, two of Dong’s predecessors, former defense minister Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe were removed from their roles and expelled from the Chinese Communist Party amid allegations of corruption. Experts say the investigation into Miao, who is an admiral in the Chinese navy, shows how widespread and deep-rooted the problem of corruption is across different branches of the military. 'The Chinese navy was previously plagued by corruption in 2020, leading to the removal of several naval commanders. Since last year, the Chinese military’s rocket force became the focus of the Chinese authorities’ anti-corruption campaign,' said Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research. During an inspection of the PLA’s information support force on December 4, Chinese President Xi urged the military to 'improve conduct, enforce discipline and combat corruption,' emphasizing that the Chinese military 'must be entirely loyal, pure and reliable.' Sung at ANU said the investigation against Miao will likely set off 'a new round of purges inside the Chinese military.' 'Since Miao has essentially been the PLA’s head of HR, many appointees [in the PLA] need to get into his good graces, and what kind of entanglement that entails leaves a lot of room for imagination,' he told VOA. Impact on warfighting and morale Experts say that while there are legitimate reasons for Chinese authorities to root out rampant corruption in the military, Xi has used the anti-corruption campaign to maintain his control over the PLA. 'Xi uses the anti-corruption campaign to strengthen his control over the Chinese military and under this ‘reign with terror,’ it’s difficult for the military to challenge his authority,' Tamkang University’s Lin told VOA. In addition to maintaining control over the military, Xi is using the anti-corruption campaign to eliminate military commanders from other factions within the Chinese Communist Party, said Su Tzu-yun. He adds that such a vicious cycle could negatively impact morale in the military. The constant personnel reshuffling at the top level will also affect the military’s operation and long-term planning, according to Sung. Military purges 'will inevitably lead to personnel reshuffling thus slow down [the Chinese military’s] long-term planning for force building and warfighting,' he told VOA. Since Xi has urged the military to combat corruption and it is used to control the military, Lin said the pace of Beijing’s anti-corruption campaign against the PLA will likely continue in 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-defense-minister-reappears-as-military-purge-marches-on-/7892681.html	2024-12-09T08:13:37-08:00	
TikTok asks federal appeals court to bar enforcement of potential ban until Supreme Court review	TikTok asked a federal appeals court on Monday to bar the Biden administration from enforcing a law that could lead to a ban on the popular platform until the Supreme Court reviews its challenge to the statue. The legal filing was made after a panel of three judges on the same court sided with the government last week and ruled that the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban as soon as next month, was constitutional. If the law is not overturned, both TikTok and its parent ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, have claimed that the popular app will shut down by Jan. 19, 2025. TikTok has more than 170 million American users. 'Before that happens, the Supreme Court should have an opportunity, as the only court with appellate jurisdiction over this action, to decide whether to review this exceptionally important case,' attorneys for the two companies wrote in the legal filing on Monday. It's not clear if the Supreme Court will take up the case. President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok the last time he was in the White House, has said he is now against such action. In their legal filing, the two companies pointed to the political realities, saying that an injunction would provide a 'modest delay' that would give 'the incoming Administration time to determine its position — which could moot both the impending harms and the need for Supreme Court review.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tiktok-asks-federal-appeals-court-to-bar-enforcement-of-potential-ban-until-supreme-court-review-/7892664.html	2024-12-09T07:51:58-08:00

Emilia Perez,' 'The Brutalist' lead Golden Globe film nominations	BEVERLY HILLS, California — Musical thriller 'Emilia Perez' and historical epic 'The Brutalist' led the roster of films nominated on Monday for the 2025 Golden Globes, the Hollywood honors that kick off the movie awards season leading to the Oscars. 'Emilia Perez,' released by Netflix NFLX.O, scored 10 nods and 'The Brutalist,' from independent distributor A24, earned seven. Taking home a Globe can help movies in the race to the Academy Awards in March. Last year's Hollywood strikes scrambled this year's release schedule, and awards pundits say there is no clear frontrunner for best picture at the Oscars. The Globe winners will be chosen by 334 entertainment journalists from 85 countries and will be announced Jan. 5 at a ceremony broadcast live on CBS and streamed on Paramount+.

Tonga PM abruptly resigns following rift with king	Nuku'alofa, Tonga — Tonga's Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni abruptly resigned on Monday, stepping down in the wake of a power struggle with the Pacific nation's royal family. Sovaleni has butted heads with Tonga's influential King Tupou VI, fueling speculation of a deepening rift between the royals and his government. In cryptic remarks delivered before announcing his shock resignation, Sovaleni suggested the country's nobility was 'fearful' of losing its sway. 'I thought this land had been given freedom, but there's still enslavement,' he told parliament through tears. 'I hope there's a time where we'll work together. If the nobility can do it and we can work together, we can achieve great things.' Sovaleni resigned before facing a vote of no confidence brought on by opposition lawmakers on Monday afternoon. Tonga's hereditary nobles occupy nine seats in the country's 26-member legislative assembly. If the nobles voted as a bloc alongside the opposition, they would have enough numbers to force Sovaleni out. It was not immediately clear who would replace Oxford-educated Sovaleni, who has been prime minister since 2021. Veteran politician and longtime rival 'Aisake Eke loomed as one of the the likely frontrunners. The line of Tongan kings and queens stretches back more than 1,000 years, according to a government history. Although the monarchy no longer enjoys the unbridled power of old, it remains one of the most dominant institutions across the Tongan archipelago. King Tupou VI penned a letter earlier this year saying he no longer had 'confidence' in Sovaleni as Tonga's armed forces minister. Bad blood Sovaleni refused to stand down from the portfolio, sparking a tense standoff between two of Tonga's most powerful figures. Eventually Sovaleni backed down, delivering a traditional apology to the king and resigning from the armed forces ministry. Although the details of the disagreement remain a mystery, it appears this was not enough to quell the bad blood between the two. Tonga overhauled its constitution after pro-democracy protests in 2006, which spiralled into angry riots that left swathes of capital Nuku'alofa in smoking ruins. At the time, the Tongan king held immense sway as the country's head of state, head of government, and military commander-in-chief. Although the monarchy eventually agreed to devolve much of its responsibility to a cabinet of elected lawmakers, its power has not been totally diluted. The king still has the power to veto legislation, and appoints the prime minister on the advice of the Tongan parliament. A developing country of some 106,000 people spread across dozens of islands, Tonga's debt-laden government is seen as particularly vulnerable to economic pressure from China. The island kingdom owes China's export bank around $130 million – almost a third of its GDP – which was loaned to help rebuild after the 2006 riots Repayments on that loan were scheduled to start spiking this year. Sovaleni was first elected to parliament in 2014 and served as deputy prime minister from 2014-17, then became education minister in 2019.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tonga-pm-abruptly-resigns-following-rift-with-king-/7892532.html	2024-12-09T06:23:54-08:00	
China launches anti-monopoly probe into Nvidia	BEIJING — China on Monday said it has launched an investigation into U.S. chip maker Nvidia over suspected violations of the country's anti-monopoly law, in a move that will likely be seen as a retaliatory move against Washington's recent chip curbs. The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said Nvidia is also suspected of violating commitments it made during its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd, according to terms outlined in the regulator's 2020 conditional approval of that deal. It did not elaborate on how Nvidia might have violated China's anti-monopoly laws. Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company's shares fell 2.2% in premarket trading after the Chinese regulator's announcement. The investigation comes after the U.S. last week launched its third crackdown in three years on China's semiconductor industry, which saw Washington curb exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment makers. Nvidia has enjoyed booming demand from China, though this has been dented over the past year by U.S. efforts to stop China from acquiring the world's most advanced chips. Before the U.S. curbs, Nvidia dominated China's AI chip market with more than 90 per cent share. However, it currently faces increasing competition from domestic rivals, chief among them being Huawei. When the U.S. firm made a $6.9 billion bid to acquire Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies in 2019 there were concerns that China could block the deal due to U.S.-China trade frictions. Beijing however later approved the deal in 2020 with multiple conditions for Nvidia and the merged entity's China operations, including prohibitions on forced product bundling, unreasonable trading terms, purchase restrictions, and discriminatory treatment of customers who buy products separately.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-launches-anti-monopoly-probe-into-nvidia-/7892526.html	2024-12-09T06:09:19-08:00	
Head of UN human rights promises advice to FIFA and Saudi Arabia over 2034 World Cup issues	Geneva — Two days before FIFA confirms Saudi Arabia as the 2034 World Cup host, the United Nations' top human rights official pledged Monday to try to ensure migrant labor standards are 'properly respected' around the tournament. Saudi Arabia is the only candidate and sure to win Wednesday when FIFA will ask an online meeting of its 211 member federations to award the 2034 hosting rights by acclaim without an itemized vote. The oil-rich kingdom's World Cup plan needs to build eight of the 15 promised stadiums from scratch, plus add 175,000 hotel rooms. It will rely heavily on migrant workers, often from South Asia, within a labor law framework that activist groups say does not protect them. On Monday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, said his organization in Geneva was not directly engaged by FIFA on World Cup issues. 'What we are involved in though is to make sure that indeed, in each and every major sporting event, human rights are part and parcel of the way that sports events are not only conceived but also conducted,' Türk said at a news conference on the eve of the UN's annual Human Rights Day. Critics of FIFA say a Saudi-hosted World Cup risks repeating rights abuses seen during a decade of similar preparations for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Allegations of widespread labor abuses in Saudi Arabia are already part of an investigation by the UN-backed International Labor Organization (ILO) after a formal complaint by trade unions. Two United States senators have cited human rights in urging FIFA to find a different host for its marquee men's event that earns billions of dollars in profit for the soccer body. 'Whatever the decision is, to whoever is going to organize it, we will provide precisely that type of advice to the organizers,' Türk, an Austrian lawyer, said. 'That will include also, of course, the need to make sure that migrant labor standards are properly respected and all the various other human rights dimensions of major sporting events.' FIFA has been criticized for not using its leverage ahead of the World Cup decision with Saudi Arabia, despite its president Gianni Infantino building close ties to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saudi officials made some promises in a formal bid document to engage with the ILO and domestic agencies but not international groups like unions and rights groups that have limited or no access to work in the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/head-of-un-human-rights-promises-advice-to-fifa-and-saudi-arabia-over-2034-world-cup-issues-/7892422.html	2024-12-09T05:09:47-08:00	
Sent back to Cambodia from Thailand, six government critics face charges, trial	Bangkok — Experts tell VOA that Thailand’s deportation last month of six Cambodian activists back to Cambodia shows Bangkok continues to participate in 'transnational repression' — coordination among governments targeting dissidents outside their countries. Authorities deported Pen Chan Sangkream, Hong An, Mean Chanthon, Yin Chanthou, Soeung Khunthea and Vorn Chanratchana last month. The four women and two men have since been charged by Cambodia with treason for posting social media statements criticizing Cambodian policies over the 20-year-old Cambodia-Laos-Vietnam Development Triangle Area, or CLV-DTA, agreement, which is aimed at easing trade and migration among the three countries, The Associated Press reports. They are now being held in separate facilities in pre-trial detention in Cambodia, and will face trial for their charges, that could see them sentenced to lengthy time in prison, according to Radio Free Asia. The six activists are supporters of the banned opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party and had left Cambodia for Thailand in 2022. Tiy Chung, a regional spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, confirmed to VOA by email that the six have been deported and 'are people of concern.' UNHCR, he said, is 'deeply concerned' by the deportation, which included a child, he said, and which goes against Thailand’s obligation to ensure that no one is expelled or returned to someplace where their life or freedom could be at risk. 'We are seeking urgent clarification from the Thai authorities on the circumstances surrounding this deportation and urge them to honour Thai law and their international obligations to prevent such actions in the future,' he wrote. In recent years the Cambodian government has cracked down critics in and out of the country. Planned protests against the CLV-DTA agreement saw September arrests of at least 100 activists, who accused Phnom Penh of ceding Cambodian territory, although the same month saw Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet announce Cambodia would pull out of the decades-old deal. In February, three other Cambodian activists, recognized as persons of concern by the UNHCR, and their families, were arrested in Thailand before they had planned to protest Manet’s visit to Thailand. The practice of transnational repression is not new. Freedom House said in 2022 that since 2014, over 150 people in Thailand had been victims of the practice. Phil Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights Labor Advocates, said Thailand is not safe for Cambodian refugees. 'The message here to all Cambodian refugees sheltering in Thailand is you’re not safe because the friendship between the Hun and Shinawatra families trumps any obligations Thailand is supposed to uphold under international human rights law,' he said. Cambodia has been ruled by the Cambodian People’s Party for 45 years, with critics saying in recent years the regime has stepped up efforts to target dissidents, opposition parties and independent media who pose threats to its reputation or rule. Hun Manet took power in 2023, succeeding his father, Hun Sen, who led Cambodia for nearly four decades. Thailand and Cambodia have endured an up-and-down relationship over the years, with border and cultural conflicts periodically being divisive. Those relations appear currently to be close, in part because of family ties. Thai prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra met Manet in Laos in October. But it is the relationship between their fathers and predecessors, Thaksin Shinawatra and Hun Sen, that has cemented strong ties between the two families. Thailand’s ruling Pheu Thai party has vowed to work together on transnational crime with Manet. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political analyst in Thailand, told VOA the family links are likely key in this deportation case. 'The close personal relations and even family ties between the two families make this deportation suspect. It will be difficult not to conclude that these intimate links facilitated it. The deportation is an ill-considered move for the Paetongtarn leadership and government that claims democratic legitimacy despite coming second in the May 2023 election,' he told VOA. The purported treasonous crimes that six Cambodians allegedly committed fall under Article 453 of Cambodia's criminal code. If found guilty, the criticism of the Cambodian regime and its policies toward neighbors Vietnam and Laos could land them a decade in prison. Thailand has its own strict laws it implements for those who are critical of its monarchy. Under Article 112 of its criminal code, it is illegal to criticize the Thai monarchy, carrying sentences of 15 years in prison for each offense. In January, a 30-year-old man was sentenced to 50 years in jail after being ruled to have defamed the monarchy. Prem Singh Gill, visiting fellow in Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, Indonesia, says the Thai and Cambodian governments share similar interests when it comes to prohibiting dissent. 'This collaborative approach is not coincidental but strategically designed. Both countries share similar authoritarian impulses, with royal institutions and political elites working in concert to maintain their grip on power. By harmonizing their approach to dissent, Thailand and Cambodia create a more comprehensive mechanism of controlling political discourse,' Gill told VOA via email. 'Transnational repression becomes a sophisticated tool of regional authoritarianism, where activists find themselves trapped in a network of legal and extra-legal threats. Governments collaborate through informal channels, sharing intelligence, coordinating deportations, and creating an environment of constant vulnerability for political dissidents,' he added. Thailand recently was elected to a seat at the U.N. Human Rights Council and is expected to begin its duties in January 2025. VOA contacted Thailand’s Foreign Affairs Ministry for comment but received no response.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sent-back-to-cambodia-from-thailand-six-government-critics-face-charges-trial-/7892412.html	2024-12-09T05:00:07-08:00	
Israel announces deaths of 4 soldiers in southern Lebanon fighting	Israel’s military said Monday that four of its soldiers were killed in fighting in southern Lebanon. A military statement said the soldiers were all from the same brigade, but it did not specify when they were killed or the circumstances of their deaths. The development comes nearly two weeks after Israel and the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah began a cease-fire. The agreement, which calls for both sides to pull back from southern Lebanon, has brought a sharp reduction in fighting, but has not eliminated violence in the area. Lebanon’s military said Monday an Israeli airstrike hit a car near an army checkpoint in southern Lebanon, killing one person and wounding four soldiers. The Lebanese military is not a party to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, and along with the United Nations is supposed to monitor a buffer zone between the warring sides as part of the ceasefire agreement. Hezbollah launched attacks against Israel in October 2023 in solidarity with its ally, the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip, following the Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. Israel and Hezbollah traded cross-border attacks for months, with the conflict intensifying in September and Israeli troops entering Lebanon in October. The ceasefire has allowed Israeli troops to refocus on Gaza, where health officials said Monday Israeli airstrikes killed at least six people. Israeli officials also said Monday that a drone believed to have originated in Yemen hit a residential building in the central Israeli city of Yavne. There were no reported injuries, authorities said. The Yemen-based Houthi militant group has launched multiple attacks against Israel during the past year, and it has carried out a campaign targeting ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, all part of what the Iran-backed group says are actions in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,700 Palestinians, more than half of the verified deaths women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry. Israel says that the death toll includes thousands of militants it has killed. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, United Kingdom and other Western countries. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-announces-deaths-of-4-soldiers-in-southern-lebanon-fighting-/7892351.html	2024-12-09T03:49:27-08:00	
Taiwan says China has sent naval ships into nearby waters ahead of anticipated drills	BEIJING — China's military appears to be preparing for widely anticipated drills in response to a recent visit by Taiwan's president to Hawaii and Guam. Taiwan's defense ministry said Monday that it detected Chinese naval and coast guard ships entering the Taiwan Strait and the western Pacific and that China had restricted airspace along its southeast coast through Wednesday. There was no immediate confirmation from the Chinese side. A Taiwan defense ministry statement said it has set up an emergency response center and launched combat readiness exercises. It did not say what those exercises entailed. The Chinese government says Taiwan is part of its territory and opposes American support and military sales to the self-governing island. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te made stops in Hawaii and Guam during a weeklong tour of the Pacific that ended Friday. China maintains that Taiwan is a province that should not have its own president or foreign relations. 'It must be pointed out that there is no such thing as a defense ministry in Taiwan,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said when asked about the Taiwanese statement. 'Taiwan is part of China, and the Taiwan issue is China's internal affairs. China will firmly safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.' China, which views Lai as a separatist, held major military exercises around Taiwan following his inauguration in May and his national day speech in October. It also held a major drill after Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in 2022. The Taiwan defense ministry statement said China had restricted air space in seven zones off Fujian province, which faces Taiwan, and off Zhejiang province, which stretches north from Fujian to Shanghai.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-says-china-has-sent-naval-ships-into-nearby-waters-ahead-of-anticipated-drills-/7892323.html	2024-12-09T03:27:15-08:00	
Earth's lands are drying out; Nations are trying to address it in talks this week	Much of Earth's lands are drying out and damaging the ability of plant and animal life to survive, according to a United Nations report released Monday at talks where countries are working to address the problem. The report was released at the U.N. summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on combating desertification — once-fertile lands turning into deserts because of hotter temperatures from human-caused climate change, lack of water and deforestation. It found that more than three-quarters of the world's land experienced drier conditions from 1970 to 2020 than the previous thirty-year period. 'The drier climates now affecting vast lands across the globe will not return to how they were,' said Ibrahim Thiaw, chief of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which is facilitating the Riyadh talks. 'This change is redefining life on Earth.' At the talks, which started last week and are set to end on Friday, nations are discussing how better they can help the world deal with droughts — a more urgent lack of water over shorter periods — and the more permanent problem of degrading land. Earth's drying comes with devastating effects If global warming trends continue, nearly five billion people — including in most of Europe, parts of the western U.S., Brazil, eastern Asia and central Africa — will be affected by the drying by the end of the century, up from a quarter of the world's population today, the report warned. UNCCD's chief scientist Barron Orr warned drier land could lead to 'potentially catastrophic impacts affecting access to water that could push people and nature even closer to disastrous tipping points,' where humans are no longer able to reverse damaging effects of climate change. Sergio Vicente-Serrano, one of the lead authors of the report, said that as the atmosphere heats up because the burning of coal, oil and gas spews planet-warming emissions, it leads to more evaporation on the ground. That makes water less available for humans, plants and animals, making it harder to survive. Farming is particularly at risk, with drier land being less productive and hurting both yields and the availability of food for livestock, the report said. That can lead to food insecurity for communities worldwide. Aridity also leads to more migration, because erratic rainfall, degrading land and frequent water shortages make it harder for regions or nations to develop economically, the report said. It said the trend is especially noticeable in some of the world's driest areas such as southern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa and southern Asia. Addressing the problem at UN talks— slowly Negotiators in Riyadh are mainly discussing how best the world can respond to more frequent and damaging droughts. Jes Weigelt, of European climate thinktank TMG, said it's still a sticking point because countries can't agree on whether rich nations should be forking out funds for drought responses around the world. Any money pledged would go toward better forecasting and monitoring systems as well as creating reservoirs and other structures that can provide access to water even during prolonged dry spells. 'The big contentious issue is do we do this (drought response) through a binding U.N.-level protocol or are there other options that we should explore,' Weigelt said. A binding protocol would mean that among other obligations, developed countries might be asked to provide funding. Thiaw, the UNCCD chief, said that hosts Saudi Arabia pledging $2.15 billion from various countries and international banks for drought resilience has set the right tone for the meetings. And the Arab Coordination Group — 10 development banks based in the Middle East — committed $10 billion by 2030 to address degrading land, desertification and drought. The funds are expected to support 80 of the most vulnerable countries prepare for worsening drought conditions. But the U.N. estimates that between 2007 and 2017, droughts cost $125 billion worldwide. 'As hosts, our primary objective is to help facilitate the critical discussions taking place,' said Osama Faqeeha, Saudi Arabia's deputy environment minister and an advisor to the talks' presidency. 'These crises know no borders.' Lasting solutions for an arid world While drought can be very damaging, Thiaw wrote in Monday's report, recovery is possible. But he called the drying of land 'an unrelenting menace that requires lasting adaptation measures.' Longer lasting solutions — such as the curbing of climate change — are not much of a talking point at the Riyadh summit. Hosts Saudi Arabia have long been criticized by some other nations and climate analysts for stalling progress on curbing emissions from fossil fuels at other negotiations. The U.N.'s report recommends that countries improve their land use practices and are more efficient at using water. That includes rolling out measures like growing crops that need less water and irrigation methods that are more efficient — like drip irrigation, which feeds water to plants slowly to minimize evaporation — on a much larger scale. It also suggests better monitoring so that communities can plan ahead, and large-scale reforestation projects to protect the earth and its moisture. Andrea Toreti, one of the report's lead authors, said addressing the issue — just like tackling climate change or biodiversity loss — will need countries to work better together. It 'requires coordinated international action and an unwavering commitment,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/earth-s-lands-are-drying-out-nations-are-trying-to-address-it-in-talks-this-week-/7892310.html	2024-12-09T03:18:38-08:00

South Korea’s leadership unclear as Yoon struggles to retain power	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea’s defense ministry insisted that President Yoon Suk Yeol remained in charge of the country’s armed forces on Monday, even as the justice ministry enforced a travel ban against him following his attempt to declare martial law last week. The developments deepened what legal scholars described as an extraordinary constitutional crisis. Although Yoon is being investigated for treason, and the head of his own party has said he would no longer be involved in state affairs, conservative lawmakers have continued to resist his impeachment, and it appeared Yoon continued to hold key levers of power as of late Monday. When asked by a reporter how a president under suspicion of rebellion could control the country’s armed forces, a spokesperson for South Korea’s defense ministry responded: 'Legally, the authority remains with the current commander in chief.' Yoon has also continued to perform other presidential duties, such as accepting the resignation of senior officials and appointing others. The developments raise questions about what, if any duties, he has ceded, as he and his conservative allies have promised. On Sunday, PPP chief Han Dong-hoon said that Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would handle state affairs in consultation with the party, but offered few other details about the apparent power-sharing arrangement. Neither Han holds an elected position. PPP officials did not respond to VOA’s request for more details about the alleged deal, which numerous legal scholars have called extra-constitutional and likely illegal. Jeon Hak-seon, a constitutional law professor at Hankook Foreign Language University, said the only established process for removing a president’s powers are impeachment or resignation. There is no constitutional provision, Jeon said, for an arrangement in which the president voluntarily and informally entrusts his powers to another official – and certainly not an unelected one. 'Such a system does not exist,' Jeon told VOA. 'The term ‘entrustment’ is not even used in Korean law.' Another Seoul-based legal professor, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions, said Yoon and his party are likely trying to avoid a presidential vacancy, because under such a scenario an election must be held within 60 days, according to the constitution. Yoon, frustrated by what he saw as opposition attempts to obstruct his governing, declared martial law late Tuesday – the first such decree since South Korea became a democracy in the 1980s. Yoon said the move was necessary to 'crush anti-state forces,' but opposition lawmakers overturned the decree within hours. In a speech Saturday, Yoon apologized for causing anxiety and said future governance 'will be handled jointly by our party and the government.' The two-minute speech was Yoon’s only public appearance since lifting the martial decree early Wednesday. South Korean opposition lawmakers failed to impeach Yoon in a vote on Saturday, but vowed to soon hold another vote. Yoon’s office did not respond Monday to VOA’s request for clarification about what, if any, presidential powers had been ceded to the party or prime minister. Responding to a similar VOA question on Sunday, a presidential spokesperson said: 'I ask for your deep understanding that we cannot help but be cautious in sending messages. However, if there is anything to say at the level of the Office of the President, we will share it without delay.' Early Monday, the Yonhap news agency reported that many officials at the presidential office 'seem to be abandoning their messaging apps or social media accounts and creating new ones, possibly in preparation for ongoing investigations by the prosecution and police.' South Korea’s Justice Ministry on Monday announced that it had imposed a travel ban on Yoon, who faces three separate government investigations into treason for his activities related to the martial law attempt. While in office, South Korean presidents are immune from prosecution, except in cases involving allegations of rebellion or treason. However, it remained unclear whether any law enforcement agency would attempt to question or arrest Yoon, a former chief prosecutor. Yoon’s popularity plunged to an all-time low of 17%, according to a poll released Monday by Realmeter, a public opinion research organization. Other recent polls have put that figure much lower. Ahead of Saturday’s impeachment vote, an estimated crowd of 100,000 protesters gathered outside the country’s legislature. Despite immense public pressure, lawmakers in Yoon’s PPP have refused to support impeachment, saying such an outcome would create instability. The situation in some ways mirrors 2017, when South Korea's former conservative president, Park Geun-hye, was removed from office on corruption-related charges. Those developments deeply fractured the conservative party, and made some reluctant to repeat the process. But conservatives are likely to face mounting pressure if street protests and strikes intensify and polling continues to reflect Yoon’s low popularity, said Mason Richey, professor of international politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. 'Logically, the Han-Han-Yoon governing arrangement may be unsustainable, as it is apparently extra-constitutional and opens up tensions in handling state affairs,' said Richey. 'Although much about this saga so far has been illogical.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-leadership-unclear-as-yoon-struggles-to-retain-power/7892280.html	2024-12-09T02:11:34-08:00	
Fishing boat capsizes after colliding with barge in South Korea, killing 7	SEOUL, South Korea — A fishing boat capsized after colliding with a sand barge in waters off South Korea's southeastern coast early Monday, leaving seven crew members dead and one missing, according to local coast guard and fire departments. The 29-ton fishing boat, which had eight passengers, three South Koreans and five Indonesian nationals, capsized after colliding with a 456-ton barge in waters near the city of Gyeongju, according to Kim Eul-dong, an official at the Pohang coast guard. Dozens of emergency workers, along with 15 coast guard vessels and six helicopters, were mobilized to search for the missing passenger, who was Indonesian. None of the passengers from the barge were hurt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fishing-boat-capsizes-after-colliding-with-barge-in-south-korea-killing-7/7892249.html	2024-12-09T00:25:19-08:00	
Australian synagogue fire declared terrorism	MELBOURNE, Australia — Australian law enforcement authorities on Monday declared an arson attack on a synagogue last week a terrorist act in a decision that increases resources available to the investigation. Arson squad detectives have been investigating the blaze that extensively damaged the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne on Friday. But the investigation was taken over on Monday by the Joint Counter-Terrorism Team which involves Victoria state Police and Australian Federal Police as well as the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, the nation's main domestic spy agency. 'The decision ... to transition the Adass Israel Synagogue fire attack to the Victorian Joint Counter-Terrorism Team is a crucial turning point in this investigation,' Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Krissy Barrett told reporters. 'I want to thank Victoria Police investigators for the significant information they have gathered so far, which has helped lead us to believe that this is likely to be a politically motivated attack. This is now a terrorism investigation,' Barrett added. The declaration gave investigators more resources, information and legal powers to pursue the three suspects, police said. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said investigators had made 'significant progress,' but declined to detail that progress. Witnesses reported seeing two masked men spreading a liquid accelerant before the fire. Police have not revealed what role the third suspect played. Police have also not revealed if they know the identity of any suspect. The synagogue fire is the first declared terrorist incident in Australia since April when a 16-year-old boy allegedly stabbed a bishop and priest in a Sydney Assyrian church while a service was being streamed online. Some lawmakers had been calling for the arsonists to be charged with terrorism offenses so that they would potentially face longer prison sentences. The blaze is an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and Hamas last year. Cars and buildings have been vandalized and torched around Australia in protests inspired by the war. In a separate initiative, Australian Federal Police announced on Monday the formation of Special Operation Avalite to target antisemiticism around the country. The investigators were brought together in response to arson attacks on the synagogue, Jewish lawmaker Josh Burns' Melbourne office in June and on a car in a Sydney street last month that was related to antisemitic vandalism. 'Special Operation Avalite will be an agile and experienced squad of counter-terrorism investigators who will focus on threats, violence, and hatred towards the Australian Jewish community and parliamentarians,' Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said. Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, who is Jewish, said his government was striving to make the Jewish community 'feel safe.' 'We've experienced in Australia, in the last year, the highest level of antisemitism that I've experienced in my lifetime. That's a common reaction from members of the Australian Jewish community,' Dreyfus said. The Victoria government on Friday offered 100,000 Australian dollars ($64,300) to help repair the synagogue and said there would be an increased police presence in the area. The federal government on Sunday offered the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, an umbrella body representing more than 200 Jewish organizations, AU$32.5 million ($20.8 million) to enhance security at community sites including synagogues and schools.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-synagogue-fire-declared-terrorism-/7892243.html	2024-12-09T00:08:36-08:00	
Polarization' is Merriam-Webster's 2024 word of the year	The results of the 2024 U.S. presidential election rattled the country and sent shockwaves across the world — or were cause for celebration, depending on who you ask. Is it any surprise then that the Merriam-Webster word of the year is 'polarization'? 'Polarization means division, but it's a very specific kind of division,' said Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement. 'Polarization means that we are tending toward the extremes rather than toward the center.' The election was so divisive, many American voters went to the polls with a feeling that the opposing candidate was an existential threat to the nation. According to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters, about 8 in 10 Kamala Harris voters were very or somewhat concerned that Donald Trump's views — but not Harris' — were too extreme, while about 7 in 10 Trump voters felt the same way about Harris — but not Trump. The Merriam-Webster entry for 'polarization' reflects scientific and metaphorical definitions. It's most commonly used to mean 'causing strong disagreement between opposing factions or groupings.' Merriam-Webster, which logs 100 million pageviews a month on its site, chooses its word of the year based on data, tracking a rise in search and usage. Last year's pick was 'authentic.' This year's comes as large swaths of the U.S. struggle to reach consensus on what is real. 'It's always been important to me that the dictionary serve as a kind of neutral and objective arbiter of meaning for everybody,' Sokolowski said. 'It's a kind of backstop for meaning in an era of fake news, alternative facts, whatever you want to say about the value of a word's meaning in the culture.' It's notable that 'polarization' originated in the early 1800s — and not during the Renaissance, as did most words with Latin roots about science, Sokolowski said. He called it a 'pretty young word,' in the scheme of the English language. 'Polarized is a term that brings intensity to another word,' he continued, most frequently used in the U.S. to describe race relations, politics and ideology. 'The basic job of the dictionary is to tell the truth about words,' the Merriam-Webster editor continued. 'We've had dictionaries of English for 420 years and it's only been in the last 20 years or so that we've actually known which words people look up.' 'Polarization' extends beyond political connotations. It's used to highlight fresh cracks and deep rifts alike in pop culture, tech trends and other industries. All the scrutiny over Taylor Swift's private jet usage? Polarizing. Beef between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake? Polarizing. The International Olympic Committee's decision to strip American gymnast Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal after the Paris Games? You guessed it: polarizing. Even lighthearted memes — like those making fun of Australian breakdancer Rachael 'Raygun' Gunn's performance — or the proliferation of look-alike contests, or who counts as a nepo baby proved polarizing. Paradoxically though, people tend to see eye to eye on the word itself. Sokolowski cited its frequent use among people across the political spectrum, including commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN. 'It's used by both sides,' he said, 'and in a little bit ironic twist to the word, it's something that actually everyone agrees on.' Rounding out Merriam-Webster's top 10 words of 2024: Demure TikToker Jools Lebron's 38-second video describing her workday makeup routine as 'very demure, very mindful' lit up the summer with memes. The video has been viewed more than 50 million times, yielding 'huge spikes' in lookups, Sokolowski said, and prompting many to learn it means reserved or modest. Fortnight Taylor Swift's song 'Fortnight,' featuring rapper Post Malone, undoubtedly spurred many searches for this word, which means two weeks. 'Music can still send people to the dictionary,' Sokolowski said. Totality The solar eclipse in April inspired awe and much travel. There are tens of millions of people who live along a narrow stretch from Mexico's Pacific coast to eastern Canada, otherwise known as the path of totality, where locals and travelers gazed skyward to see the moon fully blot out the sun. Generally, the word refers to a sum or aggregate amount — or wholeness. Resonate 'Texts developed by AI have a disproportionate percentage of use of the word 'resonate,'' Sokolowski said. This may be because the word, which means to affect or appeal to someone in a personal or emotional way, can add gravitas to writing. But, paradoxically, artificial intelligence 'also betrays itself to be a robot because it's using that word too much.' Allision The word was looked up 60 times more often than usual when, in March, a ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. 'When you have one moving object into a fixed object, that's an allision, not a collision. You're showing that one of the two objects struck was not, in fact, in motion,' Sokolowski said. Weird This summer on the TV news show 'Morning Joe,' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called Republican leaders 'weird.' It may have been what launched his national career, landing him as the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Though it's a word that people typically misspell — is it 'ei' or 'ie'? — and search for that reason, its rise in use was notable, Sokolowski said. Cognitive Whether the word was used to raise questions about President Joe Biden's debate performance or Trump's own age, it cropped up often. It refers to conscious intellectual activity — such as thinking, reasoning, or remembering. Pander Pander was used widely in political commentary, Sokolowski said. 'Conservative news outlets accused Kamala Harris of pandering to different groups, especially young voters, Black voters, gun rights supporters.' Whereas Walz said Trump's visit to a McDonald's kitchen pandered to hourly wage workers. It means to say, do, or provide what someone — such as an audience — wants or demands even though it is not 'good, proper, reasonable, etc.' Democracy In 2003, Merriam-Webster decided to make 'democracy' its first word of the year. Since then, the word — which, of course, means a form of government in which the people elect representatives to make decisions, policies and laws — is consistently one of the dictionary's most looked up. 'There's a poignancy to that, that people are checking up on it,' Sokolowski said. 'Maybe the most hopeful thing that the curiosity of the public shows, is that they're paying attention.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/polarization-is-merriam-webster-s-2024-word-of-the-year/7892235.html	2024-12-08T23:41:21-08:00	
UN Security Council to discuss Syria after Assad’s ouster	The U.N. Security Council is set to hold closed-door talks Monday on the situation in Syria, following the lightning advance by rebels that ousted President Bashar al-Assad. Russia, which provided military assistance to Assad during the nearly 14-year Syrian civil war, requested the Security Council session to discuss the developments, including the potential implications on the U.N.’s peacekeeping mission in the Golan Heights. Israeli troops deployed Sunday to the U.N.-monitored buffer zone in the Golan Heights, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying the move was necessary to protect Israelis after Syrian forces abandoned their positions. Many questions remained Monday about who will lead Syria and how the country will try to recover after years of war and nearly five decades under the rule of the Assad family. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement late Sunday that the United States will be 'closely monitoring developments as they unfold and engaging with our partners in the region.' 'The United States strongly supports a peaceful transition of power to an accountable Syrian government through an inclusive Syrian-led process,' Blinken said. 'During this transitional period, the Syrian people have every right to demand the preservation of state institutions, the resumption of key services, and the protection of vulnerable communities.' Blinken said the United States will support international efforts to hold Assad and others accountable for abuses against the Syrian people and detention of civilians such as U.S. journalist Austin Tice. Assad was accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the country’s civil war, including a 2013 chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of Damascus. More than half a million Syrians died in the war, and the conflict displaced at least half the country’s pre-war population of 22 million people. Assad’s fall prompted crowds to gather and celebrate in Damascus and elsewhere. Rebels opened prisons where the Assad government held thousands of people as part of its crackdown against the uprising that began in 2011 against his rule. There was continued focus Monday on the Saydnaya prison outside of Damascus, where the White Helmets rescue organization said it deployed teams to search for potential hidden, underground cells where people may still be held. Russian news agencies said Sunday that Assad and his family arrived in Moscow and were granted asylum in Russia. The downfall of Assad was stunningly quick, with the rebels capturing the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs in a matter of days as the Syrian army ended any opposition. The rebels are led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group (HTS) which has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. Abu Mohammed al-Golani leads HTS and could chart the country's immediate direction. He is a former al-Qaida commander who cut ties with the group years ago and says he embraces pluralism and religious tolerance. But there are bitter divides in the country. Turkey-backed opposition fighters are battling U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in the north, and the Islamic State group is still active in some remote areas. Some information came from The Associated Press. Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-security-council-to-discuss-syria-after-assad-s-ouster/7892233.html	2024-12-08T23:26:30-08:00

US to stick with Kurdish allies in Syria	WASHINGTON — The fall of the Assad regime in Syria will not impact U.S. support, at least for now, for one of Washington’s most steadfast allies in the fight against the Islamic State terror group, according to senior American officials. Speaking just hours after Russian officials confirmed former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad had fled Damascus and taken refuge in Moscow, and a day after rebel forces entered the Syrian capital, U.S. officials insisted there are no plans to alter the U.S. military footprint in Syria, which includes some 900 troops, most of them working in the country’s northeast with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces or SDF. Maintaining U.S. positions across eastern Syria 'is something we will continue to do,' a senior U.S. administration official said Sunday, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive information. 'We think that presence is critically important for the stability of those areas and for denying the efforts of ISIS to resurge, and also for the integrity of the SDF and the groups that we work with in the East to maintain stability out there,' the official said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group, also known as IS or Daesh. The SDF, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias formed in 2015, mustering a force of 30,000 to 40,000 fighters that played a key role in eroding IS’s hold on large swaths of territory, including the terror group’s self-proclaimed Syrian capital of Raqqa. Four years after its creation, in March 2019, the SDF announced the fall of the town of Baghuz, IS’s last stronghold in Syria. But the defeat of the self-declared IS caliphate in Syria came at a cost. SDF officials estimated some 11,000 fighters were killed in the yearslong campaign. And fighting with remnants of the terror group has persisted. Intelligence shared both by the U.S. and by United Nation member states earlier this year indicated an uptick in IS activity, especially by small cells in Syria’s central desert, describing it as a growing logistic hub for the terror group. Various estimates warn the number of IS fighters across Syria and Iraq has grown to between 2,500 and 5,000. This past July, U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq, warned IS was on pace to 'more than double the total number of attacks they claimed in 2023.' And IS has made repeated attempts to free some 9,000 of its fighters being held in about 20 SDF-run prisons across northeastern Syria, described by one senior U.S, official as 'the largest collection of terrorist fighters in the world.' Additionally, the SDF has been charged with overseeing security at displaced persons camps, like al-Hol and al-Roj, which house about 30,000 people, most of them children under the age of 12, and many from families loyal to IS. U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday said Washington has no intention of letting Syria, or the SDF, face those challenges alone. 'Our mission against ISIS will be maintained, including the security of detention facilities where ISIS fighters are being held as prisoners,' the president said. 'We're clear eyed about the fact that ISIS will try to take advantage of any vacuum to reestablish its capabilities, to create a safe haven,' Biden added. 'We will not let that happen.' To underscore the U.S. commitment, Biden said U.S. forces Sunday carried out dozens of airstrikes against IS camps and operatives. U.S. Central Command said the operation struck more than 75 targets using a combination of long-range bombers, fighter jets and close air support. 'We targeted a significant gathering of ISIS fighters and leaders,' the senior administration official said, adding U.S. war planes dropped about 140 munitions during the strikes, which were authorized earlier Sunday. 'It's a significant strike, I think, just given the collection of ISIS individuals in that area and the size of the area,' the official added. But U.S. concerns about instability extend beyond the threat from IS itself. There are fears that ongoing tensions between the SDF and Turkey could also bring additional instability and danger. Already, there have been reports of clashes between Turkish-backed forces and the SDF in northern Syria. Turkey has also long voiced objections to the U.S alliance with the Kurdish-led SDF, arguing many of the fighters are also People's Protection Units, or YPG, a Syrian-based offshoot of the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), labeled by both Ankara and Washington as a terrorist organization. And though the U.S. views the SDF and YPG as different entities, in Turkey's view, they are one and the same. U.S. officials said Sunday that there have already been high-level talks between officials at the Pentagon and State departments with their Turkish counterparts, describing the calls as 'constructive.' 'Additional conflicts, additional fronts opening up, not in anybody's interest,' the official said. Some analysts, however, worry the Turkish-Kurdish tensions will not be so easily resolved, pointing in part to Biden’s failure to mention Turkey Sunday while discussing U.S. outreach to Syria’s other neighbors. '[It] indicates that behind the scenes there's continuing to be ongoing machinations between American diplomats and Turkish officials about their aims for occupying portions of north and east Syria and thereby jeopardizing the Syrian Democratic Forces and civilians who live under the [Kurdish-led] Autonomous Administration,' said Myles Caggins, a nonresident fellow at the New Lines Institute and former spokesperson for the U.S.-led, anti-IS coalition in Syria and Iraq. 'President Biden made it very clear that U.S. forces will remain in north and east Syria in the foreseeable future to continue the anti-ISIS mission,' Caggins told VOA. 'The United States government has an opportunity to showcase and highlight its strong support of the Syrian Democratic Forces and people of Northeast Syria.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-stick-with-kurdish-allies-in-syria-/7892183.html	2024-12-08T18:20:05-08:00	
Notre Dame hosts first Mass since 2019 fire	PARIS — Notre Dame Cathedral, its air thick with the smell of incense, hosted its first Mass on Sunday since the catastrophic fire of 2019, a moment that transcended religious significance to become a powerful symbol of Paris’ resilience. Beneath the glow of traditional chandeliers and modern spotlights, which illuminated its intricately carved stonework, the cathedral emerged reborn, its grandeur restored after five years of reconstruction. For Catholics, it marks the revival of the city’s spiritual heart, a place where faith has been nurtured for centuries. For the world, it signals the rebirth of one of global heritage's most famous landmarks. The event was both solemn and historic. Archbishop Laurent Ulrich presided over the morning Mass, including the consecration of a new bronze altar. The liturgy was attended by 2,500 people, including French President Emmanuel Macron — enjoying a brief respite from France's political tumult and economic troubles — clergy, dignitaries and a few lucky members of the public who stood in long lines to enter. Nearly 170 bishops from France and around the world took part, along with one priest from each of the 113 parishes in the Paris diocese, accompanied by worshippers from these communities. Macron, in line with France’s strict division of state and church, did not take communion. Notre Dame’s journey from ruin to resurrection was defined by extraordinary craftsmanship, nearly $1 billion in global donations and a collective, unyielding determination to rebuild. After the Mass, faithful attendees, priests, nuns, and other guests lingered in the cathedral, their awe evident. Many took pictures and selfies in front of the altar, the baptistery, and vibrant rose windows, their joy mingling with reverence. Others knelt to pray at chapels dedicated to saints, savoring a spiritual intimacy many had not experienced since the fire. Later Sunday, the cathedral opened its doors to members of the public who secured reservations last week for the first fully public Mass. The Associated Press learned that tickets for this service were claimed within 25 minutes, underscoring Notre Dame’s enduring appeal. What’s more extraordinary is that this is taking place in a country with a strong emphasis on secularism and a low rate of church attendance. The public watches from a distance Public viewing areas along the Seine on Sunday morning drew hundreds of people who wished to witness the historic moment from afar, although their numbers were likely subdued by rainy and miserably cold weather conditions. Retired engineer Claude Lancrenon, watching from a viewing area, expressed both awe and disappointment. 'There is so much security,' he said, gesturing toward the barriers. 'Yesterday, that seemed appropriate. But today, I had hoped it would be more open so we could approach the cathedral. I still hope we’ll be able to get closer.' Tight security — akin to that of the Paris Olympic Games — reflected the importance of the occasion, ensuring the safety of dignitaries and the public alike. Nathalie Martino, a retired event organizer visiting Paris, recalled the anguish of watching the cathedral burn. 'I cried so much that day,' she said. 'And now, here I am. I had to come. It was something I needed to do.' A sacred space reborn Sunday’s Masses follow Saturday evening’s ceremonies in which Ulrich symbolically reopened the cathedral’s massive wooden doors by striking them three times with a crosier crafted from charred beams salvaged from the fire. As the doors swung open, choirs filled the air with song and the cathedral’s great organ — silent since the fire — resounded with majestic melodies. Inside, the restoration reveals a cathedral transformed with now-gleaming limestone walls cleaned of centuries of grime. The restored stained-glass windows project dazzling patterns of color across the nave. 'No one alive has seen the cathedral like this,' said the Rev. Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, Notre Dame’s rector. 'It is more than restored — it is reborn.' The consecration of the new altar was a pivotal moment in Notre Dame’s return to full liturgical life. The altar houses relics of five saints tied to Paris, including St. Catherine Labouré and St. Charles de Foucauld, continuing a centuries-old tradition of embedding sacred artifacts at the heart of worship spaces. The consecration, involving holy water, chrism oil, incense and prayer, transforms the altar into a sacred centerpiece of the cathedral. That was the most moving moment of the day for Marie Capucine, 37, a consecrated virgin representing her Parisian parish of Saint Germain des Prés at the reopening. She recalled the day the fire raged, and the ‘’communion in prayer all over the world'' for the cathedral to be saved. 'That shows that the Church gathers, no matter whether people are believers or not, it says something to the world, something beautiful,' she concluded. A moment of unity The reopening of Notre Dame is also a moment of cultural and national unity. Macron, who vowed to restore the cathedral within five years after the fire, called the project 'a jolt of hope' for France, a nation often divided by political crises. Challenges overcome The path to restoration was fraught with challenges. Lead contamination forced work to pause, and the COVID-19 pandemic added delays. Yet the project, overseen by architect Philippe Villeneuve, has been hailed as a triumph of human ingenuity and collective resolve. Cutting-edge fire prevention systems, including thermal cameras and a misting system, have been installed to safeguard the cathedral’s future. Villeneuve described the effort as 'restoring not just a building but the soul of a nation,' emphasizing the personal and national significance of the work. A sacred future and an ‘octave’ With its spire once again piercing the Parisian sky, Notre Dame is poised to reclaim its role as a global beacon of faith and art. The cathedral, which previously welcomed 12 million annual visitors, is expected to draw 15 million in its new chapter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/notre-dame-hosts-first-mass-since-2019-fire/7892164.html	2024-12-08T17:08:26-08:00	
Australia outlines changes to anti-slavery law	Sydney — Civil society groups and academics say that Australia is falling behind other countries in tackling slavery. The government this week released its response to an independent assessment of Australia's slavery laws. The review found that the legislation had 'not yet caused meaningful change' for victims and made various recommendations to strengthen the law. The Australian government has accepted 25 of 30 recommendations made by an independent assessment of Australia’s Modern Slavery Act of 2018. While some activists and unions say the government’s responses are positive, other campaigners say they fear Australia is doing much less than other countries to combat modern slavery and human trafficking. Justine Nolan, director of the Australian Human Rights Institute, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Saturday that the reforms could be delayed by federal elections due before next May. 'There is a danger of this again getting lost in the election cycle with everything, sort of, stopping very early in the new year. We have just had a visit from the U.N. special rapporteur, who has recognized that Australia has a problem in this. This is not something we can keep waiting on,' said Nolan. Under recommended legislative changes, Australian authorities would have to publish locations and industries known to be high risk for modern slavery, including agriculture and construction. The government said in a statement that 'modern slavery practices rob an individual of their freedom and control over their lives. From the trafficking of children, to the criminal exploitation of workers, to an individual forced into servitude — these practices are major violations of human rights.' James Cockayne is the anti-slavery commissioner in the state of New South Wales, responsible for increasing awareness about exploitation. He recently told local media that other global jurisdictions are expanding anti-slavery laws. 'The legislative landscape is moving pretty rapidly on these things internationally at the moment. There has been significant developments in the EU and continue to be day-on-day,' he said. Canada’s modern slavery law came into effect early this year. It requires companies to file annual reports on efforts to identify and prevent forced and child labor. The 2023 Global Slavery Index, published by the campaign group Walk Free, estimated there are 50 million people in modern slavery. In Australia, it is estimated that 41,000 people are being exploited.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-outlines-changes-to-anti-slavery-law/7892158.html	2024-12-08T16:42:21-08:00	
Georgian journalists allege brutal beatings; protests rage against ending EU talks	TBILISI, Georgia — Tens of thousands of people joined an 11th straight day of protests in Georgia on Sunday after the governing party moved to suspend negotiations on joining the European Union, while a separate demonstration decried violence against Georgian journalists covering the rallies. Police have been using increasing force in their attempts to curb the demonstrations, which have centered on the parliament building in the capital, Tbilisi. Riot police have used water cannons and tear gas every day to disperse the rallies, beating scores of protesters who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the Georgian capital’s central boulevard. At Saturday night’s demonstration, reporter Maka Chikhladze and her colleague from the independent Pirveli TV channel were targeted by a violent mob, Chikhladze told The Associated Press. Chikladze said her colleague managed to capture footage of men dressed in black who were beating demonstrators before they turned on the pair, violently pushing Chikhladze to the ground. She later told AP that her colleague sustained a head injury and had his camera stolen. Chikhladze charged that Georgia’s government was using bands of thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, an allegation denied by representatives of the Georgian Dream party. On Sunday, several hundred media workers marched down Tbilisi’s central Rustaveli Avenue before putting up posters of colleagues they say had been assaulted while doing their jobs. 'Our colleagues are beaten, injured, some remain in hospital in serious condition,' TV Pirveli anchor Ekaterine Mishveladze told AP. In a separate incident Saturday, AP journalists saw several masked men violently tackle a protester attempting to enter the offices of an opposition party, Ahali. The man, Koba Khabazi, lay slumped on the ground while his attackers repeatedly kicked him. He later showed AP his head injuries. Georgian Dream retained control of parliament in the disputed Oct. 26 election, a vote widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president, Salome Zourabichvili, have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia’s help and have boycotted parliament sessions. Opposition protests gained new momentum after the Georgian Dream’s decision last Thursday to put the EU accession talks on hold. Riot police have used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the rallies and beat scores of protesters, who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on Rustaveli Avenue. The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials. Speaking Thursday at a ministerial conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken denounced what he described as the brutal 'repression of those calling for their country to stay on the path to closer ties with Europe.' Mamuka Mdinanradze, leader of the Georgian Dream party, condemned mob violence against protesters during a news briefing Sunday, and denied any connection with the government. The office of Georgia’s rights ombudsman issued a statement Sunday criticizing Georgian police for 'failing to take adequate measures' to ensure safety during the demonstrations. President Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, refused to recognize the official election results and contested them before the Constitutional Court, which rejected her appeal earlier this week. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations but put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. The law requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-journalists-allege-brutal-beatings-protests-rage-against-ending-eu-talks/7892149.html	2024-12-08T16:32:19-08:00

From VOA Turkish: Kurdish politicians in Turkey are satisfied with fall of Assad regime but wary of future	Kurdish politicians in Turkey expressed their satisfaction with the end of the Assad regime in Syria. Speaking to VOA Turkish, several Kurdish politicians in Turkey called on Ankara to see the Kurds in Syria as friends and allies rather than as a threat. They also called on Kurdish groups in Syria to reconcile with Turkey. Following the developments in Syria, the first statement from Kurdish political actors in Turkey came from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM Party). The DEM Party suggested a transitional administration in which ethnic and religious groups in Syria would be represented and called for the United Nations to take responsibility for the return of refugees.

Taylor Swift’s record-breaking ‘Eras Tour’ ends in Vancouver	Vancouver, British Columbia — Taylor Swift’s 'The Eras Tour' officially ended Sunday in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The nearly two-year-long tour was record-breaking and trend-setting. It is finally the end of an era for Taylor Swift. The last show here in Vancouver is the finale of a 149-concert tour that spanned almost two years. It is estimated that it earned around two-billion dollars since the first concert in March 2023. Each concert lasted about three-and-a-half hours and featured at least 44 songs, divided into 10 parts, or 'eras,' of her recording career. The tour stopped in 53 cities on five continents. For Vancouver residents, the arrival of Swiftmania took over the city and drew comparisons to when the area hosted the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. Chris May is the general manager of BC Place Stadium, the venue that hosted the final three Swift concerts. He said organizing and preparations for these concerts was similar to ceremonies for the Olympics, Paralympics and the 2015 Women’s World Cup of Soccer, which were held in the stadium. He said 70% of attendees for the final concerts were from outside of the greater Vancouver area. 'That means we have a huge amount of guests that have never been here before. So, you know, it's working through those realities of ensuring we have enough staffing, enough signage and wayfinding, and people to help to get people where they're going,' he said. May said the April 2024 concert for Diljit Dosanjh, which was the biggest Punjabi music concert outside of India, drew more than 50,000 fans. All told, Swift's three Vancouver concerts drew about 160,000 people. Jarrett Vaughan, an adjunct professor at the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia, said Swift’s adept use of social media played a crucial role in the tour’s success. He also said the COVID-19 pandemic played a part for some younger members of her audience. 'I think when we look at the current audience that she has, you know, they were fairly young at that time. They didn't have the opportunity to attend concerts going through maybe middle school or elementary school, and so for them now, to be able to attend something like this is pretty remarkable,' he said. Vaughan said the legacy of the Eras Tour will not solely be just Swift’s use of social media, but the positivity she created for her fan base. Stephanie Burt is an English professor at Harvard College and recently taught a very popular class at the school on Swift. For her, the secret to Swift’s Eras Tour and her career itself is simple, she is really good at writing songs that are aspirational and relatable. 'We hear the songs, and we hear both someone who's already like us and someone who we want to be more like and want to be closer to and aspire to be like. That's a rare gift to extend it that long, and the tour testifies to the persistence of her talent and to her versatility and to her ability to collaborate and organize and plan,' she said. Vancouver’s tourism office estimates the final dates of Swift’s tour boosted the city’s economy by $112 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taylor-swift-s-record-breaking-eras-tour-ends-in-vancouver/7892139.html	2024-12-08T16:11:37-08:00	
From VOA Turkish: Some Syrians in Istanbul want to return to their hometowns after Assad’s fall	As the 61-year Baathist regime comes to an end, with Syrian President Bashar Assad leaving the country, one of the largest celebrations abroad is being held in Turkey, which hosts nearly 3 million Syrian refugees. Istanbul, which hosts nearly 500,000 Syrian refugees, has been the scene of many demonstrations since Saturday evening. Sunday, opponents of the regime removed the Syrian flag hanging at the Syrian Consulate General in Istanbul’s Tesvikiye district, and they celebrated the victory of rebel forces led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) at the historic Fatih Mosque and Saraçhane Square throughout the day. VOA Turkish talked to Syrians celebrating Assad’s fall in Istanbul.

Reindeer' volunteers bring holiday magic to Ukrainian children on front lines	IZIUM, Ukraine — Hopes for victory, a swift end to the war and prayers for their loved ones' survival or return from Russian captivity are among the wishes scattered throughout letters sent to a volunteer group by Ukrainian children living in front-line areas. While the volunteers, who are named reindeer after the magical beasts that pull Santa’s sleigh, cannot fulfill many of these dreams, they strive to deliver on the simpler ones, such as requests for power banks to help families endure outages, bicycles, books, and even pets. Every winter, the volunteers travel to heavily damaged cities to deliver gifts and ensure that, despite the war, Ukrainian children can celebrate the holiday season just like their peers around the world. This year, the group received 2,310 letters, according to project manager Inna Achkasova from the NGO Ukrainian Frontiers, who launched the St. Nicholas’ Reindeers initiative in 2015. The children’s wishes are published on the project’s website. Donors affectionately known as magicians then choose a letter and buy the requested gift to make that child's dreams come true. The reindeer then deliver those gifts. 'Children are those who have no choice whatsoever. No one asks them whether they want to stay or leave,' says project psychologist Kateryna Shutalova. 'What happens to them is never their choice. And this makes them the most vulnerable.' But every child gets only one childhood, even if it’s shaped by war. That’s why, in their letters, the horrors that have impacted their lives coexist with wishes similar to those of children everywhere. 'My father is in captivity, and I live with my mother and brother,' one boy wrote in his letter. He continued: 'I love playing football and practice it professionally. I want a leather football.' Volunteers sift through all the letters, enduring the tragic stories of each child, to sort and deliver the gifts correctly. Among the writers are children who have lost loved ones to shelling, endured Russian occupation, seen their homes destroyed, have parents serving on the front lines, or were forced to flee to escape the war. 'What struck me wasn’t their wishes but how deeply children feel the need to tell their stories,' Shutalova says. Wearing reindeer antlers, the volunteers set out on their journey on Dec. 6, when Ukraine celebrates St. Nicholas Day. Their journey is expected to last until mid-January. On a frosty morning in Kharkiv, covered by the season’s first snow, a team of volunteers departs in two buses filled with gifts, headed for the formerly Russian-occupied city of Izium, around 55 kilometers (35 miles) from the front line. At first, when the celebration has started, the children observe cautiously, their expressions somber, but that mood doesn't last. With each activity, they became more cheerful and engaged. One of them is 9-year-old Alina Soboleva, who remains detached despite the volunteers’ efforts. She watches the festivities unfold with a quiet gaze. Her grandmother, Svitlana Lokotosh, explains that Alina has been withdrawn since witnessing the deaths of her mother and other grandmother in a shelling in the courtyard of their home. Alina had been watching through the window as her mother spoke on the phone. When the shell struck, a fragment hit her mother in the neck. Her grandmother rushed outside to help and was killed by another shell. In her letter, Alina asked for two pet mice. She said it was her dream. 'Our only wish is for peace and quiet,' says Lokotosh, who took Alina in after her mother’s death. 'So the children don’t have to be afraid.' Shutalova explains that parents often find it hard to talk to their children about the war. They’re either afraid, lack the emotional resources, or are overwhelmed by their feelings. 'But for children to process what they’ve been through, they need to talk, play, and express those emotions,' she says. At the celebration, parents stand against the walls, smiling as their children laugh and play despite having endured so much at such a young age. Among them is Anna Bolharska, a 32-year-old mother of two. Her father-in-law was killed, and her brother-in-law was injured during the occupation. In the spring of 2022, she and her children fled Izium amid relentless shelling, only returning after Ukrainian forces liberated the city in September that year. 'I don’t like to remember those times. We try to move forward because dwelling on it is too hard mentally,' Bolharska says. 'We try not to remind the children and to keep them distracted.' Her 9-year-old daughter, Myroslava Bolharska, dreams of becoming a veterinarian. In her letter, she asked for a guitar. 'During the war it seems everyone’s dreams have changed — to wish for the war to end,' she wrote. The reindeers' winter journey will take them to over 40 towns in the coming weeks. They hope to realize many dreams and bring joy to the kids, even though some of their wishes are impossible to fulfill. 'Some children wrote in their letters that they want their childhood back,' project co-founder Inna Achkasova says, adding that the reindeer volunteers aim to ensure that every child feels seen, heard and loved.	https://www.voanews.com/a/reindeer-volunteers-bring-holiday-magic-to-ukrainian-children-on-front-lines/7891899.html	2024-12-08T15:49:42-08:00	
From VOA Turkish: Analysts: Turkey is the biggest winner, Russia and Iran are the biggest losers in Syria	The civil war in Syria, which began in 2011, gained a new dimension with the overthrow of the Assad regime. After armed rebel groups let by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) entered Damascus, Assad left Syria. Russian state media reported that Assad and his family arrived in Moscow. Military sources and experts in France who assessed the developments for VOA Turkish agreed that the biggest winner in the latest developments is Turkey, 'while the biggest losers are Iran and Russia.' However, they said the way negotiations between HTS and Turkey proceed, especially on the Kurdish issue, will be decisive.

Tehran said it would continue to support international mechanisms for pursuing the political process, adding that long-standing and friendly relations between the Iranian and Syrian nations are expected to continue. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu The fall of Assad, a major link in the Iranian axis, is an historic day and a direct result of blows dealt to Hezbollah and Iran by Israel, Netanyahu said. 'We will not allow any hostile force to establish itself on our border,' he added. U.S. President Joe Biden 'President Biden and his team are closely monitoring the extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with regional partners,' the White House said in a statement. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump 'Assad is gone. He has fled his country. His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer,' Trump posted on Truth Social. 'Russia and Iran are in a weakened state right now, one because of Ukraine and a bad economy, the other because of Israel and its fighting success.' Russian Foreign Ministry The ministry said in a statement, Syrian President Bashar Assad has left office and departed the country after giving orders for there be a peaceful handover of power. The ministry did not say where Assad was now and said Russia has not taken part in the talks around his departure. It said Russia's military bases in Syria had been put on a state of high alert, but that there was no serious threat to them at the current time. Moscow is in touch with all Syrian opposition groups and urges all sides to refrain from violence. Iraqi government spokesperson Iraqi government spokesperson Bassem Al-Awadi said Iraq was closely following developments and reaffirmed the importance of not interfering in the internal affairs of Syria or supporting one party in favor of another. Jordan's King Abdullah King Abdullah said Jordan respected the choices of the Syrian people. He urged the avoidance of any conflict in Syria that might lead to chaos and stressed the need to protect the security of his country's northern neighbor, according to a statement published by the Royal Hashemite Court.

Qatar Foreign Ministry Qatar's foreign ministry renewed its call to end the crisis in Syria along the lines of the 2015 U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 which laid out the steps for a ceasefire and political transition. The foreign ministry said it is following developments in Syria with interest and called for the preservation of the unity of the state. Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been communicating with all regional actors on Syria and is determined to do what is possible to avoid a chaotic outcome for the country, a Saudi official told Reuters.

The Syrian people cannot do this alone. Turkey attaches importance to Syrian territorial integrity. A new Syrian administration must be established inclusively, there should be no desire for revenge. Turkey calls on all actors to act with prudence and to be watchful. Terrorist organizations must not be allowed to take advantage of this situation. Opposition groups must be united. We will work for stability and safety in Syria. The new Syria should not pose a threat to neighbors, it should eliminate threats. Any extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) cannot be considered a legitimate counterpart in Syria. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha 'Assad has fallen. This is how it has always been and will always be for dictators who bet on Putin. He always betrays those who rely on him. The main goal now is to restore security in Syria and effectively protect its people from violence.'

Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Daniel Shapiro 'The United States will continue to maintain its presence in eastern Syria and will take measures necessary to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State,' Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Daniel Shapiro told the Manama Dialogue security conference in Bahrain. Shapiro called on all parties to protect civilians, particularly minorities, and respect international norms. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock 'It is impossible to say exactly what is happening in Syria now. But one thing is clear: for millions of people in Syria, the end of Assad means the first big sigh of relief after an eternity of atrocities committed by the Assad regime.' 'Assad has murdered, tortured and used poison gas against his own people. He must finally be held accountable for this. 'The country must not now fall into the hands of other radicals — regardless of the guise. We therefore call on the parties to the conflict to live up to their responsibility for all Syrians. This includes the comprehensive protection of ethnic and religious minorities such as Kurds, Alawites or Christians and an inclusive political process that creates a balance between the groups.' German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz 'Bashar al Assad has brutally oppressed his own people, has countless lives on his conscience and has driven numerous people to flee Syria, many of whom have also come to Germany. The Syrian people have experienced appalling suffering. The end of Assad's rule over Syria is therefore good news. 'What matters now is that law and order are quickly restored in Syria. All religious communities, all minorities must enjoy protection now and in the future.' Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani 'We are calling for a peaceful handover between the fallen regime and the new reality, so for a peaceful rather than military transition.

Timeline: Assad's fall followed years of bloodshed and division	The collapse of Bashar Assad's rule over Syria marks the culmination of a nearly 14-year rebellion and a key moment in a civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced half the population and drew in outside powers. This is how it unfolded: 2011 - The first protests of Assad quickly spread across the country and were met by security forces with a wave of arrests and shootings. Some protesters take up guns and military units defect as the uprising becomes an armed revolt that will gain support from Western and Arab countries and Turkey. 2012 - A bombing in Damascus is the first by al-Qaida's new Syrian affiliate, the Nusra Front, which gains in power and starts crushing groups with a nationalist ideology. World powers meet in Geneva and agree on the need for a political transition, but their divisions on how to achieve it will foil years of U.N.-sponsored peace efforts. Assad turns his air force on opposition strongholds, as rebels gain ground, and the war escalates with massacres on both sides. 2013 - Lebanon's Hezbollah helps Assad to victory at Qusayr, halting rebel momentum and showing the Iran-backed group's growing role in the conflict. Washington has declared chemical weapons use a red line, but a gas attack on rebel-held eastern Ghouta near Damascus kills scores of civilians without triggering a U.S. military response. 2014 - Islamic State group suddenly seizes Raqqa in the northeast and swathes more territory in Syria and Iraq. Rebels in the Old City of Homs surrender, agreeing to move to an outer suburb — their first big defeat in a major urban area and a precursor to future 'evacuation' deals. Washington builds an anti-Islamic State coalition and starts airstrikes, helping Kurdish forces turn the jihadi tide but creating friction with its ally Turkey. 2015 - With better cooperation and more arms from abroad, rebel groups gain more ground and seize northwestern Idlib, but Islamist militants are taking a bigger role. Russia joins the war on Assad's side with air strikes that turn the conflict against the rebels for years to come. 2016 - Alarmed by Kurdish advances on the border, Turkey launches an incursion with allied rebels, making a new zone of Turkish control. The Syrian army and its allies defeat rebels in Aleppo, seen at the time as Assad's biggest victory of the war. The Nusra Front splits from al-Qaida and starts trying to present itself in a moderate light, adopting a series of new names and eventually settling on Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). 2017 - Israel acknowledges airstrikes against Hezbollah in Syria, aiming to degrade the growing strength of Iran and its allies. U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces defeat Islamic State in Raqqa. That offensive, and a rival one by the Syrian army, drive the jihadi group from nearly all its land. 2018 - The Syrian army recaptures eastern Ghouta, before quickly retaking the other insurgent enclaves in central Syria, and then the rebels' southern bastion of Deraa. 2019 - Islamic State loses its last scrap of territory in Syria. The U.S. decides to keep some troops in the country to prevent attacks on its Kurdish allies. 2020 - Russia backs a government offensive that ends with a ceasefire with Turkey that freezes most front lines. Assad holds most territory and all main cities, appearing deeply entrenched. Rebels hold the northwest. A Turkey-backed force holds a border strip. Kurdish-led forces control the northeast. 2023 - The Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7 triggers fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, ultimately reducing the group's presence in Syria and fatally undermining Assad. 2024 - Rebels launch a new assault on Aleppo. With Assad's allies focused elsewhere his army quickly collapses. Eight days after the fall of Aleppo the rebels have taken most major cities and entered Damascus, driving Assad from power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/timeline-assad-s-fall-followed-years-of-bloodshed-and-division/7891891.html	2024-12-08T14:55:11-08:00	
Kennedy Center honors Coppola, the Grateful Dead, Raitt and Sandoval	Washington — Celebrities, cultural icons and a few surprise guests are gathering for the annual Kennedy Center Honors celebration Sunday evening in Washington. This year's recipients of the lifetime achievement award for artistic accomplishment are director and filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, the Grateful Dead, jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, and singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt. In addition, the venerable Harlem theater The Apollo, which has launched generations of Black artists, is being recognized. There will be personalized tributes with performances and testimonials from fellow artists during the gala at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Medallions were presented during the traditional Saturday night ceremony at the State Department. The tribute performances are often kept secret from the recipients themselves, most notably in 2018 when Cyndi Lauper flat out lied to her longtime friend Cher about being unable to attend. Lauper appeared on stage to perform Cher's hit, 'If I Could Turn Back Time.' Several of the latest honorees have themselves participated in past tributes to friends and colleagues at the Kennedy Center. Coppola spoke during fellow director Martin Scorsese's induction in 2007. Sandoval performed in the tribute to his mentor, jazz trumpet legend Dizzy Gillespie. Raitt has taken part in tributes to Buddy Guy and Mavis Staples. Raitt even attended the Kennedy Center Honors in the 1970s when her father, Broadway performer John Raitt, was taking part in a tribute to composer Richard Rogers. The tribute to the Grateful Dead is expected to double as a memorial to the band's founding bass player Phil Lesh, who died in October at age 84. This could also be the last Kennedy Center Honors ceremony without political intrigue for a while. During Republican Donald Trump's first four years in office, Kennedy Center officials were forced to walk a public tightrope between the tradition of the president attending the ceremony and the open antipathy toward Trump from multiple honorees. In 2017, recipient Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump, who takes office in January, skipped the ceremony for the entirety of his first term. Democratic President Joe Biden is scheduled to host a reception for the honorees at the White House and plans to attend the Kennedy Center ceremony afterward. The show will air on CBS on Dec. 22.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kennedy-center-honors-coppola-the-grateful-dead-raitt-and-sandoval/7891876.html	2024-12-08T13:58:47-08:00	
Biden: Assad’s Syrian collapse a ‘fundamental act of justice’	U.S. President Joe Biden declared Sunday that the sudden demise of the Syrian government under Bashar Assad was a 'fundamental act of justice,' but that it was 'a moment of uncertainty' for the Mideast. Biden, speaking at the White House, said the collapse of the decades-long iron rule by the Assad family was 'the best opportunity in a generation for the Syrian people to forge their own destiny.' Biden said that action by the U.S. and its allies over the last two years weakened Syria's backers — Russia, Iran and Iran-supported Hezbollah militants in Lebanon — to the extent that 'for the first time' they could no longer defend the Assad government. 'Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,' Biden said, after a meeting with his national security advisers at the White House. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday that Assad had fled his country, which his family had ruled for decades, because close ally Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, 'was not interested in protecting him any longer.' Trump’s comments on his social media platform came a day after he decried the possibility that the U.S. might intervene militarily in Syria to aid the rebels as they moved to oust Assad, declaring, 'THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT.' The Biden administration had no intention of intervening, according to Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. The U.S has about 900 troops in Syria, including forces working with Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any resurgence of the Islamic State group. Biden said he intends for those troops to remain, adding that U.S. forces on Sunday conducted 'dozens' of what he called 'precision airstrikes' on Islamic State camps and operations in Syria. Biden said the U.S. is 'clear eyed' that ISIS will try to take advantage of the situation in Syria. The Syrian opposition that brought down Assad is led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The Biden administration has designated the group as a terrorist organization and says it has links to al-Qaida, although Hayat Tahrir al-Sham says it has since broken ties with al-Qaida. 'We will remain vigilant,' Biden said. 'Make no mistake, some of the rebel groups that took down Assad have their own grim record of terrorism and human rights abuses.' He added that the groups are 'saying the right things now.' 'But as they take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just their words, but their actions,' Biden said. Trump, who takes office January 20, linked the upheaval in Syria and Russia's war in Ukraine, noting that Assad's allies in Moscow, as well as in Iran, the main sponsor of Hamas and Hezbollah, 'are in a weakened state right now.' Vice President-elect JD Vance, a veteran of the U.S.-led war in Iraq, wrote on his own social media Sunday to express skepticism about the insurgents. 'Many of 'the rebels' are a literal offshoot of ISIS. One can hope they've moderated. Time will tell,' he said. With the collapse of the Assad regime, the family of missing U.S. journalist Austin Tice renewed calls to find him. 'To everyone in Syria that hears this, please remind people that we're waiting for Austin,' Tice's mother, Debra, said in comments that hostage advocacy groups spread on social media. 'We know that when he comes out, he's going to be fairly dazed & he's going to need lots of care & direction. Direct him to his family please!' Tice disappeared in 2012 outside Damascus. 'We've remained committed to returning him to his family,' Biden told reporters. 'We believe he's alive, we think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence to that yet. And Assad should be held accountable.' The president added: 'We have to identify where he [Tice] is.' Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-assad-s-syrian-collapse-a-fundamental-act-of-justice-/7891867.html	2024-12-08T13:44:18-08:00	
How it happened: Two seismic weeks that toppled Syria's government	London — Half a century of rule by the Assad family in Syria crumbled with astonishing speed after insurgents burst out of a rebel-held enclave and converged on the capital, Damascus, taking city after city in a matter of days. Opposition forces swept across the country and entered Damascus with little or no resistance as the Syrian army melted away. President Bashar Assad, Syria’s ruler for 24 years — succeeding his father, Hafez Assad — fled the country. Russian state media reported that he was in Moscow. It’s a stunning development in Syria’s devastating 13-year conflict. Anti-government protests in 2011 met with a brutal crackdown, escalating into a civil war that has killed more than half a million people and displaced half of Syria’s prewar population of 23 million. Assad, backed by Iran and Russia, gradually regained control of more than two-thirds of Syria, leaving the rebels with one stronghold in the northwest of the country. And there the conflict remained, largely frozen, for years until late November. Here’s a look at a seismic two weeks for the Middle East. Wednesday, Nov. 27: Rebel offensive begins Armed opposition groups launch a large-scale attack on areas controlled by government forces in northwestern Syria and claim to have wrested control of over 15 villages from government forces in northwestern Aleppo province. The government and its allies respond with airstrikes and shelling in an attempt to halt the insurgent advances. The offensive is led by the jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Formerly the Syrian branch of al-Qaida and known as the Nusra Front, HTS later distanced itself from al-Qaida, seeking to market itself as a more moderate group. It is classed as a terrorist group by the United Nations and the U.S. The attack on Aleppo follows weeks of simmering low-level violence, including government attacks on opposition-held areas. Turkey, a main backer of Syrian opposition groups, says the rebels began a limited offensive to stop the attacks, but it expanded as government forces began to retreat. Thursday, Nov. 28: The offensive expands The offensive expands to reach the countryside of Idlib province amid reports government troops are retreating. Friday, Nov. 29: Rebels enter Aleppo The insurgents enter Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, for the first time since they were pushed out in 2016 after a grueling military campaign by Syrian government forces backed by Russia and Iran. They meet with little resistance. Saturday, Nov. 30: Aleppo falls under insurgent control The rebels say they control Aleppo, raising a flag over the city’s citadel and occupying the international airport. The Syrian armed forces claim to have redeployed troops and equipment in preparation for a counterattack. By evening, the insurgents seized at least four towns in the central Hama province and claim to have entered the provincial capital. Sunday, Dec. 1: The government fights back The Syrian military launches a counterattack with troops and airstrikes on Idlib and Aleppo. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visits Damascus, telling Assad that Tehran will support the counteroffensive. But Assad receives little, if any, help from his allies. Russia is busy with its war in Ukraine, and Iran has seen its proxies across the region degraded by regular airstrikes. Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up Assad’s forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Monday, Dec. 2 - Wednesday, Dec. 4: Fighting rages near Hama The insurgents push south, advancing to within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of Hama, the country’s fourth-largest city and a key crossroads in central Syria, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Damascus. State media reports fierce fighting in the province, and both state media and a U.K.-based observer group say government forces, backed by Russian airstrikes, have recaptured some territory. Turkey urges Assad to hold talks with the opposition. Thursday, Dec. 5: Insurgents capture Hama After several days of fighting the rebels swept into Hama. Dozens of jubilant fighters are seen firing weapons into the air in celebration in Assi Square, the site of massive anti-government protests in the early days of the uprising in 2011. The Syrian army says it has redeployed to positions outside the city to protect civilians. Friday, Dec. 6: Rebels advance on Homs Rapidly advancing now, the rebels seize two towns on the outskirts of Homs, Syria’s third-largest city. About 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Hama, Homs is the gateway to Damascus and the location of one of Syria’s two state-owned oil refineries. Capturing it would cut the link between Damascus, Assad’s seat of power, and the coastal region where he enjoys wide support. The government denies reports that its military has withdrawn from the city. Top diplomats from countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Iran and Russia, hold talks on Syria in the Qatari capital, Doha. Saturday, Dec. 7: Homs falls, Assad’s grip weakens Opposition forces take Homs after government forces abandon it. The insurgents say they have encircled Damascus and are carrying out the 'final stage' of their offensive. The U.N. special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, seeks urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition,' as Syrian state media denies Assad has fled the country. Sunday, Dec. 8: Assad is toppled Syrian state television airs a video statement by a group of men saying that President Bashar Assad has been overthrown, and all prisoners have been set free.

Ukrainian couple takes care of abandoned animals despite shelling	The town of Orikhiv in southeastern Ukraine is located just ten kilometers from the front lines and is under almost-constant Russian shelling. Only some 900 people remain, a fraction of those who lived there before the war. Among them is the couple of Yuriy and Lubov Lysenko, who have been caring for dozens of animals that their neighbors left behind. Eva Myronova has the story, narrated by Anna Rice.

India not pursuing shared BRICS currency, analysts say	NEW DELHI — India is not pursuing the creation of a shared BRICS currency, an idea that has met with a strong verbal pushback from incoming U.S. President Donald Trump, but the South Asian giant is making efforts to promote trade in its local currency, according to analysts in New Delhi. Trump has threatened a 100% tariff on products from BRICS nations if they develop their own currency to replace the U.S. dollar. The BRICS bloc, which began with China, Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa, expanded this year to include Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia and Egypt. 'We require a commitment from these countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency nor back any other currency to replace the mighty U.S. dollar,' Trump said in a post on the Truth Social media platform. Talk of a BRICS currency gained some momentum following U.S.-led sanctions on Russia in 2022 and since, in recent years, economic and political tensions have grown between the West and China. Russia and China have publicly expressed a desire to explore diversification of international trade away from the dollar. Ajai Sahai, director general of the Federation of Indian Export Organizations, though, said New Delhi does not plan to move away from the American currency. 'Trump’s post is like a forewarning to tread carefully down this road. But at the moment, this is just an idea, and a common BRICS currency is simply not on India’s agenda,' Sahai said. The creation of such a currency is unlikely to gain traction due to mistrust and internal differences within major countries in the alliance such as India and China, according to analysts working in the Indian capital. 'India is not supportive of this particular initiative. Any common currency is not going to help anyone; only the dominant countries like China ultimately will dictate. So, it is very difficult to develop a consensus to have a common currency,' according to Chintamani Mahapatra, founder of the Kalinga Institute of Indo Pacific Studies. The emerging countries group is also too diverse to make it economically viable to forge a competing currency, according to Mahapatra. 'Unlike the European Union, we [BRICS countries] don’t have a common market. We don’t have a common trade policy. We have nothing in common,' Mahapatra said. At the same time, several BRICS members have accelerated efforts to explore ways to reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar, which has been the world’s dominant currency since the end of World War II. BRICS countries account for about 40% of the world’s population and an estimated one-third of global gross domestic product. At a summit held in the Russian city of Kazan in October, BRICS nations agreed to boost efforts to trade in local currencies rather than in U.S. dollars and said they would strengthen banking networks within the group to facilitate settlements in their currencies. 'Trade in local currencies and smooth cross-border payments will strengthen our economic cooperation,' Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said. India, which adopted a new foreign trade policy last year to support using the rupee more frequently for trade, has identified 17 countries with which it wants to use rupees or the other country’s currency, according to Biswajit Dhar, a senior professor at the Council for Social Development in New Delhi. Those countries include Russia. New Delhi, which did not join U.S. sanctions against Russia, is paying for its crude oil imports from Moscow in rupees. As trade with Russia increases exponentially, though, that also presents problems. 'India runs a huge trade deficit vis-a-vis Russia, which means that when India is buying a lot of oil and is paying in rupees, Russia does not know what to do with the stock of rupees it is holding now,' Dhar said. 'Indian businesses are wary of selling to Russia because of the sanctions.' he said. Aside from Russia, other countries such as Malaysia, Kenya, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh also have agreed to facilitate trade in rupees. Such efforts however are modest, and India’s international trade is still dominated by the dollar. Indian External Affairs Minister Jaishankar Subramanian has said that moving away from the U.S. currency is not part of New Delhi’s economic policy. 'We have never actively targeted the dollar. That's not part of either our economic policy or our political or strategic policy,' he said responding to a question on dedollarization at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington in October. But in an indirect reference to Russia, he said that India had to look for 'workarounds' when trade in dollars with some partners became difficult. 'It was the U.S. actions targeting Russia that made countries search for mechanisms and options to the dollar. It was not to dislodge the dollar’s position,' according to Ajay Srivastava, of the Global Trade Research Initiative. However, he said Trump’s threat to impose 100% tariffs on products coming from countries adopting a BRICS currency makes the idea of such a potential new currency 'unrealistic and more symbolic than practical.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-not-pursuing-shared-brics-currency-analysts-say/7888407.html	2024-12-08T12:31:12-08:00

Trump: Sweeping changes starting on 1st day he takes office	Washington — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is vowing to make swift and sweeping changes as he takes office on January 20, deporting millions of migrants in the country illegally, imposing tariffs on imported goods that could raise consumer prices for Americans and pardoning rioters who tried to upend his 2020 reelection loss. Six weeks ahead of taking office for a new four-year tenure in the White House, Trump seemed emboldened by his victory last month, making him only the second American president elected to a second, nonconsecutive term after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s. 'People like me now, you know?' he told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' in an interview conducted Friday in New York and broadcast Sunday. 'It’s different than the first — you know, when I won the first time [in 2016], I wasn’t nearly as popular as this,' he said. 'And one thing that’s very important, in terms of the election, I love that I won the popular vote, and by a lot,' with about a 2.3 million-vote margin in his defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris out of the 155 million ballots that were cast. But Trump, a Republican, also lapsed into familiar grievances, refusing as he has for four years to concede he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden because of unfounded claims of fraudulent balloting and vote counting. Asked by NBC anchor Kristen Welker how, in his view, Democrats were able to steal that election but not the one a month ago, Trump said, 'Because I think it was too big to rig.' Trump blamed Biden for the nation’s political divide and heaped insults on his perceived foes, including the nine-member House of Representatives committee that spent more than a year examining the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters trying to block lawmakers from certifying that Biden had won the 2020 election. He called the seven Democrats and two Republicans on the investigative panel 'political thugs and, you know, creeps. For what they did, honestly, they should go to jail.' Trump said that on his first day in office he would be 'acting very quickly' to pardon many of the more than 1,200 people convicted of an array of offenses linked to the rioting at the Capitol. Many of them have already completed their prison sentences while others have years to go or have to be tried. He has characterized those imprisoned as 'hostages' and called them 'patriots.' 'These people are living in hell,' he said. Yet Trump said he would not appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Biden. 'I’m not looking to go back into the past,' he said. 'Retribution will be through success.' But he said that if the Senate confirms his choices of former Florida state attorney general, Pam Bondi, as attorney general, and loyal political supporter Kash Patel as FBI director, they would have autonomy in deciding what to investigate and prosecute. Trump described special counsel Jack Smith, who twice indicted him, as 'very corrupt.' Trump centered much of his campaign on closing the southwestern U.S. border with Mexico and said mass deportations will begin quickly. First will be convicted criminals, he said, while other incoming Trump officials have said those with deportation orders will also be among the first to be deported. 'I think you have to do it, and it’s a hard — it’s a very tough thing to do. It’s — but you have to have, you know, you have rules, regulations, laws. They came in illegally,' he said. Trump made no exceptions for families with mixed immigration status, where some family members are in the U.S. legally and some illegally. 'I don’t want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back,' he declared. Trump said the cost and logistical complexity of such a massive deportation plan does not faze him. 'You have no choice,' he said. 'First of all, they’re costing us a fortune. But we’re starting with the criminals, and we’ve got to do it. And then we’re starting with the others, and we’re going to see how it goes.' But he said he would attempt to work with Democratic lawmakers to exempt so-called 'dreamers' from deportation, young children who were brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents and have little connection to their native countries. He also said he will attempt to end birthright citizenship in the U.S., now embedded in the country’s Constitution, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil regardless of the legality of their parents being in the U.S. Trump said he would keep a campaign promise to levy tariffs on imports from America’s biggest trading partners, including China, Mexico and Canada. He acknowledged that he could not 'guarantee American families won’t pay more' as a result of his plan. 'I can’t guarantee anything,' Trump said. 'I can’t guarantee tomorrow.' He said he is actively trying to end Russia’s war on Ukraine, 'if I can.' He said Kyiv may not get as much military assistance under his administration as it has under Biden. During a political debate in September, Trump declined to say he wants Ukraine to win the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-sweeping-changes-starting-on-1st-day-he-takes-office-/7891797.html	2024-12-08T11:57:37-08:00	
‘Moana 2’ cruises to another record weekend, $600 million globally	The Walt Disney Co.'s animated film 'Moana 2' remained at the top of the box office in its second weekend in theaters as it brought in another record haul. The film added $52 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. That brings its domestic total to $300 million, surpassing the original, and its global tally to a staggering $600 million. The amount set a record gross for a movie on the weekend following Thanksgiving weekend, unseating 'Frozen II,' which earned $35.2 million in the same time frame in 2019. The numbers are not adjusted for inflation. Originally conceived as a Disney+ series, 'Moana 2' has already broken into the top five highest grossing releases of the year. Its performance means Disney has three films in this year's top five, including 'Inside Out 2' and 'Deadpool & Wolverine.' The studio also has another big movie on the way before the year ends: Barry Jenkins' 'Mufasa,' out Dec. 20. The weekend also showcased several new releases, including A24’s horror comedy 'Y2K' and the Jude Law crime thriller 'The Order.' But nothing was ever going to present significant competition to the enticing Thanksgiving leftovers, 'Moana 2,' 'Wicked' and 'Gladiator II.' Second place at the box office was occupied by 'Wicked,' which added $34.9 million, bringing its domestic total to $320.5 million in three weeks. Globally, the musical adaptation released by Universal is at $455.6 million. 'Gladiator II' followed in third place with $12.5 million, while 'Red One' came in fourth with $7 million. 'These holdovers are going to create the momentum that’s going to put an $8.5 billion-plus box office year on the horizon,' said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. Pre-pandemic, $11 billion had become the annual norm for the movie business. Since then, the closest the industry has gotten to that number was last year, which cracked $9 billion. This year started off slow and up to a few months ago, Dergarabedian said, even hitting $8 billion for the year was in doubt. But in the two weeks since Thanksgiving, the deficit from last year has narrowed by over 5%. The newcomers struggled to make a significant impact. Even the 10th anniversary rerelease of Christopher Nolan’s 'Interstellar,' which played in only 165 theaters, did better than 'Y2K' ($2.1 million) and 'The Order' ($878,000) combined. Paramount reported that the science fiction epic starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway brought in an estimated $4.4 million. IMAX also noted that all the 70mm IMAX presentations of 'Interstellar' were sold out through the weekend. 'I was thrilled so many moviegoers took advantage of the original IMAX experience of ‘Interstellar’ this weekend,' Nolan said in a statement. The biggest of the many newcomers was the Indian action pic 'Pushpa: The Rule – Part 2,' which earned $4.9 million. Sony and Crunchyroll's anime release, 'Solo Leveling – ReAwakening,' made $2.4 million. Fathom also released pop duo for KING + COUNTRY’s 'A Drummer Boy Christmas' concert in theaters where it made $2.1 million. 'It’s a really diverse marketplace,' Dergarabedian said. 'There's event cinema, international cinema, a rerelease of a 10-year-old film. It's easily one of the most eclectic and interesting lineups I’ve ever seen.' Next weekend theaters are in for another influx of bigger movies, with both Sony's comic book film 'Kraven the Hunter' and the animated 'The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim' opening in wide release. Awards contenders 'Nickel Boys' and 'September 5' will also open in a limited number of theaters. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. 'Moana 2,' $52 million. 2. 'Wicked,' $34.9 million. 3. 'Gladiator II,' $12.5 million. 4. 'Red One,' $7 million. 5. 'Pushpa: The Rule – Part 2,' $4.9 million. 6. 'Interstellar' rerelease, $4.4 million. 7. 'Solo Leveling – ReAwakening,' $2.4 million. 8. 'Y2K,' $2.1 million. 9. 'for KING + COUNTRY’S: A Drummer Boy Christmas,' $2.1 million. 10. 'The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,' $1.5 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moana-2-cruises-to-another-record-weekend-600-million-globally/7891791.html	2024-12-08T11:33:54-08:00

UN calls for unity in Syria as rebels topple Assad regime	New York — The U.N. secretary-general called for calm and avoiding violence Sunday, in the aftermath of the sudden and stunning fall of Syria’s Assad regime to rebel forces. 'After 14 years of brutal war and the fall of the dictatorial regime, today the people of Syria can seize an historic opportunity to build a stable and peaceful future,' Antonio Guterres said in a statement. 'The future of Syria is a matter for the Syrians to determine, and my Special Envoy will be working with them towards that end.' His envoy, Geir Pedersen said that the country is in a 'watershed moment' in its history, with immense challenges ahead, and must avoid bloodshed and preserve unity as it transitions. 'This dark chapter has left deep scars, but today we look forward with cautious hope to the opening of a new time — one of peace, reconciliation, dignity, and inclusion for all Syrians,' U.N. Syria envoy Pedersen told reporters in Doha, Qatar where he is attending meetings about the situation. On November 27, multiple rebel groups aligned under the leadership of U.N.-designated terror group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) launched their biggest challenge in years to the regime of President Bashar Assad. They made stunning gains in just over one week, first sweeping into the northwest city of Aleppo, then taking towns and villages in Idlib governorate. Emboldened, they continued to the central city of Hama and then Homs, capturing them. Late Saturday, the rebels made their way to the capital, Damascus. President Assad and his family reportedly left the city ahead of their arrival to an unknown destination. The U.N. envoy said he had no information on Assad’s whereabouts. On their telegram channel Saturday, HTS announced Assad’s fall and said it is the beginning of a new era for the country, which has been torn apart by nearly 14 years of civil war. It will be a 'new Syria' where 'everyone lives in peace and justice prevails,' the group said. The Assad family has ruled Syria with an iron grip since 1971, first Hafez and then his son, Bashar. 'Let me urge all Syrians to prioritize dialogue, unity, and respect for international humanitarian law and human rights as they seek to rebuild their society,' Pedersen said. 'Let me stress that there must be a collective effort to secure peace and dignity for all.' He said he is ready to support the Syrian people in their journey toward a stable and inclusive future that they will decide and shape themselves. 'But to this end, let me emphasize the clear desire expressed by millions of Syrians that stable and inclusive transitional arrangements are put in place urgently, and that the Syrian institutions continue to function, and that the Syrian people are enabled to begin to chart the path to meeting the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people and restore a unified Syria, with its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, in a way that can receive the support and engagement of the entire international community,' Pedersen said. Pedersen acknowledged that the fact that HTS is a designated terrorist group 'creates challenges.' 'It's extremely important that we now see on the ground a development that proves that we can achieve, you know, a transition to what I hope will be a democratic future for Syria,' he emphasized. The U.N. has been involved in trying to end the Syrian conflict since its start in 2011. Security Council resolution 2254 in 2015 laid out a road map for a Syrian-owned and led process with U.N. facilitation for reaching a political settlement. Mediation has been stalled for years. Pedersen is the fourth in a string of U.N. envoys who have tried to resolve the conflict, which has killed an estimated half-million Syrians and displaced more than 12 million others. The United Nations said Friday that at least 370,000 people have been displaced in northwest Syria in the latest fighting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-calls-for-unity-in-syria-as-rebels-topple-assad-regime-/7891705.html	2024-12-08T09:54:25-08:00	
As Assad falls, fighting intensifying over northern Syria town	Hours after Syrian rebel forces announced the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime, Turkish-backed armed groups launched an attack Sunday on a town in northern Syria under the control of U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces. The Syrian National Army, or SNA, a coalition of Turkish-backed militias, announced advances in several parts of Manbij, a town in northern Syria, as intense clashes erupted with fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), according to the Turkey’s state-run Anadolu. But the Manbij Military Council, which is affiliated with the SDF, denied that 'large parts of the city' have been controlled by Turkish-backed groups, saying in a statement Sunday that its fighters were continuing their military mission in Manbij. The SDF said that several administrative buildings in Manbij were targeted in Turkish military strikes. The Turkish military has not commented on the developments in the city. Manbij, located in Aleppo province, has been under the control of U.S.-backed SDF fighters since it was liberated from Islamic State militants in 2016. But Turkey, which views the SDF as a terrorist organization, has been supporting rebel groups in efforts to expel the Kurdish-led forces from the area. A reporter with VOA’s Kurdish Service in northern Syria said that after hours of fierce fighting between the two sides, some Turkish-backed groups have retreated from Manbij while others remain positioned outside the city. He added that SNA’s Sunday attack was aided by some sleeper cells inside the city. The 11-day rapid rebel offensive across the country, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, resulted in the capture of the capital Damascus and other strategic cities in northwest and central Syria. Simultaneously, an operation led by SNA factions aimed at dislodging Kurdish forces from parts of Aleppo province. Following the collapse of the Syrian regime in Damascus, SDF General Commander Mazloum Abdi stated that the country was experiencing a historic moment. 'This change is an opportunity to build a new Syria based on democracy and justice that guarantee the rights of all Syrians,' he said on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.

Who is Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of the insurgency that toppled Syria's Assad?	BEIRUT — Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the militant leader whose stunning insurgency toppled Syria's President Bashar Assad, has spent years working to remake his public image, renouncing longtime ties to al-Qaida and depicting himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. In recent days, the insurgency even dropped his nom de guerre and began referring to him by his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa. The extent of that transformation from jihadi extremist to would-be state builder is now put to the test. Insurgents control capital Damascus, Assad has fled into hiding, and for the first time after 50 years of his family's iron hand, it is an open question how Syria will be governed. Syria is home to multiple ethnic and religious communities, often pitted against each other by Assad's state and years of war. Many of them fear the possibility Sunni Islamist extremists will take over. The country is also fragmented among disparate armed factions, and foreign powers from Russia and Iran to the United States, Turkey and Israel all have their hands in the mix. The 42-year-old al-Golani — labeled a terrorist by the United States — has not appeared publicly since Damascus fell early Sunday. But he and his insurgent force, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS — many of whose fighters are jihadis — stand to be a major player. For years, al-Golani worked to consolidate power, while bottled up in the province of Idlib in Syria's northwest corner as Assad's Iranian- and Russian-backed rule over much of the country appeared solid. He maneuvered among extremist organizations while eliminating competitors and former allies. He sought to polish the image of his de-facto 'salvation government' that has been running Idlib to win over international governments and reassure Syria's religious and ethnic minorities. And he built ties with various tribes and other groups. Along the way, al-Golani shed his garb as a hard-line Islamist guerrilla and put on suits for press interviews, talking of building state institutions and decentralizing power to reflect Syria's diversity. 'Syria deserves a governing system that is institutional, no one where a single ruler makes arbitrary decisions,' he said in an interview with CNN last week, offering the possibility HTS would eventually be dissolved after Assad falls. 'Don't judge by words, but by actions,' he said. Al-Golani's beginnings in Iraq Al-Golani's ties to al-Qaida stretch back to 2003, when he joined extremists battling U.S. troops in Iraq. The Syrian native was detained by the U.S. military but remained in Iraq. During that time, al-Qaida usurped like-minded groups and formed the extremist Islamic State of Iraq, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In 2011, a popular uprising against Syria's Assad triggered a brutal government crackdown and led to all-out war. Al-Golani's prominence grew when al-Baghdadi sent him to Syria to establish a branch of al-Qaida called the Nusra Front. The United States labeled the new group as a terrorist organization. That designation still remains in place and the U.S. government has put a $10 million bounty on him. The Nusra Front and the Syrian conflict As Syria's civil war intensified in 2013, so did al-Golani's ambitions. He defied al-Baghdadi's calls to dissolve the Nusra Front and merge it with al-Qaida's operation in Iraq, to form the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Al-Golani nonetheless pledged his allegiance to al-Qaida, which later disassociated itself from ISIS. The Nusra Front battled ISIS and eliminated much of its competition among the Syrian armed opposition to Assad. In his first interview in 2014, al-Golani kept his face covered, telling a reporter for Qatari network Al-Jazeera that he rejected political talks in Geneva to end the conflict. He said his goal was to see Syria ruled under Islamic law and made clear that there was no room for the country's Alawite, Shiite, Druze and Christian minorities. Consolidating power and rebranding In 2016, al-Golani revealed his face to the public for the first time in a video message that announced his group was renaming itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham — the Syria Conquest Front — and cutting its ties to al-Qaida. 'This new organization has no affiliation to any external entity,' he said in the video, filmed wearing military garb and a turban. The move paved the way for al-Golani to assert full control over fracturing militant groups. A year later, his alliance rebranded again as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — meaning Organization for Liberating Syria — as the groups merged, consolidating al-Golani's power in northwest Syria's Idlib province. HTS later clashed with independent Islamist militants who opposed the merger, further emboldening al-Golani and his group as the leading power in northwestern Syria, able to rule with an iron fist. With his power consolidated, al-Golani set in motion a transformation that few could have imagined. Replacing his military garb with shirt and trousers, he began calling for religious tolerance and pluralism. He appealed to the Druze community in Idlib, which the Nusra Front had previously targeted, and visited the families of Kurds who were killed by Turkish-backed militias. In 2021, al-Golani had his first interview with an American journalist on PBS. Wearing a blazer, with his short hair gelled back, the now more soft-spoken HTS leader said that his group posed no threat to the West and that sanctions imposed against it were unjust. 'Yes, we have criticized Western policies,' he said. 'But to wage a war against the United States or Europe from Syria, that's not true. We didn't say we wanted to fight.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-is-abu-mohammed-al-golani-the-leader-of-the-insurgency-that-toppled-syria-s-assad-/7891514.html	2024-12-08T06:07:31-08:00	
Trump calls for 'immediate ceasefire' in Ukraine after meeting Zelenskyy in Paris	KYIV — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, shortly after a meeting in Paris with French and Ukrainian leaders, claiming Kyiv 'would like to make a deal' to end the more than 1,000-day war. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed that Moscow and Kyiv have both lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a war that 'should never have started.' 'There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin. Too many lives are being needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed,' he said, as he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to act to bring the fighting to an end. Trump's remarks came after a meeting Saturday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, that Zelenskyy later described as 'constructive'. Speaking to reporters later that day, Zelenskyy insisted that any peace deal 'should be just' for Ukrainians, 'so that Russia and Putin or any other aggressors will not have the opportunity to return.' In a separate social media update Sunday, Zelenskyy asserted that Kyiv has so far lost 43,000 soldiers since Moscow's all-out invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, while a further 370,000 have been wounded. Both Russia and Ukraine have been reluctant to publish official casualty figures, but Western officials have said that the past few months of grinding positional warfare in eastern Ukraine have meant record losses for both sides, with tens of thousands killed and wounded each month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-calls-for-immediate-ceasefire-in-ukraine-after-meeting-zelenskyy-in-paris-/7891506.html	2024-12-08T05:47:58-08:00

Ghana ruling party candidate concedes in presidential election	ACCRA, GHANA — Ghana's ruling New Patriotic Party candidate, Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, on Sunday conceded defeat in the country's presidential election after failing to shake off widespread frustration over the struggling economy. Defeat in Saturday's election ended two terms in power for the NPP under President Nana Akufo-Addo, marked by Ghana's worst economic crisis in years, high inflation and a debt default. 'The people of Ghana have spoken, the people have voted for change at this time and we respect it with all humility,' Bawumia said in a news conference. Bawumia said he had called his opponent, National Democratic Congress (NDC) candidate and former president John Mahama, to congratulate him. Blaring horns and cheering, Mahama supporters were already gathering and celebrating outside the party campaign headquarters in Accra. On his X account, Mahama confirmed he had received Bawumia's congratulatory call over his 'emphatic victory.' The vice president said Mahama won the presidency 'decisively' as well as Mahama's NDC party winning the country's parliament election, according the NPP's own internal tally of votes. Ghana's economic woes dominated the election, after the west Africa gold and cacao producer went through a crisis of default and currency devaluation, ending with a $3 billion International Monetary Fud bailout. Earlier, NDC spokesperson Sammy Gyamfi told reporters the party's internal review of results showed Mahama won 56.3% of the vote against 41.3% for Bawumia. 'It is very clear the people of this country have voted for change,' Gyamfi said. Political parties had agents at polling stations to observe and tally the initial vote counts before the ballots were sent for official collation by the election commission. Earlier, Commission Deputy Commissioner Bossman Asare told reporters regional results had yet to arrive at the national center. The commission had said official results were likely due by Tuesday. With a history of democratic stability, Ghana's two main parties, the NPP and NDC, have alternated in power equally since the return to multiparty politics in 1992. Under the slogan 'Break the 8' -- a reference to two terms in power -- Bawumia had sought to lead the NPP to an unprecedented third term. But he struggled to break away from criticism of Akufo-Addo's economic record. Though inflation slowed from more than 50% to around 23%, and other macro-economic indicators are stabilizing, economic struggles were still a clear election issue for many. That frustration opened the way for a comeback challenge from Mahama, who was president from 2012 to 2017 but since failed twice in presidential bids.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ghana-ruling-party-candidate-concedes-in-presidential-election/7891419.html	2024-12-08T02:52:04-08:00	
Syrians celebrate as rebels topple Assad	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — The Syrian government collapsed early Sunday, falling to a lightning rebel offensive that seized control of the capital of Damascus and sent crowds into the streets to celebrate the end of the Assad family's 50 years of iron rule. Syrian state television aired a video statement by a group of men saying that President Bashar Assad had been overthrown and all prisoners had been set free. The man who read the statement said the opposition group, known as the Operations Room to Conquer Damascus, called on all rebel fighters and citizens to preserve the institutions of 'the free Syrian state.' The statement emerged hours after the head of a Syrian opposition war monitor said Assad had left the country for an undisclosed location, fleeing ahead of insurgents who said they had entered Damascus following a remarkably swift advance across the country. Many of the capital's residents were in disbelief at the speed at which Assad lost his hold on the country after nearly 14 years of civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced half the country's prewar population of 23 million and drew in several foreign powers. Celebrations erupt across capital As daylight broke over Damascus, crowds gathered to pray in the city's mosques and to celebrate in the squares, chanting 'God is great.' People also chanted anti-Assad slogans and honked car horns. In the streets, teen boys picked up weapons that had apparently been discarded by security forces and fired them in the air. Soldiers and police officers left their posts and fled, and looters broke into the Defense Ministry. Videos from Damascus showed families wandering into the presidential palace, with some emerging carrying stacks of plates and other household items. 'I did not sleep last night, and I refused to sleep until I heard the news of his fall,' said Mohammed Amer Al-Oulabi, 44, who works in the electricity sector. 'From Idlib to Damascus, it only took them [the opposition forces] a few days, thank God. May God bless them, the heroic lions who made us proud.' Meanwhile, organizations that had previously been close to Assad's government attempted to distance themselves from it. Syria's al-Watan newspaper, which was historically pro-government, wrote: 'We are facing a new page for Syria. We thank God for not shedding more blood. We believe and trust that Syria will be for all Syrians.' The newspaper added that media workers should not be blamed for publishing government statements in the past. 'We only carried out the instructions and published the news they sent us,' it said. 'It quickly became clear now that it was false.' A statement from the Alawite sect — to which Assad belongs and which has formed the core of his base — called on young Syrians to be 'calm, rational and prudent and not to be dragged into what tears apart the unity of our country.' 'We were and still are advocates of peace and advocates of unity,' it said. The statement called for 'the language of reason and dialogue to prevail over all parties in the service of Syria and its great people.' Assad's whereabouts unknown Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said in a video statement that the government was ready to 'extend its hand' to the opposition and turn its functions over to a transitional government. He later told Saudi television network Al-Arabiyya that he does not know where Assad and the defense minister are. He said he lost communication with Assad late Saturday. Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told The Associated Press that Assad took a flight Sunday from Damascus. A senior diplomat from the United Arab Emirates, which had sought to rehabilitate Assad's image and has welcomed high-profile exiles in recent years, declined to comment on his whereabouts when asked by reporters at a conference in Bahrain. Anwar Gargash said Assad's destination at this point is a 'footnote in history,' comparing it to the long exile of German Kaiser Wilhelm II after World War I. Assad has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war, including a 2013 chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of the capital. There was no immediate comment from Iran, which had been Assad's staunchest supporter. The Iranian Embassy in Damascus was ransacked after apparently having been abandoned. AP footage showed broken windows and documents scattered in the entryway. Entry into Damascus caps lightning advance Opposition forces had not reached Damascus since 2018, when Syrian troops recaptured areas on the outskirts of the capital following a yearslong siege. The night before, opposition forces took the central city of Homs, Syria's third-largest, as government forces abandoned it. The city stands at an important intersection between Damascus, the capital, and Syria's coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus — the Syrian leader's base of support and home to a Russian strategic naval base. The rebels had already seized the cities of Aleppo and Hama, as well as large parts of the south, in a fast-moving offensive that began November 27. The advances in the past week were by far the largest in recent years by opposition factions, led by a group that has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. In their push to overthrow Assad's government, the insurgents, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, have met little resistance from the Syrian army. UN calls for 'orderly transition' HTS set up a 'salvation government' in 2017 to administer a large region in northwestern Syria under its control. In recent years, HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has sought to remake the group's image, cutting ties with al-Qaida, ditching hard-line officials and vowing to embrace pluralism and religious tolerance. 'Golani has made history and sparked hope among millions of Syrians,' said Dareen Khalifa, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and an expert on Syrian groups. 'But he and the rebels now face a formidable challenge ahead. One can only hope they rise to the occasion.' The U.N.'s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, called Saturday for urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition.' Speaking to reporters at the annual Doha Forum in Qatar, he said the situation in Syria was changing by the minute. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, whose country is Assad's chief international backer, said he feels 'sorry for the Syrian people.' The Israeli military said Sunday it has deployed forces in a demilitarized buffer zone along its northern frontier with Syria following the rebel offensive there. The military, which said it also sent troops to 'other places necessary for its defense,' said the deployment was meant to provide security for residents of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast war and the international community, except for the United States, views it as occupied.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rebels-topple-syrian-government-ending-50-years-of-iron-rule-by-assad-family/7891386.html	2024-12-08T00:46:06-08:00	
World's oldest-known wild bird lays egg in Hawaii at age 74	The oldest known wild bird in the world has laid an egg at the ripe age of about 74, her first in four years, U.S. wildlife officials said. The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the northwestern edge of the Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg, the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said in a Facebook post this week. Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, had returned to the atoll in the Pacific Ocean to lay and hatch eggs since 2006. Laysan albatrosses mate for life and lay one egg per year. But Akeakamai has not been seen for several years, and Wisdom began interacting with another male when she returned last week, officials said. 'We are optimistic that the egg will hatch,' Jonathan Plissner, supervisory wildlife biologist at Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, said in a statement. Every year, millions of seabirds return to the refuge to nest and raise their young. Albatross parents take turns incubating an egg for about two months. Chicks fly out to sea about five to six months after hatching. They spend most of their lives flying over the ocean and feeding on squid and fish eggs. Wisdom was first banded as an adult in 1956 and has raised as many as 30 chicks, Plissner said. The typical lifespan of a Laysan albatross is 68 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-s-oldest-known-wild-bird-lays-egg-in-hawaii/7890334.html	2024-12-08T00:16:58-08:00	
Japanese artist finds global fans with intricate leaf-cutting	TOKYO — A frog holding a taro-leaf umbrella. A parade of frolicking animals. An Ukiyo-e style Mount Fuji. Giant waves. A Japanese artist who goes by the name Lito carves these delicate designs on fallen leaves, giving life back to them. The world of Lito's delicate art, which he began in 2020 and posts on social media almost daily, has won fans from around the world. The leaf art has also given him solace after earlier struggles with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and a purpose in life — the joy of making people happy with his art. He enjoys working at night. From a pile of leaves treated with a wrinkle-free chemical, he picks one and places it on a cutting board. First, he outlines the design on the leaf with a pen in his right hand. Then he takes a design knife in his left hand and starts cutting the leaf carefully. Slowly, the leaf begins to take the shape of a frog carrying an umbrella — a simple design he demonstrated in a recent interview with The Associated Press. More complex, highly intensive work on a single leaf can take more than eight hours to complete. His leaf-cutting works include titles such as Scrolls of Frolicking Animals, Leaf Aquarium and Thirty-six Views of Mt. Fuji: The Great Wave off Kanagawa. Each piece includes his own twists and often uses animals. 'I would rather finish it in one go when I am focused,' Lito, 38, said. He didn't want to disclose his real name for personal reasons. Since his childhood, Lito says he has had high levels of concentration and patience. But he had trouble fitting into what was considered the norm at school or at work, despite all his efforts. He struggled to interpret others' feelings and to avoid confrontations. After years of difficulty, he went to a hospital at age 30 and was told he has ADHD, a diagnosis that he felt explained why he has always done things differently. He saw no point in forcing himself to do things the same way as other people, and began to adjust his life. In early 2020, Lito came across the art of leaf cutting. He saw it as the perfect use of his patience and concentration. Word of his skills has spread across social media, and he has published books on his leaf-cutting work. He holds a near monthly solo exhibition in various places in Japan. 'If I can make people happy by doing what I am doing, I want to do more. That's my driving force for what's next,' Lito says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japanese-artist-finds-global-fans-with-intricate-leaf-cutting/7887919.html	2024-12-08T00:16:22-08:00	
As data centers proliferate, conflict with local communities follows	ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA — Richard Andre Newman thought he would live the rest of his life in his quiet, leafy neighborhood in suburban Virginia. He was born and raised in Bren Mar Park, where children ride their bikes and neighbors wave hello. But now, as he's approaching 60, he's considering selling his Fairfax County home and moving away. That's because he's getting a new neighbor: Plaza 500, a 466,000-square-foot data center and an adjacent electrical substation to be built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center. Newman feels helpless to stop it. 'I planned on staying here until I died,' he said, 'until this came up.' The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States. Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and local governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies. But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities. Tyler Ray, a vocal critic of data centers and leader in the fight against the Virginia project, said the incentives offered are not enough to counteract the consequences of building a facility so close to homes. 'All that we are asking for is, as the county is trying to bring in this data center income, that they are doing it in a way that doesn't run residents away from their homes,' he said. Dotting the hills in Northern Virginia In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties. Cyclists who ride the popular Washington & Old Dominion trail are at times flanked by data centers, and the thousands of commuters who head into the nation's capital each day can see them in the distance from the Metro. Plaza 500, one of the latest proposals in the area, is encroaching on neighborhoods like never before, said Newman, who heads a homeowners association in the community. The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised a significant property tax boost and, in addition to permanent positions in the data center itself, hundreds of temporary construction and electrical jobs to build the facility. Tyler Ray and his husband moved to the Bren Pointe community in 2022, hoping to balance proximity to Washington with a desire for green space. But shortly after the couple moved in, Starwood Capital began scoping out a commercial property near their new home as a possible location for the Plaza 500 project. When Ray and his neighbors learned of the proposal, they held protests, attended regular county meetings and drew media attention to their concerns to try and stop the development. But their efforts were largely unsuccessful: the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project would be grandfathered in under the old rules. Ray worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere. A spokesperson for the firm declined to respond to questions for this story. 'I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue,' Ray said, 'has any chance to go up against the data center industry.' Local leaders say data centers a financial boon For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's existing data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue, more than the $750 million in tax breaks given to the tech companies that own them in 2023. For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs — often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its two data centers in Loudoun County, which has about 440,000 residents, created only around 150 direct jobs. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs. Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits. 'I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,' Smith said. 'Data centers are not going away.' Amazon data centers welcomed by some in Oregon On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river. Last year, AWS, which is owned by Amazon, paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. The company also paid out $10 million total in two, one-time payments to a community development fund and spent another $1.7 million in charitable donations in the community in 2023. That money has been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services for the roughly 12,000-person county, going toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer, police body cameras, and $5,000 grants for homebuyers among other things. Still, some residents are skeptical of the scale of tax break deals. Suspicions started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint against them. Those officials are no longer in office. But some remain wary of the relationships between the company and local officials, and raised eyebrows at one of the latest data center deals which gives AWS an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers. Former county commissioner Jim Doherty described a meeting with AWS officials soon after he was elected to office at an upscale restaurant in Boardman, where large windows opened onto the Columbia River. The AWS representatives asked what Doherty wanted to accomplish as a commissioner. 'They said, 'Tell us what your dreams are. Tell us what you need. Tell us what we can do for you,'' Doherty recalled. Other former officials have described similar interactions. Doherty said AWS didn't ask for anything in return, but the exchange left him uneasy. 'We engage with stakeholders in every community where we operate around the world, and part of that outreach is to better understand a community's goals,' said Kevin Miller, AWS' Vice President of global data centers. 'This helps AWS be a catalyst for communities to achieve those goals, and reflects our ongoing commitment to being good neighbors.' Doherty and another former county commissioner Melissa Lindsay said they pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations. They also lobbied to hire outside counsel to negotiate on their behalf, feeling outgunned by the phalanx of AWS-suited lawyers. 'We didn't want to blow it up. We didn't want to run them off,' said Lindsay. 'But there were better deals to be made.' Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer and Police Chief Rick Stokoe say their direct line to AWS allows them to get the most out of the company. 'This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS,' said Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement. Both Keefer and Stokoe have been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks for AWS. 'These companies would not be here if they weren't getting some kind of incentive,' Stokoe said. 'There wouldn't be any money to talk about.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-data-centers-proliferate-conflict-with-local-communities-follows/7889331.html	2024-12-08T00:14:38-08:00	
Senegalese artisans in the spotlight as they exhibit for the first time at a prestigious art event	DAKAR, SENEGAL — For the artistic and cultural elites of Senegal, the monthlong Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Arts is a celebratory moment. Every two years, hundreds of artists, curators and art lovers from across the world descend on the West African capital to attend the event, which was founded in 1989 by the Senegalese government and has over the decades become one of the most important showcases on the continent. Pop-up exhibitions are held in hundreds of venues, from stylish five-star hotels to local art galleries. Roads are even more crowded than usual, with traffic jams stretching out for miles along the Corniche, the city's picturesque seaside boulevard. Every night, there are music concerts, fashion shows, talks with artists and movie screenings held against the backdrop of palm trees and to the soundtrack of popping champagne bottles. But it wasn't until this year that the local artisans in the Soumbedioune crafts market, just off the Corniche and at the doorstep on the Medina working-class neighborhood, realized what the Biennale was. For years, 'we saw the OFF signs, but we didn't know what was going on,' said Ndiouga Dia, a 48-year-old leatherworker from Soumbedioune, referring to a series of events organized in parallel to the official government program, scattered all over the city. 'Only the artists knew among themselves what was going on.' Craftsmanship is deeply rooted in the country's culture. Senegal, like most African nations, has little capacity for industrial production, and traditionally much of its economy has relied on locally produced goods. For centuries, craftsmen played a central role in Senegalese social life, sculpting religious statues and ceremonial masks, sewing boubous (traditional colorful wide-sleeved robes), molding pottery and weaving baskets. But these days, their role is in decline. As living costs rise, many Senegalese opt for cheaper, often Chinese products. And those that can afford it buy Western clothes and furniture to mark their social status. So when two designers approached Dia, who is also the community leader of the Soumbedioune artisans, with a proposal for a joint exhibition, he didn't hesitate for a second. It felt good to be noticed and included, Dia said. Designers Kemi Bassène and Khadim Ndiaye asked five artisans — a sculptor, a painter, a jeweler, a leatherworker and a upholsterer — to interpret the theme of 'hippo.' They chose the theme because it was easily recognizable across Africa, they said, bringing together people from different nations who live next to the water. The exhibition, held in the central square of Soumbedioune, surrounded by artisanal boutiques and restaurants selling thieboudienne, the most famous Senegalese dish, has been a hit among locals. There are hippo earrings and a hippo necklace; a giant wooden sculpture of a sleeping hippo; and a hippo-shaped bag. Papise Kanté, a 45-year-old sculptor who created two wooden hippo statues for the exhibition, said it allowed him to tap into a more creative part of his work, instead of just producing objects that he intended to sell. 'I have been sculpting since I was a young child,' said Kanté, who comes from a long line of sculptors. 'Every artist wants to get better.' But it also gave his work recognition. 'It's because of the Biennale that people know my work,' he said. If you participate in the Biennale, he added, 'you are proud.' Bassène, the curator, grew up in Medina, next to Soumbedioune, but is now based in Paris. He said he wanted to bridge the divide between arts and crafts. 'This is the first time in the history that artisans, especially those who are custodians of traditional craftsmanship, are invited to the Biennale,' Bassène said. 'For craftsmen in Africa, there is a natural progression towards the world of modern design.' It was 'normal,' he said, to include artisans in the Biennale 'if we wanted to try to decolonize a little.' This year's Biennale is being held as Senegal is undergoing profound political change, with the newly elected authorities charting a more self-reliant and pan-African course. Last month, the governing party, PASTEF, secured a resounding victory in legislative elections. Its win granted President Bassirou Diomaye Faye a clear mandate to carry out ambitious reforms promised during the campaign to improve living conditions for ordinary Senegalese — including greater economic self-reliance, revamping the fishing industry, and making maximum use of natural resources. The theme of this year's Biennale has been 'The Wake,' alluding to the emancipation of the African continent from its remaining dependence on former colonial powers. The new government of Senegal has 'a transformational agenda,' said Bassène. 'I think that what we have experienced politically will impact all the social sciences and all art.' In the meantime, the Soumbedioune artisans have big plans. Dia, the community leader, said that they are planning a collaboration with a local school to manufacture backpacks for students. His dream, he said, was to expand the production across the whole country so the Senegalese parents 'do not have to buy Chinese products.' 'We have all the know-how,' he said. 'We can produce more.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/senegalese-artisans-in-the-spotlight-as-they-exhibit-for-the-first-time-at-a-prestigious-art-event/7887944.html	2024-12-08T00:13:27-08:00	
Sumo wrestlers bring 1,500 years of tradition to London as sport has international moment	LONDON — London's Royal Albert Hall, the gilded concert venue known for an annual Rule Britannia singalong, is preparing to host a different kind of spectacle: Sumo wrestling. Camera shutters clicked furiously and reporters 'Ahhhed' in delight Wednesday as wrestlers Daisuke Kitanowaka and Akira Fukutsuumi demonstrated a sideways stamp and put on an exhibition of heavyweight grappling to promote a tournament scheduled for next October. It marks only the second time an elite five-day tournament will be held outside Japan. The first was in 1991 at the same venue. Organizers are hoping to whip up the kind of excitement that was generated three decades ago, when the deeply ritualistic sport attracted sell-out crowds and a national television audience. 'It wasn't just an event here at the hall,'' said James Ainscough, chief executive of the Royal Albert Hall. 'It became a national moment. People talked about it in the workplace. You could see kids acting it out each day in playgrounds the length and breadth of the country. So it's a huge honor and a huge matter of excitement to welcome it back in 2025.'' A variety of factors, including a series of sumo wrestling scandals, the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, delayed the sport's return to London. But organizers believe the time is right because sumo is having a bit of a moment. Two Netflix series have introduced audiences to the intricacies of the sport, which has roots stretching back 1,500 years. Earlier this year, Hanshin Contents Link opened a sumo hall in Osaka, Japan's third-largest city, that entertains foreign tourists with explanatory exhibitions and actual bouts. Organizers of the London event say they hope to show Japan's rich culture as well as its traditional sport that pits two huge men clad in very little against each other in a test of strength and technique. On hand Wednesday was the winner of the previous U.K. tournament, Nobuyoshi Hakkaku, nicknamed 'bulldog'' by British fans in 1991. Now the chairman of the Japan Sumo Association, he reminisced about how the only thing that made him really nervous was preparing for a victory speech in English. Japan's ambassador to the U.K., Hiroshi Suzuki, also made an appearance, a reflection of the event's importance to the nation. Organizers promised that spectators also would see exhibitions of Kabuki theater and other Japanese traditions. But the main attraction were the wrestlers. Kitanowaka and Fukutsuumi gamely tried to show off their sport. Clad in their mawashi, or ceremonial aprons, they faced off on a mat in front of several dozen journalists. The big men slammed into each other with an 'oomph' as flesh slapped flesh. A grunt or two broke the silence. No sweat was evident. It was over in a flash. Then they went outside, dropping their robes and exposing their flesh to the frosty November air as they entered and exited a classic London black cab for photographers.

Assad’s ouster after 14 years of war in Syria brings to an end a decades-long dynasty	BEIRUT — The fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government Sunday brought to a dramatic close his nearly 14-year struggle to hold onto power as his country fragmented amid a brutal civil war that became a proxy battlefield for regional and international powers. Assad's downfall came as a stark contrast to his first months as Syria's unlikely president in 2000, when many hoped he would be a young reformer after three decades of his father's iron grip. Only 34 years old, the Western-educated ophthalmologist was a rather geeky tech-savvy fan of computers with a gentle demeanor. But when faced with protests against his rule that erupted in March 2011, Assad turned to the brutal tactics of his father in an attempt to crush them. As the uprising hemorrhaged into an outright civil war, he unleashed his military to blast opposition-held cities, with support from allies Iran and Russia. International rights groups and prosecutors alleged widespread use of torture and extrajudicial executions in Syria's government-run detention centers. The Syrian war has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the country's pre-war population of 23 million. As the uprising spiraled into a civil war, millions of Syrians fled across the borders into Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon and on to Europe. His departure brings an end to the Assad family rule, spanning just under 54 years. With no clear successor, it throws the country into further uncertainty. Until recently, it seemed that Assad was almost out of the woods. The long-running conflict had settled along frozen conflict lines in recent years, with Assad's government regaining control of most of Syria's territory while the northwest remained under the control of opposition groups and the northeast under Kurdish control. While Damascus remained under crippling Western sanctions, neighboring countries had begun to resign themselves to Assad's continued hold on power. The Arab League reinstated Syria's membership last year, and Saudi Arabia in May announced the appointment of its first ambassador to Syria since severing ties with Damascus 12 years earlier. However, the geopolitical tide turned quickly with a surprise offensive launched by opposition groups based in northwest Syria in late November. Government forces quickly collapsed, while Assad's allies, preoccupied by other conflicts — including Russia's war in Ukraine and the yearlong wars between Israel and the Iran-backed militant groups Hezbollah and Hamas — appeared reluctant to forcefully intervene. Assad's whereabouts were not clear Sunday, amid reports he had left the country as insurgents took control of the Syrian capital. He came to power in 2000 by a twist of fate. His father had been cultivating Bashar's oldest brother Basil as his successor, but in 1994 Basil was killed in a car crash in Damascus. Bashar was brought home from his ophthalmology practice in London, put through military training and elevated to the rank of colonel to establish his credentials so he could one day rule. When Hafez Assad died in 2000, parliament quickly lowered the presidential age requirement from 40 to 34. Bashar's elevation was sealed by a nationwide referendum, in which he was the only candidate. Hafez, a lifelong military man, ruled the country for nearly 30 years during which he set up a Soviet-style centralized economy and kept such a stifling hand over dissent that Syrians feared even to joke about politics to their friends. He pursued a secular ideology that sought to bury sectarian differences under Arab nationalism and the image of heroic resistance to Israel. He formed an alliance with the Shiite clerical leadership in Iran, sealed Syrian domination over Lebanon and set up a network of Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups. Bashar initially seemed completely unlike his strongman father. Tall and lanky with a slight lisp, he had a quiet, gentle demeanor. His only official position before becoming president was head of the Syrian Computer Society. His wife, Asma al-Akhras, whom he married several months after taking office, was attractive, stylish and British-born. The young couple, who eventually had three children, seemed to shun trappings of power. They lived in an apartment in the upscale Abu Rummaneh district of Damascus, as opposed to a palatial mansion like other Arab leaders. Initially upon coming to office, Assad freed political prisoners and allowed more open discourse. In the 'Damascus Spring,' salons for intellectuals emerged where Syrians could discuss art, culture and politics to a degree impossible under his father. But after 1,000 intellectuals signed a public petition calling for multiparty democracy and greater freedoms in 2001 and others tried to form a political party, the salons were snuffed out by the feared secret police who jailed dozens of activists. Instead of a political opening, Assad turned to economic reforms. He slowly lifted economic restrictions, let in foreign banks, threw the doors open to imports and empowered the private sector. Damascus and other cities long mired in drabness saw a flourishing of shopping malls, new restaurants and consumer goods. Tourism swelled. Abroad, he stuck to the line his father had set, based on the alliance with Iran and a policy of insisting on a full return of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, although in practice Assad never militarily confronted Israel. In 2005, he suffered a heavy blow with the loss of Syria's decades-old control over neighboring Lebanon after the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri. With many Lebanese accusing Damascus of being behind the slaying, Syria was forced to withdraw its troops from the country and a pro-American government came into power. At the same time, the Arab world became split into two camps -- one of U.S.-allied, Sunni-led countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, the other Syria and Shiite-led Iran with their ties to Hezbollah and Palestinian militants. Throughout, Assad relied for largely on the same power base at home as his father: his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam comprising around 10% of the population. Many of the positions in his government went to younger generations of the same families that had worked for his father. Drawn in as well were the new middle class created by his reforms, including prominent Sunni merchant families. Assad also turned to his own family. His younger brother Maher headed the elite Presidential Guard and would lead the crackdown against the uprising. Their sister Bushra was a strong voice in his inner circle, along with her husband Deputy Defense Minister Assef Shawkat, until he was killed in a 2012 bombing. Bashar's cousin, Rami Makhlouf, became the country's biggest businessman, heading a financial empire before the two had a falling out that led to Makhlouf being pushed aside. Assad also increasingly entrusted key roles to his wife, Asma, before she announced in May that she was undergoing treatment for leukemia and stepped out of the limelight. When protests erupted in Tunisa and Egypt, eventually toppling their rulers, Assad dismissed the possibility of the same occurring in his country, insisting his regime was more in tune with its people. After the Arab Spring wave did move to Syria, his security forces staged a brutal crackdown while Assad consistently denied he was facing a popular revolt, instead blaming 'foreign-backed terrorists' trying to destabilize his regime. His rhetoric struck a chord with many in Syria's minority groups - including Christians, Druze and Shiites - as well as some Sunnis who feared the prospect of rule by Sunni extremists even more than they disliked Assad's authoritarian rule. Ironically, on February 26, 2011, two days after the fall of Egypt's Hosni Mubarak to protesters and just before the wave of Arab Spring protests swept into Syria — in an email released by Wikileaks as part of a cache in 2012 — Assad e-mailed a joke he'd run across mocking the Egyptian leader's stubborn refusal to step down. 'NEW WORD ADDED TO DICTIONARY: Mubarak (verb): To stick something, or to glue something. ... Mubarak (adjective): slow to learn or understand,' it read.	https://www.voanews.com/a/assad-s-ouster-after-14-years-of-war-in-syria-brings-to-an-end-a-decades-long-dynasty-/7891367.html	2024-12-07T22:50:27-08:00	
Opposition fighters reportedly drive Syrian leader from the country. Who are they and what now?	Syria's government appears to have fallen after opposition fighters said they entered Damascus following a stunning advance. Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said the government was ready to 'extend its hand' to the opposition and hand over its functions to a transitional government. 'I am in my house and I have not left, and this is because of my belonging to this country,' Jalili said in a video statement. He said he would go to his office to continue work in the morning and called on Syrian citizens not to deface public property. A Syrian opposition war monitor, Rami Abdurrahman, said Assad left the country on a flight from Damascus early Sunday. Jalili did not address reports of Assad's departure. Opposition fighters entered Syria's capital in a swiftly developing crisis that has taken much of the world by surprise. Syria's army has abandoned key cities with little resistance. Who are these opposition fighters? If they take control of Damascus after seizing some of Syria's largest cities, what then? Here is a look at the stunning reversal of fortune for Assad and the government in just the past 10 days, and what might lie ahead as Syria's 13-year civil war reignites. The aim? Overthrow the government This is the first time that opposition forces have reached the outskirts of the Syrian capital since 2018, when the country's troops recaptured the area following a yearslong siege. The approaching fighters are led by the most powerful insurgent group in Syria, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, along with an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. Both have been entrenched in the northwest. They launched the shock offensive on November 27 with gunmen capturing Aleppo, Syria's largest city, and the central city of Hama, the fourth largest. The HTS has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations. But the group said in recent years it cut ties with al-Qaida, and experts say HTS has sought to remake itself in recent years by focusing on promoting civilian government in their territory as well as military action. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday from Syria that the aim of the offensive is to overthrow Assad's government. Possible rifts ahead The HTS and Syrian National Army have been allies at times and rivals at times, and their aims might diverge. The Turkish-backed militias also have an interest in creating a buffer zone near the Turkish border to keep away Kurdish militants at odds with Ankara. Turkey has been a main backer of the fighters seeking to overthrow Assad but more recently has urged reconciliation, and Turkish officials have strongly rejected claims of any involvement in the current offensive. Whether the HTS and the Syrian National Army will work together if they succeed in overthrowing Assad or turn on each other again is a major question. Others take advantage While the flash offensive against Syria's government began in the north, armed opposition groups have also mobilized elsewhere. The southern areas of Sweida and Daraa have both been taken locally. Sweida is the heartland of Syria's Druze religious minority and had been the site of regular anti-government protests even after Assad seemingly consolidated his control over the area. Daraa is a Sunni Muslim area that was widely seen as the cradle of the uprising against Assad's rule that erupted in 2011. Daraa was recaptured by Syrian government troops in 2018, but rebels remained in some areas. In recent years, Daraa was in a state of uneasy quiet under a Russian-mediated ceasefire deal. And much of Syria's east is controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led group backed by the United States that in the past has clashed with most other armed groups in the country. Syria's government now has control of only three of 14 provincial capitals: Damascus, Latakia and Tartus. What's next? A commander with the insurgents, Hassan Abdul-Ghani, posted on the Telegram messaging app that opposition forces have started carrying out the 'final stage' of their offensive by encircling Damascus. And Syrian troops withdrew Saturday from much of the central city of Homs, Syria's third largest, according to a pro-government outlet and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. If that city is captured, the link would be cut between Damascus, Assad's seat of power, and the coastal region where he enjoys wide support. Assad appears to be largely on his own as allies Russia and Iran are distracted by other conflicts and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah has been weakened by its war with Israel, now under a fragile ceasefire. The U.N. special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, seeks urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition,' saying the situation is changing by the minute. He met with foreign ministers and senior diplomats from eight key countries including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Egypt, Turkey and Iran on the sidelines of the Doha Summit.	https://www.voanews.com/a/opposition-fighters-reportedly-drive-syrian-leader-from-the-country-who-are-they-and-what-now-/7891355.html	2024-12-07T21:26:40-08:00	
White House on guard against Islamic State resurgence in Syria	LOS ANGELES — The White House said Saturday that U.S. priorities in Syria now are to ensure the country's conflict does not encourage a resurgence of the Islamic State militant group or lead to a 'humanitarian catastrophe.' U.S. President Joe Biden and his team are monitoring the 'extraordinary events in Syria' are in touch with regional partners, the White House said on Saturday. 'President Biden and his team are closely monitoring the extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with regional partners,' the White House said in a statement. Spillover 'is a concern,' said national security adviser Jake Sullivan, with particular worry about the so-called Islamic State, also known as ISIS. In previous phases of Syria's long-running civil war, 'at its worst, we saw the explosion of ISIS onto the scene,' he said at a conference in Simi Valley, California run by the Reagan National Defense Forum. The main priority is to ensure 'that the fighting in Syria not lead to a resurgence of ISIS,' Sullivan said. 'We are going to take steps ourselves, directly and working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurds, to ensure that does not happen.' The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria, including U.S. forces working with Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any resurgence of the Islamic State group, according to The Associated Press. Gen. Bryan Fenton, head of U.S. Special Operations Command, told the AP he would not want to speculate on how the upheaval in Syria would affect the U.S. military’s footprint in the country. 'It’s still too early to tell,' he said. What would not change is the focus on disrupting IS operations in Syria and protecting U.S. troops, Fenton said during a panel at the Reagan event. Rebel forces are in the midst of a lightning offensive and say they have begun to encircle Syria's capital, Damascus. Sullivan said the Biden administration is working to ensure allies Israel, Jordan, Iraq and others in the region, 'who would potentially face spillover effects from Syria, are strong and secure, and we're in touch with them every day.' Washington is also alert to stopping a 'humanitarian catastrophe, both in terms of civilians, access to life-saving necessities, and in terms of the protection of religious and ethnic minorities in Syria,' Sullivan said. 'Of course, an event like this happens and ISIS immediately looks to take advantage. We have seen reports of ISIS trying ... to reconstitute to a certain extent.' So the United States will seek to 'contain the potential violence and instability,' protect allies and ensure that ISIS not 'get new oxygen out of this' that could lead them to threaten US or allies' interests, Sullivan added. Sullivan's remarks come as Washington prepares for a transition of power next month back to former president Donald Trump, who defeated Biden in November's election. Trump, who visited Paris on Saturday, warned against US involvement in Syria, saying the country is 'a mess' and 'not our friend.' 'THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT,' Trump said on his Truth Social platform. Sullivan, addressing Trump's remarks, agreed, saying 'the United States is not going to... militarily dive into the middle of a Syrian civil war.' Some material for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-on-guard-against-islamic-state-resurgence-in-syria/7891348.html	2024-12-07T21:03:29-08:00	
US House to vote to provide $3 billion to remove Chinese telecoms equipment	WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote next week on an annual defense bill that includes just over $3 billion for U.S. telecom companies to remove equipment made by Chinese telecoms firms Huawei and ZTE 000063.SZ from American wireless networks to address security risks. The 1,800-page text was released late Saturday and includes other provisions aimed at China, including requiring a report on Chinese efforts to evade U.S. national security regulations and an intelligence assessment of the current status of China's biotechnology capabilities. The Federal Communications Commission has said removing the insecure equipment is estimated to cost $4.98 billion but Congress previously only approved $1.9 billion for the 'rip and replace' program. Washington has aggressively urged U.S. allies to purge Huawei and other Chinese gear from their wireless networks. FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel last week again called on the U.S. Congress to provide urgent additional funding, saying the program to replace equipment in the networks of 126 carriers faces a $3.08 billion shortfall 'putting both our national security and the connectivity of rural consumers who depend on these networks at risk.' She has warned the lack of funding could result in some rural networks shutting down, which 'could eliminate the only provider in some regions' and could threaten 911 service. Competitive Carriers Association CEO Tim Donovan on Saturday praised the announcement, saying 'funding is desperately needed to fulfill the mandate to remove and replace covered equipment and services while maintaining connectivity for tens of millions of Americans.' In 2019, Congress told the FCC to require U.S. telecoms carriers that receive federal subsidies to purge their networks of Chinese telecoms equipment. The White House in 2023 asked for $3.1 billion for the program. Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said funding for the program and up to $500 million for regional tech hubs will be covered by funds generated from a one-time spectrum auction by the FCC for advanced wireless spectrum in the band known as AWS-3 to help meet rising spectrum demands of wireless consumers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-to-vote-to-provide-3-billion-to-remove-chinese-telecoms-equipment/7891322.html	2024-12-07T19:08:23-08:00	
South Korea arrests former defense minister over martial law declaration, Yonhap News says	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean prosecutors on Sunday arrested former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun over his alleged role in President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law on Tuesday, Yonhap News Agency said. Yoon survived an impeachment vote in parliament on Saturday, prompted by his short-lived attempt to impose martial law, but the leader of his own party said he will be effectively excluded from his duties before eventually stepping down. Ruling Party leader Han Dong-hoon plans to meet with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo on Sunday morning. Kim, who offered his resignation on Wednesday, was seen as a central figure in Tuesday's brief martial law declaration. A senior military official and filings to impeach Yoon by opposition members said Kim had made the proposal to Yoon. The prosecution's special investigative team has questioned Kim, who voluntarily appeared at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office at around 1:30 a.m. on Sunday (1630 GMT on Saturday), the report said. The office was not immediately available for comments. Three minority opposition parties filed a complaint with the prosecution against Yoon, Kim and martial law commander Park An-su, accusing them of insurrection. If convicted, the crime of leading an insurrection is punishable by death or life imprisonment, with or without prison labor. Opposition lawmakers alleged Yoon mobilized military forces to block a vote by lawmakers seeking to nullify what they said was an unconstitutional martial law decree. The national police raided the office of Kim on Sunday as part of an investigation into claims of treason against Yoon and top ministers, Yonhap said. Earlier on Saturday, Yoon addressed the nation in a televised speech to apologize for his martial law decree, saying he would not avoid legal and political responsibilities for his action, though he did not offer to resign. Yoon said he would put his fate in the hands of the ruling party, which Ruling Party leader Han Dong-hoon later said was effectively a promise to leave office early. Han has said Yoon would be 'effectively excluded from his duties' and his party will consult with the prime minister to manage state affairs. Yoon shocked the nation on Tuesday night when he gave the military sweeping emergency powers to root out what he called 'anti-state forces' and obstructionist political opponents. He rescinded the order six hours later, after parliament defied military and police cordons to vote unanimously against the decree. Yoon's martial law declaration plunged South Korea, Asia's fourth-largest economy and a key U.S. military ally, into its greatest political crisis in decades, threatening to shatter the country's reputation as a democratic success story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-arrests-ex-defense-minister-over-martial-law-yonhap-news-says-/7891316.html	2024-12-07T18:54:52-08:00	
Georgia's president says she talked with Trump, Macron about 'stolen election'	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Georgia's President Salome Zourabichvili said she talked with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron about the parliamentary election last month in her country that she and the opposition say was rigged. 'In depth discussion with Presidents Trump & Macron,' Zourabichvili, who was in Paris for the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral, said on X late on Saturday, underneath a photo showing her, Trump and Macron talking. 'Exposed the stolen election and extremely alarming repression against the people of Georgia.' Zourabichvili became the voice of the now weeks-long protest movement following the October vote that gave the ruling Georgian Dream party a win and its subsequent announcement that it was suspending efforts to join the European Union. The leader of Georgia's main opposition party and several other members have been detained during the protests and on Saturday the opposition said one of its politicians was beaten during a police raid on its offices. Georgian media also reported that a camera crew from pro-opposition Pirveli TV was attacked by masked men while broadcasting from near the protest site. 'The Russian regime is back at work tonight in Tbilisi — chasing civilians through the streets as they flee terror, targeting politicians, media, artists,' Zourabichvili said in a separate post on X on Saturday, posting a video showing a group of hooded men with batons beating up several men in a building. Zourabichvili, who has a largely ceremonial role as president, and the opposition have been accusing Georgian Dream of pursuing increasingly authoritarian, anti-Western and pro-Russian policies in the nation of 3.7 million people. The Kremlin has denied that Russia is interfering in the situation in Georgia, which Moscow compared to the 2014 'Maidan' revolution in Ukraine that overthrew a pro-Russian president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-s-president-says-she-talked-with-trump-macron-about-stolen-election-/7891312.html	2024-12-07T18:27:49-08:00	
Taiwan reports near doubling of Chinese warships nearby	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan's defense ministry said on Sunday that China had nearly doubled the number of its warships operating around the island in the previous 24 hours, ahead of what security sources expect will be a new round of war games. China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, has been angered by visits by President Lai Ching-te to Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam as part of a Pacific tour. Lai returned from the week-long trip on Friday night. Beijing has held two rounds of war games around Taiwan this year. In its daily morning report on Chinese military activities, Taiwan's defense ministry said there were 14 Chinese warships operating nearby, up from the eight it reported the previous day. The ministry said it had detected four Chinese balloons flying over the Taiwan Strait, one of which had brushed the top of the island.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-reports-near-doubling-of-chinese-warships-nearby-/7891309.html	2024-12-07T18:21:23-08:00	
Pearl Harbor survivors, ages 104 and 102, return to Hawaii for attack anniversary	PEARL HARBOR, HAWAII — Ira 'Ike' Schab, a 104-year-old Pearl Harbor attack survivor, was so determined to stand and salute during a remembrance ceremony honoring those killed in the Japanese bombing that thrust the U.S. into World War II some 83 years ago that he spent six weeks in physical therapy to build the strength to do so. On Saturday, Schab gingerly rose from his wheelchair and raised his right hand, returning a salute delivered by sailors on a destroyer and a submarine passing by in the harbor. His son and a daughter supported him from either side. 'I was honored to do it. I’m glad I was capable of standing up,' he said afterward. 'I’m getting old, you know.' Schab is one of only two servicemen who lived through the attack who made it to an annual observance hosted by the U.S. Navy and National Park Service on a grass field overlooking the harbor. A third survivor had been planning to join them but had to cancel because of health issues. The December 7, 1941, bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle. The remains of more than 900 Arizona crew members are still entombed on the submerged vessel. Dozens of survivors once joined the event but their attendance has declined as survivors have aged. Today there are only 16 still living, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. Military historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated there were some 87,000 military personnel on Oahu on the day of the attack. Schab agreed when ceremony organizers asked him earlier this year to salute on behalf of all survivors and World War II veterans. 'He’s been working hard, because this is his goal,' said his daughter Kimberlee Heinrichs, who traveled to Hawaii with Schab from their Beaverton, Oregon, home. 'He wanted to be able to stand for that.' Schab was a sailor on the USS Dobbin at the time of the attack, serving as the tuba player in the ship's band. He had showered and put on a clean uniform when he heard the call for a fire rescue party. He hurried topside to see Japanese planes flying overhead and the USS Utah capsizing. He quickly went back below deck to join a daisy chain of sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun topside. Ken Stevens, 102, who served on the USS Whitney, joined Schab at the ceremony. USS Curtiss sailor Bob Fernandez, 100, was unable to come due to health issues. Attendees observed a moment of silence at 7:54 a.m., the same time the attack began eight decades ago. F-22 jets in missing man formation flew overhead shortly after. Fernandez, speaking in a phone interview from California, where he lives with his nephew in Lodi, recalled feeling shocked and surprised as the attack began. 'When those things go off like that, we didn’t know what’s what,' Fernandez said. 'We didn’t even know we were in a war.' Fernandez was a mess cook on the Curtiss and his job that morning was to bring sailors coffee and food as he waited tables during breakfast. Then they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane with the red ball insignia painted on Japanese aircraft fly by. Fernandez rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing 12.7-centimeter, 38-caliber shells so they could begin passing them to the ship's guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire up above. 'I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,' Fernandez said. The ship's guns hit a Japanese plane that crashed into one of its cranes. Shortly after, its guns hit a dive bomber that then slammed into the ship and exploded below deck, setting the hangar and main decks on fire, according to the Navy History and Heritage Command. Fernandez's ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. Many laud Pearl Harbor survivors as heroes, but Fernandez doesn’t view himself that way. 'I’m not a hero,' he said. 'I’m just nothing but an ammunition passer.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pearl-harbor-survivors-ages-104-and-102-return-to-hawaii-for-attack-anniversary/7891303.html	2024-12-07T18:02:39-08:00	
Israeli strikes kill 6 in Lebanon's south, 34 in Gaza	beirut — Lebanon's health ministry said Saturday that Israeli strikes killed six people in the country's south, 10 days into a ceasefire between the Hezbollah group and Israel. Both Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah face accusations of having breached the truce that took effect on November 27 to end a war that has killed thousands in Lebanon and sparked mass displacements on both sides. 'The Israeli enemy's airstrike on the town of Beit Lif resulted in the martyrdom of five people and the injury of five others,' a health ministry statement said, adding that in a separate incident a drone strike killed one person in Deir Seryan. The two locations are more than 20 kilometers apart. Earlier Saturday, the Israeli military said it struck a Hezbollah militant in southern Lebanon, one of multiple operations against 'activities ... that posed a threat' to Israel. 'In one case, the (military) identified a Hezbollah terrorist who posed a threat to the troops deployed in southern Lebanon in violation' of the ceasefire, the military said, adding the air force 'struck the terrorist.' Lebanon's official National News Agency reported that 'an enemy drone targeted a motorcycle in Deir Seryan' On Monday the health ministry said Israeli strikes killed nine people in southern Lebanon after Israel said it was taking aim at dozens of Hezbollah targets in retaliation for an attack claimed by the militant group. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the ceasefire was 'holding' despite a series of incidents. A committee including France, United Nations peacekeepers, Israel, and Lebanon and chaired by the United States is tasked with maintaining communication between the various parties and ensuring violations are identified and dealt with to avoid any escalation. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on 'the international community, particularly the parties sponsoring security arrangements, to work seriously and decisively to halt the ongoing violations by the enemy, ensure its withdrawal from occupied territories and actively contribute to implementing the ceasefire.' Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 34 Palestinians on Saturday, health officials in the enclave said, as Qatar voiced hope of fresh momentum in efforts to reach a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The health officials said that an Israeli strike hit a house in Gaza City late Saturday, killing four women. The Israeli military did not provide an immediate comment on Saturday's strikes across Gaza. The death toll was revised upward from 30 reported earlier in the day by the Palestinian health ministry, which also said dozens were wounded. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and militants in the daily death tallies. Neither AFP nor Reuters could independently verify the figures. Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed about 44,500 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, Britain and other Western countries. Nearly three-quarters of Gaza's 2.3 million population is displaced, and nearly the entire population is at risk of famine, according to the United Nations. Some information in this story is from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strikes-kill-6-in-lebanon-s-south-34-in-gaza/7891302.html	2024-12-07T17:53:44-08:00	
Garland’s ruby slippers from 'The Wizard of Oz' auctioned for $28M	MINNEAPOLIS — A pair of iconic ruby slippers that were worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz and stolen from a museum nearly two decades ago fetched $28 million in an auction Saturday. Heritage Auctions had estimated that they would fetch $3 million or more. Online bidding opened last month and by Friday had reached $1.55 million, or $1.91 million including the buyer's premium, a commission that the buyer pays, said Robert Wilonsky, a vice president with the Dallas-based auction house. More than 800 people were tracking the slippers, and the company's web page for the auction had hit nearly 43,000 page views by Thursday, he said. As Rhys Thomas, author of the book, The Ruby Slippers of Oz, puts it, the sequined shoes from the beloved 1939 musical have seen 'more twists and turns than the Yellow Brick Road.' They were on display at the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 2005 when Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum’s door and display case. Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018. Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota, wasn't publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023. He pleaded guilty in October 2023. He was in a wheelchair and on supplementary oxygen when he was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health. His attorney, Dane DeKrey, explained ahead of sentencing that Martin, who had a long history of burglary and receiving stolen property, was attempting to pull off 'one last score' after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But a fence — a person who buys stolen goods — later told him the rubies were just glass, DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn't specify how. The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance. He's scheduled to go on trial in January and hasn't entered a plea, though his attorney has said he's not guilty. The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael Shaw, who had lent them to the museum. They were one of several pairs that Garland wore during the filming, but only four pairs are known to have survived. In the movie, to return from Oz to Kansas, Dorothy had to click her heels three times and repeat, 'There’s no place like home.' Among those bidding was the Judy Garland Museum. The city of Grand Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival to supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to help the museum purchase the slippers. The Wizard of Oz story has gained new attention in recent weeks with the release of the movie Wicked, an adaptation of the megahit Broadway musical, a prequel of sorts that reimagines the character of the Wicked Witch of the West. The auction also included other memorabilia from The Wizard of Oz, such as a hat worn by Margaret Hamilton, who played the original Wicked Witch of the West.	https://www.voanews.com/a/garland-s-ruby-slippers-from-the-wizard-of-oz-auctioned-for-28m/7891298.html	2024-12-07T17:19:21-08:00	
Insurgents reach gates of Syria's capital, threaten to upend Assad rule	BEIRUT — Insurgents' stunning march across Syria accelerated Saturday with news that they had reached the gates of the capital and that government forces had abandoned the central city of Homs. The government was forced to deny rumors that President Bashar Assad had fled the country. The loss of Homs is a potentially crippling blow for Assad. It stands at an important intersection between Damascus and Syria's coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus — the Syrian leader's base of support and home to a Russian strategic naval base. The pro-government Sham FM reported that government forces took positions outside Syria's third-largest city, without elaborating. Rami Abdurrahman who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Syrian troops and members of different security agencies have withdrawn from the city, adding that rebels have entered parts of it. The capture of Homs is a major victory for insurgents, who have already seized the cities of Aleppo and Hama, as well as large parts of the south, in a lightning offensive that began November 27. Analysts said Homs falling into rebel hands would be a game-changer. The rebels' moves around Damascus, reported by the monitor and a rebel commander, came after the Syrian army withdrew from much of southern part of the country, leaving more areas, including several provincial capitals, under the control of opposition fighters. For the first time in the country's long-running civil war, the government now has control of only three of 14 provincial capitals: Damascus, Latakia and Tartus. The advances in the past week were among the largest in recent years by opposition factions, led by a group that has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. In their push to overthrow Assad's government, the insurgents, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, have met little resistance from the Syrian army. The rapid rebel gains, coupled with the lack of support from Assad's erstwhile allies, posed the most serious threat to his rule since the start of the war. The United Nation's special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, on Saturday called for urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition.' Speaking to reporters at the annual Doha Forum in Qatar, he said the situation in Syria was changing by the minute. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, whose country is Assad's chief international backer, said he feels 'sorry for the Syrian people.' In Damascus, people rushed to stock up on supplies. Thousands went to Syria's border with Lebanon, trying to leave the country. Many shops in the capital were shuttered, a resident told The Associated Press, and those still open ran out of staples such as sugar. Some were selling items at three times the normal price. 'The situation is very strange. We are not used to that,' the resident said, insisting on anonymity, fearing retributions. 'People are worried whether there will be a battle [in Damascus] or not.' It was the first time that opposition forces reached the outskirts of Damascus since 2018, when Syrian troops recaptured the area following a yearslong siege. The U.N. said it was moving noncritical staff outside the country as a precaution. Assad's status Syria's state media denied social media rumors that Assad left the country, saying he is performing his duties in Damascus. He has had little, if any, help from his allies. Russia is busy with its war in Ukraine. Lebanon's Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up Assad's forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Iran has seen its proxies across the region degraded by regular Israeli airstrikes. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday posted on social media that that the United States should avoid engaging militarily in Syria. Pedersen said a date for talks in Geneva on the implementation a U.N. resolution, adopted in 2015, and calling for a Syrian-led political process, would be announced later. The resolution calls for the establishment of a transitional governing body, followed by the drafting of a new constitution and ending with U.N.-supervised elections. Later Saturday, foreign ministers and senior diplomats from eight key countries, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Egypt, Turkey and Iran, along with Pederson, gathered on the sidelines of the Doha Summit to discuss the situation in Syria. In a statement issued late Saturday, the participants affirmed their support for a political solution to the Syrian crisis 'that would lead to the end of military activity and protect civilians.' They also agreed on the importance of strengthening international efforts to increase aid to the Syrian people. The insurgents' march Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said insurgents were in the Damascus suburbs of Maadamiyah, Jaramana and Daraya. Opposition fighters were marching toward the Damascus suburb of Harasta, he added. A commander with the insurgents, Hassan Abdul-Ghani, posted on the Telegram messaging app that opposition forces had begun the 'final stage' of their offensive by encircling Damascus. HTS controls much of northwest Syria and in 2017 set up a 'salvation government' to run day-to-day affairs in the region. In recent years, HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has sought to remake the group's image, cutting ties with al-Qaida, ditching hard-line officials, and vowing to embrace pluralism and religious tolerance. The shock offensive began November 27, during which gunmen captured the northern city of Aleppo, Syria's largest, and the central city of Hama, the country's fourth-largest city. Opposition activists said Saturday that a day earlier, insurgents entered Palmyra, which is home to invaluable archaeological sites that had been in government hands since being taken from the Islamic State group in 2017. To the south, Syrian troops left much of the province of Quneitra including the main Baath City, activists said. Syrian Observatory said government troops have withdrawn from much of the two southern provinces. The Syrian army said in a statement that it carried out redeployment and repositioning in Sweida and Daraa after its checkpoints came under attack by 'terrorists.' The army said it was setting up a 'strong and coherent defensive and security belt in the area,' apparently to defend Damascus from the south. The Syrian government has referred to opposition gunmen as terrorists since conflict broke out in March 2011. Diplomacy in Doha The foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Turkey, meeting in Qatar, called for an end to the hostilities. Turkey is a main backer of the rebels. Qatar's top diplomat, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, criticized Assad for failing to take advantage of the lull in fighting in recent years to address the country's underlying problems. 'Assad didn't seize this opportunity to start engaging and restoring his relationship with his people,' he said. Sheikh Mohammed said he was surprised by how quickly the rebels have advanced and said there is a real threat to Syria's 'territorial integrity.' He said the war could 'damage and destroy what is left if there is no sense of urgency' to start a political process.	https://www.voanews.com/a/insurgents-reach-gates-of-syria-s-capital-threatening-to-upend-decades-of-assad-rule-/7891291.html	2024-12-07T17:03:46-08:00	
Explosives-laden motorcycle detonates in Colombia killing 1, injuring 14	BOGOTA, COLOMBIA — A motorcycle loaded with explosives detonated at a police checkpoint in southwestern Colombia on Saturday, killing the driver and injuring 14 others, authorities said. Officers had been conducting inspections in the community of Las Penas in the Jamundi municipality to prevent possible violence by illegal armed groups, commander of the Cali Metropolitan Police Col. Carlos Oviedo told journalists. The driver 'became scared' and detonated the explosives after being called to the checkpoint, Oviedo said, killing himself and injuring seven civilians and seven police officers. One of the officers has a 'reserved prognosis,' he added. Criminal groups consider Jamundi strategic because of its plantations of coca leaf, which is transformed into cocaine, and because it is connected to the port of Buenaventura. The organized crime group Jaime Martinez is active in the area. It is composed of dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by its Spanish acronym FARC, that did not accept the 2016 peace deal with the state. Attacks with explosives against military and police officers, which authorities attribute to illegal armed groups, have continued despite efforts by Colombian President Gustavo Petro to negotiate peace deals with the irregular armies under a strategy known as total peace. The Ombudsman’s office expressed concern over growing violence in Jamundi and urged authorities to guarantee the protection and security of citizens.	https://www.voanews.com/a/explosives-laden-motorcycle-detonates-in-colombia-killing-1-injuring-14/7891296.html	2024-12-07T16:59:19-08:00

After dissolving government, leader of Burkina Faso junta names new PM	ABIDJAN, IVORY COAST — Burkina Faso's junta head named former communications minister Rimtalba Jean Emmanuel Ouedraogo as prime minister Saturday, according to a presidential decree, a day after dissolving the government. Ouedraogo served in the Cabinet of outgoing premier Apollinaire Joachim Kyelem de Tambela, who was stripped of his functions by Captain Ibrahim Traore on Friday. No reason was given for the dismissal of Tambela, who had headed three successive military-appointed governments since Traore came to power in a 2022 coup. A close ally of Traore and a journalist by trade, Ouedraogo was formerly editor-in-chief and then director of the Sahel country's state television. After the September 2022 coup, Traore tapped Ouedraogo for the post of Minister of Communications and government spokesperson as a civilian figure in the military administration. He was subsequently reappointed to the role in three reshuffles. The west African country was plunged into instability by a January 2022 coup during which Lieutenant Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba seized power. Little more than eight months later, Damiba himself was overthrown by Traore, 36, who now heads the junta regime. Under Traore, the country, along with its fellow junta-led neighbors in Mali and Niger, has turned away from former imperial ruler France and pivoted toward Russia instead. The three states have banded together to form the Alliance of Sahel States and are battling jihadi violence that first erupted in northern Mali in 2012. Since it spread to Burkina Faso, that conflict has killed around 26,000 people and forced some 2 million people to flee their homes, according to monitoring group ACLED.	https://www.voanews.com/a/burkina-junta-chief-names-new-pm-after-dissolving-govt-/7891288.html	2024-12-07T16:20:27-08:00	
North Macedonian political party calls for ban on social media content that incites 'self-destructive behavior'	SKOPJE, North Macedonia — A political party in North Macedonia on Saturday demanded authorities ban social networks whose content incites violence and self-destructive behavior after several young people were seriously injured in connection with the popular 'Superman challenge' on TikTok. Health authorities said at least 17 students, ages 10 to 17, were brought to hospitals in the capital Skopje and other towns over the past week with broken bones, contusions and bruises. The children were injured after being thrown into the air by their friends to fly like superheroes and get applause on the internet. The Liberal-Democratic Party, which was part of the left-led coalition that ruled the country from 2016 to earlier in 2024, issued a press statement Saturday strongly condemning 'the irresponsible spread of dangerous content on social media, such as the latest TikTok 'challenge' known as 'Superman,' which has injured six children across (the country) in the past 24 hours.' 'The lack of adequate control over the content of social media allows such 'games' to reach the most vulnerable users,' the party statement said. It demanded the 'immediate introduction of measures to ban content that incites violence and self-destructive behavior, increase surveillance, and sanction platforms that enable dangerous trends.' North Macedonia's education minister Vesna Janevska said students should focus on education, not TikTok challenges. 'The ban on mobile phones in schools will not have an effect. Phones will be available to children in their homes, neighborhoods and other environments,' she said. Psychologists have warned that the desire to be 'in' with the trends on social networks, combined with excessive use of mobile phones, is the main reason for the rise in risky behaviors among children. They urged parents and schools to talk with students.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-macedonian-political-party-calls-for-ban-on-social-media-content-that-incites-self-destructive-behavior-/7891124.html	2024-12-07T15:55:06-08:00	
Ghana counts votes in tight presidential race, hopes for better times	ACCRA, GHANA — Ghana voted in a presidential and parliamentary election Saturday amid hopes for an economic revival after the worst financial crisis in a generation that led to a major debt default in the West African nation. President Nana Akufo-Addo is stepping down next month after serving the two terms allowed by the constitution in Ghana, the world's second-largest cocoa producer and a significant gold miner. Twelve candidates are vying to succeed him, but the race is seen as primarily between Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, chosen successor of Akufo-Addo's New Patriotic Party (NPP), and former President John Dramani Mahama of the National Democratic Congress (NDC). Opinion polls tipped Mahama, who served as president from 2012 to 2016, for a potential comeback. Mahama, 66, has framed Bawumia as representing a continuation of policies that led to Ghana's economic woes, and has promised to renegotiate terms of a $3 billion IMF bailout secured last year to restructure the country's debts. The crisis peaked in 2022 when Ghana turned to the International Monetary Fund. 'This is the only election that we can all see the direction of the outcome before we start voting,' Mahama said after casting his vote in Bole, his hometown in northern Ghana. 'We are hopeful and confident that we'll win,' he added. Bawumia, a 61-year-old former central banker, also expressed confidence that he would win after he voted in his Walewale constituency in northern Ghana. 'By the grace of God, I'm very hopeful of winning this election. I think that we have done a lot of work. We have put our message to the people, I think the message has been well received,' he said. On the campaign trail, Bawumia has highlighted Ghana's gradual recovery from the crisis, with economic growth surging by 6.9% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, the fastest rate in five years. He told supporters he will foster policies that will strengthen Ghana's recovery. Both candidates said voting was generally calm and peaceful. Jubilant NDC supporters took to the streets of Accra's historic Jamestown, chanting, banging pans and blaring horns after results from their polling stations showed the party in a comfortable lead. The electoral commission said over 99% of polling stations opened on time with voting materials delivered to them. It said later Saturday evening that turnout was massive, but it was too early to give a specific figure. Benjamin Bano-Bio, director of electoral services, said voting was calm though there were some pockets of violence. 'Our verification machines were effective, and the entire process was largely peaceful, except for a few places where violence occurred, leading to the death of one person,' Bano-Bio told a news conference. After polls closed at 1700 GMT, election teams immediately began tallying ballots under the watch of agents from political parties before sending them to collation centers. Some provisional legislative results are expected late Saturday night and Sunday, while the presidential outcome is expected by Tuesday, although trends often allow an early prediction. Approximately 18.7 million of Ghana's 34 million population are registered to vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ghana-counts-votes-in-tight-presidential-race-hopes-for-better-times/7891123.html	2024-12-07T15:27:37-08:00	
US announces nearly $1 billion in military aid for Ukraine	WASHINGTON — The United States on Saturday announced a new $988 million military assistance package for Ukraine as Washington races to provide aid to Kyiv before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. It nearly halves the available $2.21 billion remaining in Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) as the Biden administration works to commit to buying weapons from industry, rather than pull from U.S. weapons stocks. Trump's victory in the November election has cast doubt on the future of American aid for Ukraine, providing a limited window for billions of dollars in already authorized assistance to be provided before he is sworn in next month. The package features drones, ammunition for precision HIMARS rocket launchers, and equipment and spare parts for artillery systems, tanks and armored vehicles, the Pentagon said in a statement. The Biden administration has often used Presidential Drawdown Authority, which authorizes President Joe Biden to transfer excess articles and services from U.S. stocks without congressional approval during an emergency. The USAI funds are separate and will go to purchase new weapons from the defense industry or partners rather than drawn from American stocks, meaning it will not immediately arrive on the battlefield. It follows a $725 million package announced Monday that included a second tranche of landmines as well as anti-air and anti-armor weapons. The outgoing U.S. administration is working to get as much aid as possible to Ukraine before Trump — who has repeatedly criticized U.S. assistance for Kyiv and claimed he could secure a ceasefire within hours — takes over. Trump's comments have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about the future of U.S. aid, and Ukraine's ability to withstand Russian attacks in the absence of further American support. The United States has spearheaded the push for international support for Ukraine, quickly forging a coalition to back Kyiv after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022 and coordinating aid from dozens of countries. Ukraine's international supporters have since then provided tens of billions of dollars in weapons, ammunition, training and other security aid that has been key to helping Kyiv resist Russian forces. The Biden administration still has about $6 billion of congressionally granted presidential drawdown authority, including funds authorized in 2024 and funds discovered by the Pentagon after overestimating the value of arms shipped to Ukraine. Since the Russian invasion in February 2022 the U.S. has committed more than $62 billion worth of security assistance to Ukraine.
