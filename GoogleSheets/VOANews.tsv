Mexican official sentenced to 38-plus years in US for taking cartel bribes	NEW YORK — The man once heralded as the architect of Mexico's war on drug cartels was sentenced to more than 38 years in a U.S. prison Wednesday for taking massive bribes to aid drug traffickers. Genaro García Luna, Mexico's former secretary of public security, was convicted by a New York jury in 2023 of taking millions of dollars in bribes to protect the violent Sinaloa cartel that he was supposedly combating. He is the highest-level Mexican government official to be convicted in the United States. At his sentencing hearing before a federal judge in Brooklyn on Wednesday, García Luna continued to maintain his innocence and said the case against him was based on false information from criminals and the Mexican government. 'I have a firm respect for the law,' he said in Spanish. 'I have not committed these crimes.' García Luna, 56, led Mexico's federal police before he served in a Cabinet-level position as the top security official from 2006-12 under then-President Felipe Calderón. At the time, García Luna was hailed as an ally by the U.S. in its fight on drug trafficking. But U.S. prosecutors said that in return for millions of dollars, he provided intelligence about investigations against the cartel, information about rival gangs and the safe passage of massive quantities of drugs. Prosecutors had asked for a life sentence. García Luna's lawyers had argued that he should get no more than 20 years. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan said he wasn't moved by past accolades that García Luna received for his work in the war on drugs. 'That was your cover,' Cogan said before imposing the sentence. 'You are guilty of these crimes, sir. You can't parade these words and say, 'I'm police officer of the year.'' Besides the sentence of 38 years and four months, the judge imposed a $2 million fine. During the trial, photos were shown of García Luna shaking hands with former President Barack Obama and speaking with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Sen. John McCain. But prosecutors said García Luna secretly advanced a drug trafficking conspiracy that resulted in the deaths of thousands of American and Mexican citizens. He ensured that drug traffickers were notified in advance of raids and sabotaged legitimate police operations aimed at apprehending cartel leaders, they said. Drug traffickers were able to ship more than 1 million kilograms of cocaine through Mexico and into the United States using planes, trains, trucks and submarines while García Luna held his posts, prosecutors said. During former Sinaloa kingpin Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán's trial in the same court in 2018, a former cartel member testified that he personally delivered at least $6 million in payoffs to García Luna and that cartel members agreed to pool up to $50 million to pay for his protection. 'He enabled the cartel. He protected the cartel. He was the cartel,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Saritha Komatireddy told the judge Wednesday. García Luna enabled a corrupt system that allowed violent cartels to thrive and distribute drugs that killed multitudes of people, she added. 'It may not have been the defendant pulling the trigger, but he has blood on his hands,' Komatireddy said. Prosecutors also said García Luna plotted to undo last year's verdict by seeking to bribe or corruptly convince multiple inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to support false allegations that two government witnesses communicated via contraband cellular phones in advance of the trial. García Luna's lawyer, Cesar de Castro, said the defense intends to appeal the sentence. He said his client is someone who 'has served his country' and has now lost his money, his reputation as well as policies he championed in Mexico. 'He has lost close to everything. All that remains is his wonderful family,' de Castro said. In Mexico, newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum briefly commented on the case Tuesday, saying: 'The big issue here is how someone who was awarded by United States agencies, who ex-President Calderón said wonderful things about his security secretary, today is prisoner in the United States because it's shown that he was tied to drug trafficking.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexican-official-sentenced-to-38-plus-years-in-us-for-taking-cartel-bribes/7825414.html	2024-10-16T18:24:44-07:00	
Colombian ranchers aim to prove beef production can be good for planet	Scientists say beef production takes a heavy toll on the environment. Cattle produce methane, a powerful planet-warming gas, and forests get cut down for pastures. But one farm in northern Colombia hopes to show ranching can have a lighter footprint on the planet. Austin Landis travelled to Montería in northern Colombia for a closer look at what could be a revolution in sustainable cattle ranching.	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombian-ranchers-aim-to-prove-beef-production-can-be-good-for-planet-/7825399.html	2024-10-16T18:14:19-07:00

Billie Jean King, female athletes to honor her Women's Sports Foundation	NEW YORK — Billie Jean King started the Women's Sports Foundation with a $5,000 check. She's turned that investment into $100 million and a half century of helping girls and women achieve their dreams through travel and training grants, local sports programs, and mentorship of athletes and coaches. King was set to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the foundation by honoring the 1999 U.S. women's World Cup champions; Mark Walter, co-owner of the Professional Women's Hockey League and the Los Angeles Dodgers; and the Women's National Basketball Association's 2024 rookie class on Wednesday night in New York. 'What makes me happy is creating opportunities and dreams for others,' King told The Associated Press in a recent interview. 'I look back and that's what drives me.' Nearly 100 female athletes will attend the awards dinner to celebrate the milestone and King, a tireless advocate for equal pay and more investment in women's sports. That includes awards host and soccer honoree Julie Foudy. She graduated from Stanford and played for the 1999 U.S. soccer team that won the World Cup before a record crowd of more than 90,000 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. 'She's remained a friend and mentor and such a catalyst for changing the trajectory of women's soccer and so many sports,' said Foudy, a former president of the Women's Sports Foundation and current soccer broadcaster for Turner and TNT. After the World Cup win, Foudy and the team turned to King, Donna Lopiano and Donna de Verona for advice about improving pay and starting a professional soccer league. 'I'll never forget, (King) said, 'What are you guys doing about it?' ' said Foudy, regarding their collective leverage with the U.S. Soccer Federation. 'And as players, that was the exact epiphany we needed at that moment.' Foudy and the '99ers eventually witnessed the successful struggle toward equity, helping lay the foundation for the current U.S. women's national team to receive the same pay and working conditions as the men's team. A players' lawsuit against the federation resulted in a landmark $24 million settlement in 2022. 'Billie doesn't have just one meeting. She'd check in and follow up and ask, 'What do you need?' ' Foudy said. 'She was at that first (WUSA professional) game in Washington, D.C. (in 2001), and was a big proponent of the importance of having a league and player pool for the longevity and growth of women's soccer.' The current iteration is the NWSL, which formed in 2013 and now has 14 teams. Foudy is part of the ownership group of Angel City FC. New owners Bob Iger and Willow Bay acquired a controlling stake in the team in July, with a value of $250 million. King recently joined forces with Mark and Kimba Walter to create the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL), which will launch its second season in late November. U.S. Olympic gold medalist Kendall Coyne Schofield reached out to King to help unify the fractured pro hockey landscape into one viable league. King, who is part of the Dodgers' ownership group, collaborated with Walter to form the new six-team league. The WNBA rookie class, led by No. 1 pick Caitlin Clark, will receive the Next Gen Award for 'showing up, showing out and boldly carrying the torch forward.' The popularity of Indiana's Clark and Chicago's Angel Reese generated unprecedented WNBA attendance, more nationally televised games and record-breaking TV ratings this summer. 'Caitlin Clark is fantastic,' King said. 'It reminds me of Chris Evert in 1971, when she changed everything at the U.S Open. Anytime a player can do well, she helps everybody.' The rookie class includes Cameron Brink (Stanford), Kamilla Cardoso (NCAA champion South Carolina), Rickea Jackson (Tennessee), Jacy Sheldon (Ohio State), Aaliyah Edwards (Connecticut), Reese (Louisiana State) and Alissa Pili (Utah). The WNBA lags in pay equity, with Clark receiving only $76,000 in her rookie season compared with the NBA No. 1 pick, who gets $12 million. WNBA players may see an increase in salary in 2026 from a new 11-year media rights deal for approximately $200 million a year ahead of the next collective bargaining agreement. The players' union is interested in increasing the WNBA revenue share from 9.3%, while NBA players receive about 50% of the money generated from TV deals, ticket sales, merchandise and licensing. King said it might take more time to close the pay gaps because women's sports is 'still in its infancy.' 'The NBA is 78 years old, the WNBA is 28 years old,' King said. '(Former NBA Commissioner) David Stern made a huge difference. He was a marketing genius. We need to continue to do that for women's sports.' King and the 'Original Nine' helped market the early women's professional tennis circuit, and she formed the Women's Tennis Association with players a week before Wimbledon in 1973. She advocated for Title IX, beat Bobby Riggs and fought for equal prize money in tennis. Along the way, she won 39 Grand Slam titles during her career. The next milestone for King, 80, will be receiving the Congressional Gold Medal. It's one of the highest U.S. civilian honors for individuals whose achievements have a lasting impact on their field. 'The Women's Sports Foundation, nobody knew how long it would last,' she said. 'I look at the 50th anniversary as a continuation to create more opportunities. You can't let up.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/billie-jean-king-female-athletes-to-honor-her-women-s-sports-foundation/7825363.html	2024-10-16T17:00:58-07:00	
Biden, dignitaries honor RFK widow, human rights champion Ethel Kennedy	washington — U.S. President Joe Biden joined former Democratic presidents and others to honor longtime human rights advocate and storied political family matriarch Ethel Kennedy at a memorial service in Washington on Wednesday after her death last week at age 96. The widow of Robert F. Kennedy — a former U.S. attorney general and U.S. senator, who was assassinated while seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968 — founded a human rights center to carry on her husband's work. She never remarried and went on to raise her 11 children, enduring a host of other family tragedies along the way, including separate plane crashes that killed her parents, brother and nephew, as well as the untimely deaths of several of her children, grandchildren and a great-grandchild. She and her husband were devastated by the assassination of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, in Dallas in 1963. Biden, a fellow Irish Catholic who has leaned on his faith amid his own losses, including the death of his son Beau, said the Democratic family matriarch was there for him at his time of tragedy. He said her husband had been one of his heroes. 'Ethel was a hero in her own right,' Biden said in remarks at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, just blocks from the White House. Former Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, as well as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others, also reflected on her life. The son of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated just two months before Robert Kennedy, noted the two families' shared journey and understanding of sacrifice amid their work for social justice. 'Faith and history knitted us together. Respect and love has kept us together,' Martin Luther King III told the crowd. The Kennedys were known for their parties and Wednesday's service was no different, with scores of relatives filling the pews and high-profile attendees remembering the infectious spirit highlighted by her children and grandchildren. 'She was a spitfire,' Obama said. 'As serious as Ethel was about righting wrongs, she never seemed to take herself too seriously.' Other Democratic attendees included California Governor Gavin Newsom and former top U.S. diplomat and presidential candidate John Kerry. Country star Kenny Chesney sang 'You Are My Sunshine' while Sting surprised guests with 'Fragile' and Stevie Wonder with 'Isn't She Lovely.' Over the decades, Kennedy took up many causes championed by her late husband, including fighting poverty, working for social justice and protecting the environment. Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014. She died on October 10 from complications following a stroke, her family said. Her daughter Kathleen Kennedy Townsend was Maryland's lieutenant governor, while her son Joseph P. Kennedy II represented Massachusetts in the U.S. House of Representatives. Her grandson, former U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, serves as special envoy to Northern Ireland. Her son Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine advocate and former independent presidential candidate, broke from his family's long Democratic ties to endorse Donald Trump in November's election. Many members of the Kennedy clan have denounced his election politics and backed the Democratic ticket, now led by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris after Biden stepped aside in July. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended Wednesday's service alongside his family but made no remarks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-dignitaries-honor-rfk-widow-human-rights-champion-ethel-kennedy/7825052.html	2024-10-16T15:53:33-07:00	
Georgia struggles to emerge from Russian shadow ahead of crucial election	As the Republic of Georgia prepares for a crucial election on October 26, Russia’s influence looms over the vote.

Fuel costs force some Nigerian commuters to quit jobs	Abuja, nigeria — Surging fuel prices in Nigeria are making it unaffordable for some workers to commute to their jobs, forcing them to quit. The trend is hitting low-income and informal workers especially hard. Fuel in Nigeria now averages 66 cents per liter, a 15% hike since September. The price surge forced Victor Zion to quit his job, as commuting costs consumed the lion’s share of his $85 monthly salary. Zion said that what's left of his income after transportation expenses could no longer keep him afloat. 'When it happened that there was an increment in the cost of transportation, I spent up to 70% of my salary on transportation and that didn't make sense to me at all,' he said. 'Resigning from my job has actually impacted me financially.' Zion’s experience reflects that of many workers, especially in the informal sector, who make up the majority of Nigeria’s workers. Ifunnaya Oyakimo recently closed her gym business, unable to maintain a staff because workers resigned in droves. 'Some of them said they can no longer sustain themselves with the salary, and with the whole thing that is happening, I just had to let it all go, close the gym, sell off the equipment,' she said. Some employers, like Moses Ogwoke, who is in the printing business, are covering 60% of workers’ transport costs to retain staff and stay operational. Ogwoke said those costs cut into profits, threatening the sustainability of his business. 'We have jobs that need to be attended to,' he said. 'What we decided to do is to support them the little way we can in paying their transportation at least three times a week, while they take care for the remaining two days. But that money needs to come from somewhere, so from the little profit we are making, we are still dipping hands there to be able to run the office.' The crisis extends beyond individual struggles. There is the risk of further destabilization of the labor market in Nigeria, where the unemployment rate stands at 33%. Economist Akin Ogunshola outlined the dangers of the resignation trend and suggested possible policy solutions. 'If people are resigning, definitely, they may be tempted to take to crime, they may be tempted to take to corruption, fraud and so many other social vices that will impact negatively on the economy and the society. ... What government is to do to help the workforce is to subsidize the cost of transportation,' he said. Fuel prices soared in Nigeria last year after President Bola Tinubu ended subsidies that had kept prices low for many years. The government has promised relief, including buses that run on compressed natural gas, but many workers doubt the measures will be sufficient or will be implemented soon. With no immediate relief, many Nigerians face a tough choice — pay commuting costs or resign their jobs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fuel-costs-force-some-nigerian-commuters-to-quit-jobs/7825032.html	2024-10-16T15:34:14-07:00	
FBI, French authorities coordinate on Islamic State arrests	washington — Recent arrests in the United States and in Europe have law enforcement and intelligence agencies on alert, bolstering concerns about a reinvigorated Islamic State terror group bent on lashing out against the West. FBI officials Wednesday confirmed the bureau shared information with French authorities following last week’s arrest of 27-year-old Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, an Afghan national in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on charges connected to a mass shooting plot in the name of the Islamic State group, to coincide with the U.S. election in November. That information led to the arrest of a 22-year-old Afghan national in the Haute-Garonne region of France, who French officials say is linked to Tawhedi. That arrest followed the arrests of three other men in the same region, again carried out in coordination with the U.S. French anti-terrorism prosecutors said Saturday that the suspects, all of whom are said to be followers of the Islamic State, appear to have been involved in a plan to carry out an attack on a football stadium or a shopping center. 'The recent arrests in France and by the FBI's Oklahoma City field office demonstrate the importance of partnerships to detect and disrupt potential terrorist attacks,' the FBI said in a statement. 'The FBI's top priority is preventing acts of terrorism, and we are committed to working with our partners both overseas and in the United States to uncover any plots and protect our communities from violence,' it said. The arrests follow repeated warnings from Western counterterrorism officials that the Islamic State, also known as IS or ISIS, has set its sights on launching attacks against the U.S. and Europe. And many have raised specific concerns about the group’s Afghan affiliate, known as IS-Khorasan or ISIS-K. IS-Khorasan 'does have the intention to carry out external attacks, including external attacks inside the United States,' said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen, speaking during a Washington Post webcast last month. 'We are very concerned about the capacity of ISIS-K to potentially move operatives into the United States,' he added. Others have warned that IS, and IS-Khorasan, have each sought to expand recruiting efforts around the globe. Some Western officials and regional observers have told VOA that as far back as 2021, the IS Afghan affiliate was seeking to seed Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan with small but highly capable cells and networks that could serve as the basis for future attacks. Some also have warned that IS-Khorasan has since built on those efforts, increasingly trying to target Afghans and Central Asians living in the West. 'We've seen ISIS-K make a concerted effort to recruit from diaspora communities,' said Austin Doctor, the director of counterterrorism research initiatives at the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology and Education Center, or NCITE, speaking with VOA last week following the Oklahoma City arrest. 'It will be another important factor to watch as more information becomes available.'

Iran FM slams Western sanctions as 'hostile action,' state media says	Tehran, Iran — Iran 's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Wednesday that new Western sanctions against Iran were 'hostile action' and would not help to resolve regional tensions, state media reported. 'The new Western sanctions against Iran are considered a hostile action and will not help the existing situation,' he told reporters in Jordan's capital, Amman, according to IRNA state news agency. On Monday, the 27-member European Union imposed sanctions on prominent Iranian officials and entities, including airlines, accusing them of taking part in the transfer of missiles and drones for Russia to use in its war against Ukraine. Tehran has repeatedly denied the accusations. Last week, the United States expanded sanctions on Iran 's oil industry in response to Tehran's October 1 attack on Israel, which has vowed to respond. Iran said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-aligned militant leaders in the region and a general in its Revolutionary Guards. Regional tensions have soared since the outbreak of the Gaza war in October last year, drawing in Iran-aligned groups from Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Iran was already reeling from crippling U.S. sanctions imposed following Washington's unilateral withdrawal in 2018 from a landmark nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Iran 's president Masoud Pezeshkian, who took office in July, has prioritized reviving the deal. On Wednesday, Araghchi said the so-called Muscat process of indirect negotiations with the United States on nuclear issues 'has been halted for the time being.' Oman has long mediated between Iran and the United States, which cut ties after the 1979 Islamic revolution. Araghchi said, however, that exchanges with the U.S. on other issues are 'still ongoing.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-fm-slams-western-sanctions-as-hostile-action-state-media-says/7824989.html	2024-10-16T14:09:38-07:00	
Iran's border security forces allegedly massacre 'dozens' of Afghan migrants	ISLAMABAD — Taliban authorities are looking into allegations that dozens of Afghan civilians were killed and injured by Iranian border forces while trying to enter that country from Pakistan illegally. Hamdullah Fitrat, the deputy Taliban spokesperson in Kabul, said Wednesday that 'various governmental bodies' and Afghan diplomatic missions have initiated 'comprehensive investigations' to verify the reported casualties. 'As the incident is reported to have occurred beyond Afghanistan’s borders, the available information remains unverified,' Fitrat noted in his English-language statement posted on social media platform X. He added that a 'conclusive decision' would be made after a 'thorough clarification of the facts.' The Taliban probe was announced after an Iranian rights group, known as Halvash, initially reported the alleged Afghan casualties, saying they occurred Sunday in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchistan border province. The organization quoted survivors as saying that about 300 Afghan migrants were attempting to enter Iran unlawfully when they were assaulted by Iranian border guards, resulting in deaths and injuries. 'As of now, reliable sources confirm that the news about the deaths of dozens of illegal citizens at the Saravan border is not true,' Hassan Kazemi Qomi, Iran’s special presidential envoy for and ambassador to Kabul, said in a Persian language statement on X. He referred to an Iranian region adjacent to Washuk, a border district in Pakistan’s southwestern sparsely populated Baluchistan province. Qomi emphasized, however, that responding 'legally' to the 'illegal entry of unauthorized nationals' was 'the legitimate right of countries, and the border guards of any country are obliged to prevent the entry of illegal nationals.' The Iranian envoy wrote that 'managing border traffic is a shared responsibility, and neighboring countries must prevent unauthorized' crossings in line with their international border security obligations. Qomi reiterated that Tehran is determined to return undocumented asylum-seekers and deal sternly with illegal border crossers. 'I'm seriously concerned about reports of injuries & deaths of Afghans in Iran's #Saravan border area and I call for authorities to investigate transparently,' Richard Bennett, the United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Afghanistan, said on X. 'Clarity is urgently needed. These reports don't stand in isolation. More dignity & safety is needed for Afghans worldwide,' Bennett wrote. Residents in the Pakistani border district of Washuk also reported the alleged Iranian assault on Afghan migrants, but they could not provide specific casualty details, citing the remoteness of the border area. Pakistani provincial authorities did not immediately comment on the alleged incident. Iran and Pakistan together host millions of documented and undocumented Afghan refugees. Both countries have deported hundreds of thousands of undocumented individuals back to Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power three years ago. According to the International Organization for Migration, the deportations continue daily, and almost 100,000 Afghans returned home from Pakistan and Iran in September alone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-border-security-forces-allegedly-massacre-dozens-of-afghan-migrants-/7824988.html	2024-10-16T14:09:25-07:00	
Ex-Las Vegas-area official gets at least 28 years in prison for killing reporter	las vegas — A former Las Vegas-area Democratic elected official was sentenced Wednesday to serve at least 28 years in Nevada state prison for killing an investigative journalist who wrote articles critical of his conduct in office two years ago and exposed an intimate relationship with a female coworker. A judge invoked sentencing enhancements for use of a deadly weapon and the age of the reporter to add eight years to the minimum 20-years-to-life sentence that a jury set in August after finding Robert Telles guilty of first-degree murder. 'The judge couldn't sentence him to any more time,' Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said after telling reporters the sentence represented justice for the community. 'She gave him the maximum.' Telles, 47, testified in his defense at trial, denying he stabbed Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German to death in September 2022. But evidence against him was strong — including his DNA beneath German's fingernails. Telles was the administrator of a county office that handles unclaimed estate and probate cases when he was arrested and jailed without bail several days after German's murder. He was stripped of his elected position weeks later. Standing in shackles before the judge on Wednesday, Telles offered 'deepest condolences' to German's family but again denied responsibility for the reporter's death. 'I understand the desire to seek justice and hold somebody accountable for this,' he said. 'But I did not kill Mr. German.' Prosecutor Pamela Weckerly told the judge that evidence showed Telles killed German because 'he didn't like what Mr. German had written about him. He felt that Mr. German had cost him an elected position.' 'This type of violence, this sort of political violence,' the prosecutor said, 'is unacceptable and dangerous for a community as a whole.' Telles' defense attorney, Robert Draskovich, asked for leniency for Telles and told the judge that Telles intends to appeal his conviction. After sentence was pronounced, Draskovich withdrew as Telles' defense lawyer. 'The sentence was not surprising,' Draskovich said outside court. 'We fulfilled our defense obligation. We parted on good terms. [Telles] preserved all his rights for appeal.' German was 69. He was a respected reporter who spent 44 years covering crime, courts and corruption in Las Vegas. Telles lost his primary for a second term in office after German's stories in May and June 2022 described turmoil and bullying at the Clark County Public Administrator/Guardian office and a romantic relationship between Telles and a female employee. His law license was suspended following his arrest. Police sought public help to identify a person captured on neighborhood security video driving a maroon SUV and walking while wearing a broad straw hat that hid his face and an oversized orange long-sleeve shirt. Weckerly showed the jury footage of the person wearing orange slipping into the side yard where German was stabbed, slashed and left dead. At Telles' house, police found a maroon SUV and cut-up pieces of a straw hat and a gray athletic shoe that looked like those worn by the person seen on video. Authorities did not find the orange shirt or a murder weapon. Telles testified for several rambling hours at his trial, admitting for the first time that reports of the office romance were true. He said he was 'framed' for the crime by a broad conspiracy involving a real estate company, police, DNA analysts, former co-workers and others. He told the jury he was victimized for crusading to root out corruption. Wolfson and prosecutors at trial dismissed those claims as unbelievable. Other evidence pointed to Telles, who prosecutor Christopher Hamner told the jury blamed German for destroying his career, ruining his reputation and threatening his marriage. Telles told the jury he took a walk and went to a gym at the time German was killed. But evidence showed Telles' wife sent text messages to him about the same time asking, 'Where are you?' Prosecutors said Telles left his cellphone at home so he couldn't be tracked. The jury deliberated nearly 12 hours over three days before finding Telles guilty. Clark County District Court Judge Michelle Leavitt was able to consider sentencing enhancements adding time to Telles' sentence for using a deadly weapon in a willful, deliberate, premeditated killing and because German was older than 60 years old. 'This defendant has shown absolutely no remorse, no acceptance of responsibility,' said Wolfson, the Democratic elected regional prosecutor. 'And in fact, his behavior is such that I believe he is an extreme danger to the community if he is ever released.' German was the only journalist killed in the U.S. in 2022, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. The nonprofit has records of 17 media workers killed in the U.S. since 1992.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ex-las-vegas-area-official-gets-at-least-28-years-in-prison-for-killing-reporter-/7824974.html	2024-10-16T13:54:05-07:00	
Lebanese refugee crisis raises political tensions in Iraq and demographic concerns in Kirkuk	Washington/Kirkuk, Iraq — Israeli airstrikes against Hezbollah are driving tens of thousands of Lebanese into Iraq — with more expected as the security situation deteriorates. The sudden influx is generating political concerns, especially in Iraq’s volatile Kirkuk region. Iraqi officials say that as of October 9, about 8,000 Lebanese refugees have entered Iraq. Kirkuk, a multi-ethnic province contested by Kurds, Arabs and Turkmens, is already burdened with unresolved demographic and political tensions. The situation has been acute since many internally displaced Iraqis from the war against Islamic State have settled in Kirkuk rather than return to their original provinces. A senior Kurdish official there expressed apprehension that the arrival of Lebanese refugees could further complicate the area’s delicate demographic balance. Many of the refugees are coming from overwhelmingly Shiite areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah is most influential. 'The arrival of Lebanese refugees in Kirkuk must be treated with caution,' the Kurdish official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, told VOA. 'Although the Iraqi government has made the decision to accept the refugees, the provinces are required to comply, but this must be done carefully.' Demographic risk? The official highlighted the precedent of Egyptian workers brought in prior to the U.S. overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003, who never returned to their home country. He suggested that a similar pattern could emerge with the Lebanese refugees. On Sunday, the High Security Committee of Kirkuk, led by Rebwar Taha, convened to discuss preparations for handling the arrival of Lebanese refugees if they migrate to the province. 'Kirkuk itself is full of unresolved conflicts between Kurds, Arabs, and Turkmens. If the arrival of these refugees is not handled properly, the already accumulated issues will intensify,' the Kurdish official warned. While Kurdish officials voice their concerns, Shiite factions with close ties to Hezbollah advocate for welcoming the refugees, emphasizing humanitarian obligations. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani issued a letter on October 10 calling the Lebanese newcomers 'guests, not refugees.' He has ordered officials to 'facilitate entry into Iraq and humanitarian assistance.' Sunni Arabs also have raised concerns. Mahmoud Zaidan, a Sunni leader in Kirkuk, stressed that while humanitarian efforts are necessary, 'The government must carefully evaluate the situation, as the arrival of more refugees could exacerbate feelings of marginalization among Iraqis, particularly those displaced by the war with ISIS.' The timing of the refugee crisis coincides with Iraq’s preparations for a national census, which further complicates the situation.

US Supreme Court declines to pause EPA power plant emissions rule	The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Wednesday to put on hold a new federal rule targeting carbon pollution from coal- and gas-fired power plants at the request of numerous states and industry groups in another major challenge to President Joe Biden's efforts to combat climate change. The justices denied emergency requests by West Virginia, Indiana and 25 other states — most of them Republican led — as well as power companies and industry associations, to halt the Environmental Protection Agency rule while litigation continues in a lower court. The regulation, aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change, took effect July 8. The rule would require existing coal and new natural gas-fired plants eventually to reduce emissions including by capturing and storing carbon dioxide. The EPA's new rule, issued under the landmark Clean Air Act anti-pollution law, was issued two years after a major ruling by the Supreme Court in 2022 undercut the agency's power to issue sweeping regulations to force an electricity-generation shift from coal to cleaner energy sources. The EPA has said efforts to address climate change and its impacts such as extreme weather and rising sea levels must include the power sector because fossil fuel-fired plants make up 25% of overall domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Notably, the rule mandates that coal plants operating past 2038 and certain new gas plants reduce emissions by 90% by 2032 including by using carbon capture and storage systems that extract carbon dioxide from plant exhaust and sequester it underground. The EPA has called the technology proven and technically feasible. The rule's challengers have said it has not been shown effective at the scale predicted by the EPA. The rule's requirements are 'really a backdoor avenue to forcing coal plants out of existence,' West Virginia, a major coal producer, and other state challengers said in a written filing. The Supreme Court's 2022 ruling was based on what is called the 'major questions' legal doctrine embraced by its conservative justices that requires explicit congressional authorization for action on issues of broad importance and societal impact. The states and certain other challengers contend that the EPA's new rule likewise implicates a major question and exceeds the agency's authority. Numerous states and industry players filed multiple lawsuits challenging the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which on July 19 denied requests to pause the regulation pending its review. The case did not implicate a major question because the EPA's actions setting plant limits were 'well within' its statutory authority, the D.C. Circuit stated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supreme-court-declines-to-pause-epa-power-plant-emissions-rule/7824943.html	2024-10-16T13:36:38-07:00	
Georgia struggles to emerge from Russian shadow ahead of crucial election	Tbilisi, Georgia — On a clear October day, the snow-capped Caucasus mountain peaks of Georgia’s South Ossetia are visible from Tbilisi. Yet for most Georgians, the region is off-limits. South Ossetia, and Abkhazia farther to the west, have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 1992. Both regions broke away from Georgia during the collapse of the Soviet Union, in brutal ethnic conflicts stoked by Moscow. Russia’s historical influence looms over Georgia’s upcoming election on Oct. 26, which is widely seen as a referendum on a future aligned to the West or to Moscow. The ruling Georgian Dream party has pledged to reconcile with the breakaway regions and reunite Georgia. 'I want to use this opportunity to address our people on the other side of occupation land in Abkhazia and Tskhinvali (South Ossetia) regions,' Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said at the United Nations’ General Assembly last month. 'Whatever actions we take are done to help our people, so that one day with our children we can live together in one happy, united and developed Georgia. On this side of the occupation line, we will always meet you with an open heart. We have to rebuild all the broken bridges in our country,' Kobakhidze added. Russian forces invaded Georgia in 2008, before formally recognizing South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states. Several hundred Georgian soldiers and civilians died in the five-day conflict. Russia’s troops still occupy 20% of Georgian territory, including the two breakaway regions. Yet the billionaire founder of Georgian Dream, Bidzina Ivanishvili, blames Georgia for the conflict, accusing the 'criminal regime' of former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili of starting the war on the orders of foreign powers. 'Immediately after the October 26 elections, those who instigated the war will face justice,' Ivanishvili said at a campaign event on Sept. 15 in Gori, a city briefly occupied by Russian forces in 2008. He said that Georgia would then apologize for the war. Ivanishvili’s comments sparked widespread anger among Georgians. Critics said it’s a stark example of Georgian Dream’s closer alignment with Russia — but this time, it backfired. 'In this case, they didn’t get a favorable response from Russia,' noted political analyst Ghia Nodia of Georgia’s Ilia State University. 'Russia stated that Abkhazia and South Ossetia are independent states, and reunification with Georgia isn’t going to happen.' Georgian Dream officials defended Ivanishvili’s comments. 'In order to resolve this conflict, of course, there’s the issue with Russia, but there’s also the problem between Georgian society and the Ossetians and Abkhazians,' said Nikoloz Samkharadze, a member of Georgian Dream and chairman of the parliamentary Foreign Relations Committee. 'Reconciliation won’t happen unless these societies forgive and apologize to one another.' The legacy of Stalin The weight of history on the upcoming election extends from well before the collapse of communism and Georgian independence in 1991. Giorgi Kandelaki is from the Tbilisi-based Soviet Past Research Laboratory, an organization dedicated to busting romanticized myths about the Soviet Union and uncovering the truth of Communist rule. He said Georgian Dream’s leaders, aided by Moscow, are attempting to rewrite the history of Georgian-born Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin — an effort to stoke divisive culture wars ahead of the election. 'Many polls indicate that Stalin’s popularity is rising in Georgia, with him being seen as a model of Georgian patriotism,' Kandelaki told VOA. 'This narrative paints Western civilization as a threat, for example by attempting to ‘make us all gay,’ while portraying the Russian world, with an emphasis on religion, as the savior of our souls. In this project, Stalin, as an icon of Georgian patriotism, plays a crucial role. 'Georgian Dream, especially its grassroots supporters and local leaders in the regions, also plays a role in promoting this narrative,' he added. More than 70 years after his death, the debate over Stalin’s legacy remains a live issue in Georgia’s election. The European Union has frozen accession talks with the Georgian government, citing concerns over a slide towards autocracy. Last Friday, EU lawmakers approved a resolution that expressed regret over the 'growing cult of Stalin and the related increase in Soviet nostalgia in Georgia, supported by the ruling government, which underscores its closer alignment with Russia.' Georgian Dream strongly rejected that characterization. 'This is utter nonsense and absurd. No one is promoting the cult of Stalin in Georgia,' Samkharadze told VOA. 'I urge [EU lawmakers] to once again come to Georgia and show me the processes that supposedly contribute to promoting the cult of Stalin. This is especially offensive to me, considering I come from a family that was repressed by the Stalin regime.' The EU resolution, which calls for sanctions to be imposed on Ivanishvili, also suggested that the Georgian government was trying to bury the truth about what happened during Soviet times. 'Some of Georgia’s most important Soviet-era archives (including the archives of the former KGB and the former Central Committee of the Communist Party) have been completely closed since October 2023 without any explanation,' according to the EU parliament resolution. Giorgi Kandelaki of the Soviet Past Research Laboratory echoed that complaint. 'Since 2013, [the Georgian government] has implemented increasingly restrictive measures, gradually making it harder for researchers to access these archives. Today, it’s easier to study Soviet archives in Russia than it is in Georgia,' he said. Again, Georgian Dream denied those accusations. 'Regarding the archives, there are no restrictions, except for foreign citizens. Georgian citizens have no restrictions whatsoever,' Samkharadze told VOA. Georgian Dream insisted it intends to join the EU by 2030, an aspiration enshrined in the country’s constitution. The party denied it is pro-Russian, highlighting resolutions it has sponsored at the U.N. condemning Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The party has held power since 2012 — but polls suggest it will struggle to retain its majority in the upcoming election. Aka Zarqua, the editor-in-chief of the website Realpolitika, said voters no longer trust Georgian Dream. 'The strategic ambiguity they tried to maintain over the years — claiming to support the EU and the West, while simultaneously taking anti-Western steps — has collapsed,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-struggles-to-emerge-from-russian-shadow-ahead-of-crucial-election/7824935.html	2024-10-16T13:19:46-07:00	
Biden to travel to Germany this week, Angola in December for visits delayed by Hurricane Milton	Washington — President Joe Biden is heading to Germany Thursday and will visit Angola the first week in December, rescheduling visits that were postponed so he could remain in Washington to monitor the federal response to Hurricane Milton as it struck Florida. The White House confirmed Biden will depart for his quick trip to Berlin on Thursday. It will offer him the opportunity to huddle with his key ally, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, about their countries' support for Ukraine in its war with Russia as the conflict is at another critical moment. Biden's initial itinerary for the postponed trip included a meeting on the war in Ukraine with allied nations at an American military base in Germany before he was to continue on to Angola. The White House says that the gathering of representatives of the allied nations, partners in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, will instead take place virtually next month. Still, the war in Ukraine will loom large during Biden's time in Berlin this week. Biden spoke by phone Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but they will not meet while the president is in Germany. The two leaders discussed Zelenskyy's 'victory plan,' shortly after the Ukrainian leader presented it to his parliament . Zelenskyy is scheduled to present the five-point plan to the European Council on Thursday. Zelenskyy had previously spoken to Biden about the proposal. The plan includes an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory — steps that have been met with reluctance by Kyiv's allies so far. The White House on Wednesday declined to comment about the plan. 'We're going to let the Ukrainians speak to their victory plan,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. 'What we're going to continue to do is show our support for the Ukrainians on the battlefield as they continue to beat back Russia.' Zelenskyy said in a statement following the call he also spoke to Biden about the U.S. and Ukraine potentially exploring ways to produce weapons together. The Biden administration also announced a further $425 million in military assistance to Ukraine, bringing its total to more than $64 billion in the two and a half years since Russia's invasion. Wednesday's package includes surface-to-air missiles to protect Ukrainian infrastructure from Russian attacks and long range rockets and artillery to help its war effort. Biden and Scholz recently spoke by phone to discuss the need for the countries to 'continue our strong collaboration on geopolitical priorities, including supporting Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression,' according to the White House. Jean-Pierre said the trip was important to Biden, in part because of Germany's help with a complicated hostage swap with Russia. 'The president really wanted to make sure to go to Germany to thank Chancellor Scholz directly,' she said. Scholz in a speech before the German parliament on Wednesday said he was looking forward to Biden's visit. 'I would like to say that … President Biden stands for an incredible improvement in cooperation over recent years,' said Scholz, adding that he was grateful for the 'good collaboration' forged with the Democratic president. There's a significant measure of anxiety in Europe about what next month's U.S. presidential election could mean for Ukraine. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has been in lockstep with Biden about the need to maintain robust economic and military support for Ukraine. Republican Donald Trump has said he would move to quickly to end the war the war with Russia should he regain the White House. Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has said that the plan would include establishing a 'demilitarized zone' and that Ukraine would not reclaim territory that Russia occupies and would agree not to join NATO. Scholz has been one of Biden's closest global allies. In addition to his robust support for Ukraine, Scholz played a critical role in helping free Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, corporate security executive Paul Whelan, and others from Russian prisons in a multinational prisoner swap. As part of the biggest prisoner exchange in post-Soviet history, Scholz agreed to release Vadim Krasikov, a Russian who was convicted of the 2019 murder of a 40-year-old Georgian citizen who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany. Biden has not visited Africa since taking office in early 2021. Jean-Pierre said the coming visit to Luanda aims to 'recognize Angola's role as a strategic partner and regional leader, and discuss increased collaboration on security, health, and economic partnerships.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-travel-to-germany-this-week-angola-in-december-for-visits-delayed-by-hurricane-milton/7824926.html	2024-10-16T13:19:37-07:00	
US Navy fighter jet with two on board crashes during training in Washington state	The U.S. Navy searched Wednesday through mountainous terrain for two crew members who were aboard a fighter jet that crashed in Washington state during a routine training flight. The EA-18G Growler jet from the Electronic Attack Squadron crashed east of Mount Rainier at about 3:23 p.m. Tuesday, according to Whidbey Island Naval Air Station. Search teams, including a U.S. Navy MH-60S helicopter, launched from NAS Whidbey Island to try to find the crew and examine the crash site. Navy searchers were joined by Yakima County tribal and local authorities as they pored over an area of about 48 kilometers (30 miles) west of Yakima in cloudy weather with low visibility, the Navy said. As of late Wednesday morning, they hadn't found the wreckage or crew, officials said in a news release. Navy officials said they didn't know if the two crew members managed to eject before the crash, which remains under investigation. The EA-18G Growler is similar to the F/A-18F Super Hornet and includes sophisticated electronic warfare devices. Most of the Growler squadrons are based at Whidbey Island. One squadron is based at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan. The 'Zappers' were recently deployed on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. The search Wednesday was happening in rainy and cloudy weather near Mount Rainier, a towering active volcano that is blanketed in snowfields and glaciers year-round. The first production of the Growler was delivered to Whidbey Island in 2008. In the last 15 years, it has operated around the globe supporting major actions, the Navy said. The plane seats a pilot in front and an electronics operator behind them. 'The EA-18G Growler aircraft we fly represents the most advanced technology in airborne Electronic Attack and stands as the Navy's first line of defense in hostile environments,' the Navy said on its website. Each aircraft costs about $67 million. Military aircraft training exercises and travel can be dangerous and sometimes result in crashes, injuries and deaths. In May, an F-35 fighter jet on its way from Texas to Edwards Air Force Base near Los Angeles crashed after the pilot stopped to refuel in New Mexico. The pilot was the only person on board in that case and was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. Last year, eight U.S. Air Force special Operations Command service members were killed when a CV-22B Osprey aircraft they were flying in crashed off the coast of Japan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-navy-fighter-jet-with-two-on-board-crashes-during-training-in-washington-state-/7824904.html	2024-10-16T13:19:29-07:00	
Defense contractor to pay $252M penalty to resolve Qatar bribery charges	NEW YORK — RTX Corporation, the defense contractor formerly known as Raytheon, has agreed to pay the U.S. government $252 million to resolve criminal charges alleging it paid bribes to secure contracts with Qatar, federal prosecutors said Wednesday. The company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement on charges of violating the anti-bribery provision of the Foreign Corruption Practices Act and the Arms Export Control Act. It also agreed to pay a $52.5 million civil penalty to resolve a parallel Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and must forfeit at least $37 million to satisfy both probes. At a brief hearing in federal court in Brooklyn, lawyers for RTX waived their right to an indictment and pleaded not guilty to both counts. They did not object to any of the allegations in court documents filed in conjunction with the agreement. Under the agreement, the company will have to demonstrate good conduct for the next 3½ years and foster a culture of ethics and compliance with anti-corruption laws. Messages seeking comment were left for RTX Corporation and the Qatari Embassy in Washington. RTX said in a July regulatory filing that it set aside $1.24 billion to resolve pending legal and regulatory matters. The company's president and CEO, Christopher Calio, told investors that the investigations largely involved issues that predated the Raytheon-United Technologies merger that formed the current company in 2020. 'These matters primarily arose out of legacy Raytheon Company and Rockwell Collins prior to the merger and acquisition of these companies,' Calio said. 'We've already taken robust corrective actions to address the legacy gaps that led to these issues.' According to court documents, Raytheon employees and agents offered and paid bribes to a foreign official between 2012 and 2016 to gain an advantage in obtaining lucrative business deals with the Qatar Emiri Air Force and Qatar Armed Forces. The company then succeeded in securing four additions to an existing contract with the Gulf Cooperation Council — a regional union of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — and a $510 million sole-sourced contract to build a joint-operations center for the Qatari military, the court documents said. Raytheon made about $36.7 million in profit from the Gulf Cooperation Council contract additions and anticipated making more than $72 million on the joint operations center, but the Qatari government ultimately did not go forward with the deal, prosecutors said. Wednesday's penalty is just the latest legal fallout from RTX's business dealings. According to court and regulatory filings, the company is expected to soon enter into another deferred prosecution agreement to resolve civil and criminal investigations in Massachusetts into defective pricing claims for Raytheon contracts dating from 2011 to 2017. In August, the company agreed to pay $200 million to the State Department after voluntarily disclosing more than two dozen alleged violations of the Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Among the allegations were that the company provided classified military aircraft data to China and that employees took company-issued laptops containing information about missiles and aircraft into Iran, Lebanon and Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/defense-contractor-to-pay-252m-penalty-to-resolve-qatar-bribery-charges/7824918.html	2024-10-16T13:13:16-07:00	
Listeria recall grows to 5.4 million kilograms of meat and poultry	A nationwide recall of meat and poultry products potentially contaminated with listeria has expanded to nearly 15.4 million kilograms (12 million pounds) and now includes ready-to-eat meals sent to U.S. schools, restaurants and major retailers, federal officials said. The updated recall includes prepared salads, burritos and other foods sold at stores including Costco, Trader Joe's, Target, Walmart and Kroger. The meat used in those products was processed at a Durant, Oklahoma, manufacturing plant operated by BrucePac. The Woodburn, Oregon-based company sells precooked meat and poultry to industrial, foodservice and retail companies across the country. Routine testing found potentially dangerous listeria bacteria in samples of BrucePac chicken, officials with the U.S. Agriculture Department said. No illnesses have been confirmed in connection with the recall, USDA officials said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not launched an outbreak investigation, a spokesperson said. The recall, issued on October 9, includes foods produced between May 31 and October 8. The USDA has posted a 342-page list of hundreds of potentially affected foods, including chicken wraps sold at Trader Joe's, chicken burritos sold at Costco and many types of salads sold at stores such as Target and Walmart. The foods were also sent to school districts and restaurants across the country. The recalled foods can be identified by establishment numbers '51205 or P-51205' inside or under the USDA mark of inspection. Consumers can search on the USDA recall site to find potentially affected products. Such foods should be thrown away or returned to stores for refunds, officials said. Eating foods contaminated with listeria can cause potentially serious illness. About 1,600 people are infected with listeria bacteria each year in the U.S. and about 260 die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Listeria infections typically cause fever, muscle aches and tiredness and may cause stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. Symptoms can occur quickly or to up to 10 weeks after eating contaminated food. The infections are especially dangerous for older people, those with weakened immune systems or who are pregnant. The same type of bacteria is responsible for an outbreak tied to Boar's Head deli meat that has killed at least 10 people since May.	https://www.voanews.com/a/listeria-recall-grows-to-5-4-million-kilograms-of-meat-and-poultry/7824872.html	2024-10-16T12:42:25-07:00	
Two US radio stations end Russian-backed 'propaganda' programming	Washington — Russian-backed radio programmer Sputnik no longer broadcasts in the Washington market after years of criticism that its local radio station, WZHF, carries antisemitic content and false information about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Political cartoonist Ted Rall, who described himself as a guest on Sputnik’s programming, posted a comment Tuesday on X: 'Biden/Harris say they're fighting for democracy. Yet: today Sputnik News US is being forced to shut down today due to Biden/Harris sanctions. My radio show and cartoons for them are being quashed. So are the other amazing shows. I go off the air with the station at noon.' Manila Chan, a self-described indie journalist, tweeted Tuesday that she and Rall would be relaunching their show on YouTube 'following sanctions that have shut down RT+Sputnik.' As first reported by The Desk, a news website on the business of streaming media, Sputnik stopped programming in its Washington-based market and three stations in the Kansas City, Missouri, area this week. Last month, the U.S. State Department introduced new sanctions on Russian-backed broadcasters, including television channel RT, for fundraising on behalf of the Russian military in opposition to Ukraine. The sanctions marked the first time the United States accused Russian broadcasters of providing direct and material military support. 'RT wants its new covert intelligence capabilities, like its longstanding propaganda disinformation efforts, to remain hidden. Our most powerful antidote to Russia’s lies is the truth. It’s shining a bright light on what the Kremlin is trying to do under the cover of darkness,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month. The sanctions did not specifically prohibit the content of the programming but made it more difficult for Sputnik to continue buying airtime on U.S. stations. 'As Foreign Missions Act-designated entities, Rossiya Segodnya, RIA Novosti, RT, TV-Novosti, Ruptly, and Sputnik will be required to notify the State Department of all personnel working in the United States. The entities will also be required to disclose all real property they hold within the United States,' said the State Department in a September 4 statement. RT and RT America, the TV and digital media company founded by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2005, directs Sputnik. Prior to this week, five U.S. radio stations carried Russian government-backed Sputnik programming. Shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the National Association of Broadcasters said in a statement, 'While the First Amendment protects freedom of speech, however, it does not prevent private actors from exercising sound, moral judgment. To that end, given the unprovoked aggression exhibited by Russia against the free and sovereign people of Ukraine, NAB calls on broadcasters to cease carrying any state-sponsored programming with ties to the Russian government or its agents.' 'While we know that airings of such programs are extremely limited, we believe that our nation must stand fully united against misinformation and for freedom and democracy across the globe,' said NAB. In January, Republican Representative Jack Bergman called on the Federal Communications Commission to revoke the license of Radio Sputnik Washington affiliate WZHF (1390) and its translator W288BS at 105.5 FM. In the letter, Bergman cited a steady stream of antisemitic tropes and false information about the war in Ukraine. 'An FCC licensee clearly has a First Amendment right to broadcast. However, that right is tempered by its obligation to broadcast programming that is in the public interest and responsive to the needs of the local community,' Bergman wrote in the letter. He also argued the licensees 'have made no effort to ascertain the needs or interests of the local community' and that their programming decisions 'are based exclusively on monetary considerations.' In 2018, three Democratic members of Congress asked then-FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to investigate Sputnik’s alleged efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 'In Washington, D.C., listeners need only tune their radios to 105.5 FM to hear the Russian government’s effort to influence U.S. policy,' the letter from Democratic Representatives Anna Eshoo, Mike Doyle and Frank Pallone said. 'Disturbingly, this means the Kremlin’s propaganda messages are being broadcast over a license granted by the FCC.' Pai — a Trump administration appointee — declined to investigate, saying the First Amendment prevented the FCC 'from interfering with a broadcast licensee’s choice of programming, even if that programming may be objectionable to many listeners.' A bipartisan group of members of Congress introduced the Identifying Propaganda on Our Airwaves Act in 2018. 'Foreign governments shouldn’t be able to hide behind shell companies to fund misinformation and propaganda on American airwaves,' said Democratic Senator Brian Schatz, a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. 'By giving the FCC the authority to require disclosure of this foreign propaganda, our bipartisan bill will help stop this practice and improve programming transparency on TV and the radio,' he said. The bill did not advance in Congress. Federal regulations already prevent foreign governments from holding U.S. broadcast licenses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-us-radio-stations-end-russian-backed-propaganda-programming/7824863.html	2024-10-16T12:34:00-07:00

Trudeau calls India's alleged interference in Canada 'horrific mistake'	OTTAWA, CANADA — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday said India made 'a horrific mistake' by thinking it could interfere as aggressively as it allegedly did in Canada's sovereignty. Trudeau made the remark two days after Canada kicked out six Indian diplomats, linking them to the murder of a Sikh separatist leader in Canada and alleging a broader effort to target Indian dissidents in the country. The Canadian leader's comments were the strongest he has made in a yearlong dispute that plunged bilateral relations to a new low. 'The Indian government made a horrific mistake in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of Canada,' he told an independent probe into foreign interference in Canadian politics. Trudeau said Ottawa could take further steps to ensure Canadians' security but declined to give details. India denies the allegations of interference and has expelled six Canadian diplomats in a tit-for-tat move.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trudeau-calls-india-s-alleged-interference-in-canada-horrific-mistake-/7824810.html	2024-10-16T11:51:27-07:00	
Former US president Jimmy Carter, 100, casts vote	washington — Fifteen days after turning 100, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter cast his ballot in the U.S. election on Wednesday, fulfilling an earlier declared wish to live long enough to vote for Kamala Harris. The former Democratic leader 'voted by mail,' according to the Carter Center, the nonprofit he founded after he left the White House in 1981 to pursue his vision of world diplomacy. The centenarian — who left office under a cloud of unpopularity, but has seen his star rise ever since — took advantage of early voting in his home state of Georgia, where he is receiving hospice care. Carter had told his family earlier this year that living long enough to vote for Harris and help defeat her Republican rival, Donald Trump, was more important to him than his centennial, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper. He reached both milestones. More than 420,000 people have cast their ballot since early voting began Tuesday in Georgia, according to Gabriel Sterling, a state election official who posted the figures at midday. Election Day is November 5. Carter, a one-term president, has been receiving end-of-life care in his hometown of Plains in Georgia since February last year. He is the first former U.S. president to reach the century mark, another extraordinary milestone for the one-time peanut farmer who worked his way to the White House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-us-president-jimmy-carter-100-casts-vote-/7824686.html	2024-10-16T10:37:02-07:00

Israeli minister criticizes Macron over France defense show ban	Jerusalem — Israeli delegations taking part in the major defense show Euronaval in France next month will not be permitted to set up a stand or exhibit hardware following a decision by the French government, organizers said Wednesday, prompting outrage from Israel. The decision comes as tensions are rising between Israel and France following comments by President Emmanuel Macron criticizing the civilian casualties in the Israeli campaigns against Shiite militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon and Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The French leader last week insisted that stopping the export of weapons used by Israel in both operations was the only way to halt the two conflicts. 'The French government informed Euronaval of its decision to approve the participation of Israeli delegations at Euronaval 2024, without any stand or exhibition of equipment,' said the organizers of the show which is due to start on November 4 in Paris. Following the decision, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant slammed Macron, calling the move a 'disgrace'. 'Macron's actions are a disgrace to the French nation and the values of the free world, which he claims to uphold. The decision to discriminate against Israeli defense industries in France a second time - aids Israel's enemies during war,' Gallant said in a post on X. 'We will continue defending our nation against enemies on 7 different fronts, and fighting for our future - with or without France,' Gallant added. Euronaval, a biennial event that attracts naval defense exhibitors from around the world, said seven Israeli companies are affected by the decision. 'In accordance with the French government's decision, Israeli companies and citizens who wish to attend will be welcomed at the show under the conditions listed above,' it added. At the end of May, the presence of Israeli defense manufacturers at the Eurosatory land defense and security exhibition was banned by the government, before finally being authorized by the French courts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-minister-criticizes-macron-over-france-defense-show-ban/7824606.html	2024-10-16T09:51:57-07:00	
Mozambique’s ruling party candidate poised for presidential victory	Maputo — Daniel Chapo, the presidential candidate of Mozambique’s ruling party, is comfortably leading the vote count in nine of the country's provinces and appears set to become the country’s next president. His closest challenger was running a distant second Wednesday as vote counting from last week’s election continued. Preliminary results from Wednesday’s election announced so far show Chapo leading with over 50% of the vote in nine of Mozambique’s 11 provinces. In the capital, Maputo, Chapo is ahead with over 53 percent, followed by independent candidate Venancio Mondlane at just under 34 percent. Chapo has led at every polling station counted, according to the chairperson of the Maputo Provincial Election Commission, Lucilia Sitoe. She said, 'Daniel Franscisco Chapo, 656,056, which corresponds to 68.02. Venancio Antion Bila Mondlane, 260,792, which corresponds to 27.04%.' The two other presidential candidates, Ossufo Momade of the opposition Renamo party, polled 9.6% of the vote in Maputo, followed by Lutero Simango of Mozambique Democratic Movement, MDM with 2.86%. A similar scenario is also occurring in the central province of Zambezia, traditionally an opposition stronghold. There, Chapo is leading with 73%, with Mondlane a distant second with 14.7%. In Sofala province, another longtime opposition stronghold, Chapo held 65% of the vote. Turnout in Wednesday’s election was relatively low, less than 50%. According to data shared by electoral bodies, close to 9 million of Mozambique’s 17 million registered voters did not vote. In the northern province of Nampula, the largest constituency in the country, more than 2 million voters stayed home and tens of thousands cast blank ballots – a common form of protest in Mozambique, showing dissatisfaction with all the candidates. The numbers were similar in Zambezia, the country’s second-largest constituency. In Cabo Delgado province, plagued by an insurgency by Islamist militants for several years, 925,000 people did not vote, 35,000 cast blank ballots and another 18,000 votes were spoiled. The chairman of Mozambique’s national elections commission vowed that every ballot cast will be counted. He said, 'Every vote will be counted definitely, we are ready for that. The counting system is participatory because all the political parties are represented at polling stations so every vote will count and we just hope for the best.' Final results are expected in about two weeks. Independent political analyst Dercio Alfazema said the next president faces high expectations from the public. 'Our expectations are number one, is to be well governed, so we have a challenge to obtain a better result, the people want the end of corruption, we are looking for more security, we are looking for more health service and the quality of education, the extension of the services such as infrastructure. We also have the problem of terrorism in the north, the kidnappings; the young people are looking for jobs and some opportunities,' said Alfazema. The president-elect will be sworn into office in January, when current President Filipe Nyusi, who is barred by the constitution from running again, steps down at the end of his second five-year term.

EU, Gulf leaders meet for first summit as Mideast turmoil churns	BRUSSELS — The leaders of the European Union and six Gulf nations met for an inaugural summit on Wednesday against a backdrop of turmoil in the Middle East and struggles to find a unified position on the war in Ukraine and relations with Russia. The summit was expected to last just a few hours and encompass topics ranging from visas and trade to the situation in the Middle East. It was unlikely to yield more than general commitments to improve cooperation. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said that the summit was 'long overdue' and that 'the economic ties between the European Union and the Gulf countries need to be strengthened.' 'They are there, but they have the potential to be developed much, much further,' he said. Officials said the EU would also raise human rights issues with their visitors, which include Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The United States, United Nations and others have alleged that aides of Mohammed and other Saudi officials killed U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, whose columns for The Washington Post were critical of the crown prince. 'Our outrage and revulsion at this horrific violation of human rights cannot be set aside for the sake of quick deals with dictators. EU leaders must confront brutal authoritarianism wherever it exists,' EU Greens legislator Daniel Freund said. The 27-nation EU has long had relations with the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council of Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait. The nations of the European Union already find it challenging to find full alignment on Israel's wars against Hamas and Hezbollah, and it will be difficult to find a strong common statement with GCC leaders, officials familiar with the meeting said. EU members are also in disagreement regarding relations with Russia and Ukraine, with nations such as Hungary and Slovakia holding vastly different views on Moscow's actions than much of the other EU states. At the same time, several GCC nations have much better contact with Moscow compared to EU members.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-gulf-leaders-meet-for-first-summit-as-mideast-turmoil-churns/7824518.html	2024-10-16T08:49:54-07:00

European airlines voice concern over Chinese counterparts 'unfair advantages'	Calls are growing among European airline carriers to address what they say is an unfair advantage enjoyed by their Chinese counterparts, who can fly directly over Russia to Europe and offer customers shorter travel times and cheaper ticket prices. Many European carriers have been banned from Russia's airspace in response to sanctions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Additional environmental costs make it harder for European airlines to compete against Chinese carriers. Speaking at an industry press conference on Wednesday in Brussels, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr urged changes that would require all flights into Europe to avoid Russian airspace. 'We are not allowed to cross Russia but Chinese carriers are. If you want a level playing field, we need to ensure any airline landing in Europe avoids Russian airspace. Until that happens there will be enormous advantages to Chinese carriers,' Spohr said, according to Reuters. Bloomberg reported that according to sources familiar with the matter, Air-France KLM, a Paris-headquartered airline group, is lobbying the French government to add a cap to the number of flights to Europe from Chinese carriers to protect European airlines from unfair competition. Earlier this month, Marjan Rintel, CEO of KLM, called on Europe to take measures against what she said is an unlevel playing field, when speaking with Dutch public broadcaster Nederlandse Publieke Omroep, or NPO. 'Europe can at least look at how we can prevent that unfair playing field by pricing it or looking at it in a different way,' Rintel said. European airlines have not flown over Russian territory since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Ukraine’s airspace has also been closed. The remarks from Lufthansa’s CEO are not the first time that flights from China have aroused concerns from other countries. During the COVID pandemic, the United States took action to limit the number of Chinese airlines flying into the country which ultimately resulted in both Washington and Beijing creating caps on flight numbers. Some European airlines have already canceled routes to China. Later this month, Lufthansa will cancel its Frankfurth to Beijing flight and Air China will become the sole airline flying between the two cities. In July, Virgin Atlantic canceled its London to Shanghai flight, its only route to China. The EU and China have been at odds over various issues regarding trade, technology and national security in recent years. Some fear recent tit-for-tat actions between China and the EU could lead to a trade war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-airlines-voice-concern-over-chinese-counterparts-unfair-advantages-/7824457.html	2024-10-16T07:51:24-07:00	
Nebraska's high court says people with felony records can register to vote	OMAHA, Neb. — Nebraska's top election official had no authority to declare unconstitutional a state law that restored the voting rights of those who have been convicted of a felony, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in a decision with implications for the approaching election. In July, Secretary of State Bob Evnen ordered county election officials to reject the voter registrations of those with felony convictions, citing an opinion issued by Attorney General Mike Hilgers. That opinion, which Evnen had requested, deemed as unconstitutional a law passed this year by the Legislature immediately restoring the voting rights of people who have completed the terms of their felony sentences. Evnen's order could have kept 7,000 or more Nebraska residents from voting in the upcoming election, the American Civil Liberties Union said. Many of them reside in Nebraska's Omaha-centered 2nd Congressional District, where both the race for president and Congress could be in play. In an otherwise reliably Republican state that, unlike most others, splits its electoral votes, the district has twice awarded an electoral vote to Democratic presidential candidates — once to Barack Obama in 2008 and again to Joe Biden in 2020. In a presidential race shown by polling to be a dead heat, a single electoral vote could determine who wins. Given the Omaha district's history, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Democratic groups have spent millions in the district in the hopes of securing the electoral vote — far more than former President Donald Trump and Republican groups. The last day to register to vote for the 2024 general election in Nebraska is Oct. 25 and must be done in person at a voter's county election commission office. Election Day is Nov. 5. Hilgers' opinion had said the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers, saying only the state Board of Pardons under the control of the executive branch can restore voting rights through pardons. Pardons are exceedingly rare in Nebraska. Evnen, Hilgers and Gov. Jim Pillen make up the three-member Board of Pardons. All three are Republicans. The opinion also found unconstitutional a 2005 state law that restored the voting rights of people with felony convictions two years after they complete the terms of their sentences. The ACLU is representing advocacy group Civic Nebraska and two Nebraska residents, a Republican and an independent, who would be denied the right to vote under Evnen's directive. Because Evnen's move came only weeks ahead of the November election, the ACLU asked to take the lawsuit directly to the Nebraska Supreme Court, and the high court agreed. Restoring the voting rights of former felons has drawn national attention in recent years. In Florida, lawmakers weakened a 2018 voter-approved constitutional amendment to restore the voting rights of most convicted felons. Following that, an election police unit championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis arrested 20 former felons. Several of them said they were confused by the arrests because they had been allowed to register to vote. In Tennessee, lawmakers killed a bipartisan bill this year that would have let residents convicted of felonies apply to vote again without also restoring their gun rights. Dozens of states allow people living with felony convictions to vote, either for those not currently in prison or upon completion of their sentences. Two states, Maine and Vermont, allow everyone, even those in prison, to vote. But despite a recent trend toward restoration of rights, felony disenfranchisement laws prevent around 5.85 million people across the country from voting, according to the ACLU. Felony disenfranchisement laws date to the Jim Crow era and mainly targeted Black people, according to experts. Black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive view of Harris, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nebraska-s-high-court-says-people-with-felony-records-can-register-to-vote/7824406.html	2024-10-16T07:25:24-07:00

Pakistan pushes for expansion of China’s BRI plans	Islamabad — Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif advocated expanding China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) on Wednesday, saying it would enhance regional trade cooperation and promote 'the vision of a connected Eurasia.' He delivered the remarks at the annual heads of government meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Islamabad. Beijing and Russia established the SCO in 2001 as a way to counterbalance Western alliances in the areas of security, politics, and economics. In his inaugural speech to the SCO huddle, Sharif hailed China’s investments in infrastructure projects in Pakistan as part of its global Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, and called for its expansion. 'Flagship projects like the Belt and Road Initiative of President Xi Jinping, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor…should be expanded, focusing on developing road, rail, and digital infrastructure that enhances integration and cooperation across our region,' he stated. 'Let us not look at such projects through the narrow political prism, and [instead] invest in our collective connectivity capacities, which are crucial to advancing the shared vision of an economically integrated region,' Sharif asserted, noting that 40% of the world’s population lives in SCO member countries. Beijing launched the ambitious $1 trillion BRI, a global infrastructure and energy network, a decade ago to connect Asia, Africa, and Europe through new land and maritime routes. The United States and other Western critics see the plan as a tool for China to expand its geopolitical and economic influence. They also criticize the Chinese investments, alleging they are burdening developing countries with unsustainable debt, charges Beijing rejects as politically motivated. Last year, through the G7 framework, Western nations unveiled a $600 billion initiative to establish an alternative infrastructure development plan for connectivity. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, known as CPEC, is a key BRI extension into Pakistan, building road networks, mostly coal-fired power plants and a deep-water port as well as an airport in the coastal city of Gwadar. Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin were among the leaders from the 10-member grouping who attended Wednesday’s gathering, including host Pakistan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India, and Iran. An official Chinese statement quoted Premier Li as stating during the SCO gathering in Islamabad that China 'looks forward to working with all parties' to implement the outcomes of summits and 'deepen cooperation in various fields, and promote the cohesion of the SCO, so as to make greater contributions to advancing regional peace, stability, and development.' Analysts remain skeptical whether the SCO meetings have produced outcomes that would address the needs of member states, noting that Western alliances like NATO or the European Union offer members privileges such as mutual defense and economic integration. Afghanistan Pakistani authorities placed Islamabad under a security lockdown for the SCO meeting, deploying around 10,000 security forces, including troops, in and around the city to protect the high-profile event due to a recent surge in deadly militant attacks. Islamabad says fugitives linked to anti-Pakistan terrorist groups orchestrate the violence from sanctuaries in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Sharif used his speech Wednesday to press the Taliban government, which is officially not recognized by any country, to address regional terrorism concerns, noting that stability in Afghanistan was essential for SCO member states to realize regional connectivity and trade opportunities fully. 'While the international community must extend the needed assistance to help the Afghan interim government in staving off the humanitarian crisis and preventing an economic meltdown, it must also demand from the Afghan Interim government to take concrete measures to promote political inclusivity, as well as to ensure that its soil is not used for terrorism against its neighbors, by any entity,' he stated. Militant and separatist attacks have claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Pakistani civilians and security forces so far this year alone. Last week, two Chinese engineers were killed and another was injured when a suicide car bombing hit their convoy in the southern Pakistani port city of Karachi. The slain Chinese nationals were staff at a CPEC-built power plant. The Taliban have repeatedly denied charges that foreign militants are using Afghan soil to threaten neighboring countries. They also dismissed international calls for giving representation to all ethnic and political groups in Afghanistan in their administration, called the Islamic Emirate. The Tabliban say they are governing the country in line with their strict interpretation of Islamic law.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-pushes-for-expansion-of-china-s-bri-plans/7824296.html	2024-10-16T06:17:32-07:00	
China says unidentified foreign company conducted illegal mapping services	BEIJING — China's state security ministry said that a foreign company had been found to have illegally conducted geographic mapping activities in the country under the guise of autonomous driving research and outsourcing to a licensed Chinese mapping firm. The ministry did not disclose the names of either company in a statement on its WeChat account on Wednesday. The foreign company, ineligible for geographic surveying and mapping activities in China, 'purchased a number of cars and equipped them with high-precision radar, GPS, optical lenses and other gear,' read the statement. In addition to directly instructing the Chinese company to conduct surveying and mapping in many Chinese provinces, the foreign company appointed foreign technicians to give 'practical guidance' to mapping staffers with the Chinese firm, enabling the latter to transfer its acquired data overseas, the ministry alleged. Most of the data the foreign company has collected have been determined to be state secrets, according to the ministry, which said state security organs, together with relevant departments, had carried out joint law enforcement activities. The affected companies and relevant responsible personnel have been held legally accountable, the state security ministry said, without elaborating. China has strictly regulated mapping activities and data, which are key to developing autonomous driving, due to national security concerns. No foreign firm is qualified for mapping in China and data collected by vehicles made by foreign automakers such as Tesla in China has to be stored locally. The U.S. Commerce Department has also proposed prohibiting Chinese software and hardware in connected and autonomous vehicles on American roads due to national security concerns. Also on Wednesday, a Chinese cybersecurity industry group recommended that Intel products sold in China should be subject to a security review, alleging the U.S. chipmaker has 'constantly harmed' the country's national security and interests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-unidentified-foreign-company-conducted-illegal-mapping-services-/7824277.html	2024-10-16T05:59:17-07:00	
US police urged to embrace prevention to head off mass shootings, attacks	The U.S. agency charged with protecting the life of the president of the United States and other high-ranking officials wants state and local law enforcement to do more to stop potential threats from escalating into violence. And it is trying to show police agencies across the country exactly how to do it. The U.S. Secret Service's National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) on Wednesday issued a new guide, encouraging law enforcement agencies to create specific units to address threatening behavior in cases where there are significant concerns, even though no laws have been broken. The guide specifically calls for police agencies to set up what NTAC calls behavioral threat assessment units that can assess potential dangers and then provide resources to make sure individuals get help before they resort to violence. 'What our research has continuously found is that in many cases of mass violence or other forms of targeted violence, the attacker's behavior was witnessed by community bystanders, some of whom sought to report their concerns to public safety officials,' said Lina Alathari, NTAC director, briefing reporters ahead of the guide's release. 'Unfortunately, many communities lack the structured systems to receive, evaluate and respond to these reports in a way that would reduce the likelihood of a violent or tragic outcome,' she said. NTAC's plea for law enforcement agencies to find ways to be more proactive is not new. A January 2023 report that analyzed 173 mass attacks carried out over a five-year period urged communities to make it easier for witnesses to report concerns and allow for earlier intervention from crisis counselors and social services. But the latest guidance comes as national security officials are bracing for potential violence. The Department of Homeland Security's 2025 annual threat assessment, issued last month, warned, 'The terrorism threat environment in the United States over the next year will remain high. 'The threat will continue to be characterized primarily by lone offenders or small cells motivated to violence by a combination of racial, religious, gender, or anti-government grievances; conspiracy theories; and personalized factors,' it added. The Secret Service has itself responded to two unrelated attempts to assassinate former president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, coming under criticism for its failure to prevent one of the would-be assassins from firing eight shots and injuring Trump before he was stopped. Investigators in that case have said the now dead 20-year-old gunman had spent months researching assassinations and saw the former president as a 'target of opportunity.' The new guide, issued Wednesday, aims to show police agencies how to spot warning signs more quickly and find ways to intervene. 'We have seen historically that law enforcement in the United States may at times feel limited in what they can do when responding to reports of threats or other concerning behavior, particularly when that behavior does not involve criminal activity,' said NTAC Assistant Chief Steven Driscoll. 'This publication represents the most comprehensive guidance ever produced on how to adapt and operationalize the Secret Services Behavioral Threat Assessment model for use by state and local law enforcement agencies,' he said. Some state law enforcement agencies have already adopted the Secret Service model. North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation set up a behavioral analysis threat assessment unit following a 2018 shooting that killed 17 people in Parkland, Florida. The unit works with other state agencies and the state's university system to prevent potential attacks. The state of Hawaii has likewise created a team to intervene in cases of potential violence. And there is a similar program in Washington, the U.S. capital. 'Behavioral threat assessment methodology has been proven effective in safeguarding community time and again,' Driscoll said. 'Prevention happens successfully every day, and thankfully, these are stories that we never hear about, when everybody goes home safely.' As an example, Driscoll pointed to a 2021 NTAC study that looked at 67 incidents in which attacks on schools were averted due to students and community members reporting warning signs so authorities could intervene before anyone got hurt. Despite such successes, NTAC said it does not have any data on how many communities have behavioral threat assessment units. And officials worry that too many state and local law enforcement agencies lack access to programs that allow them to step in when a threat has been identified but no law has been broken. Some federal funding, though, is available. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it has awarded almost $90 million through its Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention Grant Program since 2020. And NTAC's Alathari said the specialized units can be effective, even when people and resources are scarce. 'Behavioral assessment units are able to vary in size,' she said in response to a question from VOA. 'An agency with limited resources to establish this kind of unit could begin with just a single designated violence prevention officer who maintains the responsibility of gathering information, information to manage situations that might revolve around potential violence.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-police-urged-to-embrace-prevention-to-head-off-mass-shootings-attacks-/7824207.html	2024-10-16T04:59:09-07:00	
Impeachment proceedings against Kenyan deputy president are constitutional, court says	NAIROBI — Kenya's senate began impeachment hearings against Kenya's deputy president on Wednesday, hours after a court said the proceedings were constitutional, clearing the way for a vote on his dismissal this week. Kenya's National Assembly voted on Tuesday last week to impeach the deputy president, Rigathi Gachagua, on 11 charges which included corruption, undermining the government and stirring ethnic hatred. Gachagua has denied all charges. Gachagua has said the impeachment motion, backed by opposition lawmakers and allies of President William Ruto, was based on falsehoods that constituted a political lynching, according to court documents seen by Reuters. As the senate opened proceedings on Wednesday, Gachagua denied the 11 charges read out by senate clerk Jeremiah Nyegenye. 'Not guilty,' Gachagua said in response to each one. Gachagua had launched a legal challenge against the impeachment proceedings in the high court, but Judge Erick Ogolla said the process could go ahead. 'At this stage, the process is a lawful, constitutional process, and the Senate will conduct a trial where all the issues being raised before the court will be raised and determined at the moment,' the judge said in court. 'The application at this stage is premature and anticipatory,' he said, referring to Gachagua's legal challenge. The deputy president was Ruto's running mate in their 2022 election win, helping secure vital votes from the populous central Kenya region. But the men have since fallen out and political alliances have shifted. Ruto fired most of his Cabinet and appointed members of the opposition to what he called a unity government after nationwide protests against tax increases in which more than 50 people were killed. During Wednesday's session, members of parliament seeking Gachagua's removal are expected to present their case to the senators. Gachagua is expected to defend himself on Thursday before the vote. A two-thirds majority would be needed to dismiss him. The court also said it would decide on Oct. 29 whether Ruto can nominate a new deputy if Gachagua is dismissed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/impeachment-proceedings-against-kenyan-deputy-president-are-constitutional-court-says/7824186.html	2024-10-16T04:20:59-07:00	
Italy delivers first migrants to Albania under new deal	SHENGJIN, Albania — A ship carrying the first group of migrants to be processed in Albania under a deal with Italy arrived in the port of Shengjin on Wednesday morning, setting in motion Rome's controversial plan to process thousands of asylum seekers abroad. Italy has built two reception centers in Albania, in the first scheme by a European Union nation to divert migrants to a non-E.U. country. The plan aims to deter irregular arrivals to Italy, but has been criticized by rights groups who say it restricts migrants' right to asylum. The Libra, an Italian navy ship, docked at Shengjin, Reuters footage showed. Sixteen migrants were escorted into a newly built processing center at the port, which was ringed by a high metal fence and adorned with Italian and E.U. flags. Rising tension in Europe over migration issues has seen many E.U. nations, including Germany and Poland, propose or adopt tougher policies. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said this week that her country was setting an example for the rest of Europe with the Albanian scheme. A small group of protesters gathered at the port on Wednesday. 'The European dream ends here,' one banner read. 'These immigrants who have done long, dangerous journeys to make it to Europe are now rerouting to Albania so that they will go back to their home countries... It's ending for us [the concept of] Europe as a place of democracy, of values, of human rights,' said Arilda Lleshi, an Albanian human rights activist. The group of migrants taken to Albania comprised 10 Bangladeshis and six Egyptians who were picked up at sea on Sunday aboard boats that had set sail from Libya. After processing in Shengjin, they will be taken inland to the village of Gjader, a 15-minute drive away, where they will be accommodated until their papers are finalized. They will then be sent to Italy if their asylum request is granted, or sent to their home country if rejected. The facilities in Shengjin and Gjader will be staffed by Italian personnel. Under the deal, the total number of migrants present at one time in Albania cannot be more than 3,000. Italy has said only 'non-vulnerable' men coming from countries classified as safe would be sent to Albania, to a limit of 36,000 migrants a year. At present there are 21 such nations on the Italian list. Last year, 56,588 migrants arrived in Italy from just four of them — Bangladesh, Egypt, Ivory Coast and Tunisia. Most abscond from reception centers and head to wealthier northern Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-delivers-first-migrants-to-albania-under-new-deal-/7824147.html	2024-10-16T03:52:41-07:00	
Nigeria fuel tanker explosion kills almost 100	Kano, Nigeria — A fuel tanker explosion in northern Nigeria has killed almost 100 people and left 50 injured, police said on Wednesday. Many of the victims had been trying to collect fuel spilt on the road after the tanker crashed in northern Jigawa state late on Tuesday, police spokesman Lawan Shiisu Adam told AFP. The tanker had veered to avoid colliding with a truck in the town of Majia, he said. 'We have so far confirmed 94 people dead and around 50 injured,' he said, warning the death toll could rise. Following the crash, residents crowded around the vehicle, collecting fuel that had spilt on the road and in drains, Adam said. He said the residents had 'overwhelmed' officers trying to stop them. The Nigerian Medical Association has urged doctors to rush to nearby emergency rooms to help with the influx of patients. Fuel tanker explosions are common in Africa's most populous nation, where roads can be poorly maintained and residents often look to siphon off fuel following accidents. Fuel has become an even more precious commodity as Nigeria suffers its worst economic crisis in a generation. The price of petrol has soared fivefold since President Bola Ahmed Tinubu scrapped subsidies last year, and there are often shortages. Desperation rose further last week after the state oil company hiked prices for the second time in just over a month. Dangerous roads Accidents involving tankers are frequent in the country, with the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) recording 1,531 in 2020, causing 535 deaths. Last month, at least 59 people died when a fuel tanker collided with a truck carrying passengers and cattle in northwestern Niger state. The FRSC said more than 5,000 people died in road accidents in Nigeria in 2023, compared to nearly 6,500 the previous year. But according to the World Health Organization, the figures do not include accidents that are not reported to the authorities. It estimates annual road accident deaths in Nigeria to be closer to 40,000, it said in a report published last year. Deadly fires and explosions also take place across fuel and oil infrastructure in Nigeria, one of the continent's largest crude producers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-fuel-tanker-explosion-kills-almost-100-/7824153.html	2024-10-16T03:52:16-07:00	
Chinese cyber association calls for review of Intel products sold in China	BEIJING — Intel products sold in China should be subject to a security review, the Cybersecurity Association of China (CSAC) said on Wednesday, alleging the U.S. chipmaker has 'constantly harmed' the country's national security and interests. While CSAC is an industry group rather than a government body, it has close ties to the Chinese state and the raft of accusations against Intel, published in a long post on its official WeChat group, could trigger a security review from China's powerful cyberspace regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). 'It is recommended that a network security review is initiated on the products Intel sells in China, so as to effectively safeguard China's national security and the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese consumers,' CSAC said. Last year, the CAC barred domestic operators of key infrastructure from buying products made by U.S. memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc after deeming the company's products had failed its network security review. Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company's shares were down 2.7% in U.S. premarket trading.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-cyber-association-calls-for-review-of-intel-products-sold-in-china-/7824133.html	2024-10-16T03:22:01-07:00	
Saudi cartoonist gets 23-year prison sentence: rights group	Dubai, United Arab Emirates — A Saudi artist has been sentenced to more than two decades in prison over political cartoons that allegedly insulted the Gulf kingdom's leadership, his sister and a rights group said this week. The case against Mohammed al-Hazza, 48, adds to concerns about freedom of expression under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as Saudi Arabia -- the world's largest crude oil exporter -- seeks to open up to tourists and investors after years of isolation. The father of five was arrested in February 2018 in Saudi Arabia during 'a violent raid' in which security forces entered his home and ransacked his studio, the London-based Sanad Human Rights Organization said in a statement. A court document seen by AFP says the charges against him concern 'offensive cartoons' he produced for the Qatari newspaper Lusail as well as social media posts that were allegedly 'hostile' to Saudi Arabia and supportive of Qatar. Hazza's arrest came less than a year after Saudi Arabia and several allies cut ties with Qatar, claiming it supported extremists and was too close to Iran -- allegations that Doha denied. The countries mended ties in January 2021. Saudi Arabia's Specialized Criminal Court, set up in 2008 to deal with terrorism-related cases, initially sentenced Hazza to six years in prison. But this year, as Hazza was preparing to be released, the case was re-opened and he was sentenced to 23 years, his sister Asrar al-Hazza told AFP by phone from the United States. 'He was almost there... He almost left the prison. But then out of nowhere it was opened again and it was 23 years,' she said. Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the case on Wednesday. Sanad said in its statement that Hazza worked for Lusail mostly before the 2017 boycott 'and only briefly afterward' and that most of his cartoons concerned domestic Qatari issues. The group said prosecutors failed to provide evidence of cartoons that were offensive to Saudi Arabia or social media posts that backed Qatar during the boycott. Under Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia has been criticized for what activists describe as a fierce crackdown on even vaguely critical online speech. In the past two years the Saudi judiciary has 'convicted and handed down lengthy prison terms on dozens of individuals for their expression on social media,' human rights groups Amnesty International and ALQST said in April. Saudi officials say the accused committed terrorism-related offences. 'The case of Mohammed al-Hazza is one example of the suppression of freedom of expression in Saudi Arabia, which has not spared anyone, including artists,' Sanad operations manager Samer Alshumrani told AFP. 'This is supported by the politicized, non-independent judiciary in Saudi Arabia.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-cartoonist-gets-23-year-prison-sentence-rights-group/7824085.html	2024-10-16T01:49:35-07:00	
Georgia's leaders stoke fears of Russian war ahead of pivotal election	Tbilisi, Georgia — The Republic of Georgia, which was part of the Soviet Union until independence in 1991, is preparing for a crucial election on October 26 in a vote widely seen as a choice between a future aligned with the West or Russia. The United States and the European Union accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of backsliding on democracy and of tacking closer to Moscow, which party officials deny. Polls suggest Georgian Dream may struggle to win a parliamentary majority and retain power, although it's not clear if opposition parties would be able to form a coalition to oust the government. Fear of conflict With Russia's invasion of Ukraine looming over the election campaign, Georgian Dream has sought to shore up its support by capitalizing on voters' fears of renewed conflict with Moscow. Russian forces still occupy 20% of Georgian territory following their 2008 invasion of the country. Georgian Dream's election posters seek to present a stark choice for voters. On one side, there are photographs of the destruction from Russia's war on Ukraine; on the other, idyllic images of a prosperous Georgia. The captions read: 'No to war! Choose peace.' Georgian Dream accuses its rivals of being part of what it calls the 'global war party.' 'Since the war began, Georgian Dream's rhetoric has been based on the idea that they are the party of peace, while the opposition is the party of war,' said Ghia Nodia, a political analyst at Ilia State University in Tbilisi. 'They claim the opposition would drag the country into war with Russia and that the opposition is, in this sense, an agent of the West, part of the 'global war party.'' 'The fear of war exists in society, largely because of the experience of 2008. And in some ways, this message has been successful. But from my observations, this message has now worn out,' Nodia told VOA. 'Global war party' Opposition parties have expressed disgust at the Georgian Dream campaign. Several of the billboards and TV advertisements feature photographs of alleged Russian atrocities, such as the strike on the Mariupol theater in March 2022, which is thought to have killed several hundred civilians. Kyiv has described the images as 'unacceptable.' Georgian Dream stands by its campaign. 'What we have said is that some individuals — whether politicians, businesspeople, or other actors — might support ongoing wars, including entangling Georgia in war. No leader of Georgian Dream has ever labeled the EU, the U.S., or any Western nation as part of the global war party,' said Nikoloz Samkharadze, a member of Georgian Dream and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in parliament. West vs. Russia To many Georgians — including the country's president, Salome Zourabichvili, a critic of the government — the election presents a choice on Georgia's future path: Align with the West, or with Moscow. 'It's a choice about what kind of country we want to live in. The West represents democracy, while Russia stands for authoritarianism,' said analyst Nodia. Georgian Dream rejects accusations that it is seeking closer relations with Moscow. 'We sponsored multiple United Nations resolutions condemning Russia's aggression [on Ukraine]. We supported Russia's expulsion from the Council of Europe due to the war. We co-sponsored similar resolutions in the OSCE, and we filed a lawsuit at the International Criminal Court on behalf of Ukraine against Russia for war crimes. 'All of this demonstrates Georgia's clear, principled diplomatic and legal stance on Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine,' said Samkharadze. EU future Georgia's aspiration to join the EU is enshrined in the country's constitution. Polls suggest more than 80% of Georgians want to join the bloc. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December last year as part of an effort by Brussels to offer political support to former Soviet states in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But relations have soured fast. Brussels effectively froze membership talks after Georgia reintroduced a so-called foreign agent law in April, which the West says mimics Russian legislation used to clamp down on political opposition, civil society and free media. A violent crackdown on subsequent anti-government protests in Tbilisi prompted the U.S. and EU to impose sanctions on Georgian officials. EU lawmakers accuse the government of pivoting toward Russia and have called for the European Commission to impose sanctions on Georgian Dream's billionaire founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili, along with other party officials. Speaking on Monday, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Georgia's EU accession process was 'de facto halted.' 'The ruling party's recent actions, statements and electoral promises take the country away from the European path and signals a shift towards authoritarianism,' Borrell told reporters following an EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg. Georgian Dream insists EU membership is still on track. 'It's crucial for us to prepare Georgia to become a member of the EU by 2030,' Samkharadze told VOA. 'I think these issues are temporary, and we can find common ground with both the EU and the U.S. on these matters, provided there's mutual will.' Coalition building For the first time, lawmakers will be elected by full proportional representation. Most opposition parties have united under four broad coalition blocs to ensure they exceed the 5% threshold required to avoid disqualification. Polls suggest no single party or bloc will gain a majority amid public distrust of the entire political class. Can the opposition coalesce to oust Georgian Dream? Giga Bokeria, a former secretary of the National Security Council and founder of the new Federalist Party, which is not taking part in the election, believes there is public and political will to force a change of government. 'A significant part of society has legitimate reasons to mistrust the political class, particularly certain representatives. This is a serious problem. But … I believe there are still more than enough arguments to build a consensus around the need to change the government, despite this mistrust,' Bokeria said. Election aftermath According to Ilia State University's Nodia, Georgian Dream stands little chance of winning 'in a free and fair election,' but there are concerns the party may not willingly relinquish power. 'There is still a fear within society that even if Georgian Dream loses, they won't recognize the results and will declare themselves the winners. I think this fear is exaggerated, but we can't say anything for sure,' Nodia said. Georgian Dream insists it will respect democracy. 'We will accept the people's decision, whatever it may be,' said Samkharadze. 'At the same time, I want to emphasize that we are confident the vast majority of Georgians will support Georgian Dream.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-s-leaders-stoke-fears-of-russian-war-ahead-of-pivotal-election-/7824081.html	2024-10-16T01:38:14-07:00	
Grand museum displaying Egypt's ancient treasures opens for trial run	CAIRO — The Grand Egyptian Museum will open 12 halls with exhibits about ancient Egypt in its main galleries starting this week in a trial run ahead of the still-unannounced official opening, officials said Tuesday. The museum, a mega-project near the famed Giza Pyramids which has cost well over $1 billion so far, will open the halls for 4,000 visitors per day starting Wednesday, said Al-Tayeb Abbas, assistant to the minister of antiquities. The museum has been under construction for more than a decade, and an overall opening date has not yet been set, having been repeatedly delayed for various reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Some sections have been open since 2022 for limited tours. More than 100,000 artifacts of Egypt’s ancient treasures will be displayed in the world’s largest archaeological museum, according to the Egyptian state information website. Abbas told the AP that the trial run starting Wednesday would help prepare for the full opening by identifying operational issues, including which parts of the museum might become overcrowded. The displays across the 12 halls tap into issues related to society, religion, and doctrine in ancient Egypt, he added. The open-style halls have been classified by dynasty and historical order and will showcase thousands of artifacts. Eras that will be exhibited in the main galleries include the Third Intermediate Period (about 1070-664 B.C.), Late Period (664-332 B.C.), Graeco-Roman Period (332 B.C.-395 A.D.), New Kingdom (1550-1070 B.C.), Middle Kingdom (2030-1650 B.C.), and Old Kingdom (2649-2130 B.C.). One of the halls displays statues of 'Elite of the King,' members of the royal family and high-ranking officials who worked in the army, priesthood, and the government. Limited tours have been allowed in parts of the site since late 2022 to test visitors’ experience and the museum’s operational preparedness. Aude Porcedde, a Canadian tourist who visited several sections, told the AP she was amazed by the museum, adding that Egyptian civilization is important for her and for the world to know more about. 'There is a lot of history and a lot of things we are not aware of, especially coming from the other side of the world, and seeing everything here and learning from the locals has been great,' said Costa Rican tourist Jorge Licano. The grand staircase, six stories high and with a view of the pyramids, and the commercial area are open to the public, showcasing monuments and artifacts that include sarcophagi and statues. Other parts of the museum, including the King Tutankhamun treasure collection, are set to open at later dates. All halls are equipped with advanced technology and feature multimedia presentations to explain the lives of the ancient Egyptians, including the kings, according to Eissa Zidan, director-general of preliminary restoration and antiquities transfer at the museum. One of the halls will use virtual reality to explain the history of burial and its development throughout ancient Egypt. 'The museum is not only a place to display antiquities, but it also aims to attract children to learn about ancient Egyptian history ... The museum is a gift to all the world,' Zidan told the AP.	https://www.voanews.com/a/grand-museum-displaying-egypt-s-ancient-treasures-opens-for-trial-run/7824076.html	2024-10-16T01:18:16-07:00	
Spiraling Sudan bloodshed sparks refugee surge into Chad	GENEVA — Nearly three million people have fled Sudan after 18 months of war in a still-growing exodus, the U.N. warned, with 25,000 fleeing to neighboring Chad in the first week of October alone. Mamadou Dian Balde, the U.N.'s Sudan regional refugee coordinator, told AFP that the three-million mark will likely be crossed in the next two to three weeks. That the figure is approaching three million is a 'disaster' directly linked to the increasing brutality of the conflict, he said in an interview on Tuesday during a visit to Geneva. War has raged since April 2023 between the Sudanese army under the country's de facto ruler Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. Both sides have been accused of war crimes, including targeting civilians and blocking humanitarian aid. The conflict has left tens of thousands dead and some 26 million people facing severe food insecurity, with famine declared in the Zamzam displacement camp in Sudan's western Darfur region. Some 11.3 million people have been forced to flee, including nearly 2.95 million who have fled across the country's borders, according to the latest figures from UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. Strain on Chad In a sign of the worsening conflict in Darfur, some 25,000 people — 80% of whom were women and children — crossed into eastern Chad in the first week of October, a record number for a single week in 2024. And more than 20,270 crossed into Chad in the whole of September. Chad is host to 681,944 Sudanese refugees — more than any other country. However, it is also one of the poorest countries in the world and is lacking the basic services to accommodate such numbers, said Balde, while highlighting the generosity shown by Chadians towards their fleeing neighbors. 'When we see 25,000 arriving, it's enormous,' he said. He called for greater support from international donors. A UN appeal for $1.51 billion to support Sudanese refugees and their hosts in the region through the end of the year remains just 27% funded. 'It's not enough, because the number of refugees continues to grow,' said Balde, who also serves as the UNHCR's East and Horn of Africa and Great Lakes regional director. Balde said he expected 'very unfortunately, in the coming weeks, to have many more refugees in Chad,' due to both the conflict intensifying in Darfur and the drop in water levels as the rainy season ends. Aid still limited With the drier conditions, the UN hopes to be able to deliver more aid to Sudan — if the parties to the conflict allow it. Several rounds of negotiation efforts have so far failed to end the fighting. In late August, following talks outside Geneva convened by the United States, the two factions committed to ensuring safe and unhindered access for humanitarians along two key corridors. 'This has helped us save lives,' but 'not all the commitments made, have been respected' — and the flow of aid remains 'limited,' said Balde, deploring the persistent 'barriers at the administrative level.' In Geneva this week for the UNHCR's annual executive committee meeting, he chaired a discussion on Sudan, during which he asked for support to help Sudanese refugees get into the jobs market and thereby reducing their reliance on humanitarian assistance. 'We are asking development actors to mobilize to complement' such aid, he explained, while stressing the need for peace in Sudan. Balde warned it would be 'a big mistake' to think the flow of displaced people will be limited to Sudan and the wider region. 'There are more and more who are coming towards Italy, Europe and southern Africa,' and 'there are some who will go towards the Gulf countries too,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spiraling-sudan-bloodshed-sparks-refugee-surge-into-chad/7824072.html	2024-10-16T01:04:35-07:00	
Xi says China willing to be a partner, friend with the US	BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping said a successful partnership between China and the United States is an opportunity for the two countries to be enablers for each other's development rather than an obstacle, according to state media on Wednesday. 'China is willing to be a partner and friend with the United States. This will benefit not only the two countries, but the world,' Xi said in remarks from a letter to the 2024 annual awards dinner of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, according to a CCTV news report. Xi pointed out that China-U.S. relations are among the most important bilateral relations in the world, which have a bearing on the future and destiny of mankind, according to the letter. The two countries have been at odds over national security concerns, ongoing trade spats as well as China's actions in the South China Sea and intensified military drills around Taiwan. Trade relations soured over the past year and have centered around issues including restrictions on electric vehicles and advanced semiconductors. 'China has always handled China-U.S. relations in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and has always believed that the success of China and the United States is an opportunity for each other,' Xi said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/xi-says-china-willing-to-be-a-partner-friend-with-the-us/7824068.html	2024-10-16T00:54:04-07:00	
Former Malaysian PM Mahathir, 99, hospitalized with respiratory infection	Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has been admitted to hospital for a respiratory infection, his office said on Wednesday after media reported the ex-premier missed a court hearing in a defamation case he has lodged. The 99-year-old Mahathir, who served as prime minister for more two decades, has a history of heart problems and has undergone bypass surgeries. He has been in and out of hospital in recent years, and was last hospitalised in July. Mahathir had been due in court on Wednesday for a defamation case he had filed against the current deputy prime minister, but local media reported the hearing was postponed after his lawyer said he had been admitted to the National Heart Institute. An aide of Mahathir told Reuters he was hospitalized on Tuesday evening for coughing due to a lower respiratory tract infection, and would be on medical leave until Oct. 25. Mahathir served as prime minister for 22 years until 2003. He returned as premier in 2018 after leading the opposition coalition to a historic win, but his government collapsed in less than two years due to infighting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-malaysian-pm-mahathir-99-hospitalized-with-respiratory-infection/7824039.html	2024-10-15T23:31:56-07:00	
Israeli airstrikes hit Beirut suburbs	Israeli forces carried out airstrikes Wednesday on Beirut’s southern suburbs, sending plumes of smoke rising from at least two neighborhoods. The Israel Defense Forces said its fighter jets struck a Hezbollah underground weapons warehouse. The attacks followed Israel’s latest evacuation order that warned people to leave areas in Beirut that the Israeli military said were near Hezbollah facilities. Israel also reported more than 50 projectiles were fired from Lebanon Wednesday, while Hezbollah said it launched missiles at an area in northern Israel. The latest Israeli strikes in the area of Lebanon’s capital came a day after the United States said it expressed concerns about such attacks to Israeli officials. 'When it comes to the scope and nature of the bombing campaign that we saw in Beirut over the past few weeks, it's something that we made clear to the government of Israel we had concerns with and we were opposed to,' State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters. Meanwhile, the United States is demanding that Israel boost its humanitarian aid to famished Palestinians in Gaza within the next month or face the possibility that the United States would cut its military aid supporting Israel's year-long war against Hamas militants. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told top Israeli officials in a letter Sunday that Washington has 'deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and seek urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse this trajectory.' Miller said the message was meant to be a private diplomatic communication but confirmed its veracity. For months, even as Israel's fight against Hamas has raged on, the U.S. has repeatedly pressed Israel to ramp up its humanitarian assistance — food, water, medical supplies, fuel and other goods — to Palestinian civilians. But the humanitarian effort has waxed and waned, the effort hampered by the theft of goods by the militants, continued fighting near drop-off sites and disputes over entry points into Gaza. While some left-wing U.S. lawmakers have urged the administration of President Joe Biden to cut off military aid to Israel to pressure it to reach a cease-fire deal to halt fighting, the United States has continued to supply it, most recently on Sunday when Biden said he ordered the Pentagon to send Israel an advanced missile defense system and deploy about 100 U.S. troops to operate it. The new U.S. effort to boost humanitarian aid into Gaza comes as Israel has both ramped up attacks on Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and renewed its assaults on Hamas in northern Gaza. Both Hezbollah and Hamas, designated as terror groups by the U.S., are financially and militarily supported by Iran. At the same time, Israel has ordered about 400,000 Palestinians remaining in the northern third of Gaza to leave the region and move south out of harm's way. But humanitarian aid remains a distinct concern. The U.S. told the U.N. Security Council last week that Israel needs to urgently address 'catastrophic conditions' among Palestinian civilians in the besieged Gaza Strip and stop 'intensifying suffering' by limiting aid deliveries. Blinken and Austin, in the letter to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, listed specific steps Israel must take within 30 days to satisfy the U.S., including enabling a minimum of 350 trucks to enter Gaza each day through four crossings into Gaza and open a fifth entry point, instituting pauses in fighting to allow aid delivery and rescinding evacuation orders to Palestinian civilians when there is no operational need. 'Failure to demonstrate a sustained commitment to implementing and maintaining these measures may have implications for U.S. policy ... and relevant U.S. law,' the letter said. The Blinken-Austin letter cited the U.S. Foreign Assistance Act, which prohibits military aid to countries that impede delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance. It also cited Biden's National Security Memorandum issued in February that requires the State Department to report to Congress on whether it finds Israel's assurances credible that its use of U.S. weapons does not violate U.S. or international law. U.S. officials earlier this year said Israel may have violated international humanitarian law using U.S.-supplied weapons during its military operation in Gaza. Over several months, the amount of humanitarian aid being dispatched into Gaza has dropped more than 50%, and the quantity delivered in September 'was the lowest of any month during the past year,' Blinken and Austin said. The Hamas attack on Israel a year ago killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,300 Palestinians, with more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas fighters. Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., U.K, EU and others.

EU AI Act checker reveals Big Tech's compliance pitfalls	LONDON — Some of the most prominent artificial intelligence models are falling short of European regulations in key areas such as cybersecurity resilience and discriminatory output, according to data seen by Reuters. The EU had long debated new AI regulations before OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public in late 2022. The record-breaking popularity and ensuing public debate over the supposed existential risks of such models spurred lawmakers to draw up specific rules around 'general-purpose' AIs. Now a new tool designed by Swiss startup LatticeFlow and partners, and supported by European Union officials, has tested generative AI models developed by big tech companies like Meta and OpenAI across dozens of categories in line with the bloc's wide-sweeping AI Act, which is coming into effect in stages over the next two years. Awarding each model a score between 0 and 1, a leaderboard published by LatticeFlow on Wednesday showed models developed by Alibaba, Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Mistral all received average scores of 0.75 or above. However, the company's 'Large Language Model (LLM) Checker' uncovered some models' shortcomings in key areas, spotlighting where companies may need to divert resources in order to ensure compliance. Companies failing to comply with the AI Act will face fines of $38 million or 7% of global annual turnover. Mixed results At present, the EU is still trying to establish how the AI Act's rules around generative AI tools like ChatGPT will be enforced, convening experts to craft a code of practice governing the technology by spring 2025. But LatticeFlow's test, developed in collaboration with researchers at Swiss university ETH Zurich and Bulgarian research institute INSAIT, offers an early indicator of specific areas where tech companies risk falling short of the law. For example, discriminatory output has been a persistent issue in the development of generative AI models, reflecting human biases around gender, race and other areas when prompted. When testing for discriminatory output, LatticeFlow's LLM Checker gave OpenAI's 'GPT-3.5 Turbo' a relatively low score of 0.46. For the same category, Alibaba Cloud's 9988.HK 'Qwen1.5 72B Chat' model received only a 0.37. Testing for 'prompt hijacking,' a type of cyberattack in which hackers disguise a malicious prompt as legitimate to extract sensitive information, the LLM Checker awarded Meta's 'Llama 2 13B Chat' model a score of 0.42. In the same category, French startup Mistral's '8x7B Instruct' model received 0.38. 'Claude 3 Opus,' a model developed by Google-backed Anthropic, received the highest average score, 0.89. The test was designed in line with the text of the AI Act, and will be extended to encompass further enforcement measures as they are introduced. LatticeFlow said the LLM Checker would be freely available for developers to test their models' compliance online. Petar Tsankov, the firm's CEO and cofounder, told Reuters the test results were positive overall and offered companies a roadmap for them to fine-tune their models in line with the AI Act. 'The EU is still working out all the compliance benchmarks, but we can already see some gaps in the models,' he said. 'With a greater focus on optimizing for compliance, we believe model providers can be well-prepared to meet regulatory requirements.' Meta declined to comment. Alibaba, Anthropic, Mistral, and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. While the European Commission cannot verify external tools, the body has been informed throughout the LLM Checker's development and described it as a 'first step' in putting the new laws into action. A spokesperson for the European Commission said: 'The Commission welcomes this study and AI model evaluation platform as a first step in translating the EU AI Act into technical requirements.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-ai-act-checker-reveals-big-tech-s-compliance-pitfalls/7824029.html	2024-10-15T22:58:41-07:00	
Ukraine destroys 51 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Wednesday it shot down 51 drones that Russia used to target the country in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Ternopil and Zhytomyr regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said air raid alerts lasted for two hours in the Ukrainian capital, but that air defenses destroyed all of the drones that targeted the area. There were no reports of damage or casualties, Popko said on Telegram. Russia also fired two missiles as part of its attack. Russia’s Defense Ministry reported Wednesday that its air defenses destroyed two Ukrainian aerial drones over the Belgorod region and another drone over Voronezh.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-destroys-51-russian-drones/7824025.html	2024-10-15T22:38:14-07:00	
Age of electricity' to follow looming fossil fuel peak, IEA says	LONDON — The world is on the brink of a new age of electricity with fossil fuel demand set to peak by the end of the decade, meaning surplus oil and gas supplies could drive investment into green energy, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday. But it also flagged a high level of uncertainty as conflicts embroil the oil and gas-producing Middle East and Russia and as countries representing half of global energy demand have elections in 2024. 'In the second half of this decade, the prospect of more ample – or even surplus – supplies of oil and natural gas, depending on how geopolitical tensions evolve, would move us into a very different energy world,' IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a release alongside its annual report. Surplus fossil fuel supplies would likely lead to lower prices and could enable countries to dedicate more resources to clean energy, moving the world into an 'age of electricity,' Birol said. In the nearer term, there is also the possibility of reduced supplies should the Middle East conflict disrupt oil flows. The IEA said such conflicts highlighted the strain on the energy system and the need for investment to speed up the transition to 'cleaner and more secure technologies.' A record-high level of clean energy came online globally last year, the IEA said, including more than 560 gigawatts (GW) of renewable power capacity. Around $2 trillion is expected to be invested in clean energy in 2024, almost double the amount invested in fossil fuels. In its scenario based on current government policies, global oil demand peaks before 2030 at just less than 102 million barrels/day (mb/d), and then falls back to 2023 levels of 99 mb/d by 2035, largely because of lower demand from the transport sector as electric vehicle use increases. The report also lays out the likely impact on future oil prices if stricter environmental policies are implemented globally to combat climate change. In the IEA’s current policies scenario, oil prices decline to $75 per barrel in 2050 from $82 per barrel in 2023. That compares to $25 per barrel in 2050 should government actions fall in line with the goal of cutting energy sector emissions to net zero by then. Although the report forecasts an increase in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) of 145 billion cubic meters (bcm) between 2023 and 2030, it said this would be outpaced by an increase in export capacity of around 270 bcm over the same period. 'The overhang in LNG capacity looks set to create a very competitive market at least until this is worked off, with prices in key importing regions averaging $6.5-8 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) to 2035,' the report said. Asian LNG prices, regarded as an international benchmark are currently around $13 mmBtu.	https://www.voanews.com/a/age-of-electricity-to-follow-looming-fossil-fuel-peak-iea-says/7824017.html	2024-10-15T21:57:39-07:00	
China says it will not renounce use of force over Taiwan	BEIJING/TAIPEI — China will not promise to renounce the use of force over Taiwan but this is aimed at external interference and a small minority of separatists, China's Taiwan Affairs Office said on Wednesday following the country's latest war games around the island. China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, staged a day of large-scale drills around the island on Monday it said were a warning to 'separatist acts' following last week's national day speech by Taiwan President Lai Ching-te. 'We are willing to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the utmost sincerity and endeavor,' Chen Binhua, spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, told a regular press briefing in Beijing. 'But we will never commit ourselves to renouncing the use of force,' he said. That is, however, aimed at the interference of 'external forces' - a reference to the United States and its allies - and the very small number of Taiwan separatists not the vast majority of Taiwan's people, Chen said. Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future. Speaking to reporters in Taipei earlier on Wednesday, Taiwan National Security Bureau Director-General Tsai Ming-yen said China's drills had backfired given the international condemnation they generated, especially from Washington. 'The Chinese communists' military exercise has created a negative effect in that it made the international community more supportive of Taiwan,' he said. Lai, in his Oct. 10 speech, said China has no right to represent Taiwan, but the island was willing to work with Beijing to combat challenges like climate change, striking both a firm and a conciliatory tone which Taiwan officials said was a show of goodwill towards Beijing. Chen, the Chinese spokesperson, said Lai had stuck to his 'stubborn separatist position.' 'There was no goodwill to speak of,' he added. Lai has repeatedly offered talks with China but been rebuffed. China's military on Monday held open the possibility of more drills around Taiwan depending on the level of 'provocation.' Tsai said the government remained on alert for further military actions. 'We cannot rule out any possibilities,' he added. China has over the past five years sent warships and warplanes in the waters and skies around Taiwan on an almost daily basis. On Wednesday morning, in its daily update of Chinese activities in the previous 24 hours, Taiwan's defense ministry said it had detected 22 Chinese military aircraft and five navy ships.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-will-not-renounce-use-of-force-over-taiwan/7824008.html	2024-10-15T21:15:23-07:00	
Georgia judge blocks ballot counting rule and says county officials must certify election results	ATLANTA — A judge has blocked a new rule that requires Georgia Election Day ballots to be counted by hand after the close of voting. The ruling came a day after the same judge ruled that county election officials must certify election results by the deadline set in law. The State Election Board last month passed the rule requiring that three poll workers each count the paper ballots — not votes — by hand after the polls close. The county election board in Cobb County, in Atlanta’s suburbs, had filed a lawsuit seeking to have a judge declare that rule and five others recently passed by the state board invalid, saying they exceed the state board’s authority, weren’t adopted in compliance with the law and are unreasonable. In a ruling late Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote, that the so-called hand count rule 'is too much, too late' and blocked its enforcement while he considers the merits of the case. McBurney on Monday had ruled in a separate case that 'no election superintendent (or member of a board of elections and registration) may refuse to certify or abstain from certifying election results under any circumstance.' While they are entitled to inspect the conduct of an election and to review related documents, he wrote, 'any delay in receiving such information is not a basis for refusing to certify the election results or abstaining from doing so.' Georgia law says county election superintendents — generally multimember boards — 'shall' certify election results by 5 p.m. on the Monday after an election, or the Tuesday if Monday is a holiday as it is this year. The two rulings came as early in-person voting began Tuesday in Georgia. They are victories for Democrats, liberal voting rights groups and some legal experts who have raised concerns that Donald Trump’s allies could refuse to certify the results if the former president loses to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in next month’s presidential election. They have also argued that new rules enacted by the Trump-endorsed majority on the State Election Board could be used to stop or delay certification and to undermine public confidence in the results. In blocking the hand count rule, McBurney noted that there are no guidelines or training tools for its implementation and that the secretary of state had said the rule was passed too late for his office to provide meaningful training or support. The judge also wrote that no allowances have been made in county election budgets to provide for additional personnel or expenses associated with the rule. 'The administrative chaos that will — not may — ensue is entirely inconsistent with the obligations of our boards of elections (and the SEB) to ensure that our elections are fair legal, and orderly,' he wrote. The state board may be right that the rule is smart policy, McBurney wrote, but the timing of its passage makes implementing it now 'quite wrong.' He invoked the memory of the riot at the U.S. Capitol by people seeking to stop the certification of Democrat Joe Biden's presidential victory on Jan. 6, 2021, writing, 'Anything that adds uncertainty and disorder to the electoral process disserves the public.' During a hearing earlier Tuesday, Robert Thomas, a lawyer for the State Election Board, argued that the process isn’t complicated and that estimates show that it would take extra minutes, not hours, to complete. He also said memory cards from the scanners, which are used to tally the votes, could be sent to the tabulation center while the hand count is happening so reporting of results wouldn’t be delayed. State and national Democratic groups that had joined the suit on the side of the Cobb election board, along with the Harris campaign, celebrated McBurney's ruling in a joint statement: 'From the beginning, this rule was an effort to delay election results to sow doubt in the outcome, and our democracy is stronger thanks to this decision to block it.' The certification ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Julie Adams, a Republican member of the election board in Fulton County, which includes most of the city of Atlanta and is a Democratic stronghold. Adams sought a declaration that her duties as an election board member were discretionary and that she is entitled to 'full access' to 'election materials.' Long an administrative task that attracted little attention, certification of election results has become politicized since Trump tried to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 general election. Republicans in several swing states, including Adams, refused to certify results earlier this year and some have sued to keep from being forced to sign off on election results. Adams' suit, backed by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute, argued county election board members have the discretion to reject certification. In court earlier this month, her lawyers also argued county election officials could certify results without including certain ballots if they suspect problems. Judge McBurney wrote that nothing in Georgia law gives county election officials the authority to determine that fraud has occurred or what should be done about it. Instead, he wrote, state law says a county election official's 'concerns about fraud or systemic error are to be noted and shared with the appropriate authorities but they are not a basis for a superintendent to decline to certify.' The Democratic National Committee and Democratic Party of Georgia had joined the lawsuit as defendants with the support of Harris' campaign. The campaign called the ruling a 'major legal win.' Adams said in a statement that McBurney's ruling has made it clear that she and other county election officials 'cannot be barred from access to elections in their counties.' A flurry of election rules passed by the State Election Board since August has generated a crush of lawsuits. McBurney earlier this month heard a challenge to two rules having to do with certification brought by the state and national Democratic parties. Another Fulton County judge is set to hear arguments in two challenges to rules tomorrow — one brought by the Democratic groups and another filed by a group headed by a former Republican lawmaker. And separate challenges are also pending in at least two other counties.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-judge-blocks-ballot-counting-rule-and-says-county-officials-must-certify-election-results/7824005.html	2024-10-15T21:07:05-07:00	
North Korea says 1.4 million young people apply to join army	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean state media said on Wednesday around 1.4 million young people had applied to join or return to the army this week, accusing Seoul of a provocative drone incursion that had brought the 'tense situation to the brink of war.' The young people, including students and youth league officials who had signed petitions to join the army, were determined to fight in a 'sacred war of destroying the enemy with the arms of the revolution,' the KCNA report said. Photographs published by KCNA showed what it said were young people signing petitions at an undisclosed location. North Korea's claim of having more than one million young people volunteering to enlist in the country's Korean People's Army in just two days comes at a time when tensions on the Korean peninsula are running high. North Korea has made similar claims in the past when there have been heightened tensions in the region. Last year, state media reported on 800,000 of its citizens volunteering to join the North's military to fight against the United States. In 2017, nearly 3.5 million workers, party members and soldiers volunteered to join or rejoin its army, the reclusive state's state media said at that time. It is very difficult to verify the North's claims. According to data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), North Korea has 1.28 million active soldiers and about 600,000 reservists. The IISS also said it had 5.7 million Worker/Peasant Red Guard reservists with many units unarmed. In the latest sign of the growing tensions, North Korea blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border between the two Koreas on Tuesday, prompting South Korea's military to fire warning shots. Pyongyang had said last week it would cut off the inter-Korean roads and railways entirely and further fortify the areas on its side of the border as part of its push for a 'two-state' system, scrapping its longstanding goal of unification. The two Koreas are still technically at war after their 1950-53 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. North Korea has also accused Seoul of sending drones over its capital and the two Koreas have clashed over balloons of trash floated since May from North Korea. Pyongyang has said the launches are a response to balloons sent by anti-regime activists in the South. South Korea's government has declined to say whether its military or civilians had flown the alleged drones over Pyongyang. 'If a war breaks out, the ROK will be wiped off the map. As it wants a war, we are willing to put an end to its existence,' the KCNA report said, referring to the South's official name the Republic of Korea. South Korea's defense ministry warned on Sunday 'if North Korea inflicts harm on the safety of our people, that day will be the end of the North Korean regime,' Yonhap news agency reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-says-1-4-million-young-people-apply-to-join-army/7824002.html	2024-10-15T20:56:50-07:00	
Troops kicked out under 'don't ask, don't tell' upgraded to honorable discharges	WASHINGTON — The Pentagon announced Tuesday that more than 800 military personnel have seen their service records upgraded to honorable discharges after previously being kicked out of the military under its former 'don't ask, don't tell' policy. It is the latest development over the decades to undo past discrimination against LGBTQ service members. The 1951 Uniform Code of Military Justice's Article 125 had criminalized consensual gay sex. In 1993, former President Bill Clinton modified the military's policy to 'don't ask, don't tell,' which allowed LGBTQ troops to serve in the armed forces if they did not disclose their sexual orientation. That policy was repealed in 2011, when Congress allowed for their open service in the military. The 1951 UCMJ code was modified in 2013 to be limited to nonconsensual gay sex. President Joe Biden in June announced he was issuing pardons to service members convicted under repealed military policies. Under 'don't ask, don't tell,' thousands of service members still saw their military service ended without an honorable discharge, meaning they did not receive the military benefits they would have otherwise, such as education benefits, and it also could have affected their ability to apply for jobs or loans. Last year, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered a review of cases of former service members who might have been affected by the policy. The Pentagon estimates about 13,500 service members were released from military service under 'don't ask, don't tell.' With the review and upgrades of the more than 800 troops announced Tuesday, the Pentagon said that about 96% of the 13,500 personnel affected by the policy had received an honorable discharge. Not every case of the 13,500 needed review. Some of those personnel did not serve long enough to qualify for benefits, were released with an honorable discharge at the time, already had their discharges upgraded through other means, or did not qualify for an upgrade due to other violations. 'We will continue to honor the service and the sacrifice of all our troops — including the brave Americans who raised their hands to serve but were turned away because of whom they love. We will continue to strive to do right by every American patriot who has honorably served their country,' Austin said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/troops-kicked-out-under-don-t-ask-don-t-tell-upgraded-to-honorable-discharges/7823990.html	2024-10-15T19:43:32-07:00	
Voting rights groups seek investigation into Wisconsin text messages	madison, wisconsin — Voting rights advocates on Tuesday asked state and federal authorities to investigate anonymous text messages apparently targeting young Wisconsin voters, warning them not to vote in a state where they are ineligible. Free Speech for People, on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin, made the request to the U.S. Department of Justice as well as the Wisconsin Department of Justice. The letter says that 'thousands of young voters across Wisconsin' received the text message last week, including staff members at the League of Women Voters and students at the University of Wisconsin. The text in question cites Wisconsin state law prohibiting voting in more than one place and says that violating the law can result in fines of up to $10,000 and 3.5 years in prison. 'Don't vote in a state where you're not eligible,' the text said. Wisconsin is known for having razor-thin presidential elections. Four of the last six were decided by less than a percentage point. President Joe Biden won in 2020 by less than 21,000 votes. At least one person who received the text posted it on the social media platform X. The League of Women Voters, in its request for investigation, said that without prompt action 'the sender may continue its efforts to frighten eligible young voters into not voting.' Students attending college in Wisconsin can register to vote either at their home address or their one at school. 'But now, many students and other young voters are fearful that they will face criminal prosecution if they register and exercise their right to vote — because of a malicious, inaccurate text sent by an anonymous party,' the letter said. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment. Wisconsin Department of Justice spokesperson Gillian Drummond said the department takes allegations of potential violations of election law seriously. She said the agency was reviewing the information in the request for an investigation and would assess 'what, if any, follow-up is appropriate based on the facts and the law.' University of Wisconsin System spokesperson Mark Pitsch said in an email that system officials were unaware of any security breach that may have resulted in leaked student contact information. He added that nothing has been reported to system officials about the text, and there was no indication how many students may have received it. Riley Vetterkind, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said in an email to The Associated Press that the commission can't determine whether the text message violates state law because the commission hasn't received a formal complaint about it. However, he called the message 'concerning' and said it certainly could leave recipients feeling intimidated. He urged recipients to contact law enforcement directly if they are worried about the message. 'We understand that these third-party text messages can be very frustrating for voters,' Vetterkind said. 'We recommend voters rely upon official sources of election information, such as from state or local election officials. Voters are free to ignore these text messages since they are not sent or associated with an official source.' The text message was sent as thousands of voters in Wisconsin are casting absentee ballots. As of Monday, nearly 240,000 absentee ballots had already been returned statewide. Starting October 22, voters can start casting absentee ballots in person. Wisconsin is one of the 'blue wall' states along with Michigan and Pennsylvania that is key to winning for either Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris or Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voting-rights-groups-seek-investigation-into-wisconsin-text-messages-/7823623.html	2024-10-15T19:10:42-07:00	
Tech firms increasingly look to nuclear power for data center	As energy-hungry computer data centers and artificial intelligence programs place ever greater demands on the U.S. power grid, tech companies are looking to a technology that just a few years ago appeared ready to be phased out: nuclear energy. After several decades in which investment in new nuclear facilities in the U.S. had slowed to a crawl, tech giants Microsoft and Google have recently announced investments in the technology, aimed at securing a reliable source of emissions-free power for years into the future. Earlier this year, online retailer Amazon, which has an expansive cloud computing business, announced it had reached an agreement to purchase a nuclear energy-fueled data center in Pennsylvania and that it had plans to buy more in the future. However, the three companies' strategies rely on somewhat different approaches to the problem of harnessing nuclear energy, and it remains unclear which, if any, will be successful. Energy demand Data centers, which concentrate thousands of powerful computers in one location, consume prodigious amounts of power, both to run the computers themselves and to operate the elaborate systems put in place to dissipate the large amount of heat they generate. A recent study by Goldman Sachs estimated that data centers currently consume between 1% and 2% of all available power generation. That percentage is expected to at least double by the end of the decade, even accounting for new power sources coming online. The study projected a 160% increase in data center power consumption by 2030. The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that the largest data centers can consume more than 100 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power about 80,000 homes. Small, modular reactors Google's plan is, in some ways, the most radical departure — both from the current structure of the energy grid and from traditional means of generating nuclear power. The internet search giant announced on Monday that it has partnered with Kairos Power to fund the construction of up to seven small-scale nuclear reactors that, across several locations, would combine to generate 500 megawatts of power. The small modular reactors (SMRs) are a new, and largely untested, technology. Unlike sprawling nuclear plants, SMRs are compact, requiring much less infrastructure to keep them operational and safe. 'The smaller size and modular design can reduce construction timelines, allow deployment in more places, and make the final project delivery more predictable,' Google and Kairos said in a press release. The companies said they intend to have the first of the SMRs online by 2030, with the rest to follow by 2035. Great promise Sola Talabi, president of Pittsburgh Technical, a nuclear consulting firm, told VOA that SMR technology holds great promise for the future. He said that the plants' small size will eliminate many of the safety concerns that larger reactors present. For example, some smaller reactors generate so much less heat than larger reactors that they can utilize 'passive' cooling systems that are not susceptible to the kind of mechanical failures that caused disaster at Japan's Fukushima plant in 2011 and the Soviet Union's Chernobyl plant in 1986. Talabi, who is also an adjunct faculty member in nuclear engineering at the University of Pittsburgh and University of Michigan, said that SMRs' modular nature will allow for rapid deployment and substantial cost savings as time goes on. 'Pretty much every reactor that has been built [so far] has been built like it's the first one,' he said. 'But with these reactors, because we will be able to use the same processes, the same facilities, to produce them, we actually expect that we will be able to … achieve deployment scale relatively quickly.' Raising doubts Not all experts are convinced that SMRs are going to live up to expectations. Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety for the Union of Concerned Scientists, told VOA that the Kairos reactors Google is hoping to install use a new technology that has never been tested under real-world conditions. 'At this point, it's just hope without any real basis in experimental fact to believe that this is going to be a productive and reliable solution for the need to power data centers over the medium term,' he said. He pointed out that the large-scale deployment of new nuclear reactors will also result in the creation of a new source of nuclear waste, which the U.S. is still struggling to find a way to dispose of at scale. 'I think what we're seeing is really a bubble — a nuclear bubble — which I suspect is going to be deflated once these optimistic, hopeful agreements turn out to be much harder to execute,' Lyman said. Three Mile Island Microsoft and Amazon have plotted a more conventional path toward powering their data centers with nuclear energy. In its announcement last month, Microsoft revealed that it has reached an agreement with Constellation Energy to restart a mothballed nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and to use the power it produces for its data operations. Three Mile Island is best known as the site of the worst nuclear disaster in U.S. history. In 1979, the site's Unit 2 reactor suffered a malfunction that resulted in radioactive gases and iodine being released into the local environment. However, the facility's Unit 1 reactor did not fail, and it operated safely for several decades. It was shut down in 2019, after cheap shale gas drove the price of energy down so far that it made further operations economically unfeasible. It is expected to cost $1.6 billion to bring the reactor back online, and Microsoft has agreed to fund that investment. It has also signed an agreement to purchase power from the facility for 20 years. The companies say they believe that they can bring the facility back online by 2028. Amazon's plan, by contrast, does not require either new technology or the resurrection of an older nuclear facility. The data center that the company purchased from Talen Energy is located on the same site as the fully operational Susquehanna nuclear plant in Salem, Pennsylvania, and draws power directly from it. Amazon characterized the $650 million investment as part of a larger effort to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tech-firms-increasingly-look-to-nuclear-power-for-data-center/7823925.html	2024-10-15T19:08:59-07:00

South Korea steps up commitment to South China Sea, with limits	washington — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's tour of Southeast Asian countries shows Seoul has stepped up the country's role in supporting regional security, but there are limits to what it can do to help them push back against China's growing aggression, analysts say. Yoon made several pledges to support regional security during visits to the Philippines, Singapore and Laos, where he attended the closing ceremony of the ASEAN summit on Thursday. He promised South Korea's help in modernizing the Philippine military, agreed to South Korea's active participation in multilateral drills with ASEAN countries, and upgraded ties with ASEAN to a comprehensive strategic partnership. Yoon also affirmed the importance of maritime security and promoting freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea. The pledges are seen by analysts as part of Yoon's plan to make South Korea a pivotal global state by demonstrating a greater commitment to the defense of a rules-based world order. Pivotal state A South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson told VOA Korean on Tuesday that steps taken by Yoon during the trip reflect the country's 'willingness to strengthen cooperation with ASEAN countries across the board,' including 'bolstering cooperation on the defense sector.' The spokesperson added that South Korea will continue to help maintain maritime security based on the rules-based order in the South China Sea as it builds trust and enhances strategic communications with China. China claims most of the South China Sea as its sovereign maritime territory, and its vessels have repeatedly engaged dangerous maneuvers against the vessels of countries — such as the Philippines — that dispute that claim. South Korea 'can play a niche role in contributing towards the defense capabilities of regional countries to protect their maritime domain against China's intrusions,' said Rahman Yaacob, research fellow in the Southeast Asia program at the Lowy Institute. 'South Korean weapons systems are cheaper than those of the U.S. and are being used by some NATO countries,' Yaacob said. 'Therefore, Seoul could be an important arms supplier to regional countries' as an alternative to U.S. weapons.' In a joint press conference with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. after their meeting on October 7, Yoon said Seoul will support Manila's military modernization plan. The Philippines is seeking to procure advanced fighter jets, submarines and missiles in its third phase of a five-year modernization plan that began in 2023. South Korea has sold FA-50 fighter jets, anti-ship cruise missiles, frigates and corvettes to the Philippines in the past decade. South Korea is also expected to deliver FA-50 fighter jets to Malaysia in 2026 after a deal was signed last year. Facing hurdles While these efforts are noteworthy, analysts say they are not enough to push back against China's growing military might. South Korea 'is unlikely to play an operationally or strategically meaningful role on the South China Sea beyond the occasional coordinated joint maritime cooperative activities,' said Evan Laksmana, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. South Korea has participated in multilateral military drills with Southeast Asian countries, such as the annual U.S.-led Cobra Gold held in Thailand in March and the Southeast Asia Cooperation and Training exercises held in Singapore and other participating countries in August. In delivering the 47th Singapore Lecture on October 9, Yoon said South Korea will actively participate in multilateral drills with ASEAN countries as it expands engagement with China to seek common interests based on a rules-based international order. 'Yoon has been more willing to increase South Korea's support for regional security' than his predecessor Moon Jae-in, 'but he has also recognized the need for restraint in calling out China directly,' said Terence Roehrig, professor of national security affairs and a Korea expert at the U.S. Naval War College. 'South Korea can help along the margins,' but 'offsetting China's strength is near impossible' in the region, Roehrig said. VOA contacted the Chinese Embassy in Washington for its comments on South Korea's efforts to increase security cooperation with ASEAN countries and was referred to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, which has not yet replied. China and Russia on Friday blocked a joint declaration issued at the East Asian Summit in Laos, according to Reuters, citing an unnamed U.S. official. The participating countries comprised the 10 ASEAN countries and eight partners, including China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States. Beijing and Moscow objected to a clause that says the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 'sets out the legal framework' for carrying out all maritime activities. A U.N. tribunal ruled in 2016 that China was in violation by operating within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, a maritime area that extends 200 nautical miles beyond a nation's territorial sea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-steps-up-commitment-to-south-china-sea-with-limits-/7823614.html	2024-10-15T17:17:08-07:00	
British foreign secretary expected to visit Beijing, Shanghai	LONDON — British Foreign Secretary David Lammy is expected to visit Beijing and Shanghai, the highest-level trip to China since the Labour government came to power. Analysts say they will be watching the trip for signs of a possible reset in U.K.-China relations, which have been fraught in recent years. Reuters reported last week that Lammy is expected to meet with Chinese officials in Beijing and representatives of British companies in Shanghai. According to sources familiar with the matter, the trip will last two days. The U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson told VOA that the secretary's travel plans have not been publicly announced. At the same time, sources told Sky News that U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves is considering a visit to China to resume an economic and financial dialogue that was interrupted in 2019. During this year's parliamentary election campaign, the Labour Party promised to conduct a comprehensive audit of U.K.-China relations to develop a 'long-term strategic approach' to the relationship. In August, during a phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that despite the differences, there was a need to have frank exchanges while promoting closer economic ties and global cooperation. Over the past decade, ties between the U.K. and China have been on a roller coaster. In 2015, then-Prime Minister David Cameron declared a 'golden age' in U.K.-China relations. However, by 2020, Boris Johnson's government was clashing with Beijing over issues such as the Hong Kong National Security Law and the coronavirus pandemic as well as the exclusion of Huawei from Britain's 5G network construction. James Jennion, an associate fellow of the British Foreign Policy Group and co-founder of the Labour Campaign for Human Rights, told VOA that he thinks the visit will focus mainly on cooperative aspects of the relationship. 'It's been made clear this visit is intended as a 'reset' of our relations with Beijing, so trade and investment will be front and center,' Jennion said. He also said cooperation cannot come at the cost of U.K. values and human rights responsibilities. 'Human rights issues, if discussed, will likely cover 'third-party' issues like the Middle East and Ukraine, where possible joint solutions will be discussed. Given the nature and purpose of the trip,' he added. 'I would be very surprised if controversial [to China] issues like Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Taiwan are mentioned, as these have been the major friction points in previous years.' Observers say the business community generally wants to improve economic and trade relations with China, especially in the post-Brexit era, and note that Britain needs to open new markets. Human rights groups, however, have called for the U.K. not to compromise on human rights and national security. Megan Khoo, a policy adviser for Hong Kong Watch, a human rights NGO based in London, told VOA the group 'hopes that the Foreign Secretary uses his bilateral meetings to draw attention to the declining human rights situation in Hong Kong. This is especially important following the passage of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance and the recent sentencing of two former Stand News editors under colonial-era sedition laws.' Khoo said Lammy should make it clear that Britain remains committed to the observance of human rights in Hong Kong, given its historical commitments to the city. 'The Foreign Secretary should also signal that the U.K. takes seriously its duty to protect the more than 150,000 Hong Kongers who are now living in the U.K. and wish to remain free from political repression,' she said. Luke De Pulford, executive director for the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, said Beijing will test Lammy's resolve. 'Let's see if he measures up and sticks with his clear commitments he made to persecuted Uyghurs while in opposition,' De Pulford said, adding that he is not encouraged by the early signs. 'Lammy has an opportunity to show strength in defense of U.K. values, which are core to the national interest,' he said. China's recent military exercises around Taiwan could also be a topic of discussion. As an ally of the U.S., the U.K. has been concerned about the security situation in the Indo-Pacific region.

Voting rights groups seek investigation into Wisconsin text messages	madison, wisconsin — Voting rights advocates on Tuesday asked state and federal authorities to investigate anonymous text messages apparently targeting young Wisconsin voters, warning them not to vote in a state where they are ineligible. Free Speech for People, on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin, made the request to the U.S. Department of Justice as well as the Wisconsin Department of Justice. The letter says that 'thousands of young voters across Wisconsin' received the text message last week, including staff members at the League of Women Voters and students at the University of Wisconsin. The text in question cites Wisconsin state law prohibiting voting in more than one place and says that violating the law can result in fines of up to $10,000 and 3.5 years in prison. 'Don't vote in a state where you're not eligible,' the text said. Wisconsin is known for having razor-thin presidential elections. Four of the last six were decided by less than a percentage point. President Joe Biden won in 2020 by less than 21,000 votes. At least one person who received the text posted it on the social media platform X. The League of Women Voters, in its request for investigation, said that without prompt action 'the sender may continue its efforts to frighten eligible young voters into not voting.' Students attending college in Wisconsin can register to vote either at their home address or their one at school. 'But now, many students and other young voters are fearful that they will face criminal prosecution if they register and exercise their right to vote — because of a malicious, inaccurate text sent by an anonymous party,' the letter said. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment. Wisconsin Department of Justice spokesperson Gillian Drummond said the department takes allegations of potential violations of election law seriously. She said the agency was reviewing the information in the request for an investigation and would assess 'what, if any, follow-up is appropriate based on the facts and the law.' University of Wisconsin System spokesperson Mark Pitsch said in an email that system officials were unaware of any security breach that may have resulted in leaked student contact information. He added that nothing has been reported to system officials about the text, and there was no indication how many students may have received it. Riley Vetterkind, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said in an email to The Associated Press that the commission can't determine whether the text message violates state law because the commission hasn't received a formal complaint about it. However, he called the message 'concerning' and said it certainly could leave recipients feeling intimidated. He urged recipients to contact law enforcement directly if they are worried about the message. 'We understand that these third-party text messages can be very frustrating for voters,' Vetterkind said. 'We recommend voters rely upon official sources of election information, such as from state or local election officials. Voters are free to ignore these text messages since they are not sent or associated with an official source.' The text message was sent as thousands of voters in Wisconsin are casting absentee ballots. As of Monday, nearly 240,000 absentee ballots had already been returned statewide. Starting October 22, voters can start casting absentee ballots in person. Wisconsin is one of the 'blue wall' states along with Michigan and Pennsylvania that is key to winning for either Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris or Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7823623.html	2024-10-15T16:27:13-07:00	
Libya threatens legal action after Nigeria pulls out of football qualifier	Abuja, Nigeria — The Libyan Football Federation (LFF) is criticizing Nigeria's decision to withdraw from the 2025 AFCON qualifier in Libya and is threatening to take legal action. On Monday, Nigeria's national football team the Super Eagles walked off the fixture citing safety concerns after being stranded at a local airport in Libya without food and internet access for more than 16 hours. Tuesday's statement by the LFF accused its Nigerian counterpart, the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) of not cooperating with local organizers. LFF said the flight diversion was possibly caused by routine aircraft protocols, security checks or logistical problems beyond their control, adding that Libyan players faced similar challenges in last week's reverse fixture in Nigeria. LFF said it will 'take all legal measures to preserve the interests of the Libyan national football team.' The Nigerian Super Eagles had been scheduled to take on the Mediterranean Knights of Libya on Tuesday to seal their qualification for the 2025 AFCON finals in Morocco. However, the Nigerian men's team pulled out of its Confederation of African Football, or CAF, qualifier in Libya and returned home in protest at being abandoned at an airport after their plane was diverted. The NFF said the team was taken to Al-Abraq International Airport three hours away from the venue of the match and that local authorities did not make alternative travel plans for the team. 'It is consistent with their … hostile attitude toward other Africans,' said Ademola Olajire, spokesperson of the NFF. 'We have filed a formal letter, the whole world is aware of what happened and how everything went, and we expect a reasonable and justifiable decision from CAF.' Libyan authorities also have rejected allegations of foul play or willful attempt to dampen the morale of the Nigerian players ahead of Tuesday's match. However, Nigerian sports analyst Daniel Aderiye said Libya has faltered many times in the past. 'Historical antecedents have put them in a very bad spot,' Aderiye said. 'It's the most hostile environment anybody can play football in. They should go ahead and threaten because as far as we're concerned, we will not be dimwitted. CAF has said they're going to intervene — a disciplinary board has been set up to that effect.' On Monday, the CAF said it was talking to both Nigeria and Libya and would take action if a member violated its rules. Local football club coach Fred Tebit said Nigeria's diminishing positive public image is to blame. 'We should not forget where we belong in the ranks of Africa — a national team of such caliber with players playing all over the top clubs in Europe will be treated as such, and I think CAF should take a tough stance on this,' he said. 'Our government is not helping matters, our country is full of corruption, embezzlement, so that's why the Libyans [think] they can measure shoulders with us.' Last Friday, Nigeria defeated Libya 1-0, securing seven points over three games in their group. The top two teams in each group will advance to the 24-team finals.	https://www.voanews.com/a/libya-threatens-legal-action-after-nigeria-pulls-out-of-football-qualifier/7823586.html	2024-10-15T15:52:02-07:00	
Chinese spamouflage campaign highlights US support for Israel	washington — U.S. support for Israel's military offensive in Gaza has been heavily exploited by China-connected bots, a joint investigation by VOA Mandarin and Taiwan's social media analytic firm DoubleThink Lab, or DTL, has found. Their postings on social media platform X depict Washington as a peddler of war and a disrupter of global peace. The investigation has tracked and analyzed content amplified in the past 12 months by three distinct spamouflage networks with a total of 140 accounts. Each account has been disguised to look like the work of an authentic user in order to spread pro-Beijing narratives and misinformation. Content within the networks originates with three main 'seeder' accounts and then is amplified by the others. The VOA Mandarin-DTL investigation found that more than half of the content, totaling 399 posts in the last year, was about the war in Gaza. Most of those focused on U.S. military support for Israel and on pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campuses in America and other Western countries. One such post showed what appeared to be an AI-generated photo of a baby wrapped in a blood-stained white blanket, lying on a table surrounded by a circle of chairs bearing the flags of the U.S., Israel, the U.K., France, Italy and Canada. 'Bloody feast' was written at the bottom of the photo. Some posts accused the U.S. of benefiting financially from the war in Gaza. Other posts slammed Washington for funding the war while refusing to provide its own people with free health care and education. Often, these criticisms were accompanied by conspiracy theories claiming the U.S. government is controlled by the Israeli government and Jewish cabals. One post tried to connect the wars in Gaza and Ukraine to Hurricane Helene, which recently ravaged parts of the Southeastern U.S., and accused the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, of neglecting domestic needs in order to fund foreign conflicts. 'FEMA, all Jews, refused to give humanitarian aid to American victims after the hurricane,' the post wrongly claimed. 'They gave all YOUR MONEY to 'migrants' and foreign countries. BECAUSE THEY HATE AMERICA!' The unfounded accusation, like the majority of the content amplified by the spamouflage networks, had already been circulating online. The VOA Mandarin-DTL investigation found that these posts have reached few real users and have had only a limited impact on X. Two of the three seeder accounts cited in this article have been suspended by X. Echoing Beijing The VOA Mandarin-DTL investigation has not been able to link the spamouflage networks directly to the Chinese government, although disinformation experts and U.S. government officials have warned repeatedly of Beijing meddling in American politics through influence campaigns — something China has repeatedly denied. But the Chinese government has long been promoting the same narratives promoted by the spamouflage networks, which is that the U.S. is responsible for perpetuating the war in Gaza since October of last year. On October 7, China's state-run Xinhua News Agency released an article to mark the first anniversary of the violent conflict, criticizing Washington's military and diplomatic support of Israel. 'The United States' disheartening response to the conflict between Hamas and Israel has significantly tarnished its international standing in the Middle East,' the article asserted. In a post last week on X, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said this in a short post: 'The 'genocide' in Xinjiang? Reflect on your own history & what's happening in Gaza first.' Tuvia Gering, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, told VOA Mandarin that in addition to undermining the global image of the U.S., Beijing sees the conflict in Gaza as an opportunity to invalidate the West's criticism of its own human rights record. 'It portrays the U.S. as hypocritical,' he said. 'They're saying, 'Look, it's America that's helping Israelis commit genocide against the Palestinians and sending their weapons and protecting them at the [U.N.] Security Council.'' China has been accused of the mass detention of Uyghur Muslim minorities in its western Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. A 2022 U.N. report concluded that Beijing's actions in the region 'may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.' The U.S. government has labeled the alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang as genocide. Beijing denies the accusations and repeatedly has said its measures in Xinjiang are aimed at combating terrorism and extremism and ensuring regional security and development.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-spamouflage-campaign-highlights-us-support-for-israel/7823566.html	2024-10-15T15:47:55-07:00	
Report: Iran cyberattacks against Israel surge after Gaza war	Israel has become the top target of Iranian cyberattacks since the start of the Gaza war last year, while Tehran had focused primarily on the United States before the conflict, Microsoft said Tuesday. 'Following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, Iran surged its cyber, influence, and cyber-enabled influence operations against Israel,' Microsoft said in an annual report. 'From October 7, 2023, to July 2024, nearly half of the Iranian operations Microsoft observed targeted Israeli companies,' said the Microsoft Digital Defense Report. From July to October 2023, only 10 percent of Iranian cyberattacks targeted Israel, while 35 percent aimed at American entities and 20 percent at the United Arab Emirates, according to the US software giant. Since the war started Iran has launched numerous social media operations with the aim of destabilizing Israel. 'Within two days of Hamas' attack on Israel, Iran stood up several new influence operations,' Microsoft said. An account called 'Tears of War' impersonated Israeli activists critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of a crisis over scores of hostages taken by Hamas, according to the report. An account called 'KarMa', created by an Iranian intelligence unit, claimed to represent Israelis calling for Netanyahu's resignation. Iran also began impersonating partners after the war started, Microsoft said. Iranian services created a Telegram account using the logo of the military wing of Hamas to spread false messages about the hostages in Gaza and threaten Israelis, Microsoft said. It was not clear if Iran acted with Hamas's consent, it added. 'Iranian groups also expanded their cyber-enabled influence operations beyond Israel, with a focus on undermining international political, military, and economic support for Israel's military operations,' the report said. The Hamas terror attack on October 7, 2023, resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures, including hostages killed in captivity. Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed 42,289 people, the majority civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory. The U.N. has described the figures as reliable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-iran-cyberattacks-against-israel-surge-after-gaza-war/7823577.html	2024-10-15T15:06:38-07:00

FEMA resumes door-to-door visits in North Carolina after threats tied to disinformation	Federal disaster personnel have resumed door-to-door visits as part of their hurricane-recovery work in North Carolina, an effort temporarily suspended amid threats that prompted officials to condemn the spread of disinformation. Over the weekend, reports emerged that workers with the Federal Emergency Management Agency could be targeted by militia as the government responds to Hurricane Helene. A sheriff's office said Monday that one man was arrested during an investigation, but that the suspect acted alone. FEMA made operational changes to keep personnel safe 'out of an abundance of caution,' agency Administrator Deanne Criswell said at a briefing Tuesday. FEMA workers were back in the field Monday, accompanied by Criswell, and she said disaster-assistance teams helping survivors apply for FEMA aid as well as state and local assistance will continue to go door-to-door. She emphasized that the agency isn't going anywhere. 'The federal family has been here working side by side with the state since Day One. These are people who put their lives on hold to help those who have lost everything,' Criswell said. 'So let me be clear: I take these threats seriously.' North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said he directed the state's Department of Public Safety to coordinate law enforcement assistance for FEMA and other responders. He stressed the damage that internet rumors and falsehoods were causing and said officials may never know how many people won't apply for assistance because of bad information. 'There's still a persistent and dangerous flow of misinformation about recovery efforts in western North Carolina that can lead to threats and intimidation, breeds confusion and demoralizes storm survivors and response workers alike,' Cooper said at the briefing. 'If you're participating in spreading this stuff, stop it. Whatever your aim is, the people you are really hurting are those in western North Carolina who need help.' The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office said it received a call Saturday about a man with an assault rifle who made a comment 'about possibly harming' FEMA employees working in the hard-hit areas of Lake Lure and Chimney Rock in the North Carolina mountains. A man was charged with 'going armed to the terror of the public,' a misdemeanor, and was released after posting bond. The sheriff's office said it received initial reports that a 'truckload of militia' was involved in the threat, but further investigation determined the man acted alone. FEMA has faced rampant disinformation about its response to Helene, which hit Florida on September 26 before heading north and leaving a trail of destruction across six states. Asked what might be fueling disinformation, Cooper said social media has become more extreme, but he also pointed to politics. 'This is happening in the middle of an election where candidates are using people's misery to sow chaos for their own political objectives — and it's wrong,' he said. Former President Donald Trump and his allies have seized on the storm's aftermath to spread false information about the Biden administration's response in the final weeks before the election. Their debunked claims include false statements that victims can only receive $750 in aid, that emergency response funds were diverted to immigrants, that people accepting federal relief money could see their land seized and that FEMA is halting trucks full of supplies. Helene decimated remote towns throughout Appalachia, left millions without power, knocked out cellular service and killed at least 246 people. It was the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005. Terrie Daughtry, a volunteer handling therapy dogs Tuesday at a FEMA Disaster Recovery Center in Asheville, said threats and misinformation — including the militia rumors — made her feel unsafe for the first time in several trips to volunteer at disaster sites. 'I'm not coming to risk my life with it all, to be shot or hurt or trampled because of lunacy,' said Daughtry, who volunteers with Therapy Dogs International. She said she previously traveled to help in the aftermath of the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, floods in Virginia and tornadoes in Texas, Oklahoma and Alabama. She and another volunteer have been using their therapy dogs to calm people waiting in line to make FEMA claims. They hand out candy, let people pet the dogs and talk to people about their experiences. Despite the extra stress from the 'absolutely ridiculous' threats and misinformation, Daughtry said she's seen some amazing moments of human spirit. At one point on Monday, someone in line started playing a guitar and singing about having no water, she said. Eventually, the whole line sang along. 'These are special people. They're singing in horrible adversity,' she said. 'It made me tear up being there, and it's making me tear up now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/fema-resumes-door-to-door-visits-in-north-carolina-after-threats-tied-to-disinformation-/7823567.html	2024-10-15T14:54:57-07:00	
Thousands attend funeral service in Bosnia for 19 killed in floods	JABLANICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina — Several thousand mourners in southern Bosnia converged Tuesday around 19 caskets covered in traditional Islamic green cloth, part of a funeral service held for those killed during the destructive floods and landslides that hit the country in early October. Torrential rains and winds slammed four municipalities in central and southern Bosnia early on Oct. 4, catching people by surprise. Entire areas were cut off as flash floods swept away roads and bridges, and at least 26 people were reported dead. Authorities are still looking for one missing person. The 19 victims were from Donja Jablanica, a village outside the town of Jablanica where the Bosnian Islamic Community Grand Mufti Husein Kavazovic led the service. 'No words are necessary,' Kavazovic said, addressing the mourners as they stood outside Jablanica Mosque. 'Although the grief is deep and unbearable, we are aware that God decides about our lives. We are mortals.' Burials were to be held separately after the service ended. People from Donja Jablanica said they heard a thunderous roar before piles of rocks, mud and water descended on the village. Many houses were demolished and some families lost most of their members. Enes Dzino said his daughter-in-law's nine family members were killed in the floods, except for one child who has been hospitalized. 'It's hard, very hard to bear,' he said. 'They were all gone in a second, her entire family. All killed.' Bosnia's neighbors and European Union countries sent help. Human-caused climate change increases the intensity of rainfall because warm air holds more moisture. This summer, the Balkans were also hit by long-lasting record temperatures, causing a drought. Scientists said the dried-out land has hampered the absorption of floodwaters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-attend-funeral-service-in-bosnia-for-19-killed-in-floods-/7823542.html	2024-10-15T14:17:07-07:00	
Georgia judge rules county election officials must certify election results	ATLANTA, georgia — A Georgia judge has ruled county election officials must certify election results by the deadline set in law and cannot exclude any group of votes from certification even if they suspect error or fraud. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled that 'no election superintendent (or member of a board of elections and registration) may refuse to certify or abstain from certifying election results under any circumstance.' While they have the right to inspect the conduct of an election and to review related documents, he wrote, 'any delay in receiving such information is not a basis for refusing to certify the election results or abstaining from doing so.' Georgia law says county election superintendents, which are multimember boards in most counties, 'shall' certify election results by 5 p.m. on the Monday after an election — or the Tuesday if Monday is a holiday as it is this year. The ruling comes as early voting began Tuesday in Georgia. Julie Adams, a Republican member of the Fulton County election board, had asked the judge to declare that her duties as an election board member were discretionary and that she is entitled to 'full access' to 'election materials.' Long an administrative task that attracted little attention, certification of election results has become politicized since then-President Donald Trump tried to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 general election. Republicans in several swing states, including Adams, refused to certify election results earlier this year and some have sued to keep from being forced to sign off on election results. Adams' suit, backed by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute, argues that county election board members have the discretion to reject certification. In court earlier this month, her lawyers also argued that county election officials could certify results without including ballots that appear to have problems, allaying concerns of a board member who might otherwise vote not to certify. Judge McBurney wrote that nothing in Georgia law gives county election officials the authority to determine that fraud has occurred or what should be done about it. Instead, he wrote, the law says a county election official's 'concerns about fraud or systemic error are to be noted and shared with the appropriate authorities but they are not a basis for a superintendent to decline to certify.' Both sides in the fight over certification claimed McBurney's ruling as a victory. The Democratic National Committee and Democratic Party of Georgia, with the support of Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, had joined the lawsuit as defendants and called the ruling a 'major legal win.' Adams has said she was not given access to county election documents with enough time to consider them before the certification vote for elections earlier this year. She said in a statement that McBurney's ruling has made it clear that she and other county election board members 'cannot be barred from access to elections in their counties.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-judge-rules-county-election-officials-must-certify-election-results-/7823512.html	2024-10-15T13:53:22-07:00	
Beijing calls for urgency as Pakistan boosts security for Chinese projects	KARACHI, PAKISTAN — Pakistan has agreed to increase security for Chinese citizens and projects in the South Asian nation, a joint statement said on Tuesday, as Beijing called for urgent security measures following an escalation in militant threats in the country. China has pumped billions of dollars into Pakistan over the years building infrastructure under the Belt and Road Initiative, while also running a strategic port and a major mine in the country. But its citizens and projects have been attacked continuously by separatist militants fighting against what they call exploitation of the mineral-rich southwestern Balochistan province. 'The Chinese side underscored the need and urgency to take targeted security measures in Pakistan, to jointly create a safe environment for cooperation,' said a joint statement on the visit of Chinese Premier Li Qiang. Li arrived in Islamabad on Monday for a four-day visit — the first visit by a Chinese premier to Pakistan in 11 years — days after a suicide bombing in Karachi killed two Chinese engineers. It was the second attack on Chinese engineers in the country this year. The visit coincides with a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a Eurasian security and political group. The Pakistani side emphasized its firm commitment to enhancing security input and coordination as well as strengthening security measures, the statement, released by Pakistan's foreign office, said. Pakistan will make 'comprehensive efforts to ensure the safety and security of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions,' the 30-point statement said. Islamabad is under tight security for the duration of the Chinese premier's visit, which concludes on Thursday. The joint statement also touched on regional, economic and diplomatic cooperation between the two countries. Both parties reaffirmed their commitment to an upgraded version of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a $65 billion investment in the South Asian country under Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative.	https://www.voanews.com/a/beijing-calls-for-urgency-as-pakistan-boosts-security-for-chinese-projects/7823509.html	2024-10-15T13:25:50-07:00	
Georgia’s leaders stoke fears of Russian war ahead of pivotal election	The republic of Georgia – which was part of the Soviet Union until independence in 1991 - is preparing for a crucial election on October 26th, which is widely seen as a choice between a future aligned with the West or Russia.

WHO: Gaza polio campaign starts well, despite Israeli strikes	Geneva — The World Health Organization said on Tuesday it had been able to start its polio campaign in central Gaza and vaccinate tens of thousands of children despite Israeli strikes in the designated protected zone hours before. As part of an agreement between the Israeli military and Palestinian militant group Hamas, humanitarian pauses in the year-long Gaza war had been due to begin early on Monday to reach hundreds of thousands of children. However, hours before then, the U.N. humanitarian office said Israeli forces struck tents near al Aqsa hospital, inside in the zone, where it said four people were burned to death. The U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA said one of its schools in the central Gazan city of Nuseirat, intended as a vaccination site, was hit overnight between Sunday and Monday, killing up to 22 people. WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told a Geneva press briefing that over 92,000 children, or around half of the children targeted for polio vaccines in the central area, had been inoculated on Monday. 'What we have received from colleagues is that the vaccination went without a major issue yesterday, and we hope It will continue the same way,' he said. Other humanitarian agencies have previously voiced concerns about the viability of the polio campaign in northern Gaza, where an Israeli offensive is under way. Aid groups carried out an initial round of vaccinations last month, after a baby was partially paralyzed by the type 2 polio virus in August, in the first such case in the territory in 25 years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-gaza-polio-campaign-starts-well-despite-israeli-strikes/7823393.html	2024-10-15T12:14:05-07:00	
Conflict, climate change increase hunger and malnutrition across Africa	geneva — While the world’s farmers produce more than enough food to feed the planet’s nearly 8 billion people, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said 'hunger and malnutrition are a fact of life' for billions. In a message in advance of World Food Day on October 16, Guterres said 733 million people globally are short of food because of 'conflict, marginalization, climate change, poverty and economic downturns.' The Food and Agriculture Organization was established 79 years ago on October 16 with a mandate to provide people with greater access to food that not only quelled hunger but also was safe, nutritious and culturally acceptable. But Dominique Burgeon, director of the FAO Liason Office in Geneva, told journalists Tuesday that 'We continue to witness severe imbalances across the world.' 'One in 11 people in the world go to bed hungry every day, over 2.8 billion people cannot afford a healthy diet. … We have also the issue of stunting and wasting. As we speak, about 148 million children under the age of 5 are too short for their age, and 45 million are too thin for their height,' he said. The U.N. children’s fund said children suffering from wasting, which is caused by a lack of nutritious and safe food and repeated bouts of disease, are dangerously thin and their immune systems are weak, 'leaving them vulnerable to growth failure, poor development and death.' UNICEF appealed for $165 million Tuesday to provide essential ready-to-use-therapeutic food for nearly 2 million severely malnourished children 'at risk of death' in the 12 hardest-hit countries — Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, Sudan, Pakistan and Uganda. 'Levels of severe wasting in children under 5 years remain gravely high in several countries, fueled by conflict, economic shocks and climate crises,' it warned. The International Committee of the Red Cross is among several humanitarian agencies expressing alarm at the escalating incidence of acute hunger and malnutrition across wide swathes of Africa. 'The consequences of armed conflict in the region of Lake Chad, compounded by the effect of climate change, continue killing people, and especially the most vulnerable, the young children,' said Yann Bonzon, head of the ICRC delegation for Nigeria. Speaking in Nigeria, he told journalists that 'Every day, doctors and nurses in health facilities we support in northeast Nigeria receive and treat severely malnourished kids. Desperate mothers tell us every day how healthy children become weak and fall sick, and how putting food on the table has turned into a daily struggle.' Underscoring the seriousness of the situation, he noted that the number of children treated for severe malnutrition in ICRC health facilities in northeast Nigeria has increased by 24% over the past year. Humanitarian organizations estimate that across the Lake Chad region nearly 6.1 million people, the highest number in the past four years, will suffer from food shortages in the coming months. 'Farmers tell us how the rampant insecurity due to conflict is preventing farmers from planting their crops' and climate shocks have damaged crops, 'contributing to a food crisis across Lake Chad in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria,' Bonzon said. A similar scenario is playing out in southern Africa. The United Nations warns a widespread drought in the region, triggered by an El Nino weather pattern could turn into a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe without international assistance. The World Food Program said the historic drought has devastated more than 27 million lives across the region, noting that some 21 million children are malnourished. 'For many communities, this is the worst food crisis yet,' said Tomson Phiri, WFP spokesperson for Southern Africa. 'October in Southern Africa marks the start of the lean season, and each month is expected to be worse than the previous one until harvests next year in March and April,' he said. ' Crops have failed, livestock has perished and children are lucky to receive one meal per day. The situation is dire, and the need for action has never been clearer.' The World Food Program said a record five countries – Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe – have declared the hunger crisis 'a state of disaster' and have called for international support. The agency noted that Angola and Mozambique also are severely affected. The U.N. food agency expressed concern that urgent appeals for international support are falling on deaf ears, noting that 'we have only received one-fifth of the $369 million needed to provide life-saving assistance to millions in southern Africa.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7823323.html	2024-10-15T11:32:21-07:00

DeSantis praises Milton recovery efforts as rising flood waters persist in Florida	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — While there's still more work to do, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday praised Hurricane Milton recovery efforts, saying power has never been restored to so many so quickly after a major storm. 'President (Ronald) Reagan used to say the most terrifying words in the English language are, 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help.' There's a lot of wisdom in that, but I don't think The Gipper ever saw Florida respond to a natural disaster, because we get after it and we do make a difference,' DeSantis said at a news conference in front of a flooded road in Zephyrhills. There were still about 170,000 customers without electricity, rivers continued to rise in some flooded areas and the state was still providing free gas to residents struggling to top of their tanks. But DeSantis pointed out that more than 4 million customers had power restored less than a week after the Category 3 storm. At least 11 people died less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene inflicted major damage in Florida and other Southeastern states. The death toll from Helene is more than 240. While most gas stations were back up and running, the state still has 10 active fuel distribution centers providing free gas to residents. DeSantis said more than 2 million gallons had been distributed so far. As happened two years ago during Hurricane Ian, parts of central Florida on Tuesday were flooding almost a week after Milton made landfall due to the rising St. Johns River. In Seminole County, north of Orlando, crews closed roads along the shores of Lake Harney and Lake Jesup after several homes were flooded by the river. Since last Thursday, at least 15 people have been evacuated from homes in nearby Geneva and a neighborhood in Altamonte Springs located in a crook of the Little Wekiva River. Water levels along the St. Johns River were expected to crest later in the week. In Sumter County, home to the sprawling retirement community, The Villages, residents along the Little Withlacoochee River were being encouraged to evacuate as river levels rose. Residents who decided to evacuate were offered shelter at the Sumter County Fairgrounds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/desantis-praises-milton-recovery-efforts-as-rising-flood-waters-persist-in-florida/7823318.html	2024-10-15T11:15:06-07:00	
Africa’s farming future could include more digital solutions	NAIROBI, KENYA — More than 400 delegates and organizations working in Africa’s farming sector are in Nairobi, Kenya, this week to discuss how digital agriculture can improve the lives of farmers and the continent's food system. Tech innovators discussed the need for increased funding, especially for women. In past decades, African farmers have struggled to produce enough food to feed the continent. DigiCow is one of the tech companies at the conference that says it has answers to the problem. The Kenya-based company says it provides farmers with digital recordkeeping, education via audio on an app, and access to financing and marketing. Maureen Saitoti, DigiCow’s brand manager, said the platform has improved the lives of at least half a million farmers. 'Other than access to finance, it is also able to offer access to the market because a farmer is able to predict the harvest they are anticipating and begin conversations with buyers who have also been on board on the platform,' she said. 'So, this has proven to provide a wholesome integration of the ecosystem, supporting small-scale farmers.' Integrating digital systems into food production helps farmers gain access to seed, fertilizer and loans, and helps prevent pests and diseases on farms, organizers said. Innovation in agriculture technology is seen as helping reach marginalized groups, including women. Sieka Gatabaki, program director for Mercy Corps AgriFin, which is in 40 countries working with digital tool providers to increase the productivity and incomes of small-scale farmers, said his organization stresses education and practical information. 'We also focus on agronomic advice that gives the farmers the right kind of skills and knowledge to execute on their farms, as well as precision information such as weather that enables them to make the right decisions [about] how they grow and when they should grow and what they should grow in different geomatic climates,' Gatabaki said. 'Then we definitely expect that those farmers will increase their productivity and income.' According to the State of AgTech Investment Report 2024, farming attracted $1.6 billion in funding in the past decade. But experts say the current funding is not enough to meet the sector's growing demands. David Saunder, director of strategy and growth at Briter Bridges, says funding systems have evolved to cope with problems faced by farmers and the food industry. 'Funding follows those businesses, those startups, that can viably grow and scale their businesses, and that's what we are trying to do with AgTech to increase the data and information on those,' he said. During the meeting, tech developers, experts and donors will also discuss how artificial intelligence and alternative data could be used to improve productivity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/africa-s-farming-future-could-include-more-digital-solutions/7823294.html	2024-10-15T11:14:51-07:00	
Secret Venezuelan court recordings show injustice of trial, journalist says	MADRID — The recordings are not very clear but that is because they were taken clandestinely, in a Venezuelan courtroom. Jesus Medina Ezaine managed to record his appearances in court to try to prove his innocence against charges of inciting hate, money laundering, criminal association and obtaining illegal profits from the public administration. Medina, who denied all charges, faced up to 20 years in prison if convicted. A journalist for Dolar Today — an independent daily that is critical of Venezuela’s government — Medina later published extracts from the court hearings on social media to show he had accurately described how the Venezuelan legal system denies basic rights. Medina, who went into exile last month, said he has been persecuted by the government of President Nicolas Maduro for six years. Authorities claim the case was connected to an allegation that the journalist faked his own kidnapping in 2017. But the charges did not mention it, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported. Medina’s story is typical of other journalists who have left Venezuela because of a crackdown by the Maduro government against the media and political activists after disputed presidential elections on July 28. Venezuela has arrested several reporters and canceled the passports of dozens of journalists and activists since the election in what campaigners say is an intensifying campaign of repression. In September, Medina fled Venezuela for Colombia by walking across the border. Three months earlier, a court had cleared Medina of charges including inciting hate. But the government then ordered a retrial. The journalist had already experienced what life is like in prison: He was jailed for nearly three years between 2017 and 2020 in a high-security military jail awaiting trial. With a retrial looming, he decided he had to leave his country, his girlfriend and family behind. Medina said he was a victim of an 'unjust' judicial system, which forced him to appear multiple times in court. Media are rarely allowed into courts to cover trials, even those that are public. But Medina and another journalist who spoke with VOA said that media also fear retaliation from authorities if they cover such cases. 'In Venezuela, all the judicial processes are unjust and more so when they are for political issues. For this reason, I decided to record all the hearings,' Medina told VOA. In one recording, a judge called Medina to give evidence in his defense. He took the stand and said that government officials accused him of inciting hate, which carries a prison sentence of between 10 and 15 years if convicted. 'In court, I said that the owner of a Venezuelan state television station threatened to plant a bomb to shut me up,' he told VOA. 'Later in the audio, my defense lawyer said there was no evidence of me inciting violence or hate. The judge then asked a government official if there was any evidence against me, and when he said no, the judge ordered that I should be cleared.' The judge recorded a verdict of not guilty, but the government appealed. 'I managed to record with hidden microphones the trial which the state of Venezuela carried out against me to publicly demonstrate my innocence, [to show] my triumph against the justice system,' Medina told VOA. He also detailed every step of his 'Kafkaesque' judicial ordeal. He faced one trial and 14 postponed preliminary hearings. Five times proceedings were interrupted, Medina said. In 33 hearings, government officials failed to turn up to give evidence, and they all were interrupted. Medina was ordered by the court to turn up to report at a police station every eight days. He did this 231 times during the entire judicial process. During the judicial process, he was banned from leaving Venezuela, prohibited from obtaining a new passport and opening a new bank account. The court also ordered that Medina’s name be withdrawn from some media, which meant that he could not get work. The Venezuelan government and the embassy in Madrid did not respond to requests from VOA for comment on Medina’s case. Carlos Correa, a lawyer, journalist and director of Espacio Publico, a civil association in Venezuela that defends the freedom of expression, said the government denied Medina legal rights guaranteed under international law. Medina 'was denied the right to a fair trial and denied the right to his liberty at different times. He was denied the right to justice of Venezuela and international human rights,' he told VOA. Watchdogs drew attention to the legal case, including statements from the Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, a media watchdog in Venezuela that in 2022 said: 'The interpretation of judicial regulations in favor of the interests of those in power continues to violate the rights of Jesus Medina Ezaine. 'The political bias and arbitrariness of public institutions represent a threat to press freedom in this country,' the statement said. Those threats have increased since the July elections, watchdogs say. Electoral officials and Venezuela’s top court declared Maduro the winner of the election with just under 52% of the vote. But the opposition says voting machine receipts show a landslide victory for their candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, who fled to exile in Spain. Some Western governments, including the United States, have alleged electoral fraud. Media watchdogs note that journalists are being targeted. 'As protests condemning electoral fraud grip Venezuela, journalists have faced threats, censorship and arrests,' said Reporters Without Borders in a report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/secret-venezuelan-court-recordings-show-injustice-of-trial-journalist-says/7823159.html	2024-10-15T09:44:58-07:00	
US slaps sanctions on 'sham charity' fundraising for Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine	WASHINGTON — The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on what it said was a key international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which Washington has designated a terrorist organization. The U.S. Treasury Department, in action taken with Canada, said in a statement it imposed sanctions on the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, accusing it of being 'a sham charity that serves as an international fundraiser' for the PFLP. The PFLP, which has also taken part in the fight against Israel in Gaza, was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the U.S. in October 1997 and October 2001, respectively. The Treasury said PFLP uses Samidoun to fundraise in Europe and North America. The group's activities were banned by Germany last year. 'Organizations like Samidoun masquerade as charitable actors that claim to provide humanitarian support to those in need, yet in reality divert funds for much-needed assistance to support terrorist groups,' Treasury's acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Bradley Smith, said in the statement. The Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network did not respond immediately to a Reuters request for comment. A member of the PFLP's leadership abroad was also targeted with sanctions on Tuesday. Canada announced the listing of Samidoun as a terrorist entity on Tuesday. 'Violent extremism, acts of terrorism or terrorist financing have no place in Canadian society or abroad,' Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said in a statement announcing the listing. The Treasury said the PFLP remained active in the conflict between Israel and Hamas, including participating in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage to Gaza, by Israeli tallies. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the offensive so far, according to Gaza's health authorities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-slaps-sanctions-on-sham-charity-fundraising-for-popular-front-for-liberation-of-palestine/7823098.html	2024-10-15T08:55:12-07:00	
As US presidential vote looms, newsrooms focus on how to stay safe	Washington/New York — On a rainy day in September, a group of journalists gathered in a nondescript office building outside Washington. Some were seasoned reporters, others still students. But they were all there to learn how to stay safe while covering elections and unrest. Organized by the International Women’s Media Foundation, or IWMF, the training session was part of a national campaign to teach journalists based in the United States how to stay safe on assignment, including while reporting on the presidential campaign. Over the past year, the IWMF has trained more than 620 journalists across 13 states. 'This safety tour has really been illuminating. Unfortunately, what we are hearing is quite alarming, and it’s not just about election reporting,' IWMF executive director Elisa Lees Munoz told VOA. 'What we’re understanding more and more is that literally every beat in America has become a polarizing beat, and therefore has become a dangerous beat.' Three times as many journalists have been arrested in the U.S. this year compared to last year, according to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. More journalists have been assaulted too, according to the group’s data. 'We’re seeing journalists still struggling every day to uphold that basic right of freedom of the press,' Kirstin McCudden, the Tracker’s managing editor, told VOA at the group’s office in Brooklyn. 'It’s a little alarming.' Many of the incidents took place during pro-Palestine protests. In one case, three photojournalists were arrested in Chicago in August while covering a protest on the outskirts of the Democratic National Convention. 'Police departments feel that they have the power to violate the rights of journalists. Then what ends up happening is it turns into a snowball effect. More police agencies crack down even harder,' said Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which publishes the Tracker. While press freedom is often a local issue, it also matters what presidential candidates are saying and how they treat the press, multiple analysts said. The campaign of former President Donald Trump has been punctuated by the same kinds of attacks against the media that characterized his presidency, the analysts who spoke with VOA said. Leading up to and during Trump’s presidency, Stephanie Sugars, a senior reporter at the Tracker, documented more than 2,000 anti-media posts by Trump on the social media platform X, then known as Twitter. The tenor of those posts evolved from targeting individual journalists to targeting specific news outlets to targeting the media industry writ large. 'A lot of that rhetoric is still in play and is part of his playbook,' Sugars said. She added that the Tracker would monitor anti-media posts from President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris if those kinds of posts existed. Sugars cautioned against solely blaming Trump for the increased hostility facing journalists in the U.S. But, she said, he hasn’t helped the situation either. 'If you sow distrust in these sorts of external sources and really encourage your followers, those who support you, to only believe what you specifically say, that’s a great way to maintain firm control over what the narrative is, what truth is understood to be, and that’s an incredible amount of power to have,' Sugars said. McCudden agreed. 'Rhetoric does matter, and it’s fuel to the fire,' she said. In response to VOA’s request for comment, Trump’s presidential campaign shared a statement that Republican National Committee spokesperson Taylor Rogers originally provided to the conservative news site the Daily Caller. In it, Rogers described Trump as a 'champion for free speech' and said that 'everyone was safer under President Trump, including journalists.' Mitigating risk The hostile environment for journalists comes at a time when trust in media is already at a record low in the U.S., according to Gallup. Attacks or hostile rhetoric against the press only make the situation worse. So far, the Tracker has documented only a few violations directly related to the election. But, McCudden said, 'History tells us that we should be worried and aware.' She cited the January 6 insurrection on the Capitol, where 18 journalists were assaulted. It may take a few days for the election results to be confirmed, McCudden said. 'And in that time, tensions will be high. And journalists whose job it is to cover these tense times are also often in harm’s way,' she said. The IWMF’s safety training originally was directed at journalists in combat zones and dangerous regions. But following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when attacks on the media began to rise, the IWMF realized U.S. based journalists would benefit from them, too, according to Munoz. For Jennifer Thomas, a journalism professor at Howard University in Washington, the training offered her the tools to better help her students to stay safe. 'Back when I was reporting locally and then nationally and covering news, we didn't have to really be that concerned when we went out to cover an event,' said Thomas, who previously worked at CNN. 'Well, times have changed.' During the training, Thomas and the others were introduced to a range of resources on issues including covering riots and dealing with an arrest. Munoz thinks this information will become all the more important for journalists in the U.S. in years to come.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-us-presidential-vote-looms-newsrooms-focus-on-how-to-stay-safe/7822912.html	2024-10-15T08:07:21-07:00	
Chinese Pandas arrive in US, headed to National Zoo in Washington	Washington — The National Zoo's long dark panda drought is coming to an end. Eleven months after the zoo sent its three wildly popular pandas — Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — back to China, a new pair of bears arrived in the United States on Tuesday. They will be transported from Dulles International Airport in suburban Virginia to the zoo. A pair of three-year old giant pandas, named Bao Li and Qing Bao, have left a research facility in the southwestern Chinese city of Dujiangyan before being flown to Washington, according to a statement by the China Wildlife Conservation Association. 'Food prepared for the trip includes corn bread, bamboo and carrots, as well as water and medicine,' the statement said, adding that the partnership will 'make new contributions in protecting global biodiversity and enhance the friendship of the people from the two countries.' It's unclear exactly when the bears will arrive in Washington, but there will likely be an extended quarantine and acclimation period before they are introduced to the public. On Monday evening, the zoo's website posted an alert that the entire facility would be closed Tuesday, without giving a reason. The lead article on the site still said the pandas would be coming sometime before the end of the year. Bao Li (precious vigor) and Qing Bao (green treasure) arrive in Washington as part of a new 10-year agreement with Chinese authorities. The previous deal expired last year, leading to some concern among American panda-lovers that Beijing was gradually pulling its furry friendship ambassadors from American zoos amid rising diplomatic tensions. Breeding pairs in zoos in Memphis and San Diego had already returned to China earlier and the four pandas in the Atlanta zoo left for China last week. That anxiety turned to optimism last November when Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly stated a desire to continue the panda exchange programs. This year, a new pair of bears has been delivered to the San Diego Zoo, while another pair has been promised to San Francisco. In Washington, National Zoo officials remained conspicuously silent about negotiations for a new panda agreement, but they expressed optimism about striking a new deal and launched a multimillion-dollar renovation of its panda enclosure in anticipation. Then in late May, zoo director Brandie Smith teamed up with first lady Jill Biden to announce that Bao Li and Qing Bao would be arriving by the end of this year. The Chinese announcement said the National Zoo had sent 'three experienced keepers and veterinary experts' to China to assist the transport and accompany the bears. Zoo officials on Monday declined to confirm the Chinese announcement. Zoo spokesperson Jennifer Zoon said in an email, 'For the safety of animals and staff, we are not able to confirm any details at this time.' But signs at the zoo and on its social media site have heralded the planned return of the pandas and panda-themed merchandise still dominates the gift shops. 'The giant pandas are an iconic part of the Washington, D.C., story, both for locals and incoming travelers alike,' said Elliott L. Ferguson, II, president and CEO of Destination DC. 'The interest and excitement associated with their return directly benefits the entire city, bringing further interest and visitors to our hotels, restaurants and other attractions.' The exact terms of the deal are still unclear; under previous 10-year agreements the Chinese government receives $1 million per year, per bear. Any cubs born in overseas zoos are typically returned to China before they reach age four. Pandas have become one of the unofficial symbols of the nation's capital, dating back to 1972 when the first pair — Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing — were sent as a gift from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai following President Richard Nixon's historic diplomatic visit to China. Later, a rolling series of 10-year cooperation agreements was struck. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, credited the decades of cooperation with advancing research into panda preservation and breeding. During the lifespan of these agreements, giant pandas have been reclassified from an endangered species to merely vulnerable. 'The current round of cooperation will focus on prevention and treatment of major diseases, and protection of habitats and wild giant panda populations,' Liu said in an email. 'We hope the arrival of the pandas will inject fresh impetus into exchanges between China and the U.S., and help to stabilize the broader bilateral relationship as well.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-pandas-arrive-in-us-headed-to-national-zoo-in-washington/7822991.html	2024-10-15T07:50:47-07:00	
Kenya's High Court rejects move to stop deputy president's impeachment debate	NAIROBI, Kenya — Kenya's High Court on Tuesday rejected an application by the deputy president's lawyers to stop the senate from debating an impeachment motion against him after parliament voted to remove him from office last week. Justice Chacha Mwita ruled that parliament will be allowed to proceed with its constitutional mandate and the court won't 'interfere.' Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua's impeachment motion was approved by a 281-44 vote in parliament last week and forwarded to the senate, which will begin hearings on Wednesday. Gachagua is facing impeachment over corruption and other irregularities, including allegations that he supported anti-government protests in June. He denies all the charges against him. Under the Kenyan Constitution, the removal from office is automatic if approved by both chambers, though Gachagua can challenge the action in court — something he has said he would do. The chief justice on Monday approved a three-judge panel to hear six petitions filed against the impeachment process. The debate surrounding his fate has extended beyond parliament — supporters and opponents of the motion clashed last week in public forums after the ruling alliance brought the motion before parliament. President William Ruto has yet to publicly comment about the impeachment, but is on record in the earlier days of his presidency saying that he wouldn't publicly humiliate his deputy, alluding to the troubled relationship he had with his predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta, during their second term in office. The senate requires a two-thirds majority to approve the impeachment motion. If approved, it would be the first time that a sitting deputy president is impeached in Kenya.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-s-high-court-rejects-move-to-stop-deputy-president-s-impeachment-debate-/7822968.html	2024-10-15T07:34:58-07:00	
Shootout with Haitian, Kenyan police injures gang leader	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — A leader of one of Haiti's most powerful gangs was injured in a shootout with Haitian and Kenyan police in their first major incursion into gang-controlled territory since a United Nations-backed mission began earlier this year, police said Tuesday. The second-in-command of the Kraze Barye gang, known simply as 'Deshommes,' was shot in Torcelle, a community the gang controls in the southeast region of the capital, Port-au-Prince, Haiti National Police said in a statement Tuesday. Some 20 other gang members were killed during the police operations, which occurred on Saturday and Monday, officials said, adding that they confiscated firearms, munitions, phones and 'sensitive materials and equipment.' Nobody was detained in the operations, and police didn't say how they know that Deshommes was injured. Police said the incursions would continue until the gang and its top leader, Vitel'Homme Innocent, could be neutralized. In a statement, the Kenyans who are leading the mission called on Innocent to 'stop committing atrocities against innocent Haitians.' '[The mission] is sending a strong warning to key gang leaders to stop the barbarous acts of rapes, extortion, kidnapping, blackmail and killings,' they said. Innocent has been sanctioned by the U.S., the European Union and the U.N. Security Council, with the U.S. offering a $2 million reward for information leading to his capture. He has been indicted in the U.S. for the armed kidnapping of 16 Christian missionaries in 2021 and the slaying of missionary Marie Franklin and kidnapping of her husband in 2022. In a recent video, Innocent stands near an armored vehicle set on fire that police said they were forced to abandon due to engine failure during one of their operations. Innocent claimed the gang was not giving police any problems and accused them of 'hurting too many innocent people.' He also said the gang has the power to decide who enters and leaves the community it controls. Kraze Barye is an ally of the G-Pep gang federation, an enemy of G9 Family and Allies, a different federation led by former elite police officer Jimmy Cherizier, best known as Barbecue. Kraze Barye has about 600 members and controls the community of Tabarre as well as parts of Petionville and Croix-des-Bouquets. The gang is accused of killings, drug and weapon trafficking, rapes, robberies and other crimes, according to the U.N., which called it 'one of the most powerful gangs' in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area. Kenyan officials pledged that 'the pressure will be sustained on the gangs until or unless they surrender to the authorities.' They also noted that operations are still ongoing in the central town of Pont-Sonde, where at least 115 people were killed by another gang earlier this month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shootout-with-haitian-kenyan-police-injures-gang-leader/7822947.html	2024-10-15T07:18:43-07:00	
Pakistan hosts regional leaders for SCO summit under tight security	Islamabad — Leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization of Eurasian countries gathered in Pakistan Tuesday for an annual, two-day meeting to discuss ways to enhance regional security, stability, and development cooperation. Authorities have placed Islamabad under a security lockdown for the SCO gathering, deploying thousands of forces, including troops, in and around the Pakistani capital to protect the high-profile event due to a recent surge in deadly militant attacks. China and Russia established the SCO in 2001 as a way to counterbalance Western alliances in the areas of security, politics, and economics. Other members of the 10-state alliance are Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, India and Iran. Officials said that Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin are among several heads of government who will attend the meeting, which will be presided over by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the organization's current chair. Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and the first vice president of Iran will represent their respective countries at the meeting. Jaishankar is the first Indian foreign minister to visit Islamabad in nearly a decade. Pakistan and India have both ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks during Jaishankar’s visit, emphasizing that the SCO is a 'multilateral' gathering, and neither side has requested such a meeting. Officials stated that Sharif would host a welcome dinner for SCO delegates on Tuesday. The summit proceedings will commence on Wednesday morning. On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that Premier Li 'will have an in-depth exchange of view' with leaders of the participating countries on advancing the SCO’s 'practical cooperation,' among other issues. 'China believes that this meeting will produce positive outcomes and give a stronger boost to the security, stability, and development of regional countries,' Mao told reporters in Beijing. Analysts remain skeptical whether the SCO meetings have produced outcomes that would address concerns of member states, noting that Western alliances like NATO or the European Union offer members privileges such as mutual defense and economic integration. Security concerns surrounding Tuesday’s SCO meeting in Pakistan stem from a recent surge in militant attacks in the country. However, the deadly violence has primarily affected southwestern Balochistan and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces bordering Afghanistan. The Pakistani government has declared a three-day public holiday in Islamabad and the adjoining garrison city of Rawalpindi as part of security measures. Last week, two Chinese engineers were killed and another was injured when their convoy was hit by a suicide car bombing in Karachi, the capital of southern Sindh province. A separatist group from Balochistan claimed responsibility for the deadly attack. The slain foreigners were staff at a Chinese-funded coal-fired power plant under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure development bilateral collaboration stemming from Beijing’s global Belt and Road Initiative. Despite the deadly attack, Premier Li arrived in Islamabad Monday and held wide-ranging bilateral talks with Sharif before participating in the SCO meeting. The leaders also virtually inaugurated a CPEC-funded airport in Balochistan’s coastal city of Gwadar, which also houses a Chinese-run deep-water port on the Arabian Sea. Security concerns reportedly prompted the virtual inauguration of what officials described as Pakistan's second-largest airport, which China gifted.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-hosts-regional-leaders-for-sco-summit-under-tight-security/7822956.html	2024-10-15T07:14:11-07:00	
American couple runs across Ukraine to raise funds, help residents during war	American couple Tyler and Nikki Chay are trying to keep the world's focus on the war in Ukraine in their own unique way … by running ... over 1,200 kilometers across Ukraine.

Microsoft: Cybercriminals increasingly help Russia, China, Iran target US, allies	WASHINGTON — Russia, China and Iran are increasingly relying on criminal networks to lead cyberespionage and hacking operations against adversaries such as the United States, according to a report on digital threats published Tuesday by Microsoft. The growing collaboration between authoritarian governments and criminal hackers has alarmed national security officials and cybersecurity experts. They say it represents the increasingly blurred lines between actions directed by Beijing or the Kremlin aimed at undermining rivals and the illicit activities of groups typically more interested in financial gain. In one example, Microsoft's analysts found that a criminal hacking group with links to Iran infiltrated an Israeli dating site and then tried to sell or ransom the personal information it obtained. Microsoft concluded the hackers had two motives: to embarrass Israelis and make money. In another, investigators identified a Russian criminal network that infiltrated more than 50 electronic devices used by the Ukrainian military in June, apparently seeking access and information that could aid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There was no obvious financial motive for the group, aside from any payment they may have received from Russia. Marriage of convenience For nations such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, teaming up with cybercriminals offers a marriage of convenience with benefits for both sides. Governments can boost the volume and effectiveness of cyber activities without added cost. For the criminals, it offers new avenues for profit and the promise of government protection. 'We're seeing in each of these countries this trend toward combining nation-state and cybercriminal activities,' said Tom Burt, Microsoft's vice president of customer security and trust. So far there is no evidence suggesting that Russia, China and Iran are sharing resources with each other or working with the same criminal networks, Burt said. But he said the growing use of private cyber 'mercenaries' shows how far America's adversaries will go to weaponize the internet. Microsoft's report analyzed cyber threats between July 2023 and June 2024, looking at how criminals and foreign nations use hacking, spear phishing, malware and other techniques to gain access and control over a target's system. The company says its customers face more than 600 million such incidents every day. Russia focused much of its cyber operations on Ukraine, trying to enter military and government systems and spreading disinformation designed to undermine support for the war among its allies. Ukraine has responded with its own cyber efforts, including one last week that knocked some Russian state media outlets offline. US elections targeted Networks tied to Russia, China and Iran have also targeted American voters, using fake websites and social media accounts to spread false and misleading claims about the 2024 election. Analysts at Microsoft agree with the assessment of U.S. intelligence officials who say Russia is targeting the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, while Iran is working to oppose former President Donald Trump. Iran has also hacked into Trump's campaign and sought, unsuccessfully, to interest Democrats in the material. Federal officials have also accused Iran of covertly supporting American protests over the war in Gaza. Russia and Iran will likely accelerate the pace of their cyber operations targeting the U.S. as election day approaches, Burt said. China, meanwhile, has largely stayed out of the presidential race, focusing its disinformation on down-ballot races for Congress or state and local office. Microsoft found networks tied to Beijing also continue to target Taiwan and other countries in the region. Denials from all parties In response, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said allegations that China partners with cybercriminals are groundless and accused the U.S. of spreading its own 'disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats.' In a statement, spokesperson Liu Pengyu said that 'our position is consistent and clear. China firmly opposes and combats cyberattacks and cybertheft in all forms.' Russia and Iran have also rejected accusations that they're using cyber operations to target Americans. Messages left with representatives of those three nations and North Korea were not returned Monday. Efforts to disrupt foreign disinformation and cyber capabilities have escalated along with the threat, but the anonymous, porous nature of the internet sometimes undercuts the effectiveness of the response. Federal authorities recently announced plans to seize hundreds of website domains used by Russia to spread election disinformation and to support efforts to hack former U.S. military and intelligence figures. But investigators at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab found that sites seized by the government can easily and quickly be replaced. Within one day of the Department of Justice seizing several domains in September, for example, researchers spotted 12 new websites created to take their place. One month later, they continue to operate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cybercriminals-increasingly-help-russia-china-iran-target-us-allies-/7822907.html	2024-10-15T06:56:00-07:00	
UN: Drought from El Nino to blame for Southern Africa's worst hunger crisis in decades	CAPE TOWN, South Africa — Months of drought in southern Africa triggered by the El Nino weather phenomenon have had a devastating impact on more than 27 million people and caused the region's worst hunger crisis in decades, the United Nations' food agency said on Tuesday. The World Food Program warned it could become a 'full-scale human catastrophe.' Five countries — Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe — have declared national disasters over the drought and resultant hunger. The WFP estimates that some 21 million children in southern Africa are now malnourished as crops have failed. Tens of millions in the region rely on small-scale agriculture that is irrigated by rain for their food and to make some money to buy provisions. Aid agencies warned of a potential disaster late last year as the naturally occurring El Nino led to below-average rainfall across the region, while its impact has been exacerbated by warming temperatures linked to climate change. 'This is the worst food crisis in decades,' WFP spokesperson Tomson Phiri said. 'October in southern Africa marks the start of the lean season, and each month is expected to be worse than the previous one until harvests next year in March and April. 'Crops have failed, livestock have perished and children are lucky to receive one meal per day.' The five countries that declared drought-related disasters have pleaded for international aid, while Angola on the west coast of Africa and Mozambique on the east coast are also 'severely affected,' Phiri said, showing the extent to which the drought has swept across the region. 'The situation is dire,' Phiri said. He said the WFP needs around $369 million to provide immediate help but has only received a fifth of that amid a shortfall in donations. The WFP has begun helping with food assistance and other 'critical support' on the request of various governments in the region, he said. Phiri noted southern Africa's crisis came at a time of 'soaring global needs' with humanitarian aid also desperately required in Gaza, Sudan and elsewhere. Other aid agencies have said this drought in southern Africa was especially harsh, with the United States aid agency, USAID, saying in June it was the most severe drought in 100 years during the January to March agricultural season, wiping out swathes of crops and food for millions. El Nino, a naturally occurring weather phenomenon which warms parts of the central Pacific, has different impacts on weather in different parts of the world. The latest El Nino formed in the middle of last year and ended in June. It was blamed, along with human-caused climate change and overall ocean warmth, for a wild 12 months of heat waves and extreme weather. In southern Africa, food prices have risen sharply in many areas affected by the drought, increasing the hardship. The drought has also had other damaging effects. Zambia has lost much of its electricity and been plunged into hours and sometimes days of power blackouts because it relies heavily on hydroelectric power from the huge Kariba Dam. The water level of the dam is so low that it can hardly generate any power. Zimbabwe shares the dam and is also experiencing regular power outages. Authorities in Namibia and Zimbabwe have resorted to killing wildlife, including elephants, to provide meat for hungry people. Scientists say sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable parts of the world to climate change because of a high dependency on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources. Millions of African livelihoods depend on the climate, while poor countries are unable to finance climate-resilience measures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-drought-from-el-nino-to-blame-for-southern-africa-s-worst-hunger-crisis-in-decades-/7822872.html	2024-10-15T06:40:14-07:00	
Frontex: Irregular EU border crossings fell 42% this year	Warsaw, — Detected irregular crossings into the European Union fell 42 percent in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year, EU border agency Frontex said on Tuesday. Frontex released its latest statistics shortly before a summit of the bloc's leaders in Brussels later this week, where immigration is among topics high on the agenda. The number of detected crossings into the EU 'fell by 42 percent to 166,000 in the first nine months of this year,' Frontex said. It said the biggest falls were along the routes through the Western Balkans and Central Mediterranean. Nearly 17,000 would-be asylum seekers crossed into the 27-member EU via the Western Balkans, a 79-percent drop. Some 47,700 entered via the Central Mediterranean, a fall of 64 percent. By contrast, Frontex said crossings via the Western African route had doubled, reaching over 30,600 in the first nine months of the year. The biggest rise was registered at the EU's eastern land borders, including into Poland. Almost 13,200 crossings were detected, a 192-percent increase on January-September 2023. Poland and its Central European neighbor, the Czech Republic, called last week for EU restrictions that are tougher than those in the bloc's new pact on migration and asylum, which is due to come into force in 2026. The rules, adopted in May, aim to share the responsibility for hosting asylum seekers across the 27 countries in the EU and to speed up the deportation of people deemed ineligible to stay.	https://www.voanews.com/a/frontex-irregular-eu-border-crossings-fell-42-this-year/7822786.html	2024-10-15T04:53:34-07:00	
EU energy ministers discuss Ukraine energy crisis, Russian LNG	BRUSSELS — EU energy ministers met in Luxembourg on Tuesday to discuss the bloc's rising Russian liquified natural gas imports, Ukraine's energy shortages ahead of winter and how to balance energy prices across member states, officials said. The EU agreed on a 14th package of sanctions in June including a ban on transshipments of Russian gas as of March 2025 but stopped short of an outright ban. Since then, Belgium and the Netherlands have seen a sharp increase in imports. In a letter on Monday, France and nine other countries asked the European Commission to propose stricter reporting obligations on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) for storage companies and suppliers. 'Belgium will file and we will support an initiative to ban and track LNG imports from Russia more structurally,' Kai Mykkanen, Finland's climate and environment minister, told reporters ahead of the meeting. Soon after Moscow began its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU announced an effort towards phasing out Russian fossil fuels 'as soon as possible' without setting a date. 'We have seen in Belgium a doubling of LNG volumes. These are probably destined for security of supply within Europe but we have difficulty implementing this [14th] package that's why we are calling for a tracking system,' said Tinne van der Straeten, Belgium's energy minister. After the major Nord Stream pipeline was blown up in 2022, Russian LNG imports to the EU increased, while piped gas still flows via Ukraine and Turkey to central Europe. 'Some countries have internal issues clouding their judgment preventing a fast switch but it's been two and a half years so it's time to find an alternative,' Krzysztof Bolesta, Poland's state energy minister, said. The contract between Ukraine and Russia for gas flows via Ukraine is due to end in December. Ukraine ahead of winter The International Energy Agency said Ukraine's winter electricity shortfall could reach six gigawatts (GW), exacerbated by the end of the Russian pipeline deal. The Commission will update countries on Tuesday on efforts to extend the Russia-Ukraine pipeline deal. Ukraine said it does not want to continue while Russia said it is willing. The ministers will also look at practical ways to help Ukraine through the winter. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Russia had knocked the 'power equivalent of the three Baltic states' and aims to restore about 15% of Ukraine's needs. Poland said it was in talks with Ukraine's transmission companies to raise exports while Lithuania has dismantled a power plant, which is being rebuilt in Ukraine. The ministers will discuss former ECB bank governor Mario Draghi's competitiveness report, on which the incoming Commission is expected to draft its new Clean Industrial Deal. Europe's gas and power prices are higher than in the United State and elsewhere, and they vary considerably across the bloc. In September, the Greek prime minister asked the EU to urgently respond to soaring power prices in central and eastern Europe. Draghi advocated a faster deployment of cheaper green energy solutions. However, aging power grids, red tape, and limited cross-border infrastructure have hampered efforts. 'There is work to do on simplifying the authorization of grid projects, mobilizing funding and do more integrated planning,' EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson told the meeting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-energy-ministers-discuss-ukraine-energy-crisis-russian-lng-/7822749.html	2024-10-15T04:25:48-07:00	
Russia, China bolster defense ties at 'substantive' talks	Russia and China held 'substantive' defense and military talks to bolster ties, Russia's defense minister said on Tuesday, as Moscow and Beijing cement a 'no limits' partnership and step up criticism of U.S. efforts to extend its influence in Asia. 'The military departments of Russia and China are united in their assessments of global processes, and they have a common understanding of what needs to be done in the current situation,' a post on the Russian defense ministry's Telegram messaging app cited Defense Minister Andrei Belousov as saying. Belousov said he met with China's central military commission vice chairman, Zhang Youxia for 'very substantive' talks. China's Defense Ministry said after the meeting that both sides hope to deepen and expand military relations and maintain high-level exchanges. Belousov's visit to Beijing took place as China's military vowed to take further action against Taiwan if needed after staging a day of war games it said were a warning to 'separatist acts' and which drew condemnation from the Taiwanese and U.S. governments. China and Russia declared a 'no limits' partnership in February 2022 when President Vladimir Putin visited Beijing less than three weeks before his forces launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, triggering the deadliest land war in Europe since World War II. In May this year, Putin and China's Xi Jinping pledged a 'new era' of partnership between the two most powerful rivals of the United States, which they cast as an aggressive Cold War hegemon sowing chaos across the world. Putin and Xi also agreed to deepen their 'strategic partnership,' Belousov said, without providing detail, adding he is confident that 'fruitful work and the adoption of significant, weighty decisions are ahead.' Russia said last week it was standing alongside China on Asian issues, including the criticism of the U.S. drive to extend its influence and 'deliberate attempts' to inflame the situation around Taiwan. The U.S. says China is supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine by supplying so-called dual use goods, including microelectronics, that can help it build weapons. China says it has not provided weaponry to any party, and that normal trade with Russia should not be interrupted or restricted.

Leaf-peepers are flocking to see New England's brilliant fall colors	MEREDITH, N.H. — New England leaf-watching season is in full swing, as people from as far as Florida and Berlin flock to the region for scenic drives, train rides and bus tours to soak in the splendid hues of red, orange and bronze. With quaint towns and covered bridges scattered through swaths of changing forest, the rural Northeast provides an ideal setting to view nature's annual show. 'Leaf-peeping is one of the most accessible tourism things that you can do,' said Teddy Willey, the general manager of the Frog Rock Tavern in Meredith, New Hampshire. 'You don’t have to have the athleticism to be a hiker, you don’t have to have the money to own a boat.' You just need to be able to jump in a car and head north, he said. 'Once you’re there, you just take it in,' Willey said. He spoke just after his tavern was flooded with tourists from Indiana who had stepped off a sightseeing bus. Among them was Vicky Boesch, of Fort Wayne, who had made the trip with her sisters. 'We came out to the Northeast to see the beautiful foliage and the colorful leaves,' she said, adding the she was impressed with Vermont. 'The leaves were very pretty on the mountains because the sun was out yesterday, and so that makes them pop more,' she said. It wasn't only the fall colors that provided a contrast with Indiana, she said, but also the region's distinctive architecture, lakes and towns. Gordon Cochran, of Lake View, Iowa, said he was in New Hampshire to visit his daughter and had a 'beautiful ride' on the slow-moving Winnipesaukee Scenic Railroad. Weather conditions associated with climate change have disrupted some recent leaf-peeping seasons. One problem is that global warming has brought drought that causes leaves to turn brown and wither before they can reach their colorful peak. Willey acknowledges that he's not a leaf guy. 'Personally, no. I grew up here, so I think it loses its luster a little bit,' he said with a chuckle, adding that the season still has its moments. 'I’ll be driving somewhere around the Lakes Region, and all of a sudden, you're like, ‘You know what, there’s a reason why people come here and there’s a reason I live here. It really is quite beautiful,’' he said, referring to a scenic part of eastern New Hampshire.	https://www.voanews.com/a/leaf-peepers-are-flocking-to-see-new-england-s-brilliant-fall-colors-/7822688.html	2024-10-15T02:10:18-07:00	
Summit in Australia urges science to do more to embrace First Nations climate knowledge	SYDNEY — An international conference in Australia of First Nations people is calling on scientists to engage with Indigenous experts to find solutions to climate change. Indigenous Australians consider the land to be the mother of creation. To them, it is a living, breathing mass that contains secrets and wisdom. Tribal leaders have gathered in Dubbo, 390 kilometers northwest of Sydney, to urge governments and scientists to do more to harness the knowledge of First Nations peoples to combat climate change. In an official video, Glen Wingfield of the Kokatha Aboriginal Corporation in South Australia said the conference is part of a growing movement. 'We get on top of this (and) try to slow this global warming and all that stuff and get the message out to young people,' Wingfield said. 'We need more and more voices. If there is one or two people, you go and knock at the door, they tell you to go away. If you are going to come with a big mob, now they are going to start listening.' Indigenous communities around the world have relied on a deep understanding of their environments to survive. Kyle Whyte, professor of Environmental Justice at the University of Michigan, is attending the summit as a science envoy for the U.S. State Department. He has said previously that First Nations people around the world have already been through an environmental 'apocalypse' because of the theft of customary lands. He told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Tuesday that the impact of dispossession continues to this day. 'Going back several centuries it was Indigenous peoples’ lands that were first sacrificed to make way for mining and other industries that we now know are responsible for human-caused climate change,' he said. The Canadian government has set up a partnership with Indigenous people to help tackle climate change. In 2023, the Ottawa government said, 'First Nations, Inuit, and Métis in Canada are at the forefront of efforts to…adapt to the impacts of our changing climate.' In New Zealand, authorities have acknowledged that for many Indigenous Maori, climate change 'is not an isolated risk' but is 'intrinsically linked to other issues, such as social development needs, housing, environmental degradation…and poverty.' Indigenous elders have said that the First Nations people of Australia, who make up about 3% of the national population, contribute the least to climate change, 'yet the impacts of climate change are affecting us most severely.' The climate summit in Dubbo runs Oct 14-18 and is jointly run by the local Tubba-Gah Wiradjuri Aboriginal Corporation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/summit-in-australia-urges-science-to-do-more-to-embrace-first-nations-climate-knowledge-/7822681.html	2024-10-15T01:54:34-07:00	
Iran condemns EU, UK sanctions on Tehran, denies providing ballistic missiles to Russia	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran condemned new EU and British sanctions on Tehran and denied providing ballistic missiles to Russia, spokesperson for Iran's Foreign Ministry, Esmaeil Baghaei, said in a post on X on Tuesday. The European Union agreed on Monday to impose sanctions on seven people and seven organizations, including airline Iran Air, for their links to Iranian transfers of ballistic missiles to Russia. The listings also include Saha Airlines and Mahan Air and Iran's Deputy Defense Minister Seyed Hamzeh Ghalandari. At the same time, Britain added nine new designations under its Iran sanctions regime. Last month, the United States, citing intelligence it said had been shared with allies, said Russia had received ballistic missiles from Iran for its war in Ukraine. Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson denied on Tuesday his country provided ballistic missiles to Russia. 'Some European countries and the UK have unfortunately claimed without evidence that Iran has militarily intervened in this conflict which is totally refuted,' Baghaei said, referring to the Russia-Ukraine war. Baghaei condemned the fresh sanctions saying that imposing new sanctions by the European Union and the UK on Iranian individuals and entities goes against international law. Also facing sanctions under the EU move are prominent officials from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard and the managing directors of Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industries and Aerospace Industries Organization. The sanctions include an asset freeze and a travel ban to the European Union.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-condemns-eu-uk-sanctions-on-tehran-denies-providing-ballistic-missiles-to-russia/7822672.html	2024-10-15T01:28:19-07:00	
Deadly Russian missile attack hits Mykolaiv	Officials in Ukraine’s Mykolaiv region said Tuesday a Russian missile attack killed at least one person and injured 16 others. Mykolaiv Governor Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram the attack damaged an infrastructure facility, restaurant and shopping areas, as well as residential buildings. Ukraine’s military said Tuesday that Russia’s overnight attacks included nine missiles and 17 drones, with Ukraine’s air defenses destroying 12 of the drones. The drone intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa and Poltava regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it destroyed Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod, Kursk and Tula regions. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said an explosive device dropped from a drone hit a residential building and injured one person. NATO's secretary-general said Monday the alliance will continue to support Ukraine, despite threats from Russia. Speaking at NATO's Ukraine mission in Wiesbaden, Germany, Mark Rutte said the message for Russian President Vladimir Putin 'is that we will continue, that we will do what's necessary to make sure that he will not get his way. That Ukraine will prevail.' The NATO alliance is 'the strongest military alliance in world history, serving 1 billion people,' Rutte said. We stand ready to confront any threat. We will never get intimidated by our adversaries.' Monday was Rutte's first visit to the Ukraine mission known as NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine, which will eventually take over the coordination of Western military aid to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his daily address Monday that the Foreign Intelligence Service and the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine had delivered a 'quite detailed' report on 'the intentions of the Russians for the fall and winter' for their continuing invasion of Ukraine. The report included revelations about North Korea's involvement in the war and Russia's relationship with other countries that 'unfortunately, are investing in prolonging the war.' President Zelenskyy warned that 'whoever helps Russia, we will respond as toughly as necessary to defend Ukraine.' He said, 'There will be respective work with our partners to ensure that Russia's intentions do not work.' Zelenskyy added that this week, 'Ukraine will present to all our partners in Europe our strategy for compelling Russia to bring this war to a just end.' The strategy, known as the 'victory plan,' has not yet been made public. Some information for this report was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-russian-missile-attack-hits-mykolaiv/7822668.html	2024-10-15T01:14:08-07:00	
Son of Singapore's founding PM Lee says plans to demolish family home	SINGAPORE — The youngest child of Singapore's founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said on Tuesday he would apply to demolish the statesman's home in line with his wishes, following the death of Lee's daughter last week. Lee Kuan Yew's three children, one of whom is Singapore's third Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, were split on what to do with their father's home after his death in 2015, in a public spat that saw the siblings estranged. Eldest son Lee Hsien Loong, who stepped down as Singapore's prime minister earlier this year, thought it should be up to the government to decide what to do with the property, including potentially retaining it as a heritage landmark. However his sister, Lee Wei Ling, who died on Oct. 9, and younger brother Lee Hsien Yang said the single-story bungalow, built in 1898 in central Singapore, should be demolished in accordance with their father's wishes. 'After my sister's passing, I am the only living executor of my father Lee Kuan Yew's estate,' Lee Hsien Yang wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. 'In his will, he wished for the house to be demolished 'immediately after' Wei Ling moved out of the house. It is my duty to carry out his wishes to the fullest extent of the law.' He said he would apply to demolish the house and planned to build a small private dwelling to be retained by the family, adding that it was time for the government to approve the demolition. The office of current Prime Minister Lawrence Wong did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lee Kuan Yew told the Straits Times newspaper in 2011 that he wanted the house demolished because it would 'become a shambles' if it were opened to the public, and he hoped its removal would improve land values in the neighborhood. In 2018, a ministerial committee set up to consider the future of the house laid out three options, and said the decision would be left to a future government. The options were to retain the property by officially categorizing it as a national monument or for conservation, retain the basement dining room, which has the greatest historical significance and tear down the rest of the property, or allow the property to be fully demolished for redevelopment. At that time, Lee Hsien Loong said he accepted the committee's conclusion and the range of options laid out.	https://www.voanews.com/a/son-of-singapore-s-founding-pm-lee-says-plans-to-demolish-family-home/7822611.html	2024-10-14T23:27:18-07:00

Hong Kong policy address seen pivoting from security to economic growth	HONG KONG — Hong Kong is expected to announce measures to boost the city's economy in its annual policy address on Wednesday, including slashing liquor tariffs, as it seeks to revive the financial hub that has been struggling to recover since the pandemic. Hong Kong's small and open economy has felt the ripple effects of a slowdown in the Chinese economy. The city's economy expanded by 3.3% in the second quarter from a year earlier, and is forecast to grow 2.5-3.5% for the year. Although tourism numbers have rebounded since COVID, with 46 million visitors expected this year, consumption and retail spending remain sluggish, while stock listings have dried up and capital flight remains a challenge. In February, Hong Kong's financial secretary announced new measures spanning property, tourism and financial services, noting headwinds including a complex geopolitical environment and ballooning budget deficits. But in a meeting last month between China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, Xia Baolong and Hong Kong leader John Lee, Xia emphasized a need for further 'reforms' to spur economic growth, in line with China's national strategy. He called on the Hong Kong government to 'unite and lead all sectors of society' to promote reforms, while urging businessmen to help in this drive. One commentator in the state-run China Daily said Xia's speech suggested a need for 'economic and social reforms.' Lee has said the focus this year would be on economic development and people's livelihoods. His government pushed through new national security laws in March which Lee said had improved stability. Some countries including the U.S. have criticized Lee for leading a years-long security crackdown that has jailed opposition democrats, shutdown liberal media outlets and curbed freedoms. Local media also reported possible plans to phase out some of Hong Kong's more squalid sub-divided flats, tiny cubicles that have been criticized as below acceptable living standards. Lee is also expected to push more tourism-related initiatives. On real estate, a key pillar of the economy, Lee is under pressure to do more to revive a market that has fallen around a fifth from its 2021 peak. Some market players, including Midland Realty's Hong Kong residential CEO Sammy Po, have called for further cutting of red tape to help Chinese buyers, including younger ones on talent schemes, to transfer capital and secure mortgages. Liquor taxes could also be slashed from the current 100% - one of the highest rates globally - to try to turn the city into a spirits trading hub in the way that it became an Asian wine trading hub after wine duties were abolished in 2008. The move may benefit local bars and restaurants that have struggled since COVID, with many local residents now opting to travel across the northern border to the Chinese city of Shenzhen to dine more cheaply. Retail sales were down 7.7% for the first eight months of 2024 compared with the same period a year before.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-policy-address-seen-pivoting-from-security-to-economic-growth-/7822593.html	2024-10-14T22:29:24-07:00	
Petronas' exploration in South China Sea will continue, Malaysia PM says	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday reiterated that state energy firm Petronas will continue to conduct oil and gas exploration activities in Malaysia's exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea, despite objections from China. This includes exploration activities in Petronas' Kasawari gas development off Sarawak state on Borneo, he told parliament. 'We will continue, but we will not close the door on discussions with any country,' Anwar said. He said Malaysia had territorial disputes with many of its neighbors, including Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia, and said undue focus was placed on its differences with China. 'We have issues but these issues do not affect diplomatic relations. These issues do not affect trade relations and close friendships with our neighbors,' he said. Anwar said last month Malaysia's exploration activities were within its territory and were not intended to be provocative or hostile towards China, following the media leak of a diplomatic note from Beijing. In the note, carried by a Philippine news outlet, Beijing asserted that Malaysia's oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea breached its territory. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea and has deployed a fleet of coast guards deep into Southeast Asia, including the EEZs of Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Vietnam, complicating those country's exploration efforts. China rejects a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague that Beijing's expansive claims had no basis under international law. Petronas's oil and gas projects in the South China Sea have had several encounters with Chinese vessels in recent years. The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, a U.S. think tank, said in a report this month that Chinese coast guard vessels have made frequent visits to Malaysian exploratory wells off Sarawak this year, passing as close as 1,000 meters from gas production platforms at Timi, Kasawari, and Jerun. Petronas' Kasawari field holds an estimated 10 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves and commenced first production in August this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/petronas-exploration-in-south-china-sea-will-continue-malaysia-pm-says/7822580.html	2024-10-14T21:53:12-07:00	
Beijing’s fiscal stimulus gets mixed responses in Chinese stocks	Taipei, Taiwan — China’s stock markets had a volatile day on Monday, showing mixed responses to the finance ministry’s latest fiscal policies, released during a closely watched briefing over the weekend. Hong Kong shares dropped 0.75% while its mainland peers rebounded, including the Shanghai Composite’s 2.07% gain, although the rally slowed. While some investors remained hopeful on Beijing’s promise of fiscal support, analysts warned that the fiscal measures, along with the central bank’s monetary easing in late September, are neither aggressive enough nor growth boosting although they are in 'the right direction' to address structural issues facing the world’s second-largest economy. Disappointing fiscal stimulus 'Markets conversation has already started to come up with the consensus that monetary injection or interest rate cuts cannot fix the fundamental problem,' Raymond Yeung, the Hong Kong-based chief economist of Greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, told VOA on Saturday. He added that investors in China were left guessing on the size of the government’s stimulus. Prior to the weekend briefing, investors were reportedly hoping for a 2 trillion to 10 trillion yuan ($283 billion-$1.4 trillion) stimulus package as China had pumped 4 trillion yuan ($564 trillion) to bail out its economy in 2008. China’s Finance Minister Lan Foan, however, stayed mum on the size of the stimulus package Saturday, although he pledged support to defuse local debt risks, bolster the country’s sagging property market and hinted at a deficit increase for additional fiscal support, if needed. That, Yeung said, was a 'very conservative approach' since Beijing probably doesn’t want 'a stock market bubble,' yet it wouldn’t help Chinese stock investors assess their trade this week. Stimulus can’t fix the economy He also expected market corrections to continue, as investors are concerned over whether Beijing’s stimulus plan can make the immediate growth-boosting impact to reverse high unemployment rates and the economic slowdown. The central bank’s monetary easing failed to reduce inflation in September, with both consumer and producer price growth falling short of expectations and deflationary pressures continuing to worsen. China’s consumer price index, a key gauge of inflation, grew lower-than-expected by 0.4% last month, compared to August’s increase of 0.6%, China’s National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday. Also, China’s producer price index, which measures the cost of goods at the factory gate, fell by 2.8% in September, marking the 24th consecutive month of decline. But the monetary policy helped push China’s stock prices higher for seven consecutive trading days before they took the biggest dive since 2020 last Wednesday due to a lack of new stimulus measures. Stock market correction to continue? On Saturday, while some users of the Chinese social media platform, Weibo, shared Lan’s optimistic views toward China’s economic outlook, others expressed disappointment, saying that they expect Chinese shares to see a weeklong free fall. A Weibo user in Hunan, named 'adrianolove1999,' wrote that he expects to ‘’bottom fish’’ this Friday. ‘’Why Friday? Because the shares will have a five-day losing streak.' He Jiangbing, an economist based in Hubei, China, said, by his estimate, the finance ministry is planning at least 3.2 trillion yuan ($451 trillion) worth of bond issuances, which await a final approval from the standing committee of the National People’s Congress when it meets later this month. Those will include 1 trillion yuan ($141 trillion) to replenish six major state-run bank’s capital for lending, another 1.2 trillion yuan ($169 trillion) as debt relief for local governments and the remaining 1 trillion yuan ($141 trillion) as subsidies to boost consumption or reserved for the under-privileged class, he added. Given the central government’s financial difficulty, He describes the size of the stimulus plan as 'good enough' to help ease liquidity or boost share prices. Putting the cart before the horse But such money-printing measures won’t address the root cause of China’s economic slowdown, he said. 'The [Chinese] economy won’t be revived by such fiscal policy, which can only keep the economy from collapsing. This is putting the cart before the horse. Printing money won’t solve any problem,' the economist told VOA by phone. China needs to improve its relations with the world’s major economies, which in turn will boost its exports and stop the exodus of foreign businesses, especially at a time when two thirds of China-based Japanese companies have left, he said. China also needs to reverse its emphasis on state-run businesses and its earlier course of tightening regulatory oversight, which has been threatening the survival of private enterprises, he added. Without addressing these root causes first, he argued, China’s economy won’t recover.	https://www.voanews.com/a/beijing-s-fiscal-stimulus-gets-mixed-responses-in-chinese-stocks/7822576.html	2024-10-14T21:30:06-07:00	
North Korea blows up parts of inter-Korean roads as tensions with South Korea soar	SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea said North Korea blew up the northern parts of inter-Korean roads no longer in use on Tuesday, as the rivals are locked in rising animosities over North Korea's claim that South Korea flew drones over its capital, Pyongyang. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a brief statement that North Korea blew up parts of the roads on Tuesday. It said South Korea's military is bolstering its readiness and surveillance posture but gave no further details. The explosions came a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called a meeting with his top military and security officials. During the meeting, Kim described the alleged South Korean drone flights as the 'enemy's serious provocation' and laid out unspecified tasks related to 'immediate military action' and the operation of his 'war deterrent' for defending the country's sovereignty, the North's state media reported earlier Tuesday. North Korea earlier put frontline artillery and other army units on standby to launch strikes on South Korea, if drones from South Korea are found over North Korea again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned it would sternly punish North Korea if the safety of its citizens is threatened. Destroying the roads would be in line with leader Kim Jong Un's push to cut off ties with South Korea, formally cement it as his country's principal enemy and abandon the North's decades-long objective to seek a peaceful Korean unification. During the previous era of inter-Korean detente in the 2000s, the two Koreas reconnected two road routes and two rail tracks across their heavily fortified border. But their operations later were suspended one by one as the Koreas wrangled over North Korea's nuclear program and other issues. Last week, North Korea said it would permanently block its border with South Korea and build front-line defense structures to cope with 'confrontational hysteria' by South Korean and U.S. forces. South Korean officials said North Korea had already been adding anti-tank barriers and laying mines along the border since earlier this year. They said North Korea has also planted mines and removed lamps along its sections of the inter-Korean roads and taken out ties on the northern side of the railways.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-blows-up-parts-of-inter-korean-roads-as-tensions-with-south-korea-soar/7822568.html	2024-10-14T21:16:51-07:00	
Taiwan details record surge in Chinese warplanes involved in war games	Taipai, Taiwan — Taiwan's defense ministry on Tuesday detailed the surge in Chinese warplane activity around the island during war games the previous day, saying it had detected a record 153 Chinese military aircraft. China held a single day of what it called 'Joint Sword-2024B' drills on Monday as a warning to 'separatist acts,' following last week's national day speech by Taiwan President Lai Ching-te that Beijing denounced. In its daily update on Chinese military activity around the island in the previous 24 hours, Taiwan's defense ministry said it spotted 153 Chinese military aircraft, updating a figure given on Monday evening of 125 which it had already said was a record high for a single day. Of those aircraft, according to a map the ministry released, 28 crossed the sensitive median line of the Taiwan Strait, which had previously served as an unofficial barrier and which China says it does not recognize. Other areas of activity included off Taiwan's southeastern coast, home to a major Taiwanese air base, and to the southwest of Taiwan, at the top part of the South China Sea where the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands are located. There were also 14 Chinese navy ships and 12 'official ships' - which refers to the coast guard and other military adjacent vessels - spotted, the ministry said. Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Premier Cho Jung-tai said the drills were not just a Taiwan issue. 'Any drills without prior warning will cause great disturbance to peace and stability in the entire region,' he said. 'China's drills not only affect Taiwan's neighborhood, but also seriously affect the entire international navigational rights and air and sea space, so attracted the attention of other countries.' Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's territorial claims, and says only the island's people can decide their future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-details-record-surge-in-chinese-warplanes-involved-in-war-games/7822564.html	2024-10-14T21:00:32-07:00

Ailing and silenced in prison, Belarus activist symbolizes the nation's repression	TALLINN, Estonia — The last time any of Maria Kolesnikova's family had contact with the imprisoned Belarusian opposition activist was more than 18 months ago. Fellow inmates at the penal colony reported hearing her plead for medical help from inside her tiny, smelly cell. Her father, Alexander Kolesnikov, told The Associated Press by phone from Minsk that he knows she's seriously ill and tried to visit her several months ago at the facility near Gomel, where she is serving an 11-year sentence, but has failed whenever he goes there. On his last attempt, he said the warden told him, 'If she doesn't call or doesn't write, that means she doesn't want to.' The 42-year-old musician-turned-activist is known to have been hospitalized in Gomel in May or June, but the outcome was unclear, said a former prisoner who identified herself only as Natalya because she feared retaliation from authorities. 'I can only pray to God that she is still alive,' Kolesnikov said in an interview. 'The authorities are ignoring my requests for a meeting and for letters — it is a terrible feeling of impotence for a father.' Kolesnikova gained prominence when mass protests erupted in Belarus after the widely disputed August 2020 election gave authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko a sixth term in office. With her close-cropped hair, broad smile and a gesture of forming her outstretched hands into the shape of a heart, she often was seen at the front of the demonstrations. She became an even greater symbol of defiance in September of that year when Belarusian authorities tried to deport her. Driven to the Ukrainian border, she briefly broke away from security forces in the neutral zone at the frontier and tore up her passport, then walked back into Belarus. She was convicted a year later of charges including conspiracy to seize power. Natalya, whose cell was next to Kolesnikova’s before being released in August, said she had not heard her talking to guards for six months. Other inmates heard Kolesnikova's pleas for medical assistance, she said, but reported that doctors did not come for 'a very long time.' In November 2022, Kolesnikova was moved to an intensive care ward to undergo surgery for a perforated ulcer. Other prisoners become aware of her movements because 'it feels like martial law has been declared' in the cellblock, Natalya said. 'Other prisoners are strictly forbidden not only to talk, but even to exchange glances with Maria.' Her sister, Tatiana Khomich, said she was told by former inmates that the 5 feet, 9 inches Kolesnikova weighed only about 45 kilograms (100 pounds). 'They are slowly killing Maria, and I consider that this is a critical period because no one can survive in such conditions,' said Khomich, who lives outside Belarus. The last time Kolesnikova wrote from prison was in February 2023. Letters to her 'are ripped up before her eyes by prison personnel,' her sister said, relaying accounts from other former inmates. Kolesnikova, who before the 2020 protests was a classical flutist who was especially knowledgeable about baroque music, is one of several major Lukashenko opponents to disappear behind bars. The prisons department of the Belarusian Interior Ministry refused to comment on Kolesnikova’s case. The U.N. Human Rights Committee has repeatedly demanded Belarusian authorities take 'urgent protective measures' in relation to Kolesnikova and other political prisoners held incommunicado. In September, the European Parliament demanded that Belarus release all political prisoners. Former inmates say Kolesnikova wore a yellow tag that indicates a political prisoner. That marks them for additional abuse by guards and officials, rights advocates say. The human rights group Viasna counts about 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, including the group's Nobel Peace Prize-winning founder, Ales Bialiatsky. At least six have died behind bars. 'It was too late to save Alexei Navalny (from prison in Russia), and it was too late for six people in Belarus. We and the Western world don't have much time to save Maria's life,' Khomich said. Amnesty International has begun a campaign to raise awareness about Kolesnikova's fate, urging people to take up her plight with Western officials and politicians. Other prominent opposition figures who are imprisoned and have not been heard from in a year or more include Siarhei Tsikhanouski, who planned to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 election but was imprisoned; his wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, took his place on the ballot and was forced to leave the country the day after the vote. Aspiring opposition candidate Viktar Babaryka also was imprisoned before the election as his popularity among prospective voters soared. Kolesnikova was his campaign manager but then joined forces with Tsikhanouskaya. Prominent opposition figure Mikola Statkevich and Kolesnikova's lawyer, Maxim Znak, are imprisoned and have not contacted the outside world since the winter of 2023. Lukashenko denies Belarus has any political prisoners. At the same time, in recent months he has unexpectedly released 115 prisoners whose cases had political elements; those released had health problems, wrote petitions for pardons and repented. Belarus is deeply integrated with Russia, and some observers believe Lukashenko is concerned about the extent of his dependence on Moscow, hoping to restore some ties with the European Union by releasing political prisoners ahead of a presidential election next year. 'Minsk is returning to the practice of bargaining with the West to try to soften sanctions and achieve at least partial recognition of the results of the upcoming presidential election,' said Belarusian analyst Alexander Friedman. 'Lukashenko’s regime is interested in not becoming part of Russia and therefore wants at least some communication with the West, offering to talk about political prisoners.' Lukashenko’s critics and human rights activists say they see no real change in government policy since all leading pro-democracy figures are still behind bars and authorities have seized three times as many opposition activists to refill the prisons. 'It is difficult to consider these pardons as a real thaw since the repressions continue, but the West should encourage Lukashenko to continue releasing political prisoners,' Khomich said. 'The regime is sending clear signals to Western countries about its readiness to release people, and it's very important that [the signal] is heard, and the opportunity is seized.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ailing-and-silenced-in-prison-belarus-activist-symbolizes-the-nation-s-repression/7822524.html	2024-10-14T18:31:06-07:00	
Pakistan hosts major security meeting as it struggles against rising insurgent violence	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan is hosting a major security meeting this week, with senior leaders from longtime ally China and archrival India among those attending. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization was established in 2001 by China and Russia to discuss security concerns in Central Asia and the wider region. But it’s Pakistan’s own security that is under the microscope. An attack on a foreign ambassadors’ convoy, violent protests by supporters of an imprisoned former prime minister and a bombing outside Pakistan’s biggest airport are signs the country is struggling to contain multiplying threats from insurgents. The meeting, which begins Tuesday in Islamabad, comes at a crucial time for the government. Here’s why: Armed groups are outpacing the army Pakistan says it has foiled attacks through intelligence-based operations and preventative measures. It frequently vows 'to root out terrorism.' But the frequency and scale of the recent violence give the impression that the government isn’t in control and raises questions about its ability to protect key sites and foreigners, let alone Pakistanis. In the last few weeks, separatists from Pakistan's southwest Balochistan province have killed Chinese nationals in Karachi, Pakistan’s biggest city, as well as more than 20 miners in an attack on housing at a coal mine and seven workers in another attack. The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, is better at mobilizing fighters in different areas, and its operational capabilities have increased. The group wants independence for the province. It’s not interested in overthrowing the state to establish a caliphate, which is what the Pakistani Taliban want. But the two groups have a common enemy — the government. Analysts have said the BLA is getting support from the Pakistani Taliban. But, even without an alliance, attacks in the southwest are becoming more audacious and brutal, indicating that the BLA’s tactics are evolving and taking the security apparatus by surprise. The Pakistani Taliban continue their shootings and bombings in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan. It could be difficult for militants to hit the meeting, given the security around it and the areas where delegates will stay. But they could still wreak havoc. Vehicles are often just waved through street checkpoints in Islamabad. Aside from government buildings and top hotels, body searches and under-vehicle scanners are rare. 'At stake for the entire state is the only mission: how to hold such an event peacefully,' said Imtiaz Gul, executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies. 'How to get it done without any unpleasant incidents taking place. It’s going to be a formidable challenge for the government to disprove the notion of failures within the security apparatus.' Pakistan is paying the price for shutdowns Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said last week that the national economy suffered cumulative daily losses of more than $684 million on account of recent agitation. He was referring to supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan reaching the heart of the capital, despite a suspension of cellphone service and placement of shipping containers at access points to the city. The shutdown hit most business sectors, the gig economy, point-of-sale transactions, commuters, students, workers and more. Pakistan can’t afford to incur such losses or deepen people’s grievances. It relies on International Monetary Fund bailouts and multibillion-dollar deals and loans from friendly countries to meet its economic needs. There are regular protests over energy bills and the cost of living. Despite people's hardships, authorities have declared a three-day holiday surrounding the meeting. There have been reports of the government ordering the closure of wedding halls, restaurants, hotels, cafes and markets in Islamabad and the neighboring garrison city Rawalpindi for security reasons. Officials denied the reports, but not very strenuously. 'Generally, high-profile conferences are meant to promote connectivity, trade and improve a country’s image,' said Gul. But not in this case because Islamabad won't look like a normal city, he said. 'It seems they lack innovative thinking,' Gul said. 'They are unable to use smart approaches, and that’s why the easier way is to shut everything down.' A seat at the table and saving face The last time Pakistan hosted a major conference was in March 2022, a month before Khan was kicked out of office and a new cycle of upheaval started. The country's security situation and political instability are two factors that have prevented it from holding big international events. Even its best-loved sport, cricket, has suffered. There was a 10-year absence of test matches after terrorists ambushed a Sri Lanka team bus in 2009, killing eight people and injuring players and officials. The meeting is Pakistan’s chance to shine, especially in front of its neighbor China, to whom it is in hock by several billion dollars and whose nationals are prime targets for armed groups, as well as India, which is sending its foreign minister to the country for the first time since 2015. India and Pakistan have fought three wars and built up their armies but also developed nuclear weapons. China and India fought a war over their border in 1962. Pakistan, unused to hosting such a high-level meeting, will have to put its best face forward. Senior defense analyst Abdullah Khan said the government wants to show its international legitimacy amid the domestic crises. 'The presence of heads of state and other senior officials will itself be a success as Pakistan will come out of its so-called isolation,' said Khan. 'A peacefully held SCO will further improve the country’s image.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-hosts-major-security-meeting-as-it-struggles-against-rising-insurgent-violence/7822519.html	2024-10-14T17:51:14-07:00	
Europe's water security under threat, environment agency warns	Copenhagen, Denmark — Pollution, habitat degradation, climate change and overuse of freshwater resources are putting a strain on Europe, with only a third of its surface water in good health, the European Environment Agency warned Tuesday. 'The health of Europe's waters is not good. Our waters face an unprecedented set of challenges that threatens Europe's water security,' EEA executive director Leena Yla-Mononen said in a statement. Only 37% of Europe's surface water bodies achieved 'good' or 'high' ecological status, a measure of aquatic ecosystem health, the EEA report said. Meanwhile, only 29% of surface waters achieved 'good' chemical status over the 2015-21 period, according to data reported by EU member states. Europe's groundwaters — the source of most drinking water on the continent — fared better, with 77% enjoying 'good' chemical status. Good chemical status means the water is free of excessive pollution from chemical nutrients and toxic substances like PFAS and microplastics. Surface water is threatened by air pollution — such as coal burning and car emissions — as well as the agriculture industry, whose dumped waste contaminates the soil. 'European agriculture needs to increase its use of more sustainable organic and agro-ecological practices, accompanied by incentives and a change in our food and dietary habits,' the report said. The European agency analyzed 120,000 surface water bodies and 3.8 million square kilometers (1.5 million square miles) of groundwater body areas in 19 EU countries and Norway. It called on EEA member states to halve their use of pesticides by 2030. 'We need to redouble our efforts to restore the health of our valued rivers, lakes, coastal waters and other water bodies, and to make sure this vital resource is resilient and secure for generations to come,' Yla-Mononen said. Climate change effects, including extreme droughts and flooding, and the overuse of freshwater resources are putting a strain on Europe's lakes, rivers, coastal waters and groundwaters 'like never before,' the EEA said. Governments must prioritize reducing water consumption and restoring ecosystems, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-s-water-security-under-threat-environment-agency-warns-/7822511.html	2024-10-14T17:44:17-07:00	
North Korea's Kim holds security meeting as tensions with Seoul soar	SEOUL, SOuth Korea — North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un convened a top national security meeting Monday, state media reported, directing a plan of 'immediate military action' at a time of spiking tensions with the South. The meeting in Pyongyang was attended by the country's top security officials, including the army chief and other military officials, as well as the ministers of state security and defense. 'He set forth the direction of immediate military action and indicated important tasks to be fulfilled in the operation of the war deterrent and the exercise of the right to self-defense,' the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported. The meeting comes as the nuclear-armed North has accused Seoul of flying drones over its capital and moved troops to its border, with South Korea saying Monday it was 'fully ready' to respond if fired upon. Officials at the meeting in Pyongyang heard a report on the 'enemy's serious provocation,' KCNA reported, an apparent reference to the drone flights. Kim 'expressed a tough political and military stand' at the meeting, state media said. The North has accused Seoul of being responsible for the drones, which dropped propaganda leaflets filled with 'inflammatory rumors and rubbish,' and warned on Sunday that it would consider it 'a declaration of war' if another drone was detected. Seoul's military initially denied it was behind the flights, with local speculation centered on activist groups in the South that have long sent propaganda and U.S. currency northward, typically by balloon. The United Nations Command, which oversees the armistice that ended active fighting in the 1950 to 1953 Korean War, said it was aware of the North Korean claim. 'The command is currently investigating the matter in strict accordance with the Armistice Agreement,' it said. The two Koreas remain technically at war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-holds-security-meeting-as-tensions-with-seoul-soar/7822509.html	2024-10-14T17:28:47-07:00

Britain to allow drones to inspect power lines, wind turbines	london — Britain's aviation regulator said Tuesday that it would allow drones to inspect infrastructure such as power lines and wind turbines, a move the authority has described as a significant milestone. The U.K.'s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had said earlier this year that it wanted to permit more drone flying for such activities as well as for deliveries and emergency services. It selected in August six projects to test it. Drones inspecting infrastructure will now be able to fly distances beyond remote flyers' ability to see them. 'While some drones have been flying beyond visual line of sight in the U.K. for several years, these flights are primarily trials under strict restrictions,' the CAA said. Under the CAA's new policy, some drones will be able to remain at low heights close to infrastructure where there is little or no potential for any other aircraft to operate. It will also reduce costs, the CAA said. Drones will inspect power lines for damage, carry out maintenance checks of wind turbines and even be used as 'flying guard dogs' for site security. The CAA will work with several operators to test and evaluate the policy, which according to the regulator's director, Sophie O'Sullivan, 'paves the way for new ways drones will improve everyday life.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-to-allow-drones-to-inspect-power-lines-wind-turbines/7822493.html	2024-10-14T17:02:34-07:00	
UN: Over 400,000 children in Lebanon displaced in 3 weeks by war	BEIRUT — More than 400,000 children in Lebanon have been displaced in the past three weeks, a top official with the U.N. children’s agency said Monday, warning of a 'lost generation' in the small country grappling with multiple crises and now in the middle of war. Israel has escalated its campaign against the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group, including launching a ground invasion, after a year of exchanges of fire during its war with Hamas in Gaza. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, most of them fleeing to Beirut and elsewhere in the north over the past three weeks since the escalation. Ted Chaiban, UNICEF's deputy executive director for humanitarian actions, has visited schools that have been turned into shelters to host displaced families. 'What struck me is that this war is three weeks old and so many children have been affected,' Chaiban told The Associated Press in Beirut. 'As we sit here today, 1.2 million children are deprived of education. Their public schools have either been rendered inaccessible, have been damaged by the war or are being used as shelters. The last thing this country needs, in addition to everything else it has gone through, is the risk of a lost generation.' While some Lebanese private schools are still operating, the public school system has been badly affected by the war, along with the country's most vulnerable people, such as Palestinian and Syrian refugees. ″What I’m worried about is that we have hundreds of thousands of Lebanese, Syrian, Palestinian children that are at risk of losing their learning,' Chaiban said. More than 2,300 people in Lebanon have been killed in Israeli strikes, nearly 75% of them over the last month, according to the Health Ministry. In the last three weeks, more than 100 children were killed and over 800 were wounded, Chaiban said. He said displaced children are crammed into overcrowded shelters where three or four families can live in a classroom separated by a plastic sheet, and where 1,000 people can share 12 toilets. Not all of them work. Many displaced families have set up tents along roads or on public beaches. Most displaced children have experienced so much violence, including the sounds of shelling or gunshots, that they cower at any loud noise, Chaiban said. Then there is 'evacuation orders upon evacuation orders. We’re at the beginning, and already there’s been a profound impact,' he said. The escalation has also put over 100 primary health care facilities out of service, while 12 hospitals are either no longer working or partially functional. Water infrastructure has also come under attack. In the last three weeks, 26 water stations providing water to almost 350,000 people have been damaged, Chaiban said. UNICEF is working with local authorities to repair them. He called for civilian infrastructure to be protected. And he appealed for a cease-fire in Lebanon and in Gaza, saying there needs to be political will and a realization that the conflict cannot be resolved through military means. 'What we must do is make sure that this stops, that this madness stops, that there’s a cease-fire before we get to the kind of destruction and pain and suffering and death that we’ve seen in Gaza,' Chaiban said. With so many needs, he said, the emergency response appeal for $108 million in Lebanon has only been 8% funded three weeks into the escalation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-over-400-000-children-in-lebanon-displaced-in-3-weeks-by-war-/7822225.html	2024-10-14T16:24:16-07:00	
Kenya relocates 50 elephants to larger park, a sign poaching is under control	MWEA, Kenya — As a helicopter hovers close to an elephant, trying to be as steady as possible, an experienced veterinarian cautiously takes aim. A tranquilizer dart whooshes in the air, and within minutes the giant mammal surrenders to a deep slumber as teams of wildlife experts rush to measure its vitals. Kenya is suffering from a problem, albeit a good one: the elephant population in the 42-square-kilometer (16-square-mile) Mwea National Reserve, east of the capital Nairobi, has flourished from its maximum capacity of 50 to a whopping 156, overwhelming the ecosystem and requiring the relocation of about 100 of the largest land animals. It hosted only 49 elephants in 1979. According to the Kenya Wildlife Service Director General Erustus Kanga, the overpopulation in Mwea highlighted the success of conservation efforts over the last three decades. 'This shows that poaching has been low, and the elephants have been able to thrive,' Kanga said. Experts started relocating 50 elephants last week to the expansive 780-square-kilometer (301-square-mile) Aberdare National Park in central Kenya. As of Monday, 44 elephants had been moved from Mwea to Aberdare, with six others scheduled for Tuesday. Tourism Minister Rebecca Miano oversaw the translocation of five of the elephants Monday, saying: 'This will go down in history as a record, as it is the biggest exercise of its kind. It is the first time we are witnessing the translocation of 50 elephants at a go.' The process started at dawn and involved a team of more than 100 wildlife specialists, with equipment ranging from specially fitted trucks to aircraft and cruisers. A fixed-wing aircraft conducted aerial surveillance to track down herds of elephants, which naturally move in small families of about five. The craft was in constant communication with two helicopters used to herd and separate the elephants to ensure they were relocated with their family units. Aboard one of the helicopters is a spotter, on the lookout for elephants, and a veterinarian with a tranquilizer gun. Once an elephant is sedated, a ground team of veterinary specialists and rangers rush to find it and clear thickets to make way for transport crews. Its vitals are monitored as another group of rangers works on lifting the massive animal, weighing hundreds of kilograms, onto specialized trucks, to be driven 120 kilometers (74 miles) to their new home. Kanga, the wildlife service director, said the relocation was also aimed at curbing human-wildlife conflict. Boniface Mbau, a resident of the area, said, 'We are very happy that the government has decided to reduce the number of elephants from the area. Due to their high numbers, they did not have enough food in the reserve, and they ended up invading our farms.' A second phase to relocate 50 other elephants is planned, but the date has not been disclosed. The project has cost at least 12 million Kenyan shillings ($93,000), the wildlife agency said. Kenya’s national parks and reserves are home to a variety of wildlife species and attract millions of visitors annually, making the country a tourism hotspot.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-relocates-50-elephants-to-larger-park-a-sign-poaching-is-under-control-/7822219.html	2024-10-14T16:05:47-07:00	
Half million still without power in Sao Paulo after Friday’s deadly storm	SAO PAULO, Brazil — Half a million consumers in Latin America's largest city are still without electricity three days after a violent gale knocked down power lines and caused a blackout, the distributor owned by Enel SpA said Monday. The delay in resumption of power supplies has led to criticism of the distributor from politicians and authorities, with calls to cancel the concession. Enel Sao Paulo said it would need time to restore parts of the electricity network that was damaged Friday night by winds of more than 100 kmh (62 mph). At least five people died in the storm that knocked over trees in the city's streets. Regulatory agencies Aneel and Arsesp said the company's response to the storm was 'much below expectations' and warned that they could recommend allowing Enel's contract to expire. Enel is facing similar criticism in Chile, whose government said in August it will study whether the Italian electricity distributor's local unit meets the terms of its concession to operate in the country after thousands of customers were left without power following a storm. According to Enel Sao Paulo, 537,000 consumers were still without electricity as of midday Monday. Blackouts that have occurred repeatedly since last year have angered Sao Paulo consumers and led authorities to fine the company for delays in restoring services. Enel's contingency plan calls for 2,500 people working to restore services in an extreme weather situation, but its field teams numbered 1,700 to 1,800 people 48 hours after the storm, Sao Paulo's state regulator for utilities Arsesp said. According to federal regulator Aneel, the company has been fined around 320 million reais ($57 million) since 2018, including 260 million reais ($46 million) related to extreme weather events since the end of last year, but payment was suspended by court order. The Ministry of Mines and Energy criticized Aneel for the current crisis, saying that the regulator had failed to supervise the distributor. Highlighting the weak response to the blackout, local media said more people were without electricity in Sao Paulo after the 15-minute storm than in Florida after Hurricane Milton.	https://www.voanews.com/a/half-million-still-without-power-in-sao-paulo-after-friday-s-deadly-storm/7822208.html	2024-10-14T15:46:30-07:00	
German secret services alarmed by Russian threat	berlin — Increased acts of espionage and sabotage, possible direct military confrontation with NATO as early as 2030: German secret services sounded the alarm Monday about the growing danger they believe Moscow's interference in Germany and Europe represents. It was a bleak picture that the three heads of the German intelligence services painted Monday during their annual hearing before MPs. 'It's burning almost everywhere,' said the head of the Federal Intelligence Service (BfV), Thomas Haldenwang, regarding threats from outside — Russia, China, Iran — as well as from within with radical Islam and the extreme right. Intelligence officials have been particularly vocal about Moscow's interference in Germany in the context of the war in Ukraine, where Germany is the second largest arms supplier after the United States. 'Whether we like it or not, we are in direct conflict with Russia,' said the head of the German intelligence and counterintelligence service (BND), Bruno Kahl. Package bomb? 'Russian espionage and sabotage are increasing in Germany, both quantitatively and qualitatively,' added Haldenwang. Germany has been rocked by several cases of alleged espionage for Russia, particularly since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In April, two men with Russian and German citizenship were indicted for planning acts of sabotage for Russia, including at a U.S. military base, to undermine German aid to Ukraine. Haldenwang accused Moscow of being behind the case of a parcel that caught fire at a DHL carrier center in Leipzig in July before its scheduled transport by plane. If the package 'had exploded on board during the flight,' he said, 'there would have been a crash and the debris could have affected all the people here in Germany who sympathize with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his regime, openly and secretly.' Haldenwang also mentioned disinformation campaigns and cases of use of spy drones. From a 'storm,' the Russian threat has 'become a real hurricane' which moves 'from east to west,' he added in a metaphor with the Baltic States and Poland, where Russian actions 'are much more brutal than they are currently here.' The head of the German military counterintelligence service (BAMAD), Martina Rosenberg, reported a 'significant increase in acts of espionage and sabotage' targeting the German army. Moscow is seeking to obtain information on 'deliveries of German arms to Ukraine' and to 'create a feeling of insecurity,' according to BAMAD. And the Kremlin 'is preparing for further escalation in hybrid and covert actions,' Kahl said. Red lines With these acts of interference of an 'unprecedented level,' the Kremlin wants to 'test the red lines of the West,' estimated the director of the secret services. For him, Russia will 'probably' be able 'to carry out an attack against NATO by the end of this decade.' 'A direct military conflict with NATO is becoming an option for Russia,' he added. Russia on Monday rejected the assertion by German's foreign intelligence chief that it would be able to attack NATO by the end of this decade, saying it was NATO that threatened Russia. Referring to successive waves of NATO expansion, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was NATO that had moved toward Russia, not the other way round. In an interview with the daily Handelsblatt, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser accused Moscow of acting 'in an ever more aggressive manner.' German services 'prevented possible explosive attacks' and 'demonstrated just a few months ago the seriousness of the Russian threat,' she also said. In July, the American channel CNN reported that the United States and Germany had foiled an assassination plot attributed to Russia against the head of the German industrial group Rheinmetall, which supplies arms to Ukraine. The accusations were rejected by Moscow. In August, fears of sabotage prompted security alerts at two military bases in Germany. The German government announced Wednesday parallel measures aimed at strengthening security controls, particularly on social networks, in the face of increased risks of espionage in ministries and sabotage of critical infrastructure.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7822201.html	2024-10-14T15:28:42-07:00	
Dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters arrested outside New York Stock Exchange	NEW YORK — About 200 demonstrators protesting Israel's war in Gaza were arrested in a sit-in outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, police said. The protesters chanted 'Let Gaza live!' And 'Up up with liberation, down down with occupation!' in front of the stock exchange's landmark building in lower Manhattan. 'The reason we’re here is to demand that the U.S. government stop sending bombs to Israel and stop profiting off of Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza,' said Beth Miller, political director of Jewish Voice for Peace, the group that organized the demonstration. 'Because what’s been happening for the last year is that Israel is using U.S. bombs to massacre communities in Gaza while simultaneously weapons manufacturers on Wall Street are seeing their stock prices skyrocket.' A handful of counter protesters waved Israeli flags and tried to shout down the pro-Palestinian chants. None of the pro-Palestinian protesters got inside the exchange, but at least 200 made it inside a security fence on Broad Street, where they sat down and waited to be taken into custody. A spokesperson for the exchange declined to comment on the protest. Police arrested the protesters one by one, cuffing their hands behind their backs with plastic ties and leading them to vans. Some demonstrators went limp and were carried by three or four officers. A police spokesperson said there were about 200 arrests. She did not have details on the charges they faced. The protest happened a week after the world marked the anniversary of Hamas' surprise Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the start of Israel's retaliatory campaign in Gaza, which has since spread to Lebanon and beyond. The Lebanese Red Cross said an Israeli airstrike hit an apartment building in northern Lebanon on Monday, killing at least 21 people. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, and it was not clear what the target was.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-of-pro-palestinian-protesters-arrested-outside-new-york-stock-exchange/7822191.html	2024-10-14T15:10:41-07:00	
Death toll in Bosnia's floods reaches 26	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina — The death toll from this month's devastating floods and landslides in Bosnia has reached 26 people, while rescue teams are searching for at least one more person still missing 10 days after a rainstorm caused havoc in the Balkan country, authorities said Monday. Torrential rains and winds hit four municipalities in central and southern Bosnia on October 4. Homes, roads and bridges were destroyed, leaving villages cut off without roads or power. Rescue teams have been sifting through the rubble for days, looking for those still missing. The hardest-hit area was in and around the southern town of Jablanica, where a village was buried in rocks from a quarry on a hill above. Local government said 19 people died in Jablanica, where a collective funeral will be held on Tuesday. Four people died in Konjic, east of Jablanica, and three more in Fojnica further north. Residents in the Jablanica area have said they heard a thundering rumble that woke them up in the middle of the night. They watched as houses disappeared before their eyes. The debris that was swept away from the flood-hit areas has clogged the otherwise perfectly clear, emerald green-colored Neretva River that is a favorite destination for visitors and locals alike. All kinds of debris, from pieces of wood to home appliances, has piled up by a hydroelectric dam on the Neretva, creating a virtual island of waste on the river and illustrating the devastation the floods have caused. Human-caused climate change increases the intensity of rainfall because warm air holds more moisture. This summer, the Balkans were also hit by long-lasting record temperatures, causing a drought. Scientists said the dried-out land has hampered the absorption of floodwaters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-in-bosnia-s-floods-reaches-26/7822187.html	2024-10-14T14:58:31-07:00	
Funeral held in Iraq for Iranian general killed by Israel with Nasrallah	Karbala, Iraq — A funeral procession took place Monday in the Shiite holy city of Karbala in central Iraq for General Abbas Nilforushan, who was killed in Lebanon along with the leader of the pro-Iranian Lebanese Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, during an Israeli strike on Beirut in late September, an AFP photographer noted. The Revolutionary Guards, Iran's ideological army, announced Friday that the body of General Nilforushan had been found, 'after continuous efforts,' at the site of the strike that targeted a Hezbollah stronghold in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Sept. 27. His body was flown Monday from Beirut to Baghdad International Airport and then by ambulance to Karbala. The funeral procession headed to the Husseiniya shrine, where a representative of Iraq's top Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, led prayers in front of a large crowd. Participants waved flags of Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah and the Iraqi armed faction Kataib Hezbollah, while chanting 'death to Israel.' The body will be transported to the holy city of Mashhad in Iran, according to the Sepah news agency, which is affiliated with the Guardians. Another ceremony will be held in Tehran on Tuesday, before a burial scheduled for Thursday in Isfahan, his hometown in central Iran, the agency said. Abbas Nilforushan was a top commander of the Quds Force, the elite unit of the Revolutionary Guards. The Revolutionary Guards had said that Iran's Oct. 1 strike of nearly 200 missiles on Israel was a retaliatory measure following the assassination of Nilforushan, Nasrallah and the leader of the Palestinian Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed on July 31 in Tehran in an attack attributed to Israel. Israel has vowed to retaliate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/funeral-held-in-iraq-for-iranian-general-killed-by-israel-with-nasrallah-/7822172.html	2024-10-14T14:39:25-07:00	
Undecided voters could swing US presidential vote	In this last month of U.S. presidential campaigning, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris both are trying to reach the relatively small number of voters who say they still have not decided who to support. VOA correspondent Scott Stearns looks at the election's 'undecided.' Vero Balderas contributed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/undecided-voters-could-swing-us-presidential-vote/7822159.html	2024-10-14T14:31:53-07:00	
Trump's campaign crowdfunded millions online in untraditional approach to emergency relief	NEW YORK — Former President Donald Trump's campaign is using GoFundMe to rally its network of deep-pocketed backers and everyday donors around the survivors of his July assassination attempt and Hurricane Helene's destruction, bucking more traditional avenues of emergency relief. The two high-profile fundraisers — organized by the Republican nominee's national finance director — have drawn more than $14 million. They do not violate campaign finance laws, according to legal experts. Nor is the campaign allowed to pocket any proceeds for its own political ends; a GoFundMe spokesperson told The Associated Press that the majority of the Butler, Pennsylvania, funds have been disbursed. But the use of a crowdfunding platform marks an unorthodox response to crises from a political campaign. Never before has a major party's presidential candidate turned to the for-profit company — which usually features desperate appeals for help covering tuition costs or medical bills — to mobilize their base toward outside charitable causes. 'It's pretty unusual and actually quite odd,' said Brett Kappel, a longtime campaign finance attorney with Harmon Curran who has advised both Republicans and Democrats. It's more typical to see candidates contribute campaign funds to IRS-approved nonprofits during natural disasters, Kappel said. He pointed to Federal Election Commission filings that show U.S. Senator Tim Scott's 2022 campaign gave to the American Red Cross after Hurricane Ian hit South Carolina. Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said the motivation arose from 'the president wanting to help find a way for his supporters to give as much direct support as they can.' The finance team only got involved because of their 'great expertise in working with large accounts,' according to Hughes, and 'not one penny of this funding is going anywhere but to those impacted.' Hughes said more than $6.5 million of the $7.7 million raised for organizations helping with Hurricane Helene recovery had been disbursed as of Oct. 11. 'The president has an amazing movement of supporters,' Hughes told AP. 'With the experience in Butler generating millions of dollars of support, he saw the same opportunity to be a direct conduit for a philanthropic effort from his supporters.' Longtime Trump associates, conservative celebrities and right-wing groups gave tens of thousands of dollars. Bill Ackman, the CEO of the Pershing Square investment firm who endorsed Trump shortly after the assassination attempt, donated $100,000 for hurricane relief. UFC President Dana White also pitched in $100,000. Republican U.S. Senator Rick Scott said on X that he donated $50,000 from his congressional salary for the Butler, Pennsylvania victims. Also contributing was The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025. GoFundMe collects a transaction fee of 2.9% plus 30 cents for every donation to cover credit and debit charges. Its global Trust & Safety team has been communicating closely with organizer Meredith O'Rourke to ensure the safe distribution of donations from the Butler, Pennsylvania, page, according to a company spokesperson. O'Rourke also provided a verified distribution plan, the GoFundMe spokesperson told AP, which the company routinely requires in cases where organizers are withdrawing money on behalf of other recipients. Lawyer advises against It's not advisable for campaign finance officials to run crowdfunding pages 'at the same time they were writing your money for your camp,' said Andrew Herman, a Washington lawyer specializing in campaign finance. Because online crowdfunding is less regulated, he said, it would've been 'more palatable' to direct supporters toward a recognized nonprofit. 'But people get into trouble when they try to ascribe rationality or any degree of what we would generally consider best financial practices to campaigns,' Herman said. 'There's no black letter law that says they can't do this,' he added. 'Should they? Of course not.' The bulk of the Pennsylvania disbursements were made earlier this month, and more payouts will come while the page remains active, according to Hughes. The 'vast majority' has gone to the families of the three people shot, he said. Some funds also compensated a local crane rental company after the owner said he lost business when the ensuing police investigation left him unable to retrieve equipment he'd donated for the rally. Money raised for Hurricane Helene victims has gone to four nonprofits. Samaritan's Purse spokesperson Gabrielle Bouquet said the Christian humanitarian aid organization is grateful for Trump's 'steadfast support of the work we do in Jesus' name.' Bouquet declined to share the exact amount of the donation. Water Mission, a Christian engineering nonprofit that builds safe water solutions in disaster areas, confirmed that the South Carolina-based ministry had also received funds. Public relations director Gregg Dinino did not specify the total. Mtn2Sea Ministries, which delivers generators and supplies in the immediate aftermath of weather events, said on Facebook that it received $25,000 on Monday. The disaster relief group posted that the proceeds were used to buy South Georgia businesses' gift cards because 'the best way to help those in need is to get resources directly into their hands.' 'Combustible dynamic' It makes sense that Trump's team gravitated toward crowdfunding, said Benjamin Soskis of the Urban Institute's Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy. The campaign 'has often been premised on a suspicion of institutions,' he said, and GoFundMe 'drew some of its attraction by serving as an alternative to institutional charitable giving.' But crowdfunding also brings less accountability, Soskis said. Crowdfunding pages don't have the same disclosure requirements as public charities that must divulge their finances in annual tax filings. Soskis said Trump's checkered philanthropic ventures have likely brought increased levels of scrutiny. A judge fined Trump $2 million in 2019 for using his since-dissolved charitable foundation to advance his interests. 'It is a combustible dynamic when you combine campaigning and charitable giving,' Soskis said. 'The extra dynamics of crowdfunding and Trump's own history with philanthropy itself adds more fuel to that fire.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-campaign-crowdfunded-millions-online-in-untraditional-approach-to-emergency-relief-/7822163.html	2024-10-14T14:30:20-07:00

Italy sends 1st migrant ship to Albania, rights groups warn of 'dangerous precedent'	ROME — Italy is transferring the first group of migrants to Albania, the Interior Ministry said Monday, as part of a contentious plan to process thousands of asylum-seekers outside its borders. A naval ship departed from the island of Lampedusa with 16 men — 10 from Bangladesh and six from Egypt — who were rescued at sea after departing from Libya. The ship is expected to arrive Wednesday morning, a ministry spokesman said. Premier Giorgia Meloni's far-right government formally opened the two centers in Albania Friday where Italy plans to process thousands of male migrants requesting asylum after being intercepted in international waters while trying to cross to Europe. The centers can accommodate up to 400 migrants at first, with that expected to increase to 880 in a few weeks, according to Italian officials. Women, children, older people and those who are ill or victims of torture will be accommodated in Italy. Families will not be separated. The five-year deal was endorsed last year by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as an example of 'out-of-box thinking' in tackling the migration issue, but human rights groups say it sets a dangerous precedent. A spokesperson for the U.N. refugee agency, which has expressed serious concerns, said Monday that one of its teams was conducting an 'independent mission' on board the ship to monitor the screening process. The agency, also known as UNHCR, has agreed to supervise the first three months to help 'safeguard the rights and dignity of those subject to it.' The agreement, signed last year, calls for Albania to house up to 3,000 male migrants while Italy fast-tracks their asylum claims. The migrants will retain their right under international and EU law to apply for asylum in Italy and have their claims processed there. The two centers will cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million) over five years. The facilities will be run by Italy and are under Italian jurisdiction, while Albanian guards will provide external security. Meloni and her right-wing allies have long demanded that European countries share more of the migration burden.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-sends-1st-migrant-ship-to-albania-rights-groups-warn-of-dangerous-precedent/7822127.html	2024-10-14T13:33:32-07:00	
Lilly Ledbetter, American icon of the fight for equal pay, dies at 86	New York — Lilly Ledbetter, an former Alabama factory manager whose lawsuit against her employer made her an icon of the equal pay movement and led to landmark wage discrimination legislation, has died at 86. Ledbetter's discovery that she was earning less than her male counterparts for doing the same job at a Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. plant in Alabama led to her lawsuit, which ultimately failed when the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that she had filed her complaint too late. The court ruled that workers must file lawsuits within six months of first receiving a discriminatory paycheck — in Ledbetter's case, years before she learned about the disparity through an anonymous letter. Two years later, former President Barack Obama signed into the law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which gave workers the right to sue within 180 days of receiving each discrimination paycheck, not just the first one. 'Lilly Ledbetter never set out to be a trailblazer or a household name. She just wanted to be paid the same as a man for her hard work,' Obama said in a statement Monday. 'Lilly did what so many Americans before her have done: setting her sights high for herself and even higher for her children and grandchildren.' Ledbetter died Saturday of respiratory failure, according to a statement from her family cited by the Alabama news site AL.com. Ledbetter continued campaigning for equal pay for decades after winning the law named after her. A film about her life starring Patricia Clarkson premiered last week at the Hamptons International Film Festival. The team behind the film, 'LILLY,' issued a statement of condolence on social media. 'Lilly was an ordinary woman who achieved extraordinary things, and her story continues to motivate us all. We will miss her,' the team said. In January, President Joe Biden marked the 15th anniversary of the law named after Ledbetter with new measures to help close the gender wage gap, including a new rule barring the federal government from considering a person's current or past pay when determining their salary. Ledbetter had advocated for the measure in a January opinion piece for Ms. Magazine penned with Deborah Vagins, director of the Equal Pay Today advocacy group. But Ledbetter and other advocates for years have been frustrated that more comprehensive initiatives have stalled, including the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963. The sense of urgency among advocates deepened after an annual report from the Census Bureau last month found that the gender wage gap between men and women widened for the first time 20 years. In 2023, women working full time earned 83 cents on the dollar compared with men, down from 84 cents in 2022. Even before then, advocates had been frustrated that wage gap improvement had mostly stalled for the last 20 years despite women making gains in the C-suite and earning college degrees at a faster rate than men. Experts say the reasons for the enduring gap are multifaceted, including the overrepresentation of women in lower-paying industries and weak childcare system that pushes many women to step back from their careers in their peak earnings years. In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Ledbetter wrote a opinion piece in The New York Times detailing the harassment she faced as a manager at the Goodyear factory and drawing a link between workplace sexual harassment and pay discrimination. 'She was indefatigable,' said Emily Martin, chief program officer at the National Women's Law Center, which worked closely with Ledbetter. 'She was always ready to lend her voice, to show up to do a video, to write an op-ed. She was always ready to go.' Ledbetter was a manager at the Goodyear plant in Gadsden, Alabama, and had worked there 19 years when she received an anonymous note saying she was being paid significantly less than three male colleagues. She filed a lawsuit in 1999 and initially won $3.8 million in backpay and damages from a federal court. She never received the money after eventually losing her case before the Supreme Court. Although the law named after her didn't directly address the gender wage gap, Martin said it set an important precedent 'for ensuring that we don't just have the promise of equal pay on the books but we have a way to enforce the law.' 'She is a really an inspiration in showing us how a loss does not mean you can't win,' Martin said. 'We know her name because she lost, and she lost big, and she kept coming back from it and kept working until the day she died to change that loss into real gains for women across the country.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/lilly-ledbetter-american-icon-of-the-fight-for-equal-pay-dies-at-86/7822132.html	2024-10-14T13:28:19-07:00	
12 killed, 33 injured in Egypt after bus with university students crashes	Cairo — A bus carrying university students crashed and overturned on a highway in northeastern Egypt, killing 12 people and injuring 33 others, the health ministry said Monday night. Students from the Suez-based Galala University, southeast of Cairo, were on board. Local media reported they were returning from their classes to their dormitory in Porto Sokhna resort, using the Ain Sokhna highway, when the accident happened, and that the driver was arrested as part of an investigation into the crash. The ministry didn't say what caused the accident. The statement said 28 ambulances rushed to the site and transported the injured to the Suez Medical Complex, but didn't disclose their condition. Deadly traffic accidents claim thousands of lives every year in Egypt, which has a poor transportation safety record. Speeding, bad roads and poor enforcement of traffic laws mostly cause the collisions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-33-injured-in-egypt-after-bus-with-university-students-crashes-/7822133.html	2024-10-14T13:25:57-07:00	
Paris Motor Show opens during brewing EV trade war between EU, China	Paris — The Auto manufacturers competing to persuade drivers to go electric are rolling out cheaper, more tech-rich models at the Paris Motor Show, targeting everyone from luxury clients to students yet to receive their driving licenses. The biennial show has long been a major industry showcase, tracing its history to 1898. Chinese manufacturers are attending in force, despite European Union threats to punitively tax imports of their electric vehicles in a brewing trade war with Beijing. Long-established European manufacturers are fighting back with new efforts to win consumers who have balked at high-priced EVs. Here's a look at the show's opening day on Monday. More new models from China Chinese EV startups Leapmotor and XPeng showcased models they said incorporate artificial intelligence technology. Leapmotor, founded in 2015, unveiled a compact electric-powered SUV, the B10. It will be manufactured in Poland for European buyers, said Leapmotor's head of product planning, Zhong Tianyue. Leapmotor didn't announce a price for the B10 that will launch next year. Leapmotor also said a smaller electric commuter car it showcased in Paris, the T03, will retail from a competitive 18,900 euros ($20,620). Those sold in France will be imported from China but assembled in Poland, Zhong said. Leapmotor also announced a starting price of 36,400 euros ($39,700) in Europe for its larger family car, the C10. Sales outside of China are through a joint venture with Stellantis, the world's fourth largest carmaker. Leapmotor said European sales started in September. Xpeng braces for tariff hit Attending the Paris show for the first time, the decade-old Chinese EV manufacturer XPeng unveiled a sleek sedan, the P7+. CEO He Xiaopeng said XPeng aims to deliver in Europe from next year. Intended European prices for the P7+ weren't given, but the CEO said they will start in China at 209,800 yuan, the equivalent of 27,100 euros, or $29,600. XPeng's president, Brian Gu, said the EU's threatened import duties could complicate the company's expansion plans if Brussels and Beijing don't find an amicable solution to their trade dispute before an end-of-October deadline. Brussels says subsidies help Chinese companies to unfairly undercut EU industry prices, with Chinese-built electric cars jumping from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023. 'The tariff will put a lot of pressure on our business model. It's a direct hit on our margin, which is already not very high,' Gu said. Vehicles for young teens Manufacturers of small electric vehicles that can be driven in Europe without a license are finding a growing market among teens as young as 14 and their parents who, for safety reasons, prefer that they zip around on four wheels than on motorbikes. Several manufacturers of the two-seaters are showcasing in Paris, including France's Citroen. The starting price for its Ami, or 'Friend,' is just under 8,000 euros ($8,720). Launched in France in 2020, the plastic-shelled vehicle is now also sold in other European markets and in Turkey, Morocco and South America. 'It's not a car. It's a mobility object,' said Citroen's product chief for the Ami, Alain Le Gouguec. European legislation allows teenagers without a full license to drive the Ami and similar buggies from age 14 after an eight-hour training course. They're limited to a top speed of 45 kilometers per hour (28 mph). The vehicles are also finding markets among adults who lost their license for driving infractions or who never got a full license, and outside cities in areas with poor transport. Renault subsidiary Mobilize said that even in winter's energy-sapping cold its two-seater, no-license, plastic-shelled Duo can go 100 kilometers (over 60 miles) between charges. A phone app acts as its door and ignition key. Another French manufacturer, Ligier, sells its no-license two-seaters in both diesel and electric versions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paris-motor-show-opens-during-brewing-ev-trade-war-between-eu-china/7822118.html	2024-10-14T13:08:51-07:00	
Harris, Trump campaigning in battleground Pennsylvania Monday	Harrisburg, Pennsylvania — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will take their fight for Pennsylvania to opposite ends of the state on Monday, with Harris speaking in the northwest corner in Erie and Trump in the southeastern suburbs of Philadelphia. Democrat Harris and Republican Trump have been making regular appearances in what is the country's largest battleground state — it will be Harris' 10th visit to Pennsylvania this campaign season, and just last week Trump made stops in both Scranton and Reading. Pennsylvania's energy industry and natural gas fracking are likely topics as they compete for the fraction of the state's voters who have not made up their minds. Mail-in voting is well underway in the state where some 7 million people are likely to cast votes in the presidential race. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by more than 40,000 votes in Pennsylvania on his way to winning the presidency in 2016, but native Scrantonian Joe Biden beat Trump by about 80,000 votes in the state four years ago. Harris will be holding a rally in Erie, a Democratic majority city of about 94,000 people bordered by suburbs and rural areas with significant numbers of Republicans. Erie County is often cited as one of the state's reliable bellwether regions, where the electorate has a decidedly moderate voting record. Trump visited Erie on Sept. 29. Harris plans to talk up early voting during her rally. And she'll stop by a Black-owned small business in Erie in advance of the rally to promote her proposals to give Black men more economic opportunities and other chances to thrive as Democrats try to energize the voting bloc. Trump plans a town hall Monday at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center and Fairgrounds in suburban Oaks, hoping to drive up turnout among his supporters. Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, the most of any swing state, have generated the most attention by far from the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Including Monday's scheduled events, they will have made 46 stops in the state, according to Associated Press tracking of the campaigns' public events. Michigan, with 33 visits, and Wisconsin, with 29, are the next most-visited states, illustrating how both campaigns are focusing on winning states that had been part of the Democrats' so-called 'blue wall' until Trump emerged as the Republican standard-bearer. Democrats have won three straight elections for governor, and both current U.S. senators are Democrats, but the state's legislature is closely divided.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-trump-campaigning-in-battleground-pennsylvania-monday/7822096.html	2024-10-14T12:51:15-07:00	
NASA spacecraft rockets toward Jupiter's moon Europa, searching for keys to life	CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — A NASA spacecraft rocketed away Monday on a quest to explore Jupiter’s tantalizing moon Europa and reveal whether its vast hidden ocean might hold the keys to life. It will take Europa Clipper 5 1/2 years to reach Jupiter, where it will slip into orbit around the giant gas planet and sneak close to Europa during dozens of radiation-drenched flybys. Scientists are almost certain a deep, global ocean exists beneath Europa’s icy crust. And where there is water, there could be life, making the moon one of the most promising places out there to hunt for it. Europa Clipper won’t look for life; it has no life detectors. Instead, the spacecraft will zero in on the ingredients necessary to sustain life, searching for organic compounds and other clues as it peers beneath the ice for suitable conditions. SpaceX started Clipper on its 3 billion-kilometer (1.8 million-mile) journey, launching the spacecraft on a Falcon Heavy rocket from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center. An hour later, the spacecraft separated from the upper stage, floated off and called home. 'Please say goodbye to Clipper on its way to Europa,' NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's flight director Pranay Mishra announced from Southern California. 'The science on this is really captivating,' NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free told The Associated Press back at the launch site. Scientists are still learning about the depths of our own ocean, 'and here we are looking that far out.' The $5.2 billion mission almost got derailed by transistors. NASA didn’t learn until spring that Clipper’s transistors might be more vulnerable to Jupiter’s intense radiation field than anticipated. Clipper will endure the equivalent of several million chest X-rays during each of the 49 Europa flybys. The space agency spent months reviewing everything before concluding in September that the mission could proceed as planned. Hurricane Milton added to the anxiety, delaying the launch by several days. 'What a great day. We’re so excited,' JPL Director Laurie Leshin said after liftoff. About the size of a basketball court with its solar wings unfurled, Clipper will swing past Mars and then Earth on its way to Jupiter for gravity assists. The nearly 5,700-kilogram (13,000-pound) probe should reach the solar system’s biggest planet in 2030. Clipper will circle Jupiter every 21 days. One of those days will bring it close to Europa, among 95 known moons at Jupiter and close to our own moon in size. The spacecraft will skim as low as 25 kilometers (16 miles) above Europa — much closer than the few previous visitors. Onboard radar will attempt to penetrate the moon’s ice sheet, believed to be 15 kilometers to 24 kilometers (10 miles to 15 miles or more) thick. The ocean below could be 120 kilometers (80 miles) or more deep. The spacecraft holds nine instruments, with its sensitive electronics stored in a vault with dense zinc and aluminum walls for protection against radiation. Exploration will last until 2034. 'Ocean worlds like Europa are not only unique because they might be habitable, but they might be habitable today,' NASA’s Gina DiBraccio said on the eve of launch. If conditions are found to be favorable for life at Europa, then that opens up the possibility of life at other ocean worlds in our solar system and beyond, according to scientists. With an underground ocean and geysers, Saturn’s moon Enceladus is another top candidate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-spacecraft-rockets-toward-jupiter-s-moon-europa-searching-for-keys-to-life/7822094.html	2024-10-14T12:48:16-07:00	
ICC prosecutor renews probe into alleged crimes in conflict-torn DR Congo	THE HAGUE, Netherlands — The International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor said Monday he is renewing an investigation in Congo and focusing on allegations of crimes committed in the conflict-torn North Kivu province in the central African nation's east since early 2022. Eastern Congo has long been overrun by more than 120 armed groups seeking a share of the region’s gold and other resources as some carry out mass killings. The result is one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with more than 7 million people displaced, many beyond the reach of aid. The most active rebel group has been M23, which rose to prominence more than a decade ago when its fighters seized Goma, eastern Congo’s largest city on the border with Rwanda. It derives its name from a March 23, 2009, peace deal that it accuses Congo's government of not implementing. In August, clashes between the rebels and pro-government militias killed 16 villagers in a violation of the cease-fire announced in August to help millions displaced. The ICC first opened an investigation in Congo 20 years ago following years of armed conflict. Last year the Congolese government asked it to investigate alleged crimes in North Kivu by armed groups operating there since Jan. 1, 2022. In a statement, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said recent violence in North Kivu is 'interconnected with patterns of violence and hostilities that have plagued the region' since mid-2002. As a result, the more recent allegations fall into the ongoing investigation. Khan said his probe in North Kivu 'will not be limited to parties or members of specific groups. Rather, my office will examine holistically, independently and impartially the responsibility of all actors' allegedly committing crimes within the court's jurisdiction. The ICC previously convicted three rebels of crimes in Congo's eastern Ituri region, including a notorious warlord, Bosco Ntaganda, known as 'The Terminator' who was found guilty of crimes including murder, rape and sexual slavery. His convictions and 30-year sentence were upheld by appeals judges in 2021.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-prosecutor-renews-probe-into-alleged-crimes-in-conflict-torn-dr-congo/7822051.html	2024-10-14T12:36:31-07:00	
China urges caution in Israel-Iran tensions, calls for cease-fire	BEIJING — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called on all parties involved in tensions between Israel and Iran on Monday to exercise caution and avoid escalating the situation. In a phone conversation with Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, Wang also urged Israel to ensure the safety of personnel of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), a foreign ministry statement said. He also reiterated Beijing's position on the Gaza conflict, calling for an immediate, complete and permanent cease-fire. Katz said that during the call he had 'clarified that Iran is the primary source for undermining stability in the Middle East' and said that Iran poses a direct threat through its proxies, including Hamas and Hezbollah. Katz said he had expected that China would express 'a balanced and fair position in relation to the war,' citing the economic cooperation ties between the two countries 'and the fact that approximately 20,000 workers from China continue to work in Israel during the ... war.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-urges-caution-in-israel-iran-tensions-calls-for-cease-fire/7821998.html	2024-10-14T11:39:19-07:00	
Iran top diplomat meets senior Houthi official in Oman	Muscat, Oman — Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met a senior official from Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement in Muscat on Monday, according to his office, the latest stop in a wide-ranging diplomatic tour of the region. The Iranian foreign ministry released pictures of the talks with Mohammed Abdelsalam in the Omani capital as Araghchi consults with allies and other Middle East powers following Israel's vow to retaliate against an Iranian missile attack. Araghchi held a 'meeting and discussion with Mohammad Abdelsalam, the spokesman and chief negotiator of the Yemen National Salvation Government,' read the photo caption, referring to the Houthi administration. The Houthi-run Al Masirah television also reported the meeting without providing any details on the nature of the talks. Araghchi also met with his Omani counterpart Sayyid Badr al-Busaidi to discuss developments in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip where Israel is fighting Hezbollah and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. They 'urged an immediate end to the Israeli regime's genocide and aggression in Gaza and Lebanon,' said Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei. Oman's foreign ministry said the two officials agreed on 'harnessing diplomacy as an essential tool for resolving disputes and conflicts' in the region. Iran fired nearly 200 missiles at Israel on Oct. 1 in what it said was retaliation for the killing of Tehran-aligned militant leaders in the region and a general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Israel has since vowed to respond. Yemen's Houthis, along with the Palestinian Hamas group in Gaza and Hezbollah, are part of Iran's 'axis of resistance' of militant groups arrayed against Israel. Araghchi's visit to Muscat came after a trip to Baghdad. Last week, he visited Qatar and Saudi Arabia where talks mainly revolved around establishing a cease-fire in Lebanon and Gaza as well as ways to contain the conflict from spreading across the region. On Sunday, Araghchi reiterated that Iran was 'fully prepared for a war situation ... but we do not want war, we want peace.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-top-diplomat-meets-senior-houthi-official-in-oman/7821979.html	2024-10-14T11:15:55-07:00	
Polish leader Tusk defends decision to suspend asylum law	Warsaw — Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Monday defended a plan to temporarily suspend the right to asylum as human rights and civil society organizations express concerns about the move. Poland has struggled since 2021 with migration pressures on its border with Belarus — which is also part of the European Union's external border. 'It is our right and our duty to protect the Polish and European border,' Tusk said Monday on X. 'Its security will not be negotiated.' Successive Polish governments have accused Belarus and Russia of organizing the mass transfer of migrants from the Middle East and Africa to the EU's eastern borders to destabilize the West. They view it as part of a hybrid war that they accuse Moscow of waging against the West as it continues its nearly three-year full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Some migrants have applied for asylum in Poland, but before the requests are processed, they travel across the EU’s border-free travel zone to reach Germany or other countries in Western Europe. Germany, where security fears are rising after a spate of extremist attacks, has recently responded by expanding border controls at all of its borders to fight irregular migration. Tusk called Germany’s move 'unacceptable.' Tusk announced his plan to temporarily suspend the right for migrants to seek asylum at a convention of his Civic Coalition on Saturday. It will be part of a strategy that will be presented to a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Dozens of nongovernmental organizations urged Tusk in an open letter to respect the right to asylum guaranteed by international conventions, which Poland signed, including the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and Poland's own constitution. They argued that fundamental rights and freedoms must be respected. 'It is thanks to them that thousands of Polish women and men found shelter abroad in the difficult times of communist totalitarianism, and we have become one of the greatest beneficiaries of these rights,' the letter said. It was signed by Amnesty International and 45 other organizations that represent a range of humanitarian, legal and civic causes. Tusk argued that Finland also suspended accepting asylum applications after facing migration pressure on its border with Russia. 'The right to asylum is used instrumentally in this war and has nothing to do with human rights,' Tusk said on X on Sunday. A spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU's executive branch, acknowledged the challenge posed by Belarus, but also Russia, and didn't explicitly criticize Tusk’s approach. 'It is important and imperative that the union is protecting the external borders, and in particular from Russia and Belarus, both countries that have put in the past three years, a lot of pressure on the external borders,' Anitta Hipper said during a briefing Monday. 'This is something that is undermining the security of the EU member states and of the union as a whole.' But she also underlined that EU member countries are legally obliged to allow people to apply for international protection. Hipper noted that the commission intends to 'work on ensuring that the member states have the necessary tools to respond to these types of hybrid attacks.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/polish-leader-tusk-defends-decision-to-suspend-asylum-law/7821816.html	2024-10-14T09:06:16-07:00	
Taiwan's former President Tsai calls for release of publisher Jimmy Lai	Prague — Former Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen is among the world leaders calling for the release of pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai from jail in Hong Kong, where he is standing trial on national security charges that are widely viewed as politically motivated. 'They should release him,' Tsai told VOA about Jimmy Lai. She made the statement shortly after she delivered a speech at the Forum 2000 democracy conference in the Czech capital Prague on Monday. It was Tsai’s first international trip since leaving office in May. Tsai’s call for Lai’s release comes just weeks before Lai’s trial is set to resume on November 20, when he is expected to take the stand for the first time. Lai, the founder of Hong Kong’s now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper, has been held in solitary confinement since late 2020. The 76-year-old British national is standing trial on charges of collusion with foreign forces and sedition. The charges, which Lai rejects, are widely viewed as politically motivated. The British government recently asked to defer Tsai’s visit to the United Kingdom due to concerns that her visit would anger Beijing, according to media reports. British Foreign Minister David Lammy is expected to visit China next week in his first trip to the country as foreign secretary. A Foreign Office spokesperson told The Guardian: 'Ministerial travel will be confirmed in the usual way. We do not comment on speculation.' Jimmy Lai’s son Sebastien told VOA he hopes Lammy will raise his father’s case with the Chinese government during his upcoming visit. 'I’ll expect him to raise the case,' Sebastien said. 'At the end of the day, this is about saving my father’s life, and the foreign secretary is in a unique position to do that.' Although the United Kingdom has called for Jimmy’s release, the British government has faced criticism from rights groups and activists who say it isn’t doing enough to advocate on behalf of Jimmy, who is a British national. 'They’ve only been in power for four months,' Sebastien said, referring to Britain’s new Labour government. 'Dad’s been in jail for four years. So it’s not an excuse.' Sebastien spoke to VOA at Forum 2000, which he attended to advocate for his father’s release. 'Getting as much global attention on my father to put pressure on the government of Hong Kong so that they can’t keep essentially persecuting my father,' Sebastien said. Lai’s plight has come to symbolize the rapid deterioration of press freedom and other civil liberties in Hong Kong since China’s harsh national security law came into effect in 2020. Lai’s trial, which began in December 2023, was originally estimated to last around 80 days. Jonathan Price, a member of Jimmy’s international legal team, said he was concerned the trial could be delayed again. 'It doesn’t seem, to us, likely to finish anytime soon,' Price told VOA at Forum 2000. Price added that Lai’s trial highlights the lack of rule of law in Hong Kong. 'The proof about the rule of law in Hong Kong is in the pudding. If you’re shocked that there are 1,500 political prisoners in Russia, a country of 150 million people, you’d be staggered to learn that there are more political prisoners in Hong Kong,' Price said. The Washington-based Hong Kong Democracy Council estimates that there are more than 1,800 political prisoners in Hong Kong, which has a population of about 7.4 million. 'That itself is symptomatic of the total destruction of the rule of law,' Price said. Hong Kong's Security Bureau acknowledged receipt of VOA's email requesting comment for this story but did not provide a comment by time of publication. But in an October email to VOA, a Hong Kong government spokesperson denied that civil liberties and the rule of law have declined there. The spokesperson added that 'rights and freedoms are not absolute' anywhere in the world. 'In particular, journalists, like everyone else, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. Their freedom of commenting on and criticizing government policies remains uninhibited as long as they do not violate the law,' the spokesperson said. Hong Kong authorities have also previously denied that Jimmy’s trial is unfair. Also at Forum 2000 in Prague, Miriam Lexmann, a Slovakian Member of European Parliament, told VOA that the European Union should do more to push for Lai’s release. 'It’s very important to talk about Jimmy Lai because it represents the case of Hong Kong very clearly. And what is absolutely vital now is that we address the issue of Hong Kong as Europeans,' said Lexmann, who also serves as co-chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, or IPAC. IPAC is a coalition of global lawmakers that is focused on relations with the Chinese government. Lai’s case is especially important, Lexmann said, because he could have left Hong Kong, but he decided to stay in order to stand up for freedom. 'He decided to stay and suffer just to show the case of what’s going on in Hong Kong,' Lexmann said. 'We have a moral responsibility to help those who fight for freedom worldwide. With his father’s trial set to resume shortly, Sebastien says now is an especially important time for governments to place more pressure on Hong Kong and China to release the publisher. 'We do see this as a critical time to raise attention for my father’s case,' Sebastien said. 'My goal is to release him as soon as possible because at his age, he could die at any moment.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-former-president-tsai-calls-for-release-of-publisher-jimmy-lai/7821780.html	2024-10-14T08:42:38-07:00	
India recalls ambassador from Canada in growing dispute over assassination of Sikh activist	NEW DELHI — India said Monday it is recalling its ambassador and other diplomats from Canada, hours after it rejected a Canadian notification that the ambassador was a 'person of interest' in the assassination of a Sikh activist last year. India's foreign ministry said in a statement that it had also summoned the top Canadian diplomat in New Delhi and told him that 'the baseless targeting' of the Indian high commissioner, or ambassador, and other diplomats and officials in Canada 'was completely unacceptable.' 'We have no faith in the current Canadian Government's commitment to ensure their security,' it said. 'Therefore, the Government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials.' In September last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were credible allegations that the Indian government had links to the assassination in that country of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India rejected the accusation as absurd. In Ottawa, messages left for Canada's foreign ministry, foreign minister and the prime minister's office seeking comment were not immediately returned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-recalls-ambassador-from-canada-in-growing-dispute-over-assassination-of-sikh-activist-/7821760.html	2024-10-14T08:41:12-07:00	
EU targets Iran officials, airlines, for supplying drones, missiles to Russia	BRUSSELS — The European Union on Monday imposed sanctions on Iran’s deputy defense minister, senior members of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and three airlines over allegations that they supplied drones, missiles and other equipment to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. Deputy Defense Minister Seyed Hamzeh Ghalandari is one of seven senior officials now banned from traveling in Europe and whose assets in the bloc were frozen. The EU said he 'is involved in the development of Iran’s [drone] and missile program,' given his high-level defense role. Iran Air, Mahan Air and Saha Airlines had their assets frozen. The EU said their planes were 'used repeatedly to transfer Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicles and related technologies to Russia, which have been used in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.' EU foreign ministers endorsed the sanctions at a meeting in Luxembourg. In March, the bloc had warned that 'were Iran to transfer ballistic missiles and related technology to Russia for use against Ukraine, the EU would be prepared to respond swiftly, including with new and significant restrictive measures.' EU member countries, except for Hungary, have been supplying weapons and ammunition as well as economic and other support to Ukraine worth some 118 billion euros ($129 billion) since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-targets-iran-officials-airlines-for-supplying-drones-missiles-to-russia-/7821710.html	2024-10-14T07:53:34-07:00	
French citizen convicted in Russia of collecting military information gets 3 years in prison	Moscow — A Russian court on Monday convicted a French citizen of collecting military information and sentenced him to three years in prison. Laurent Vinatier, who was arrested in Moscow in June, earlier admitted guilt, setting the stage for a fast-tracked trial. His lawyers' asked the court to sentence him to a fine. In his remarks before the verdict, Vinatier, speaking Russian, reaffirmed that he fully recognized his guilt and asked the judge for clemency. 'I'm asking the Russian Federation to forgive me for failing to observe Russian laws,' he said in Russian. He said that he fell in love with Russia 20 years ago when he began studying the country and concluded his comments with a verse by Russian poet Alexander Pushkin about having patience that better days lie ahead. Detentions on charges of spying and collecting sensitive data have become increasingly frequent in Russia and its heavily politicized legal system since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Vinatier's arrest came as tensions flared between Moscow and Paris following French President Emmanuel Macron's comments about the possibility of deploying French troops in Ukraine. Russian authorities accused Vinatier of failing to register as a 'foreign agent' while collecting information about Russia's 'military and military-technical activities' that could be used to the detriment of the country's security. Vinatier is an adviser for the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, a Switzerland-based nongovernmental organization. It said in June that it was doing 'everything possible to assist' him. The prosecutors charged that Vinatier had collected military information during his meetings with three Russian citizens in Moscow in 2021-22. The Russian citizens weren't named in the indictment. Vinatier's lawyers argued the sentence sought by prosecutors was too harsh and asked the judge to sentence him to a fine. They pointed at his career as a political scholar who focused on studying Russia and emphasized that his books and articles have been friendly to the country. While asking the judge for clemency, Vinatier pointed at his two children and his elderly parents he has to take care of. The charges against Vinatier relate to a law that requires anyone collecting information on military issues to register with authorities as a foreign agent. Human rights activists have criticized the law and other recent legislation as part of a Kremlin crackdown on independent media and political activists intended to stifle criticism of its actions in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-citizen-convicted-in-russia-of-collecting-military-information-gets-3-years-in-prison/7821709.html	2024-10-14T07:48:03-07:00	
World Bank cuts 2024 growth forecast for sub-Saharan Africa over Sudan	Nairobi — The World Bank said on Monday it had lowered its economic growth forecast for sub-Saharan Africa this year to 3% from 3.4%, mainly due to the destruction of Sudan's economy in a civil war. However, growth is expected to remain comfortably above last year's 2.4% thanks to higher private consumption and investment, the bank said in its latest regional economic outlook report, Africa's Pulse. 'This is still a recovery that is basically in slow gear,' Andrew Dabalen, chief economist for the Africa region at the World Bank, told a media briefing. The report forecast next year's growth at 3.9%, above its previous prediction of 3.8%. Moderating inflation in many countries will allow policymakers to start lowering elevated lending rates, the report said. However, the growth forecasts still face serious risks from armed conflict and climate events such as droughts, floods and cyclones, it added. Without the conflict in Sudan, which devastated economic activity and caused starvation and widespread displacement, regional growth in 2024 would have been half a percentage point higher and in line with its initial April estimate, the lender said. Growth in the region's most advanced economy, South Africa, is expected to increase to 1.1% this year and 1.6% in 2025, the report said, from 0.7% last year. Nigeria is expected to grow at 3.3% this year, rising to 3.6% in 2025, while Kenya, the richest economy in East Africa, is likely to expand by 5% this year, the report said. Commodities The sub-Saharan Africa region grew at a robust annual average of 5.3% in 2000-2014 on the back of a commodity supercycle, but output started flagging when commodity prices crashed. The slowdown was accelerated by the COVID pandemic. 'Cumulatively, if that were to continue for a long time, it would be catastrophic,' Dabalen warned. Many economies in the region were starved of public and private investments, he said, and a recovery in foreign direct investments that started in 2021 was still tepid. 'The region needs much, much larger levels of investments in order to be able to recover faster... and be able to reduce poverty,' he said. Growth across the region is also hamstrung by high debt service costs in countries like Kenya, which was rocked by deadly protests against tax hikes in June and July. 'There are staggering levels of interest payments,' Dabalen said, attributing this to a shift by governments to borrow from financial markets in the last decade and away from the low-priced credit offered by institutions like the World Bank. Total external debt among economies has risen to about $500 billion from $150 billion a decade and a half ago, he said, with the bulk owed to bond market investors and China. Chad, Zambia, Ghana and Ethiopia went into default in the last four years and have overhauled their debt under a G20 initiative Common Framework. Ethiopia is still working to restructure its debt while the others have completed their debt restructuring. 'As long as these debt issues are not resolved, there is going to be a lot of 'wait and see' games going on, and that is not good for the countries, and certainly not good for the creditors as well,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-bank-cuts-2024-growth-forecast-for-sub-saharan-africa-over-sudan-/7821654.html	2024-10-14T07:34:14-07:00

Innocent' British nerve agent victim caught in global murder plot, inquiry finds	London — A British woman who died after being exposed to the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok was unwittingly caught up in an 'illegal and outrageous international assassination attempt,' a public inquiry was told on Monday. Dawn Sturgess, a 44-year-old mother of three children, died in July 2018 after spraying herself with what she thought was perfume from a discarded bottle containing the deadly chemical weapon. Her death followed a failed poison attack against former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, southwest England. The U.K. government has said it was 'highly likely' Russia was behind the plot. Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury in March 2018. They survived after intensive hospital treatment and now live under protection. At the start of public hearings into Sturgess's death in Salisbury, inquiry lawyer Andrew O'Connor said the perfume bottle contained enough Novichok to poison 'thousands' of people. 'It's no exaggeration to say the circumstances of Dawn Sturgess's death were extraordinary,' he told the hearing. 'When Ms Sturgess was poisoned by Novichok four months after the Skripal poisoning, the real possibility emerged that she had been caught — an innocent victim — in the crossfire of an illegal and outrageous international assassination attempt,' he added. U.K. authorities believe that agents targeting the Skripals threw the perfume bottle away, making the two cases 'inextricably interwoven'. The attempt to kill Skripal, on whom Russian President Vladimir Putin had sworn vengeance, plunged London-Moscow relations to a new low. Britain blames the Novichok attack on two Russian security service officers who allegedly entered the country using false passports. A third has been named as the operation's mastermind. All three are thought to be members of the GRU Russian intelligence agency. Russia, whose constitution does not allow extradition, has denied involvement and dismissed the inquiry as a 'circus.' Six years on, relations between the countries — already hit by claims that Russia was behind the 2006 radiation poisoning of former agent Alexander Litvinenko — remain in deep freeze. The Sturgess inquiry will include closed sessions to investigate 'private material' and intelligence related to the case. The Skripals will not give live evidence due to safety concerns. Sturgess's family was 'particularly concerned' about whether the U.K. government had taken appropriate steps to protect the Skripals and the wider public from collateral damage, according to O'Connor. International arrest warrants have been issued for the suspects, but Theresa May, who was prime minister at the time of the attack, warned justice was unlikely. She told the BBC last week that she hoped the inquiry would help 'the family and friends of Dawn Sturgess feel it has got to the truth.' But 'closure to all the people affected would only finally come with justice, and that justice is highly unlikely to happen,' May added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/innocent-british-nerve-agent-victim-caught-in-global-murder-plot-inquiry-finds/7821636.html	2024-10-14T06:57:51-07:00	
China’s Premier Li begins Pakistan visit amid rare strains in relations	ISLAMABAD — Chinese Premier Li Qiang began a four-day visit to Pakistan under tight security Monday for bilateral talks and to attend the heads of government meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) hosted in Islamabad this week. Pakistan is on high alert after a recent increase in deadly insurgent attacks nationwide, including a suicide car bomb attack in Karachi last week that targeted a Chinese convoy and resulted in the deaths of two Chinese engineers. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif received Li at a military air base outside the Pakistani capital before the two led their respective teams’ delegations to review bilateral trade and progress on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Popularly known as CPEC, the Chinese-funded multibillion-dollar bilateral project is a key extension of President Xi Jinping’s global Belt and Road Initiative. The Pakistani government has declared a three-day public holiday in Islamabad and the adjoining garrison city of Rawalpindi. Schools and businesses are closed, and troops and paramilitary forces have been deployed to ensure 'foolproof security arrangements' for the Li visit and the two-day SCO summit starting Tuesday. Officials said Li is also expected to virtually inaugurate the CPEC-built international airport in Gwadar, a coastal city housing a Chinese-controlled deep-water port on the Arabian Sea. Neither side has commented on the reason for the virtual inauguration, but diplomatic sources cited heightened security concerns, particularly following the Karachi attack. Li is the first Chinese premier to visit Islamabad in 11 years, with the Sharif administration saying the visit will help advance the development of CPEC and facilitate Chinese business expansion in the South Asian nation. China has invested nearly $25 billion over the past decade under CPEC, building large-scale infrastructure development projects in Pakistan, such as roads, highways, power plants, the Gwadar seaport, and the airport. However, critics are skeptical about whether the Chinese side would be keen to expand its business investments under CPEC, citing growing security threats to Chinese workers in Pakistan, among other challenges. Militant attacks have killed at least 21 Chinese nationals since 2017. Last week’s Karachi suicide bombing of Chinese engineers associated with a CPEC power plant prompted Beijing to ask its citizens not to visit Balochistan and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Both sit on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan and witness almost daily insurgent attacks. On Monday, at least three police officers were killed when Islamist insurgents stormed a district police headquarters in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Authorities said that three assailants were also killed in the ensuing exchange of fire. Turning point Mushahid Hussain, a former senator and head of the Islamabad-based Pakistan China Institute, cautioned that the latest deadly attack on Chinese nationals was a severe blow and could be a 'turning point' for the 'strategic partnership' between the two countries. 'China has huge investments in strife-torn Nigeria and Congo, but never have we witnessed…murders of Chinese engineers and technicians… as we see these recurring in Pakistan,' Hussian noted. Hussian described the Karachi attack as a 'blatant breach of security' and echoed Chinese calls for Pakistani authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice urgently. 'China, our best friend, has been badly let down with their confidence shaken' despite Islamabad promising 'foolproof security' for its Chinese guests, he stated. Separatist militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the October 6th attack in Karachi, the capital of the southern Sindh province. The group has been waging deadly attacks in Balochistan, accusing China of helping Pakistan to exploit the region’s natural resources, charges both countries reject as unfounded. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told reporters Monday that their government was doing all it could to ensure the security of the Chinese nationals in Pakistan. He stated that recent attacks on Chinese workers, including the Karachi bombing, 'are being probed, and the prime minister is personally looking into it.' In their post-attack meetings with Pakistani counterparts, Chinese officials appeared 'furious' and pressed the host nation to 'severely punish' the perpetrators and urgently enhance the security of Chinese nationals and projects, according to diplomatic sources privy to the discussions. Husnain Javed, a Beijing-based Pakistani researcher, told VOA that CPEC-related debt and capacity payments for Chinese-built coal-fired power plants are the main hurdles in moving the project forward. 'Pakistan is looking to defer these payments for a period of 3 years with interest and penalty amount…We are far from CPEC phase 2,' he stated in written comments. Javed noted that growing security concerns for thousands of Chinese workers in Pakistan have added to the bilateral project challenges. 'The recent attack, I think, is the final nail in the CPEC coffin as it heavily damaged the trust between the two countries…It's important to consider that these were no ordinary engineers,' the researcher noted. The Chinese foreign ministry said last week that a high-level team was sent to Islamabad after the attack. It 'asked the Pakistani side to properly handle ensuing matters…conduct thorough investigations, bring all the perpetrators to justice, and step up security measures to ensure the safety and security of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-premier-li-begins-pakistan-visit-amid-rare-strains-in-relations-/7821554.html	2024-10-14T06:17:10-07:00	
Historic Jersey Shore amusement park closes after generations of family thrills	OCEAN CITY, N.J. — For generations of vacationers heading to Ocean City, the towering 'Giant Wheel' was the first thing they saw from miles away. The sight of the 140-foot-tall (42-meter) ride let them know they were getting close to the Jersey Shore town that calls itself 'America's Greatest Family Resort,' with its promise of kid-friendly beaches, seagulls and sea shells, and a bustling boardwalk full of pizza, ice cream and cotton candy. And in the heart of it was Gillian’s Wonderland Pier, an amusement park that was the latest in nearly a century-long line of family-friendly amusement attractions operated by the family of Ocean City’s mayor. But the rides were to fall silent and still Sunday night, as the park run by Ocean City’s mayor and nurtured by generations of his ancestors, closed down, the victim of financial woes made worse by the lingering aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic and Superstorm Sandy. Gillian and his family have operated amusement rides and attractions on the Ocean City Boardwalk for 94 years. The latest iteration of the park, Wonderland, opened in 1965. 'I tried my best to sustain Wonderland for as long as possible, through increasingly difficult challenges each year,' Mayor Jay Gillian wrote in August when he announced the park would close. 'It's been my life, my legacy and my family. But it's no longer a viable business.' Gillian did not respond to numerous requests for comment over the past week. Sheryl Gross was at the park for its final day with her two children and five grandchildren, enjoying it one last time. 'I've been coming here forever,' she said. 'My daughter is 43 and I've been coming here since she was 2 years old in a stroller. Now I'm here with my grandchildren.' She remembers decades of bringing her family from Gloucester Township in the southern New Jersey suburbs of Philadelphia to create happy family memories at Wonderland. 'Just the excitement on their faces when they get on the rides,' she said. 'It really made it feel family-friendly. A lot of that is going to be lost now.' There were long lines Sunday for the Giant Wheel, the log flume and other popular rides as people used the last of ride tickets many had bought earlier in the year, thinking Wonderland would go on forever. A local non-profit group, Friends of OCNJ History and Culture, is raising money to try and save the amusement park, possibly under a new owner who might be more amenable to buying it with some financial assistance. Bill Merritt, one of the non-profit's leaders, said the group has raised over $1 million to help meet what could be a $20-million price tag for the property. 'Ocean City will be fundamentally different without this attraction,' he said. 'This town relies on being family-friendly. The park has rides targeted at kids; it's called ‘Wonderland’ for a reason.' The property's current owner, Icona Resorts, previously proposed a $150-million, 325-room luxury hotel elsewhere on Ocean City's boardwalk, but the city rejected those plans. The company's CEO, Eustace Mita, said earlier this year he would take at least until the end of the year to propose a use for the amusement park property. He bought it in 2021 after Gillian's family was in danger of defaulting on bank loans for the property. At a community meeting last month, Gillian said Wonderland could not bounce back from Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the pandemic in 2020 and an increase in New Jersey’s minimum wage that doubled his payroll costs, leaving him $4 million in debt. Mita put up funds to stave off a sheriff's sale of the property, and gave the mayor three years to turn the business around. That deadline expired this year. Mita did not respond to requests for comment. Merritt said he and others can't imagine Ocean City without Wonderland. 'You look at it with your heart, and you say ‘You’re losing all the cherished memories and all the history; how can you let that go?'' he said. 'And then you look at it with your head and you say, ‘They are the reason this town is profitable; how can you let that go?’'	https://www.voanews.com/a/historic-jersey-shore-amusement-park-closes-after-generations-of-family-thrills-/7821517.html	2024-10-14T05:13:18-07:00	
UN refugee chief urges states to drop border controls even as displacement crises worse	Geneva — The head of the U.N. refugee agency warned on Monday that displacement crises in Lebanon and Sudan could worsen, but said tighter border measures were not the solution, calling them ineffective and sometimes unlawful. Addressing more than 100 diplomats and ministers in Geneva at UNHCR's annual meeting, Filippo Grandi said an unprecedented 123 million people are now displaced around the world by conflicts, persecution, poverty and climate change. 'You might then ask: what can be done? For a start, do not focus only on your borders,' he said, urging leaders instead to look at the reasons people are fleeing their homes. 'We must seek to address the root causes of displacement, and work toward solutions,' he said. 'I beg you all that we continue to work — together and with humility — to seize every opportunity to find solutions for refugees.' Without naming countries, Grandi said initiatives to outsource, externalize or even suspend asylum schemes were in breach of international law, and he offered countries help in finding fair, fast and lawful asylum schemes. Western governments are under growing domestic pressure to get tougher on asylum seekers and Grandi has previously criticized a plan by the former British government to transfer them to Rwanda. In the same speech he warned that in Lebanon, where more than one million people have fled their homes due to a growing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the situation could worsen further. 'Surely, if airstrikes continue, many more will be displaced and some will also decide to move on to other countries.' He called for a drastic increase in support for refugees in Sudan's civil war, saying lack of resources was already driving them across the Mediterranean Sea and even across the Channel to Britain. 'In this lethal equation, something has got to give. Otherwise, nobody should be surprised if displacement keeps growing, in numbers but also in geographic spread,' he said. The UNHCR response to the crisis that aims to help a portion of the more than 11 million people displaced inside Sudan or in neighboring countries is less than 1/3 funded, Grandi said. The number of displaced people around the world has more than doubled in the past decade. Grandi, set to serve as high commissioner until Dec. 2025, said the agency's funding for this year had recently improved due to U.S. support but remained 'well below the needs.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-refugee-chief-urges-states-to-drop-border-controls-even-as-displacement-crises-worse/7821495.html	2024-10-14T04:49:58-07:00	
Pro-European President Maia Sandu: a force for change in Moldova	Chisinau, Moldova — For many Moldovans, President Maia Sandu has become a symbol of change as she seeks to chart a new pro-European path for the former Soviet Republic. Since Moscow invaded Moldova's neighbor Ukraine, Sandu has lobbied for the West to support her country and hear its concerns that it could be the Kremlin's next target. She is now running for a second term on October 20 after defeating a Moscow-backed incumbent in 2020. Applying for Moldova to join the EU in 2022, Sandu, 52, has laid out wide-ranging reforms to fight graft and bring in investment. In stirring speeches, she has warned of a tough but worthy road ahead for one of Europe's poorest countries, with a population of 2.6 million. 'Joining the European Union is Moldova's Marshall Plan,' Sandu said in a speech last month, referring to the economic recovery plan put in place after World War II to rebuild Europe. 'Rollercoaster journey' Born in the village of Risipeni near the Romanian border before Moldova gained independence in 1991, Sandu obtained a master's degree in international relations in Chisinau and another in public policy after studying at Harvard University in the United States. After a stint in the economy ministry, she worked as an economist at the World Bank's office in Chisinau for more than seven years and later as an adviser of the executive director to the World Bank in Washington. After two years in Washington, in 2012, she received an 'unexpected' offer from Moldova's government to return and become education minister, kicking off what she has described as a 'rollercoaster journey' that ended up in her becoming the country's first woman president. 'The resistance to change, the overwhelming problems in the education sector, the hate speech I was confronted with, all made my life really difficult,' she recalled in a 2022 speech at Harvard University, describing how this built her 'resilience.' In her drive to rid her country of corruption, Sandu founded her own party in 2016, the center-right Action and Solidarity Party (PAS). 'It took quite some thought and ultimately a leap of faith to go into politics, instead of choosing a different, quiet and comfortable career path,' she said in her speech at Harvard. She ran for president in 2016, but failed to win. In 2019, she was Moldova's prime minister before trying for the post of president again, this time defeating Moscow-backed incumbent Igor Dodon. 'Chance for Moldova' Landlocked between Ukraine and EU member Romania, Moldova had long been divided over closer ties with the European Union or maintaining Soviet-era relations with Moscow. When Sandu was elected president, her promises of honesty and competence resonated with many Moldovans following political crises and corruption scandals. Sandu vowed balanced ties with the West and Russia, but relations with Moscow have increasingly soured since Russia invaded Ukraine, with Sandu accusing Moscow of meddling in her country's politics. Fluent in Romanian, English and Russian, Sandu enjoys the 'respect and recognition' of international leaders, according to Armand Gosu, a Romanian historian who specializes in former Soviet countries and Russia. Sandu is 'a huge chance for Moldova,' he said, noting she was likely the first Moldovan leader 'of such international stature.' Her critics accuse her of lobbying the West while having failed to manage the country's struggling economy and high inflation or to push forward judicial reforms. Sandu has been able 'to unite a large base of voters,' but also 'a relatively large core of disappointed people,' Florent Parmentier, a political scientist at French political studies school Sciences Po, told AFP. 'The main criticism of her is regarding her ability to listen' to opposing views, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pro-european-president-maia-sandu-a-force-for-change-in-moldova-/7821490.html	2024-10-14T04:40:47-07:00

Nobel economics prize awarded for research into why countries succeed or fail	STOCKHOLM — The Nobel memorial prize in economics was awarded Monday to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson for research into reasons why some countries succeed and others fail. The Nobel memorial prize in economics was awarded Monday to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson for research into differences in prosperity between nations. The three economists 'have demonstrated the importance of societal institutions for a country's prosperity,' the Nobel committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said at the announcement in Stockholm. 'Societies with a poor rule of law and institutions that exploit the population do not generate growth or change for the better. The laureates' research helps us understand why,' it added. Acemoglu and Johnson work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Robinson conducts his research at the University of Chicago. 'Reducing the vast differences in income between countries is one of our time's greatest challenges. The laureates have demonstrated the importance of societal institutions for achieving this,' Jakob Svensson, Chair of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences, said. He said their research has provided 'a much deeper understanding of the root causes of why countries fail or succeed.' Reached by the academy in Athens, Greece, where he is due to speak at a conference, Acemoglu said he was surprised and shocked by the award. 'You never expect something like this,' he said. The economics prize is formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. The central bank established it in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel, the 19th-century Swedish businessman and chemist who invented dynamite and established the five Nobel Prizes. Though Nobel purists stress that the economics prize is technically not a Nobel Prize, it is always presented together with the others on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896. Nobel honors were announced last week in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nobel-economics-prize-is-awarded-for-research-into-why-countries-succeed-or-fail-/7821460.html	2024-10-14T03:55:29-07:00	
North Korea preparing to destroy northern parts of inter-Korean roads, Seoul says	SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea said Monday it has detected signs that North Korea is preparing to destroy the northern parts of inter-Korean roads no longer in use, as the rivals are embroiled in soaring tensions over North Korea's claim that South Korea flew drones over its territory. Destroying the roads would be in line with leader Kim Jong Un's push to cut off ties with South Korea, formally cement it as his country's principal enemy and abandon the North's decades-long objective to seek a peaceful Korean unification. South Korea's military said Monday that it was observing various activities in North Korea that appeared to be preparations for demolishing the roads, such as installing screens. 'They have installed screens on the road and are working behind those screens, preparing to blow up the roads,' Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a briefing. He said the demolitions could be carried out as early as Monday. Lee said that the South Korean military believes that the North could also attempt to launch a space rocket, which is viewed by the U.N. as a banned test of long-range missile technology. Lee said North Korea may conduct unspecified 'small provocations' to ramp up pressure on Seoul. It's not clear how much parts of the roads North Korea would destroy. The development comes as North Korea has recently accused South Korea of launching drones to drop propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang three times this month and threatened to respond with force if it happened again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned it would sternly punish North Korea if the safety of its citizens is threatened. In a statement Sunday, the North's Defense Ministry said that the military had ordered artillery and other army units near the border with South Korea to 'get fully ready to open fire.' The spokesperson said that the entire South Korean territory 'might turn into piles of ashes' following the North's powerful attack. North Korea often releases warlike rhetoric when animosities with its rivals increase. Experts say it's highly unlikely for North Korea to launch full-scale, preemptive attacks as it military is outmatched by the combined U.S. and South Korean forces. Koo Byoungsam, a spokesperson of South Korea's Unification Ministry, said Monday that North Korea's accusation on South Korean drone flights was likely aimed at creating tensions to reinforce its internal unity while stoking instability in South Korea. Koo said North Korea cannot win what it wants from South Korea with threats and provocations. Some observers say anti-Pyongyang activists might have sent drones this month, but North Korea argues the South Korean government cannot still escape responsibility because it must have been aware of such moves. In 2022, South Korea sent surveillance drones across the border into North Korea after it accused North Korea of flying drones into South Korea for the first time in five years. Last week, North Korea said it will permanently block its border with South Korea and build front-line defense structures to cope with 'confrontational hysteria' by South Korean and U.S. forces. It cited various military exercises in South Korea and the temporary deployments of powerful U.S. military assets in South Korea. South Korean officials said North Korea had already been adding anti-tank barriers, planting mines and reinforcing roads on its side of the border since earlier this year in a likely attempt to boost its front-line security posture and prevent its soldiers and citizens from defecting to South Korea. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, with North Korea continuing a run of provocative missile tests and South Korea and the U.S. expanding their military drills. Observers say North Korea could perform major weapons tests ahead of next month's U.S. presidential election to increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the Americans. In January, Kim Jong Un ordered the revision of North Korea's constitution to remove the goal of a peaceful Korean unification, formally designate South Korea as the country's 'invariable principal enemy' and define the North's sovereign, territorial sphere. Kim's order stunned many North Korea watchers because it was seen as breaking away with his predecessors' long-cherished dreams of peacefully achieving a unified Korea on the North's terms. Experts say Kim likely aims to diminish South Korea's voice in the regional nuclear standoff and seek direct dealings with the U.S. They say Kim also likely hopes to diminish South Korean cultural influence and bolster his rule at home.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-preparing-to-destroy-northern-parts-of-inter-korean-roads-seoul-says-/7821445.html	2024-10-14T03:36:01-07:00	
Sri Lanka closes schools as floods hammer capital	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka closed schools in the capital Colombo and suburbs on Monday as heavy rains triggered floods in many parts of the island nation. Heavy downpours over the weekend have wreaked havoc in many parts of the country, flooding homes, fields and roads. Three people drowned, while some 134,000 people have been affected by flooding, according to the country's Disaster Management Centre. The center said rains and floods have damaged 240 houses and nearly 7,000 people have been evacuated. Authorities have cut electricity in some areas as a precaution. Navy and army troops have been deployed to rescue victims and provide food and other essentials. Local television channels showed flooded towns in the suburbs of Colombo. In some areas, waters reached the roofs of houses and shops. Sri Lanka has been grappling with severe weather conditions since May, mostly caused by heavy monsoon rains. In June, 16 people died due to floods and mudslides.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-closes-schools-as-floods-hammer-capital-/7821441.html	2024-10-14T03:23:03-07:00	
Afghan Taliban vow to implement media ban on images of living things	Kabul — Afghanistan's Taliban morality ministry pledged Monday to implement a law banning news media from publishing images of all living things, with journalists told the rule will be gradually enforced. 'The law applies to all Afghanistan... and it will be implemented gradually' by persuading people images of living things are against Islamic law, spokesman for the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice Saiful Islam Khyber told AFP. The Taliban government judiciary recently announced legislation formalising their strict interpretations of Islamic law imposed by the authorities since they swept to power in 2021. The law detailed several rules for news media, including banning the publication of images of all living things and ordering outlets not to mock or humiliate Islam, or contradict Islamic law. Aspects of the new law have not yet been strictly enforced, however, and Taliban officials continue to regularly post photos of people on social media. Television and pictures of living things were banned across the country under the previous Taliban rule from 1996 to 2001, but a similar edict has so far not been broadly imposed since their return to power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-taliban-vow-to-implement-media-ban-on-images-of-living-things/7821442.html	2024-10-14T03:22:33-07:00

Eight monkeys found dead at Hong Kong zoo, government says	HONG KONG — Eight animals were found dead in a Hong Kong zoo, the city's government said on Monday, a rare incident in the financial hub, with necropsy and laboratory tests arranged to find out the cause of deaths. The animals, a De Brazza’s monkey, one common squirrel monkey, three cotton-top tamarins and three white-faced sakis, were found dead at the city's Zoological and Botanical Gardens on Sunday, Hong Kong's Leisure and Cultural Services Department said in a statement. While awaiting test results, the mammals section of the zoo will be shut from Monday for disinfection and cleaning. 'We will also closely monitor the health conditions of other animals. During this period, other facilities of the HKZBG will remain open,' the statement said, using the abbreviation for the zoo and gardens. The zoo is the oldest park in the territory. Built in 1860, it houses around 158 birds, 93 mammals and 21 reptiles in about 40 enclosures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eight-monkeys-found-dead-at-hong-kong-zoo-government-says/7821370.html	2024-10-13T23:43:27-07:00

China starts new round of war games near Taiwan, offers no end date	TAIPEI — China's military started a new round of war games near Taiwan on Monday, saying it was a warning to the 'separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces,' and offered no date for when they may conclude. Democratically governed Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, had been on alert for more war games since last week's national day speech by President Lai Ching-te, an address Beijing condemned after Lai said China had no right to represent Taiwan even as he offered to cooperate with Beijing. The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command in a 5 a.m. statement said the 'Joint Sword-2024B' drills were taking place in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, south and east of Taiwan. 'The drill also serves as a stern warning to the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces. It is a legitimate and necessary operation for safeguarding state sovereignty and national unity,' it said in a statement carried both in Chinese and English. Taiwan's defense ministry expressed its strong condemnation of China's 'irrational and provocative act,' adding it had dispatched its own forces. Lai's national day speech highlighted the current state of cross-strait relations, and the firm will to safeguard peace and stability and advocated future cooperation in coping with challenges like climate change, the ministry added. 'The Chinese communist's claim of 'picking quarrels and provoking trouble' is a complete departure from the truth,' it added. A senior Taiwan security official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, said they believed China was practicing blockading Taiwanese ports and international shipping lanes as well as repelling the arrival of foreign forces. China's held the 'Joint Sword-2024A' drills for two days around Taiwan in May shortly after Lai took office, saying they were 'punishment' for separatist content in his inauguration speech. Lai has repeatedly offered talks with China but has been rebuffed. He says only Taiwan's people can decide their future and rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-starts-new-round-of-war-games-near-taiwan-offers-no-end-date-/7821267.html	2024-10-13T18:09:30-07:00	
World Bank says 26 poorest countries in worst financial shape since 2006	WASHINGTON — The world's 26 poorest countries, home to 40% of the most poverty-stricken people, are more in debt than at any time since 2006 and increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters and other shocks, a new World Bank report showed on Sunday. The report finds that these economies are poorer today on average than they were on the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic, even as the rest of the world has largely recovered from COVID and resumed its growth trajectory. Released a week before World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings get underway in Washington, the report confirms a major setback to efforts to eradicate extreme poverty and underscores the World Bank's efforts this year to raise $100 billion to replenish its financing fund for the world's poorest countries, the International Development Association (IDA). The 26 poorest economies studied, which have annual per-capita incomes of less than $1,145, are increasingly reliant on IDA grants and near-zero interest rate loans as market financing has largely dried up, the World Bank said. Their average debt-to-GDP ratio of 72% is at an 18-year high and half of the group are either in debt distress or at high risk of it. Two-thirds of the 26 poorest countries are either in armed conflicts or have difficulty maintaining order because of institutional and social fragility, which inhibit foreign investment, and nearly all export commodities, exposing them to frequent boom-and-bust cycles, the report said. 'At a time when much of the world simply backed away from the poorest countries, IDA has been their lifeline,' World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill said in a statement. 'Over the past five years, it has poured most of its financial resources into the 26 low-income economies, keeping them afloat through the historic setbacks they suffered.' IDA normally is replenished every three years with contributions from World Bank shareholding countries. It raised a record $93 billion in 2021, and World Bank President Ajay Banga is aiming to exceed that with over $100 billion in pledges by Dec. 6. Natural disasters also have taken a greater toll on these countries over the past decade. Between 2011 and 2023, natural disasters were associated with average annual losses of 2% of GDP, five times the average among lower-middle-income countries, pointing up the need for much higher investment, the World Bank said. The report also recommended that these economies, which have large informal sectors operating outside their tax systems, do more to help themselves. This includes improving tax collections by simplifying taxpayer registration and tax administration and improving the efficiency of public spending.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-bank-says-26-poorest-countries-in-worst-financial-shape-since-2006/7821293.html	2024-10-13T18:07:59-07:00	
International Wine Organization calls for ‘sustainable development’ of vines	dijon, France — The International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV), a sort of 'U.N. of wine' which brings together experts from the sector, called for 'sustainable development' of the vine Sunday, following a ministerial meeting in France. 'The effects of climate change amplify' the challenges facing the vine, stressed 37 members out of 50 participating in the meeting at the OIV headquarters in Dijon. The signatories encourage 'biodiversity reservoirs, such as grape varieties and the entire ecosystem that surrounds them, by limiting soil erosion, capturing carbon ... and reducing waste,' adds the ministerial declaration, the first in the history of the organization which is celebrating its centenary this year. The OIV has set itself the 'objectives' of 'supporting innovation, ambitious, resilient and sustainable cultural and oenological practices ... as well as biodiversity such as the conservation and use of diversity in the vine, the exploitation of new vine varieties and efficient water management.' The 'sustainability' of vines and wine also applies to 'economic and social' matters, explained the director general of the OIV, New Zealander John Barker, at a news conference, stressing the need for the sector to adapt to the decline in wine consumption. Created on November 29, 1924, by eight countries (Spain, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Tunisia), the OIV today brings together 50 countries, covering 88% of world wine production, with the notable absence of the United States, which slammed the door in 2001, after the failure of its candidate for its presidency. China will become the 51st member state in November. The organization is not political but brings together technical and scientific experts who exchange information on the sector and try to harmonize standards at the international level.	https://www.voanews.com/a/international-wine-organization-calls-for-sustainable-development-of-vines/7821288.html	2024-10-13T17:55:04-07:00	
Time with horses is helping some Ukrainian kids deal with war	Since May 2024, heavy fighting has been going on near the village of Hlyboke, some 30 kilometers from Kharkiv, and animals are the victims of active fighting just as much as locals.

Iceland government collapses, new election set for November	Reykjavik, Iceland — Iceland's three-party coalition government collapsed Sunday over disagreements on policy issues, Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson said, with new elections to be held in November. Benediktsson, head of the conservative Independence Party, told reporters that tensions had mounted within the left-right coalition on issues ranging from foreign policy to asylum seekers and energy. The coalition had been made up of the Independence Party, the Left-Green Movement and the center-right Progressive Party. The issues 'were less discussed in the last election than need to be discussed now', Benediktsson said, emphasizing 'how different the (Left-Green) Movement's vision for the future is, compared to what I want to stand for.' 'It is best if the government has a common vision,' he told the online media site Visir, adding: 'It's disappointing when projects run aground or circumstances change.' He said he would meet Monday with Iceland's President Halla Tomasdottir to submit a proposal for the dissolution of parliament and parliamentary elections at the end of November. Benediktsson, one of Iceland's most experienced politicians, has previously served as finance minister, foreign minister and prime minister. He said he had strong backing from his party and planned to stand in the November election. A Gallup poll published on October 1 showed that the coalition government had the support of just one-fourth of voters, at 24.6 percent, the lowest score Gallup has recorded for an Icelandic government in 30 years. The three parties combined came in behind the Social Democrats, which were credited with 26.1 percent. Benediktsson took over as prime minister in April 2024 after Katrin Jakobsdottir, of the Left-Green Movement, resigned to run for the presidency, which she failed to win. The three parties were reelected in 2021, winning 38 of the 63 seats in parliament, up from the 33 they had held since the previous election in 2017. But the Left-Green Movement emerged weaker, losing three seats to hold just eight, while its right-wing partners both posted strong showings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iceland-government-collapses-new-election-set-for-november/7821281.html	2024-10-13T17:37:53-07:00	
Sweden wants EU to classify Revolutionary Guards as terrorist organization	Stockholm — Sweden wants the European Union to classify Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization after several attacks on Israeli targets in Sweden that Stockholm blames on Iran, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Sunday. The Scandinavian country's intelligence agency, Sapo, has accused Iran of recruiting members of Swedish criminal gangs to commit 'acts of violence' against Israeli and other interests in Sweden, a charge Tehran has denied. 'We want Sweden to seriously address, together with other EU countries, the incredibly problematic connection between the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its destructive role in the (Middle East) region, but also its increasing actions in various European countries, including Sweden,' Kristersson told the Expressen daily. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is a special branch of the Iranian armed forces whose officers hold key positions within the Iranian government. 'The only reasonable option... is that we obtain a common classification of terrorists, so that we can act more broadly than with the sanctions that already exist,' he added. Several Israeli interests have been targeted in Sweden in recent months. In early October, the Israeli Embassy was targeted by gunfire, which did not cause any injuries. Other incidents have occurred near the embassy since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip in October 2023. In February, a grenade was found near the building in what the Israeli ambassador called an attempted attack. In May, gunfire was reported outside the building, leading to increased security measures around Israeli interests in Sweden. Two attacks have also targeted an Israeli military technology company in the past six months. In May, the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter cited documents from the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad indicating that the head of the Swedish crime network Foxtrot, Rawa Majid, and his arch-rival Ismail Abdo, head of the Rumba gang, were both recruited by Iran. In early October, Swedish public broadcaster SVT reported that the two recent attacks on the Israeli Embassies in Stockholm and Copenhagen had been ordered by Foxtrot on the orders of Iran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-wants-eu-to-classify-revolutionary-guards-as-terrorist-organization/7821274.html	2024-10-13T17:22:32-07:00

Nigeria resettling people back to homes they fled to escape Boko Haram	DAMASAK, Nigeria — When Boko Haram launched an insurgency in northeastern Nigeria in 2010, Abdulhameed Salisu packed his bag and fled from his hometown of Damasak in the country's battered Borno state. The 45-year-old father of seven came back with his family early last year. They are among thousands of Nigerians taken back from displacement camps to their villages, hometowns or newly built settlements known as 'host communities' under a resettlement program that analysts say is being rushed to suggest the conflict with the Islamic militants is nearly over. Across Borno, dozens of displacement camps have been shut down, with authorities claiming they are no longer needed and that most places from where the displaced fled are now safe. But many of the displaced say it’s not safe to go back. Boko Haram — Nigeria’s homegrown jihadis — took up arms in 2009 to fight against Western education and impose their radical version of Islamic law, or Sharia. The conflict, now Africa's longest struggle with militancy, has spilled into Nigeria's northern neighbors. Some 35,000 civilians have been killed and more than 2 million have been displaced in the northeastern region, according to U.N. numbers. The 2014 kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram in the village of Chibok in Borno state — the epicenter of the conflict — shocked the world. Borno state alone has nearly 900,000 internally displaced people in displacement camps, with many others absorbed in local communities. So far this year, at least 1,600 civilians have been killed in militant attacks in Borno state, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a U.S.-based nonprofit. And in a state where at least 70% of the population depends on agriculture, dozens of farmers have also been killed by the extremists or abducted from their farmland in the last year. In May, hundreds of hostages, mostly women and children who were held captive for months or years by Boko Haram were rescued from a forest enclave and handed over to authorities, the army said. In September, at least 100 villagers were killed by suspected Boko Haram militants who opened fire on a market, on worshippers and in people’s homes in the Tarmuwa council area of the neighboring Yobe state, west of Borno. Analysts say that a forced resettlement could endanger the local population as there is still inadequate security across the hard-hit region. Salisu says he wastes away his days in a resettlement camp in Damasak, a garrison town in Borno state of about 200,000 residents, close to the border with Niger. Food is getting increasingly difficult to come by and Salisu depends on handouts from the World Food Program and other aid organizations. He longs to find work. 'We are begging the government to at least find us a means of livelihood instead of staying idle and waiting for whenever food comes,' he said. On a visit last week to Damasak, Cindy McCain, the WFP chief, pledged the world would not abandon the Nigerian people as she called for more funding to support her agency's aid operations. 'We are going to stay here and do the very best we can to end hunger,' McCain told The Associated Press as she acknowledged the funding shortages. 'How do I take food from the hungry and give it to the starving,' she said. Resettlement usually involves the displaced being taken in military trucks back to their villages or 'host communities.' The Borno state government has promised to provide returnees with essentials to help them integrate into these areas, supported by aid groups. The government says the displacement camps are no longer sustainable. 'What we need now is ... durable solutions,' Borno governor Babagana Zulum told McCain during her visit. As the resettlement got underway, one in five displaced persons stayed back in Maiduguri, the Borno state capital, and nearby towns but were left without any support for local integration, the Global Protection Cluster, a network of non-government organizations and U.N. agencies, said last December. Many others have crossed the border to the north, to settle as refugees in neighboring Niger, Chad or Cameroon. The three countries have registered at least 52,000 Nigerian refugees since January 2023, according to the U.N. refugee agency — nearly twice the number registered in the 22 months before that. A rushed closure of displacement camps and forced resettlement puts the displaced people at risk again from militants still active in their home areas — or forces them to 'cut deals' with jihadis to be able to farm or fish, the International Crisis Group warned in a report earlier this year. That could make the extremists consolidate their presence in those areas, the group warned. Boko Haram, which in 2016 split into two main factions, continues to ambush security convoys and raid villages. Abubakar Kawu Monguno, head of the Center for Disaster Risk Management at the University of Maiduguri, said the best option is for government forces to intensify their campaign to eliminate the militants or 'push them to surrender.' After not being able to access their farms because of rampant attacks by militants, some farmers in Damasak and other parts of Mobbar district returned to work their land last year, armed with seedlings provided by the government. Salisu was one of them. Then a major flood struck in September, collapsing a key dam and submerging about 40% of Maiduguri's territory. Thirty people were killed and more than a million others were affected, authorities said. Farms that feed the state were ruined, including Salisu's. His hopes for a good rice harvest were washed away. Now he lines up to get food at a Damasak food hub. 'Since Boko Haram started, everything else stopped here,' he said. 'There is nothing on the ground and there are no jobs.' Maryam Abdullahi also lined up at a WFP hub in Damasak with other women, waiting for bags of rice and other food items she desperately needs for her family of eight. Her youngest is 6 years old. The donations barely last halfway through the month, she said, but she still waited in the scorching heat. What little money she has she uses to buy yams to fry and sell to sustain her family, but it’s nowhere enough. Her only wish is to be able to get a 'proper job' so she and her children would feel safe, she said. 'We either eat in the morning for strength for the rest of the day or ... we eat only at night,' Abdullahi said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-resettling-people-back-to-homes-they-fled-to-escape-boko-haram-/7820998.html	2024-10-13T16:57:13-07:00	
7 killed in third massacre in a week in Ecuador	Quito, Ecuador — Seven people were shot dead in Ecuador while leaving a pool hall in the latest in a series of tit-for-tat gang attacks near the violence-plagued port city of Guayaquil, police said Sunday. The third shooting in a week in the town of Duran brings the number of people killed to 17 in the flare-up in violence between two notorious local gangs, the Latin Kings and Chone Killers gangs, police said. The latest shooting took place Saturday night, when gunmen travelling in two cars opened fire on suspected members of the Chone Killers, Duran police chief Roberto Santamaria said. Traces of blood from the shooting were still visible on the streets Sunday. Santamaria blamed the attack on the rival Latin Kings gang, saying it appeared to be a revenge attack. The series of shootings began on Tuesday, when gunmen wearing army-style uniforms took five people from their homes and shot them dead execution-style in an alley in Duran. Police later blamed that attack on the Chone Killers. A day later, suspected members of the Chone Killers traveling by car opened fire on a group of people, also killing five. 'There has been a succession of violent acts that began with the death of five members of a gang, they seek retaliation with five other acts (killings) and so on,' Santamaria said. The Latin Kings and Chone Killers have a strong presence in Duran, which is situated just across the Babahoyo River from Guayaquil, the nerve center of a drug war between the government and powerful criminal groups. Santamaria described the Latin Kings and Chone Killers as having 'military-style power' and accused them of drug trafficking, extortion and the recruitment of minors, among other crimes. Duran is situated in Guayas province, one of six Ecuadoran provinces which is under a state of emergency due to gang violence. The capital Quito is included in the emergency measures. Violent crime in Ecuador, a country once seen as a beacon of stability in South America that has become a major drug trafficking hub, has skyrocketed in recent years. The murder rate went from six in 2018 to 47 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2023. The government says its crackdown on gangs who control the country's prisons is producing results, with murders falling to 4,959 between January and October this year, compared to 6,037 for the same period in 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-in-third-massacre-in-a-week-in-ecuador/7820995.html	2024-10-13T16:48:40-07:00	
Lithuania's center-left opposition says it will try to form government	VILNIUS/PANEVEZYS, Lithuania — Lithuania's center-left opposition Social Democrats (SD) will attempt to form a majority coalition government together with two other parties following the country's parliamentary election, its leader said Sunday. Early results showed SD ahead in the election, which was dominated by concerns over living costs and potential threats from neighboring Russia. 'I think it will be a coalition with two left parties,' Vilija Blinkeviciute told reporters, adding the parties in question were the Farmers and Greens and For Lithuania. 'I think it will be a good left coalition.' With 61% of votes counted, SD had 22% support, making it the largest party ahead of the anti-establishment Nemunas Dawn with 17% and the ruling Homeland Union with 15%. Some 52.1% of the Baltic nation's eligible voters cast a ballot, up from 47.2% four years ago, official data showed. Blinkeviciute said foreign policy would not change and helping Ukraine remained a priority. 'I think that our voters, our people said that they want some changes,' she said, pointing to earnings, housing, health care and education as key areas of concern. Lithuania's center-right government of Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte saw its popularity eroded by inflation that topped 20% two years ago, as well as by deteriorating public services and a widening gap between the rich and the poor. 'I got bored with the old government. I want something new,' Hendrikas Varkalis, 75, said after casting his vote in Panevezys, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) northwest of the capital Vilnius. The Baltic state of 2.9 million people has a hybrid voting system in which half of the parliament is elected by popular vote, with a 5% threshold needed to win seats. The other half is chosen on a district basis, a process which favors larger parties. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote in a district, its top two candidates face each other in a run-off on Oct. 27. Domestic issues loomed large in the election campaign, with the SD vowing to tackle increased inequality by raising taxes on wealthier Lithuanians to help fund more spending on health care and social spending. But national security is also a major concern in Lithuania, which is part of the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union and shares a border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad as well as with Belarus, a close Moscow ally. Three-quarters of Lithuanians believe Russia could attack their country soon, a Baltijos Tyrimai/ELTA poll found in May. The main parties strongly support Ukraine in its war with invading Russian forces and back increased defense spending.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lithuania-s-center-left-opposition-says-it-will-try-to-form-government/7820996.html	2024-10-13T16:46:49-07:00	
Kenya says extra police ready for Haiti in early November	Nairobi, Kenya — An extra 600 Kenyan police officers set to join a U.N.-backed mission to try to quell rampant gang violence in Haiti will be ready for deployment in early November, Kenya's police chief said Saturday. President William Ruto had pledged the additional officers Friday following a meeting with Haiti's interim Prime Minister Garry Conille, as the two leaders appealed for the international community to do more. 'A contingent of 600 officers will soon join the Kenyan police already stationed in Haiti after completing pre-deployment training.' said Kenya's Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja. 'Once this training is complete, the officers will be ready for departure early next month,' he said at a media briefing alongside Conille in Nairobi. The East African country is leading the multinational mission aimed at tackling spiraling insecurity in the crime-ravaged Caribbean nation and has so far sent 400 police. Addressing concerns about delays in paying the salaries of officers already in Haiti, Kanja said, 'The payment issue has been sorted out, and the officers are happy.' On Friday, Ruto had urged the international community to 'urgently' rally behind the mission, which has been hobbled by a chronic lack of funding. 'This is the moment to provide that critical support for us to be able to undertake the exercise at hand,' he said in a call echoed by Conille. The Haitian leader's visit to Kenya comes a week after gang members opened fire in the Haitian town of Ponte Sonde, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the capital Port-au-Prince, butchering 109 people and wounding around 40 more. The U.N. Security Council last month extended the policing mission for one year, without transforming it into a U.N. peacekeeping mission as floated by Port-au-Prince. More than 3,600 people have been killed this year in 'senseless' gang violence in Haiti, according to the U.N. human rights office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-says-extra-police-ready-for-haiti-in-early-november/7820993.html	2024-10-13T16:39:00-07:00

Pakistani police fired tear gas, charge protesters in Karachi	Karachi, Pakistan — Pakistani police fired tear gas and swung batons at thousands of protesters Sunday in Karachi after the demonstrators tried to break through a security barricade. Around 2,000 supporters of a far-right Islamist party tried to reach the city’s press club to oppose another demonstration staged by civil society groups about the killing of a blasphemy suspect while he was in custody. Supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party hurled rocks at officers and torched a patrol car when police stopped them from reaching the press club. The party said one of its members died in the violence. Police arrested around 20 people from both demonstrations. Provincial Interior Minister Zia Ul Hassan said authorities feared clashes because both the political party and the civil society groups had issued calls for protests on the same day. Ul Hassan condemned the violence, especially given an upcoming security summit in Islamabad and last week’s deadly attack on a convoy of Chinese nationals outside the city's airport. The TLP supports Pakistan's controversial blasphemy laws, which call for the death penalty for anyone who insults Islam.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-police-fired-tear-gas-charge-protesters-in-karachi/7820984.html	2024-10-13T15:22:57-07:00	
Sri Lanka busts Chinese cybercrime racket	Colombo, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka's police have arrested 198 Chinese men on suspicion of operating a cybercrime ring from the South Asian nation, a police spokesperson said Sunday. Deputy Inspector-General Nihal Thalduwa said the men were taken into custody at four locations during raids carried out since October 6, with 129 arrested in one location Saturday. Thalduwa said that a large number of mobile phones and laptop computers were also seized. 'We suspect that they were operating online scams from these locations,' Thalduwa told reporters in the capital, Colombo. 'Their victims include people in Sri Lanka as well as those overseas.' He said investigations were moving slowly due to language issues in questioning the suspects, but the authorities have sought help of officials from the Chinese Embassy in Colombo. Forensic experts were analyzing the electronic devices that were seized, he said. In June, police arrested another 200 suspects, mainly Indians, who were also accused of operating online financial scams. Thalduwa said the suspects had entered the island as tourists and, in most cases, were overstaying their visas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-busts-chinese-cybercrime-racket/7820979.html	2024-10-13T14:52:59-07:00	
Chinese carmaker GAC considers making EVs in Europe as tariffs loom	Paris — Chinese state-owned carmaker GAC is exploring the manufacture of EVs in Europe to avoid EU tariffs, the general manager of its international business told Reuters on Sunday, joining a growing list of Chinese companies planning local production. The company is among China's largest automakers and is targeting 500,000 overseas sales by 2030. It does not yet sell EVs in Europe but will launch an electric SUV tailored to the European market at the Paris Auto Show, which kicks off Monday. GAC still viewed Europe as an important market that was 'relatively open' despite moves by the European Commission to impose tariffs on EVs made in China, Wei Heigang said, speaking in Paris ahead of the show. 'The tariffs issue definitely has an impact on us. However, all this can be overcome in the long term ... I am positive there is going to be a way to get it all resolved,' he said. 'Local production would be one of the ways to resolve this,' he added. 'We are very actively exploring this possibility.' Discussions were at a very early stage and the company was still considering whether to build a new plant or share — or take over — an existing one, according to Wei. The compact SUV on display in Paris, a 520-kilometer (323-mile) range vehicle called 'Aion V,' should launch in some European markets in mid-2025, priced at less than 40,000 euros ($43,748), though the final price has not yet been set, GAC said. After that launch, the next GAC vehicle due for sale in Europe will be a small electric hatchback, to be released in late 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-carmaker-gac-considers-making-evs-in-europe-as-tariffs-loom/7820966.html	2024-10-13T14:23:52-07:00	
Iran condemns 'illegal, unjustified' US sanctions on oil industry	Tehran, Iran — Iran condemned Sunday what it called an 'illegal and unjustified' expansion of U.S. sanctions targeting its oil industry following Tehran's missile attack on Israel earlier this month. In a statement, foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei defended Iran's attack on Israel and 'strongly condemned' the sanctions, saying they were 'illegal and unjustified.' The United States on Friday slapped Iran with a spate of new sanctions on the country's oil and petrochemical industry in response to Tehran's October 1 attack against Israel. Baghaei defended Iran's attack on Israel as being legal and insisted on Iran's right to respond to the new sanctions. The U.S. Treasury Department said it targeted Iran's so-called shadow fleet of ships involved in selling Iranian oil in circumvention of existing sanctions. It said it had designated at least 10 companies and 17 vessels as 'blocked property' over their involvement in shipments of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products. The State Department also announced it was placing sanctions on six further firms and six ships for 'knowingly engaging in a significant transaction for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran'. Baghaei said 'the policy of threats and maximum pressure' had no impact on 'Iran's will to defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interests and citizens against any violation and foreign aggressions.' He said the sanctions would enable Israel 'to continue killing innocents and pose a threat to the peace and unity of the region and the world'. The new wave of sanctions comes as the world awaits Israel's promised response to Tehran's missile attack, with oil prices hitting their highest levels since August. Earlier this month, U.S. President Joe Biden advised Israel against targeting oil infrastructure in Iran, one of the world's 10 largest producers. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi last Tuesday warned that 'any attack against infrastructure in Iran will provoke an even stronger response.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-condemns-illegal-unjustified-us-sanctions-on-oil-industry/7820962.html	2024-10-13T14:08:04-07:00	
Macron calls on Iran's president to back Mideast 'de-escalation'	Paris — French President Emmanuel Macron called on Iran's leader Masoud Pezeshkian to support a 'general de-escalation' in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon in a telephone conversation Sunday, his office said. Macron stressed 'the responsibility of Iran to support a general de-escalation and to use its influence in this direction with the destabilizing actors that enjoy its support.' Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters are fighting Israeli troops in Lebanon. The Iranian presidential website said that in his conversation with Macron, Pezeshkian had called for an end to 'crimes' in Lebanon and Gaza. They discussed ways to secure a 'cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel,' a statement on the website said. Pezeshkian 'asked the French president to work together with other European countries to force the Zionist regime to stop the genocide and crimes in Gaza and Lebanon,' the statement added. The Israeli army is engaged in close combat with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon this Sunday, where it announced for the first time the capture of an enemy fighter. It is also intensifying its airstrikes against the pro-Iranian formation. For its part, the Lebanese Islamist movement said it was fighting Israeli soldiers at the end of the afternoon 'with automatic weapons' and 'rockets' in at least four villages bordering Israel, with the Israeli army doing 'face to face combat.' After having weakened the Palestinian Hamas in Gaza, Israel moved the front of the war to Lebanon, saying it wanted to allow the return to northern Israel of some 60,000 inhabitants, displaced by the rocket attacks carried out for a year by Hezbollah in support for Hamas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/macron-calls-on-iran-s-president-to-back-mideast-de-escalation/7820955.html	2024-10-13T13:44:03-07:00	
Iran, Iraq to hold funerals for general killed with Hezbollah chief	Tehran, Iran — Iran and Iraq will both stage funerals for Revolutionary Guard General Abbas Nilforushan, killed in an Israeli airstrike alongside Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, the Guards' news agency said Sunday. Nilforushan, a top commander in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force foreign operations arm, was killed on September 27 alongside Nasrallah in the strike on south Beirut. The IRGC said Friday his body had been recovered from the site of the strike on the Lebanese capital's southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold. Funeral ceremonies will be held in 'Najaf and Karbala' in Iraq on Monday before the body is transferred to Iran's holy city of Mashhad, the Sepah news agency said. Another ceremony will take place at Tehran's Imam Hossein Square on Tuesday before burial Thursday in the central city of Isfahan, his hometown, Sepah said. On October 1, Iran fired some 200 missiles at Israel in retaliation for the killing of Nasrallah, Nilforushan and Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in late July. Israel said it carried out the Beirut strike but did not comment on Haniyeh's death in Tehran, where he had attended the inauguration of the Islamic Republic's new president. Israel has vowed to retaliate for the Iranian missile attack, with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant saying the response would be 'deadly, precise, and surprising.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-iraq-to-hold-funerals-for-general-killed-with-hezbollah-chief/7820952.html	2024-10-13T13:34:46-07:00	
North Korea: Front-line units could strike South Korea if more drones appear	Seoul, South Korea — North Korea said Sunday its front-line army units are ready to launch strikes on South Korea, ramping up pressure on its rival that it said flew drones and dropped leaflets over its capital Pyongyang. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned it would sternly punish North Korea if the safety of its citizens is threatened. North Korea on Friday accused South Korea of launching drones to drop propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang three times this month and threatened to respond with force if it happened again. In a statement carried by state media Sunday, the North's Defense Ministry said that the military had issued a preliminary operation order to artillery and other army units near the border with South Korea to 'get fully ready to open fire.' An unidentified ministry spokesperson said the North Korea's military ordered relevant units to fully prepare for situations like launching immediate strikes on unspecified enemy targets when South Korea infiltrates drones across the border again, possibly triggering fighting on the Korean Peninsula, according to the statement. The spokesperson said that 'grave touch-and-go military tensions are prevailing on the Korean Peninsula' because of the South Korean drone launches. In a separate statement later Sunday, the spokesperson said that the entire South Korean territory 'might turn into piles of ashes' following the North's powerful attack. Also Sunday, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un described as 'suicidal' the South Korean Defense Ministry's reported warning that North Korea would face the end of its regime if it harms South Korean nationals. She warned Saturday that the discovery of a new South Korean drone will 'certainly lead to a horrible disaster.' North Korea often issues such fiery, blistering rhetoric in times of elevated animosities with South Korea and the United States. Ties between the two Koreas remain tense since a U.S.-led diplomacy on ending North Korea's nuclear program fell apart in 2019. North Korea has since pushed hard to expand its nuclear arsenal and repeatedly threatened to attack South Korea and the U.S. with its nuclear weapons. But experts say it's unlikely for North Korea to launch a full-blown attack because its military is outpaced by the combined U.S. and South Korean forces. Observers predicted North Korea would escalate tensions ahead of next month's U.S. presidential election to boost its leverage in future diplomacy with the Americans. Since May, North Korea has floated thousands of balloons carrying rubbish toward South Korea in retaliation for South Korean activists flying their own balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets. South Korea's military responded to the North's balloon campaign by restarting border loudspeakers to blare broadcast propaganda and K-pop songs to North Korea. North Korea is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of the authoritarian government of Kim Jong Un and his family's dynastic rule.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-front-line-units-could-strike-south-korea-if-more-drones-appear/7820946.html	2024-10-13T13:10:19-07:00	
Thousands march in Spain to demand affordable housing	Madrid — Thousands protested Sunday in Madrid to demand more affordable housing amid rising anger from Spaniards who feel they are being priced out of the market. Under the slogan 'Housing is a right, not a business,' residents marched in the Spanish capital to demand lower housing rental prices and better living conditions. Twelve thousand people took to the streets, according to the Spanish government. 'Spaniards cannot live in their own cities. They are forcing us out of the cities. The government has to regulate prices, regulate housing,' said nurse Blanca Prieto, 33. In July, Spain's government announced a crackdown on short-term and seasonal holiday lettings. It plans to investigate listings on platforms such as Airbnb and Booking.com to verify if they have licenses. Spain is struggling to balance promoting tourism, a key driver of its economy, and addressing citizens' concerns over unaffordable high rents due to gentrification and landlords shifting to more lucrative tourist rentals. In a separate demonstration in Barcelona on Sunday against the America's Cup yachting race, protesters blamed the international sporting event for pushing up rental prices and bringing more tourists into an overcrowded city. Residents of the Canary Islands and Malaga have also staged protests this year against the rise in tourist rentals. Seasonal hospitality workers struggle to find accommodation in these tourism hot spots, with many resorting to sleeping in caravans or even their cars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-march-in-spain-to-demand-affordable-housing/7820929.html	2024-10-13T12:37:21-07:00	
Israel urges UN peacekeepers’ evacuation from combat zones in Lebanon	Israel’s prime minister is urging U.N. peacekeeping forces to leave war-torn parts of Lebanon as Israel continues targeting Hezbollah. His comments came after news that recent Israeli strikes injured five U.N. peacekeepers.

US will send an air defense battery and American troops to Israel to bolster defenses against Iran	Washington — The United States will send a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery and troops to Israel, the Pentagon said Sunday, even as Iran warned Washington to keep American military forces out of Israel. Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin authorized the deployment of the THAAD battery at the direction of President Joe Biden. Ryder said the system will help bolster Israel's air defenses following Iran's missile attacks on Israel in April and October. 'This action underscores the United States' ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel, and to defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks by Iran,' Ryder said. The Iranian warning came in a post on the social platform X long associated with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who noted the reports that the U.S. was considering the deployment. Israel is widely believed to be preparing a military response to Iran's Oct. 1 attack when it fired roughly 180 missiles into Israel. It was not immediately clear where the THAAD battery was coming from. The U.S. deployed one of the batteries to the Middle East along with additional Patriot battalions to bolster protections for U.S. forces in the region late last year after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas militants. Ryder also said that the U.S. sent a THAAD battery to Israel in 2019 for training. According to an April report by the Congressional Research Service, the Army has seven THAAD batteries. Generally each consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, radio and radar equipment and required 95 soldiers to operate. The THAAD is considered a complementary system to the Patriot, but it can defend a wider area. It can hit targets at ranges of 150 to 200 kilometers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-will-send-an-air-defense-battery-and-american-troops-to-israel-to-bolster-defenses-against-iran-/7820840.html	2024-10-13T10:06:21-07:00

Train crash in Egypt kills 1, injures 21 people	Cairo — A locomotive crashed into the tail of the Cairo-bound passenger train Sunday in southern Egypt, killing at least one person and injuring multiple others, authorities said. It is the second train crash in a month in the North African country. The collision occurred in the province of Minya, 270 kilometers (about 168 miles) south of Cairo, the railway authority said in a statement, and two railway carriages fell into an adjacent watercourse. The cause of the crash was being investigated, the statement added. Footage aired by local media showed the two carriages partially submerged in the watercourse. Along with the fatality, the Health Ministry said in a separate statement at least 21 people were taken to hospitals, of which 19 were later discharged after receiving treatment. Train derailments and crashes are common in Egypt, where an aging railway system has also been plagued by mismanagement. In September, two passenger trains collided in a Nile Delta city, killing at least three people. In recent years, the government announced initiatives to improve its railways. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said in 2018 some 250 billion Egyptian pounds, or $8.13 billion, would be needed to properly overhaul the neglected rail network.	https://www.voanews.com/a/train-crash-in-egypt-kills-1-injures-21-people-/7820783.html	2024-10-13T08:37:26-07:00	
Ukraine's human rights envoy urges response to alleged killings of Ukrainian POWs in Kursk	Kyiv — Ukraine's human rights ombudsman urged international organizations Sunday to respond to a claim that several Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed in Russia's Kursk region, where Kyiv had launched an incursion in August. DeepState, a Ukrainian battlefield analysis site close to Ukraine's Defense Ministry, said Russian troops shot and killed nine Ukrainian 'drone operators and contractors' on Oct. 10 after they had surrendered. Dmytro Lubinets said on Telegram that he sent letters to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding the claim, calling it 'another crime committed by the Russians.' Earlier this month, Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine said Russian troops had killed 16 captured Ukrainian soldiers in the partially occupied Donetsk region. There was no immediate response from Russian officials. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian air force said Sunday that its air defenses had shot down 31 of 68 drones launched at Ukraine by Russia overnight into Sunday in the regions of Kyiv, Poltava, Chernihiv, Sumy and Cherkasy. A further 36 drones were 'lost' over various areas, it said, likely having been electronically jammed. The air force added that ballistic missiles struck Odesa and Poltava while Chernihiv and Sumy came under attack by a guided air missile. Local authorities didn't report any casualties or damage. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that Russia had launched around 900 guided aerial bombs, more than 40 missiles and 400 drones against Ukraine over the past week. Zelenskyy appealed on social platform X to Ukraine's allies to 'provide the necessary quantity and quality of air defense systems' and 'make decisions for our sufficient range'. Kyiv is still awaiting word from its Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said that 13 Ukrainian drones were shot down over three regions of Russia: six each in the Belgorod and Kursk regions, and one in the Bryansk region, all of which border Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-s-human-rights-envoy-urges-response-to-alleged-killings-of-ukrainian-pows-in-kursk/7820719.html	2024-10-13T06:52:53-07:00	
Biden will view Hurricane Milton damage in Florida; Harris plans to go to church in North Carolina	Washington — President Joe Biden on Sunday will survey the devastation inflicted on Florida's Gulf Coast by Hurricane Milton as he urges Congress to approve additional emergency disaster funding. Vice President Kamala Harris will spend a second day in North Carolina, hard-hit by Hurricane Helene, to attend a Black church and hold a campaign rally. Biden's visit to the St. Petersburg area offers him another chance to press House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., for congressional approval of more aid money before the Nov. 5 election. Johnson has said the issue will be dealt with after then. 'I think Speaker Johnson is going to get the message that he's got to step up, particularly for small businesses,' Biden told reporters as he and Harris met with aides on Friday to discuss the federal response to Hurricanes Milton and Helene. Biden and Johnson have yet to discuss the matter directly. In Florida, Biden was set to announce $612 million for six Department of Energy projects in areas affected by the hurricanes to improve the resilience of the region's electric grid, the White House said. The funding includes $94 million for two projects in Florida: $47 million for Gainesville Regional Utilities and $47 million for Switched Source to partner with Florida Power and Light. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, visited Raleigh on Saturday to meet with Black elected and religious leaders and help volunteers package personal care items for delivery to victims of Helene in the western part of the state. She was spending Sunday in Greenville, with plans to speak during a church service as part of her campaign's 'Souls to the Polls' effort to help turn out Black churchgoers before Election Day. She was also scheduled to hold a rally to talk about her economic plans and highlight Thursday's start of early voting in the state, her campaign said. Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will spend the coming week campaigning in the competitive states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina, according to a Harris campaign official who was not authorized to publicly discuss details not yet made public and spoke on condition of anonymity. With less than four weeks to go before Election Day, the hurricanes have added another dimension to the closely contested presidential race. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has said the Biden administration's storm response had been lacking, particularly in North Carolina after Hurricane Helene. Biden and Harris have hammered Trump for promoting falsehoods about the federal response. Trump made a series of false claims after Helene struck in late September, including incorrectly saying that the federal government is intentionally withholding aid to Republican disaster victims. He also falsely claimed the Federal Emergency Management Agency had run out of money because all of it had gone to programs for immigrants in the country illegally. Biden said Trump was 'not singularly' to blame for the spread of false claims in recent weeks but that he has the 'biggest mouth.' The president is pressing for swift action by Congress to make sure the Small Business Administration and FEMA have the money they need to get through hurricane season, which ends Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. He said Friday that Milton alone had caused an estimated $50 billion in damages. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said last week that FEMA will be able to meet 'immediate needs' caused by the two storms. But he warned in the aftermath of Helene that the agency does not have enough funding to make it through the hurricane season. But Johnson has pushed back, saying the agencies have enough money for the time being and that lawmakers will address the funding issue during the lame-duck session after the election. Also percolating in the background are tensions between Harris and Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla. As Helene barreled toward Florida, the two traded accusations that the other was trying to politicize the federal storm response. Harris' office last week suggested that DeSantis was dodging her phone calls. DeSantis responded that he was unaware she had called and he grumbled that she hadn't been involved in the federal government's response before she became the Democratic nominee. Biden, for his part, said he hoped to see DeSantis on Sunday, if the governor's schedule permitted. 'He's been very cooperative,' Biden said about DeSantis. He added, 'We got on very, very well.' DeSantis said Saturday that he had no details about the president's visit. Biden was scheduled to survey damage during an aerial tour between Tampa and St. Pete Beach, where he will be briefed on the storm by federal, state and local officials. He also will residents and first responders. Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday evening. At least 10 people were killed and hundreds of thousands of residents remain without power. Officials say the toll could have been worse if not for widespread evacuations. The still-fresh devastation wrought by Helene just two weeks earlier probably helped compel many people to flee.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-will-view-hurricane-milton-damage-in-florida-harris-plans-to-go-to-church-in-north-carolina-/7820683.html	2024-10-13T06:08:47-07:00	
China's Premier Li talks trade in Vietnam despite differences over South China Sea	BANGKOK — China agreed Sunday to assist Vietnam on cross-border railway development and take steps to expand agricultural imports from its smaller neighbor, Vietnam's official media said. Premier Li Qiang, on an official visit to Vietnam, pledged that China would further open its market to high-quality fruits, seafood and other Vietnamese products, a state media report said. China is Vietnam's largest trading partner and second-largest export market after the U.S. Trade between the two countries reached $172 billion in 2023. Vietnam's top leader, To Lam, signaled the importance of the relationship when he made China his first overseas visit after assuming his post last year. Li came to Vietnam from neighboring Laos, where he had pushed back against calls at a meeting of Southeast Asian leaders to respect international law in territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh told Li that both sides should respect each other's legitimate rights and interests, resolve disputes through peaceful means and properly address issues related to fishers and their vessels, the state media report said. Vietnam condemned China two weeks ago for what it described as an assault by Chinese law enforcement personnel that injured several Vietnamese fishers near the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. The islands have been under the de facto control of China since 1974, when Beijing seized them from Vietnam in a brief but violent naval conflict. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the Southeast Asian leaders gathered in Laos last week that the U.S. is concerned about China's 'increasingly dangerous and unlawful' activities in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety. In their talks on Sunday, Chinh and Li agreed to deepen exchange and cooperation in diplomacy, national defense and public security, the state media report said. They also witnessed the exchange of 10 cooperation agreements, including the establishment of a working group to develop cross-border economic cooperation zones and the implementation of QR-code, cross-border payment services. The railway agreements covered a technical plan and feasibility studies to improve train connectivity between Vietnam and China. On trade, Chinh asked for greater access for a range of products including tropical fruits, meat products, farm-raised spiny lobster and plant-based traditional medicines. Li said that China stands ready to resolve trade issues and work with Vietnam on quarantine and customs procedures, according to the Vietnamese report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-premier-li-talks-trade-in-vietnam-despite-differences-over-south-china-sea-/7820670.html	2024-10-13T05:43:22-07:00	
NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft will scour Jupiter moon for the ingredients for life	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A NASA spacecraft is ready to set sail for Jupiter and its moon Europa, one of the best bets for finding life beyond Earth. Europa Clipper will peer beneath the moon’s icy crust where an ocean is thought to be sloshing fairly close to the surface. It won’t search for life, but rather determine whether conditions there could support it. Another mission would be needed to flush out any microorganisms lurking there. 'It’s a chance for us to explore not a world that might have been habitable billions of years ago, but a world that might be habitable today — right now,' said program scientist Curt Niebur. Its massive solar panels make Clipper the biggest craft built by NASA to investigate another planet. It will take 5 1/2 years to reach Jupiter and will sneak within 16 miles (25 kilometers) of Europa's surface — considerably closer than any other spacecraft. Liftoff is targeted for this month aboard SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. Mission cost: $5.2 billion. Europa, the superstar among Jupiter’s many moons One of Jupiter’s 95 known moons, Europa is almost the size of our own moon. It's encased in an ice sheet estimated to be 10 miles to 15 miles or more (15 kilometers to 24 kilometers) thick. Scientists believe this frozen crust hides an ocean that could be 80 miles (120 kilometers) or more deep. The Hubble Space Telescope has spotted what appear to be geysers erupting from the surface. Discovered by Galileo in 1610, Europa is one of the four so-called Galilean moons of Jupiter, along with Ganymede, Io and Callisto. Seeking conditions that support life What type of life might Europa harbor? Besides water, organic compounds are needed for life as we know it, plus an energy source. In Europa’s case that could be thermal vents on the ocean floor. Deputy project scientist Bonnie Buratti imagines any life would be primitive like the bacterial life that originated in Earth’s deep ocean vents. 'We will not know from this mission because we can’t see that deep,' she said. Unlike missions to Mars where habitability is one of many questions, Clipper’s sole job is to establish whether the moon could support life in its ocean or possibly in any pockets of water in the ice. Supersized spacecraft When its solar wings and antennas are unfurled, Clipper is about the size of a basketball court — more than 100 feet (30 meters) end to end — and weighs nearly 13,000 pounds (6,000 kilograms). The supersized solar panels are needed because of Jupiter’s distance from the sun. The main body — about the size of a camper — is packed with nine science instruments, including radar that will penetrate the ice, cameras that will map virtually the entire moon and tools to tease out the contents of Europa’s surface and tenuous atmosphere. The name hearkens to the swift sailing ships of centuries past. Circling Jupiter to fly by Europa The roundabout trip to Jupiter will span 1.8 billion miles (3 billion kilometers). For extra oomph, the spacecraft will swing past Mars early next year and then Earth in late 2026. It arrives at Jupiter in 2030 and begins science work the next year. While orbiting Jupiter, it will cross paths with Europa 49 times. The mission ends in 2034 with a planned crash into Ganymede — Jupiter’s biggest moon and the solar system's too. Europa flybys pose huge radiation risk There’s more radiation around Jupiter than anywhere else in our solar system, besides the sun. Europa passes through Jupiter’s bands of radiation as it orbits the gas giant, making it especially menacing for spacecraft. That’s why Clipper’s electronics are inside a vault with dense aluminum and zinc walls. All this radiation would nix any life on Europa’s surface. But it could break down water molecules and, perhaps, release oxygen all the way down into the ocean that could possibly fuel sea life. Earlier this year, NASA was in a panic that the spacecraft's many transistors might not withstand the intense radiation. But after months of analysis, engineers concluded the mission could proceed as planned. Other visitors to Jupiter and Europa NASA’s twin Pioneer spacecraft and then two Voyagers swept past Jupiter in the 1970s. The Voyagers provided the first detailed photos of Europa but from quite a distance. NASA’s Galileo spacecraft had repeated flybys of the moon during the 1990s, passing as close as 124 miles (200 kilometers). Still in action around Jupiter, NASA’s Juno spacecraft has added to Europa’s photo album. Arriving at Jupiter a year after Clipper will be the European Space Agency’s Juice spacecraft, launched last year. Ganymede and other possible ocean worlds Like Europa, Jupiter’s jumbo moon Ganymede is thought to host an underground ocean. But its frozen shell is much thicker — possibly 100 miles (160 kilometers) thick — making it tougher to probe the environment below. Callisto’s ice sheet may be even thicker, possibly hiding an ocean. Saturn’s moon Enceladus has geysers shooting up, but it’s much farther than Jupiter. Ditto for Saturn’s moon Titan, also suspected of having a subterranean sea. While no ocean worlds have been confirmed beyond our solar system, scientists believe they’re out there — and may even be relatively common. Messages in a cosmic bottle Like many robotic explorers before it, Clipper bears messages from Earth. Attached to the electronics vault is a triangular metal plate. On one side is a design labeled 'water words' with representations of the word for water in 104 languages. On the opposite side: a poem about the moon by U.S. poet laureate Ada Limon and a silicon chip containing the names of 2.6 million people who signed up to vicariously ride along.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-s-europa-clipper-spacecraft-will-scour-jupiter-moon-for-the-ingredients-for-life-/7820650.html	2024-10-13T04:54:52-07:00	
Sudan rescuers say air strike killed 23 in Khartoum market	Port Sudan, Sudan — A Sudanese network of volunteer rescuers said on Sunday the military carried out an air strike a day earlier on a marketplace in Khartoum, leaving 23 people dead. The market is near one of the main camps in the Sudanese capital, where the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been fighting the military as part of a civil war that has killed tens of thousands of people. 'Twenty-three people were confirmed dead and more than 40 others wounded' and taken to hospital after 'military air strikes on Saturday afternoon on the main market' in southern Khartoum, the youth-led Emergency Response Rooms said in a post on Facebook. Fierce fighting has raged since Friday around Khartoum, much of which is controlled by the RSF, with the military pounding the center and south of the city from the air. The military is advancing towards Khartoum from nearby Omdurman, where clashes erupted on Saturday, eyewitnesses said. World's largest displacement crisis Since April 2023, when war broke out between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, the paramilitaries had largely pushed the army out of Khartoum. The World Health Organization says at least 20,000 people have been killed in the civil war, but some estimates put the toll much higher at up to 150,000. The war has also created the world's largest displacement crisis, the U.N. says. More than 10 million people, around a fifth of Sudan's population, have been forced from their homes, according to U.N. figures. A U.N.-backed assessment in August declared a famine in the Zamzam refugee camp in Darfur near the city of El-Fasher. The government loyal to the army is based in Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast, where the army has retained control. The RSF meanwhile has taken control of nearly all of the vast western region of Darfur, rampaged through the agricultural heartland of central Sudan and pushed into the army-controlled southeast.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-rescuers-say-air-strike-killed-23-in-khartoum-market-/7820644.html	2024-10-13T04:36:49-07:00	
Amazon wants to be everything to everyone	Mount Juliet, United States — Amazon is bolstering its e-commerce empire while continuing a march deeper into people's lives, from robots to healthcare and entertainment. Innovations unveiled in recent days by the Seattle-based tech titan included a delivery van computer system to shave time off deliveries by its speed-obsessed logistics network. Amazon Stores boss Doug Herrington said that the technology enables vans to recognize stops and signal which packages to drop off. 'When we speed up deliveries, customers shop more,' Herrington said. 'For 2024, we're going to have the fastest Prime delivery speeds around the world,' he added, referring to Amazon's subscription service. On top of that, according to Herrington, Amazon last year managed to cut 45 cents off the cost per unit shipped, a huge savings when considering the massive volume of sales. Prime is the 'glue' Amazon last year recorded profit of more than $30 billion on revenue of $575 billion, powered by its online retail operation and its AWS cloud computing division. 'They have this whole flywheel model with Amazon Prime membership in the middle,' said eMarketer analyst Suzy Davidkhanian. 'That's the glue that keeps everything together.' Businesses include retail, advertising, cloud computing and streamed movies and music. But that very model has the 30-year-old company facing a US government lawsuit, accused of expanding an illegal monopoly and otherwise harming competition. Amazon makes money from data gathered about consumers, either by targeting ads or through insights into what products they might like, Davidkhanian said. That was why Amazon paid for expensive rights to stream NFL American football games on Prime Video in a move that promises to help it pinpoint fans of the sport. Amazon's digital assistant Alexa can order items on command and has been even built into appliances such as washing machines to let them automatically buy supplies like laundry soap as needed. A 'pocket pharmacy' Amazon showed off enhancements to its virtual health care service called One Medical. For $9 a month Prime members are promised anytime access to video consultations with health care professionals, along with record keeping and drug prescriptions. An Amazon Pharmacy takes advantage of the company's delivery network to get prescriptions to patients quickly, striving for speeds of less than 24 hours for 45 percent of customers by the end of next year. 'We're building a pharmacy in your pocket that offers rapid delivery right to your door,' Amazon Pharmacy chief Hannah McClellan said, referring to the option of using a smartphone app. The healthcare market promises to be lucrative for Amazon, which is 'trying to be the platform that has everything for everyone,' said analyst Davidkhanian. Real world wrinkles Amazon has suffered setbacks when it comes to brick-and-mortar stores but it continues to strive for a winning strategy. The company next year will open its first 'automated micro warehouse' in Pennsylvania, next to a Whole Foods Market organic grocery shop, the chain it bought in 2017. People will be able to pick up certain items selected online, with orders filled by robots, after shopping next door for fresh produce and groceries. Meanwhile, Amazon is ramping up use of artificial intelligence at its online store with tools helping sellers describe and illustrate products. Product labels will change according to the user, displaying terms likely to catch their attention such as 'strawberry flavor' for some and 'gluten-free' for others. 'The things that Amazon is doing with AI are to make sure that you go from researching something to making the purchase as quickly as possible,' Davidkhanian said. At the logistics center near Nashville, robotic arms deftly placed packages in carts that autonomously made their way to trucks. Logistics center automation improves safety and frees up workers for more interesting tasks, according to Amazon robotics manager Julie Mitchell. However, critics cite delivery speed pressure and other factors as making Amazon warehouses more dangerous than the industry average.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amazon-wants-to-be-everything-to-everyone-/7820636.html	2024-10-13T04:11:54-07:00	
Pope urges 'respect' for UN peacekeepers in Lebanon	Vatican City, Holy See — Pope Francis asked Sunday for 'respect' for U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon who have accused the Israeli military of deliberately firing on their positions. 'I am close to all the people involved, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, where I ask that the U.N. peacekeepers be respected,' Francis said at the Vatican. The peacekeeping mission, UNIFIL, has said that its forces have repeatedly come under fire in the Lebanese town of Naqura where it is headquartered, as well as in other positions. At least five U.N. peacekeepers have been wounded as Israeli forces battle Hezbollah. Efforts to negotiate a stop to the fighting in Lebanon and Gaza have so far failed. 'I once again call for an immediate ceasefire on all fronts that the paths of diplomacy and dialogue be pursued to achieve peace,' Francis said at the end of the Angelus prayer. 'I pray for all the victims, for the displaced, for the hostages and I hope that this great and unnecessary suffering, generated by hatred and revenge, will end soon,' he said. 'Brothers and sisters, war is an illusion. It will never bring peace, it will never bring security, it is a defeat for everyone, especially because you believe you are invincible. Please stop,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-urges-respect-for-un-peacekeepers-in-lebanon-/7820628.html	2024-10-13T03:53:32-07:00	
Determination to rebuild follows Florida's hurricanes with acceptance that storms will come again	VENICE, Fla — No sooner had residents of the Bahia Vista Gulf condominium complex dug out and from Hurricane Helene than they were faced with the same daunting cleanup from new damage inflicted by Hurricane Milton. The beachfront units had been gutted, treated and dried out after Hurricane Helene and mounds of sand that had blown in from the beach had been removed. Then, less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton barreled in and undid all the progress. 'They’ve got to start the whole process over, cleaning, sanitizing, bringing in drying equipment, getting them all dried and prepped for renovations,' lamented Bill O’Connell, a board member at the complex in Venice, about an hour's drive south of Tampa. The second hurricane 'brought all the sand back on our property.' Some longtime Floridians have grown accustomed to the annual cycle of storms that can shatter and upend lives in a state known mostly for its balmy weather, sunshine and beaches. 'It’s the price you pay to live in paradise,' O’Connell said. 'If you want to live here with this view, beautiful sunsets, be able to go out on your boat, enjoy what Florida has to offer, you have to be willing to accept that these storms are going to come.' The devastation of the back-to-back storms is still being tallied as a swath of the state comes to terms with damage from the unusual dual strike of storms in such close proximity. Many residents, some returning home after evacuating, spent much of Saturday searching for gas as a fuel shortage gripped the state. President Joe Biden planned to visit the Gulf Coast on Sunday. Hurricane Milton killed at least 10 people after it made landfall as a Category 3 storm, tearing across central Florida, flooding barrier islands and spawning deadly tornadoes. Officials say the toll could have been worse if not for the widespread evacuations. Overall, more than a thousand people were rescued in the wake of the storm. Disaster hits twice In the fishing village of Cortez, a community of 4,100 southwest of Tampa, Catherine Praught said she and her husband, Mark, felt 'pure panic' when Hurricane Milton menaced Cortez so soon after Helene, forcing them to pause their cleanup and evacuate. Fortunately, their home wasn’t damaged by the second storm. 'This is where we live,' Catherine Praught said of their low-lying home of 36 years that had to be emptied, gutted and scrubbed after Helene. 'We’re just hopeful we get the insurance company to help us.' Residents of the community's modest, single-story wood and stucco-fronted cottages were working Saturday to remove broken furniture and tree limbs, stacking the debris in the street much like they did after Hurricane Helene. A similar scene could be found in Steinhatchee, west of Gainsville, where enormous piles of debris lined the streets. Melissa Harden lives less than a block from a restaurant and neighborhood bar that were reduced to rubble. Her house is on 16-foot (4.9-meter) pilings, but 4 feet (1.2 meters) of water still flooded in. When Milton was forecast, she feared Steinhatachee would be hit by the third hurricane in 14 months. 'Personally, I thought, if it comes, we’re already evacuated and our home is pretty messed up,' she said as friends and relatives helped with the cleanup, removing bathroom fixtures and pulling out damaged boards. 'Of course we didn’t want it! No more storms!' Moody’s Analytics on Saturday estimated economic costs from the storm will range from $50 billion to $85 billion, including upwards of $70 billion in property damage and an economic output loss of up to $15 billion. Widespread fuel shortage In St. Petersburg, scores of people lined up at a station that had no gas Saturday, hoping it would arrive soon. Among them was Daniel Thornton and his 9-year-old daughter Magnolia, who arrived at 7 a.m. and were still waiting four hours later. 'They told me they have gas coming but they don’t know when it’s going to be here,' he said. 'I have no choice. I have to sit here all day with her until I get gas.' Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters Saturday morning that the state opened three fuel distribution sites and planned to open several more. Residents can get 10 gallons (37.8 liters) each, free of charge, he said. 'Obviously as power gets restored ... and the Port of Tampa is open, you’re going to see the fuel flowing. But in the meantime, we want to give people another option,' DeSantis said. Officials were replenishing area gas stations with the state’s fuel stockpiles and provided generators to stations that remained without power. Rising rivers among the remaining safety threats As the recovery continues, DeSantis has warned people to be cautious, citing ongoing safety threats including downed power lines and standing water. Some 1.1 million Floridians were still without power Saturday night, according to Poweroutage.us. National Weather Service Meteorologist Paul Close said rivers will 'keep rising' for the next several days and result in flooding, mostly around Tampa Bay and northward. Those areas were hit by the most rain, which comes on top of a wet summer that included several earlier hurricanes. 'You can't do much but wait,' Close said of the rivers cresting. 'At least there is no rain in the forecast, no substantial rain. So we have a break here from all our wet weather.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/determination-to-rebuild-follows-florida-s-hurricanes-with-acceptance-that-storms-will-come-again-/7820622.html	2024-10-13T03:37:27-07:00	
Indian politician known for close ties with Bollywood is killed in Mumbai	NEW DELHI — A senior politician in India's financial capital, Mumbai, who was also known for his close ties with Bollywood has been shot dead weeks before a key state election. Baba Siddique, 66, was shot multiple times outside his son's office in Mumbai on Saturday night, police said in a statement. He later succumbed to his wounds at the city's Lilavati Hospital. Siddique was associated with the Indian National Congress party for decades but had recently joined a regional party that rules Maharashtra state. He was also close to several Bollywood superstars and was known for throwing lavish parties. Maharashtra's deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who is from the same political party as Siddique, said he was shocked by the killing. 'The incident will be thoroughly investigated, and strict action will be taken against the attackers. The mastermind behind the attack will also be traced,' Pawar said in a statement. News agency Press Trust of India reported that two suspected attackers had been arrested, and police were searching for another. Broadcaster NDTV said the two suspects claimed they were part of a crime gang that has carried out multiple killings in the past. Elections in Maharashtra state are expected to be held in November.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-politician-known-for-close-ties-with-bollywood-is-killed-in-mumbai/7820607.html	2024-10-13T02:38:57-07:00	
Pakistan separatist militants BLA deny involvement in attack on mines	KARACHI, Pakistan — The Baloch Liberation Army, a militant separatist group in Pakistan, denied involvement in an attack that killed at least 21 mine workers, condemning the violence. Dozens of attackers stormed a cluster of small private coal mines in Pakistan's restive southwest on Friday with guns, rockets and hand grenades, killing some miners in their sleep and shooting others after lining them up. 'Baloch Liberation Army condemns the massacre of 21 Pashtun workers in Dukki, making it clear that our organization has no involvement in this tragic incident,' the BLA said in an email late on Saturday. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack on the mines of the Junaid Coal Co. in the mineral-rich province of Balochistan that borders Afghanistan and Iran. It was the worst such attack in weeks and comes days before Pakistan hosts a summit of the Eurasian group Shanghai Cooperation Organization. A decadeslong insurgency in Balochistan by separatist militant groups has led to frequent attacks against the government, army and Chinese interests in the region, pressing demands for a share in mineral-rich resources. Besides the separatists, the region is also home to Islamist militants, who have resurged since 2022 after revoking a cease-fire with the government. The BLA seeks independence for Balochistan. It is the biggest of several ethnic insurgent groups that have battled the South Asian nation's government for decades, saying it unfairly exploits Balochistan's rich gas and mineral resources. The province is home to key mining projects, including Reko Diq, run by giant Barrick Gold ABX.TO and believed to be one of the world's largest gold and copper mines. China also operates a gold and copper mine in the province. At the time of the attack, a delegation from Saudi Arabia, which says it is set to buy a stake in the Reko Diq mine, was in Islamabad exploring deals as Pakistan seeks to recover from an economic crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-separatist-militants-bla-deny-involvement-in-attack-on-mines/7820594.html	2024-10-13T01:27:52-07:00	
Israeli strike on Gaza kills family of 8, Palestinian officials say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike on the central Gaza Strip has killed a family of eight, Palestinian medical officials said Sunday, as Israeli forces battled Palestinian militants and pushed for the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people from the territory's north. Israel is also waging an air and ground campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon and is expected to strike Iran in retaliation for a missile attack earlier this month, though it has not said how or when. The strike in Gaza late Saturday hit a home in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing parents and their six children, who ranged in age from 8 to 23, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, where the bodies were taken. It said another seven people were wounded, including two women and a child in critical condition. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies and filmed funeral prayers held at the hospital. More than a year into the war with Hamas, Israel continues to strike what it says are militant targets in Gaza nearly every day. The military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas and other armed groups because they operate in densely populated areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. In recent months, it has repeatedly struck schools being used as shelters by displaced people, accusing militants of hiding among them. Israel presses for full evacuation of northern Gaza In northern Gaza, Israeli air and ground forces have been attacking Jabaliya, where the military says militants have regrouped. Over the past year, Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to the built-up refugee camp, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, and other hard-hit areas. Israel has ordered the full evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. An estimated 400,000 people remain in the north after a mass evacuation ordered in the opening weeks of the war. The Palestinians fear Israel intends to permanently depopulate the north to establish military bases or Jewish settlements there. The military confirmed Saturday that hospitals were included in the evacuation orders but said it had not set a specific timetable. It said a medical convoy scheduled to transfer patients from the Kamal Adwan Hospital in recent days was canceled for security reasons — without elaborating — but that the convoy had delivered fuel to the hospital on Saturday. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's bombardment and ground invasions of Gaza have killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and left much of the territory in ruins. Palestinian medical officials do not say whether those killed by Israeli forces are militants or civilians, but say women and children make up over half the fatalities. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. Israel expected to strike Iran as fighting rages in Lebanon Lebanon's Hezbollah, which is allied with Hamas, began firing rockets into Israel on October 8, 2023, drawing retaliatory airstrikes. The conflict dramatically escalated in September with a wave of Israeli strikes that killed Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground operation into southern Lebanon earlier this month. At least 2,255 people have been killed in Lebanon since the start of the conflict, including more than 1,400 people since September, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry, which also does not say how many were Hezbollah fighters. At least 54 people have been killed in the rocket attacks on Israel, nearly half of them soldiers. Iran, which supports Hezbollah and Hamas, launched around 180 ballistic missiles at Israel to avenge the killing of Nasrallah, an Iranian general who was with him, and Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who died in an explosion in Iran's capital in July that was widely blamed on Israel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strike-on-gaza-kills-family-of-8-palestinian-officials-say/7820590.html	2024-10-13T01:15:55-07:00	
Taiwan spots Chinese carrier; China military video says 'prepared for battle'	TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan reported a Chinese aircraft carrier group sailing to the island's south on Sunday, as China's military put out a video saying it was 'prepared for battle' amid concerns in Taipei about the possibility of a new round of Chinese war games. China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, detests its president Lai Ching-te as a 'separatist,' and the Chinese military routinely operates around the island. Last week at his keynote national day speech, Lai said the People's Republic of China had no right to represent Taiwan, but that the island was willing to work with Beijing to combat challenges such as climate change, striking both a firm and conciliatory tone, but drawing anger from China. Taiwan's defense ministry said in a statement that a Chinese navy group led by the carrier the Liaoning had entered waters near the Bashi Channel, which connects the South China Sea and the Pacific and separates Taiwan from the Philippines. It said the carrier group was expected to enter the Western Pacific. Taiwan's armed forces are keeping a close watch on developments and 'exercising an appropriate vigilance and response,' the ministry added, without elaborating. Security sources in Taiwan had said before Lai's address that his speech could prompt new Chinese war games, last held by the country in May in what Beijing said was 'punishment' for Lai's inauguration speech that month. Earlier Sunday, the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theatre Command, which has responsibility for an area that includes Taiwan, put out a propaganda video on its social media accounts entitled 'fully prepared and biding ones time before battle.' It showed fighter jets and warships operating together, mobile missile launchers being moving into place and amphibious assault vehicles, with a small map of Taiwan included in one of the Chinese characters that make up the video's title. China has not ruled out using force to achieve unification. China's defense ministry did not answer calls outside of office hours on Sunday. China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lai and his government reject Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only Taiwan's people can decide their future. Lai has repeatedly offered talks with Beijing but been rebuffed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-spots-chinese-carrier-china-military-video-says-prepared-for-battle-/7820587.html	2024-10-13T00:48:58-07:00	
Ukrainian move to ban Moscow-linked church stirs anger in Russia	moscow — Speaking behind the thick white walls of Moscow's ancient Danilov Monastery, Archpriest Igor Yakimchuk is adamant: People must not be forbidden to pray in their chosen branch of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. He speaks calmly, but Yakimchuk is one of many Orthodox Christians in Russia who are angry about a law passed by Kyiv in August that targets a Russia-linked Orthodox church that long dominated religious life in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration accuses the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) of spreading pro-Russian propaganda in time of war and of housing spies, charges it denies. Under the law, the Russian Orthodox Church itself was banned on Ukrainian territory and a government commission was tasked with compiling a list of 'affiliated' organizations - expected to include the UOC - whose activities will be outlawed, too. 'In the 21st century, in the center of Europe, millions of people are being deprived of their basic civil rights,' Yakimchuk, wearing a black cassock and a large Orthodox cross around his neck, told Reuters in an interview. 'Because what does it mean to ban a church, which is the largest religious denomination in Ukraine, no matter how much the current Ukrainian authorities would like to downplay its scale? Everyone understands perfectly well that it is impossible to forbid people to pray.' Whether the UOC retains the following it once did is disputed. An independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) that was set up after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 to be fully independent of Moscow has seen its popularity grow rapidly since President Vladimir Putin sent his forces into Ukraine in 2022. Ukrainian authorities say the UOC is fair game. They have launched dozens of criminal proceedings, including treason charges, against dozens of its clergy. At least one has been sent to Russia as part of a prisoner swap. Church divided However, Yakimchuk's denunciation of what he calls 'absolute lawlessness' in Ukraine is a reflection of how the nearly 32-month war - which Moscow calls a 'special military operation' - has divided Orthodox hierarchies in the two countries, even though they all adhere to Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The UOC tried to distance itself from Moscow once the war was underway, condemning Russia's actions and removing references to the 'Moscow Patriarchate' from its name. But those attempts angered clerics in Moscow, who have thrown their weight behind what they cast as Russia's 'holy war' in Ukraine against the expanding influence of what they see as a decadent, godless West. The UOC's efforts also failed to allay Kyiv's concerns about the church's activities and loyalties. The process of shutting down UOC operations in Ukraine - something one Ukrainian lawmaker called 'cleansing' - is likely to be lengthy and involve court battles, but the church's days seem numbered. Some opinion polls suggest more than 80% of Ukrainians do not trust the UOC. The Kremlin, which has forged close ties with the Russian Orthodox Church, has described Ukraine's new law as 'an open attack on freedom of religion.' One Russian Orthodox priest in St. Petersburg, Leonid Trofimuk, branded Ukraine's action as 'Satanism' and compared it to Soviet-era state repression of religion. 'The 20th century is behind us,' he said. 'We saw the persecution of the church at that time, but we didn't think that there would be this kind of persecution that is going on now in Ukraine.' Ordinary Russian churchgoers interviewed by Reuters also expressed concern. 'There is a kind of total politicization of matters of faith going on,' said Sergei, a St. Petersburg resident. 'I would like common sense to prevail and the international community to finally pay attention.' His criticism of Kyiv's moves was echoed by churchgoers leaving a golden onion-domed church more than 900 miles (1,448 km) away to the south, in Mariupol, a Ukrainian port city seized by Russian forces in 2022 after a long siege. 'This is wrong - you shouldn't do this kind of thing,' said Olga, a Mariupol resident who was wearing a headscarf. 'How can he [Zelenskyy] interfere with faith in God? This is not a matter for the state.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-move-to-ban-moscow-linked-church-stirs-anger-in-russia/7819838.html	2024-10-13T00:31:55-07:00	
Congo violence forces people to use often-risky boats to travel	goma, congo — The overcrowded boat that capsized in eastern Congo last week killed eight members of Serge Nzonga's family along with 70 others. Days later, he was back on the same route that claimed their lives in yet another boat lacking safety measures. Nzonga and hundreds of other passengers, including Associated Press journalists, lined up at the seaport in Goma, eastern Congo's largest city, getting ready to board a locally made boat bound for Bukavu city on the other side of Lake Kivu, a perilous journey they would rather undertake than travel Congo's treacherous roads. On Wednesday, as authorities continued to investigate the accident, families of those killed last week protested at the port of Kituku, accusing officials of negligence in failing to address the insecurity in eastern Congo and of delaying rescue operations. The capsizing of overloaded boats is becoming increasingly frequent in this central African nation as more people are abandoning the few available roads for wooden vessels crumbling under the weight of passengers and their goods. The roads are often caught up in the deadly clashes between Congolese security forces and rebels that sometimes block major access routes. Hundreds have already been killed or declared missing in such accidents so far this year. 'This is the only way we can reach our brothers and sisters in the other province of South Kivu,' said Nzonga as his turn to board a locally made boat drew nearer. 'If we don't take this journey, there is no other route,' he said. 'The road is blocked because of the war and … the roads are not paved in eastern Congo.' In the absence of good roads in this country of more than 100 million, the rivers in Congo have been the only means of transport many here have known — especially in remote areas where passengers usually come from. Among the frequent passengers on the boats and ferries are traders unable to transport their goods along the dangerous roads, some of them spending days or weeks along the rivers. However, several others also board them for various other reasons: It is faster than traveling by road, the roads are in bad shape, and families like Nzonga's can travel at more affordable rates. That leaves boats and ferries frequently overcrowded, and safety measures are hardly implemented, analysts say. The boat that capsized on Congo's Lake Kivu last week was trying to dock just meters away from the port of Kituku when it began to sink, witnesses said. The boat was visibly overcrowded, 'full of passengers (as) it started to lose its balance,' said Francine Munyi, an eyewitness. Authorities often threaten harsh punishments to curb overloading, enforce safety measures and punish corrupt officials, but measures promised to stop the accidents are rarely carried out, analysts say. 'The private sector dominates Lake Kivu … but the boats cannot leave the port without the authorization of the lake commissioner,' said Emile Murhula, an independent analyst, adding that authorities are also supposed to enforce the use of life jackets and remove boats that do not meet the required standards. As the Bukavu-bound boat — named Emmanuel 4 — navigated the waters, the passengers cast worried glances at the lake, many of them without life jackets. Canoes crisscrossed the lake in search of the bodies of victims still missing after the latest accident. At the seaport, dozens of relatives waited patiently for answers. Nzonga, the passenger who lost eight relatives, admits it is dangerous to travel without a life jacket. But even those jackets are not provided by the government. 'We're scared, but it's the only way we have to get to the other province,' he said. 'I still have to travel, even though we're used to it (the accidents).'	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-violence-forces-people-to-use-often-risky-boats-to-travel-/7818547.html	2024-10-13T00:30:06-07:00	
Cambodian fishermen turn to raising eels as Tonle Sap lake runs out of fish	KAMPONG PHLUK, Cambodia — Em Phat, 53, studies his eel tanks with the intensity of a man gambling with his livelihood. For millennia, fishermen like him have relied on the bounty of the Tonle Sap in Cambodia, Southeast Asia's largest lake and the epicenter of the world's most productive inland fishery. But climate change, dams upstream on the Mekong River that sustains the lake, and deforestation in the region have changed everything. There aren't enough fish and living by the lake has become dangerous as storms intensify due to global warming. 'Being a fisherman is hard,' he said. Phat hopes that raising eels — a delicacy in Asian markets like China, Japan and South Korea — will provide a way forward. He raises eels in different tanks: translucent eel eggs bob gently in small glass aquariums. Voracious glassy larvae swim in plastic tanks. Larger tubs have bicycle tires to provide places for juvenile eels to hide. Raising eels can be profitable but it's risky. Eels are notoriously difficult and expensive to raise. They need constant pure, oxygenated water and special food and are susceptible to diseases. Phat lost many eels when a power cut stopped his oxygen pumps, killing the fish. But he's optimistic about the future. Living on land, instead of on the lake, also means that his wife, Luy Nga, 52, can grow vegetables to eat and sell, so they are making enough money to get by. 'The eels have value and can also be exported to China and other countries in the future,' he said. That fishermen like Phat can no longer rely on the Tonle Sap, literally the 'Great Lake,' for their livelihood reflects how much has changed. The lake used to more than quadruple in size to an area larger than the country of Qatar during the rainy season, inundating native forests and creating the perfect breeding ground for diverse fish to thrive. The 'flood pulse,' a natural process of periodic flooding and droughts in the river system helped make the Mekong Basin the world's largest freshwater fishery, with nearly 20% of all freshwater fish worldwide caught there, according to the think tank Stimson Center in Washington. More than 3 million people live and fish by the lake: a third of all 17 million Cambodians rely on the fisheries sector and up to 70% of Cambodia's intake of animal protein is from fish. But dams upstream in China and Laos are cutting the Mekong's flow, weakening that flood pulse. The lakes have been depleted by overfishing and much of the forest surrounding it has been logged or burned for farmland. Cambodian authorities are reluctant to estimate the extent that fish stocks have declined. This year, the flood pulse was delayed by about two months, according to the Mekong Dam Monitor, a research project. In this shattered ecosystem, raising eels or other fish can provide fishermen like Phat with a 'buffer,' said Zeb Hogan, a fish biologist at the University of Nevada who has worked in the region for decades. 'Aquaculture, such as eel farming, is a way for people to take more control over their income source and livelihood,' he said, adding that it also allows them to raise fish that they know will fetch higher prices. Phat is one of more than thousands helped by a program run by the Britain-based nonprofit VSO to boost incomes of people living by Tonle Sap. VSO provides his baby eels and has taught him how to raise them. Eels are in high demand in Cambodia and elsewhere, said Sum Vy, 38, a coordinator at VSO, so they're profitable. When fishermen know how to farm eels and hatch the babies, others can follow. 'Not only can he or she earn the money to support their family, they can share this knowledge and skill with other people,' he said. Expanding aquaculture is helping increase Cambodian exports. Its fish production increased 24-fold in the two decades leading up to 2021 and, unlike its neighbors, most of its fish catch is inland, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization or FAO. Much of it is consumed domestically and exports have grown sluggishly. Earlier this year, the government launched a scheme to improve fish processing technologies and address food safety concerns, hoping to begin exporting more fish to Europe next year. Cambodia has signed trade agreements with China and began shipping frozen eels to Shanghai last year. 'This export will contribute to economic growth, creating jobs for our farmers and fishermen,' Heng Mengty, the export manager of the Cambodian fish exporter told China's official Xinhua news agency. The promised growth can't come soon enough for Cambodians living in fishing communities around the lake. Some families live in homes that float year round, others on homes built on stilts up to 8 meters high, to keep them above floodwaters during the rainy season. Fishing is the only form of subsistence for many, but signs of decay are evident. Fishing nets catch only very small fish, or worse, nothing at all. Families speak of giant fish that are now rarely seen. The catch is a fraction of what it used to be. Even 10 years ago, Som Lay, a 29-year-old fisherman said, the lake was teeming with fish. But illegal fishing has increased and some families have already given up fishing and are trying to find land where they can grow rice. 'The entire village — my family and others — is facing these difficulties,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodian-fishermen-turn-to-raising-eels-as-tonle-sap-lake-runs-out-of-fish/7817185.html	2024-10-13T00:29:30-07:00	
Hot days and methamphetamine are now a deadlier mix in US	PHOENIX — On just one sweltering day during the hottest June on record in Phoenix, a 38-year-old man collapsed under a freeway bridge and a 41-year-old woman was found slumped outside a business. Both had used methamphetamine before dying from an increasingly dangerous mix of soaring temperatures and stimulants. Meth is showing up more often as a factor in the deaths of people who died from heat-related causes in the U.S., according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Death certificates show about one in five heat-related deaths in recent years involved methamphetamine. In Arizona, Texas, Nevada and California, officials found the drug in nearly a third of heat deaths in 2023. Meth is more common in heat-related deaths than the deadly opioid fentanyl. As a stimulant, it increases body temperature, impairs the brain's ability to regulate body heat and makes it harder for the heart to compensate for extreme heat. If hot weather has already raised someone's body temperature, consuming alcohol or opioids can exacerbate the physical effects, 'but meth would be the one that you would be most concerned about,' said Bob Anderson, chief of statistical analysis at the National Center for Health Statistics. The trend has emerged as a synthetic drug manufactured south of the border by Mexican drug cartels has largely replaced the domestic version of meth fictionalized in the TV series Breaking Bad. Typically smoked in a glass pipe, a single dose can cost as little as a few dollars. At the same time, human-caused climate change has made it much easier to die from heat-related causes in places like Phoenix, Las Vegas and California's southeastern desert. This has been Earth's hottest summer on record. Phoenix baked in temperatures topping 37.7 Celsius for 113 straight days and hit 47.2 Celsius in late September — uncharacteristic even for a city synonymous with heat. The searing temperatures have carried into October. 'Putting on a jacket can increase body temperature in a cold room. If it's hot outside, we can take off the jacket,' explained Rae Matsumoto, dean of the Daniel K. Inouye College of Pharmacy at the University of Hawaii in Hilo. But people using the stimulant in the outdoor heat 'can't take off the meth jacket.' These fatalities are particularly prevalent in the Southwest, where meth overdoses overall have risen since the mid-2000s. In Maricopa County, America's hottest major metropolitan area, substances including street drugs, alcohol and certain prescription medicines for psychiatric conditions and blood pressure control were involved in about two-thirds, or 419 of the 645 heat-related deaths documented last year. Meth was detected in about three-quarters of these drug cases and was often the primary cause of death, public health data show. Fentanyl was found in just under half of them. In Pima County, home to Tucson, Arizona's second most populous city, methamphetamine was a factor in one-quarter of the 84 heat-related deaths reported so far this year, the medical examiner's office said. In metro Las Vegas, heat was a factor in 294 deaths investigated last year by the Clark County coroner's office, and 39% involved illicit and prescription drugs and alcohol. Of those, meth was detected in three-fourths. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration notes in its 2024 National Drug Threat Assessment that 31% of all drug-related deaths in the U.S. are now caused by stimulants that speed up the nervous system, primarily meth. More than 17,000 people in the U.S. died from fatal overdoses and poisonings related to stimulants in the first half of 2023, according to preliminary CDC data. Although overdoses have been more associated with opiates like fentanyl, medical professionals say overdosing on meth is possible if a large amount is ingested. Higher blood pressure and a quickened heart rate can then provoke a heart attack or stroke. 'All of your normal physiological ways of coping with heat are compromised with the use of methamphetamines,' said Dr. Aneesh Narang, an emergency medicine physician at Banner University Medical Center in downtown Phoenix. Narang, who sits on a board that reviews overdose fatalities, said the 'vast majority' of the heat stroke patients seen in his hospital's emergency department this summer had used street drugs, most commonly methamphetamine. Because of its proximity to the U.S.-Mexico border, Phoenix is considered a 'source city' where large amounts of newly smuggled meth are stored and packaged into relatively tiny doses for distribution, said Det. Matt Shay, a narcotics investigator with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. 'It's an amazing amount that comes in constantly every day,' Shay said. 'It's also very cheap.' U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized about 74,000 kilograms of meth at the U.S.-Mexico border this last fiscal year ending September 30, up from the 63,500 kilograms captured in the previous 12 months. And sellers often target homeless people, Shay said. 'It's a customer base that is easy to find and exploit,' Shay said. 'If you're an enterprising young drug dealer, all you need is some type of transportation and you just cruise around and they swarm your car.' Jason Elliott, a 51-year-old unemployed machinist, said he's heard of several heat-related deaths involving meth during his three years on the streets in Phoenix. 'It's pretty typical,' said Elliot, noting that stimulants enable people to stay awake and alert to prevent being robbed in shelters or outdoors. 'What else can you do? You have stuff; you go to sleep, you wake up and your stuff is gone.' Dr. Nick Staab, assistant medical director of the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, said brochures were printed this summer and distributed in cooling centers to spread the word about the risk of using stimulants and certain prescription medicines in extreme heat. But it's unclear how many are being reached. People who use drugs may not be welcomed at some cooling centers. A better solution, according to Stacey Cope, capacity building and education director for the harm reduction nonprofit Sonoran Prevention Works, is to lower barriers to entry so that people most at risk 'are not expected to be absent from drugs, or they're not expected to leave during the hottest part of the day.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hot-days-and-methamphetamine-are-now-a-deadlier-mix-in-us/7817104.html	2024-10-13T00:27:48-07:00	
Online hate against South Asian Americans rises steadily, report says	WASHINGTON — Online hate against Americans of South Asian ancestry has risen steadily in 2023 and 2024 with the rise of politicians from that community to prominence, according to a report released Wednesday by nonprofit group Stop AAPI Hate. Why it's important Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris is of Indian descent, as are former Republican presidential candidates Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance's wife, Usha Vance, is also Indian American. Harris faces Republican former President Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. elections. There has been a steady rise in anti-Asian hate in extremist online spaces from January 2023 to August 2024, the report said. The nonprofit group blamed the rise on a 'toxic political climate in which a growing number of leaders and far-right extremist voices continue to spew bigoted political rhetoric and disinformation.' Key quotes 'Online threats of violence towards Asian communities reached their highest levels in August 2024, after Usha Vance appeared at the Republican National Convention and Kamala Harris was declared a presidential nominee at the Democratic National Convention,' Stop AAPI Hate said. 'The growing prevalence of anti-South Asian online hate ... in 2023 and 2024 tracks with the rise in South Asian political representation this election cycle,' it added. By the numbers Among Asian American subgroups, South Asian communities were targeted with the highest volume of anti-Asian online hostility, with 60% of slurs directed at them in that period, according to the report. Anti-South Asian slurs in extremist online spaces doubled last year, from about 23,000 to more than 46,000, and peaked in August 2024. There are nearly 5.4 million people of South Asian descent living in the United States, comprising of individuals with ancestry from nations including India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.	https://www.voanews.com/a/online-hate-against-south-asian-americans-rises-steadily-report-says/7817086.html	2024-10-13T00:27:16-07:00	
Cubans searching for a better future leave pets behind	HAVANA — Balto, Pepa and Mami were among the lucky ones. After being abandoned by their owners who left Cuba — or simply couldn't care for them anymore — the dogs were rescued by animal rights activists on the island, who fed them, sterilized them and found them a new home. Many others didn't have such luck and were left wandering the streets. While there are no official figures or estimates of how many pets have been left behind by their owners who leave the island, the number of abandoned cats and dogs has spiked in the last two years as Cubans migrate in record numbers, animal activists say. 'We'd receive a phone call from someone asking us to care for their pets, because they're suddenly migrating and don't know what to do with them,' said Elizabeth Meade, founder of Adoptions for Love, an animal shelter in Havana. Although the shelter found a home for some 300 rescued pets in the past year, many of those were returned — or simply went missing — after their new owners also decided to migrate. For these animals, said Meade, 'it's not always a happy ending.' Between October 2021 and September 2024, U.S. authorities reported more than 600,000 encounters with Cubans — a significant number for an island of roughly 10 million people. That is in addition to the thousands who choose to migrate to Spain or other Latin American countries. For many Cubans, taking their pets with them is not an option. Transporting an animal from Havana to Miami through a specialized agency can cost up to $1,200 — including medical examinations and the flight — and, since September, pet owners have to pay an additional $1,300 to comply with a legal obligation of a quarantine. For those who remain in Cuba, daily life is not easy: the country's gross domestic product fell by 2% in 2023, resulting in rampant inflation and food and fuel shortages. Caring for a pet on the island can be prohibitive for most Cubans. While the average monthly salary in the state sector — the largest employer — is about $21, a 20-kilo bag of imported dog food can cost up to $70 and a visit to the vet costs the equivalent of $10. The increase in the number of abandoned pets in Cuba has been largely countered by animal activism, a phenomenon that began to take shape in 2018 after the Internet was massively adopted and social media helped coordinate actions. In 2021, animal rights activists scored a win when the government passed a long-awaited animal welfare law, which seeks to prevent cruelty and raise awareness about the need to protect animals. The law also penalizes animal cruelty, including dogfights, and the sacrifice of animals for religious purposes but activists say it is not enough. 'Abandonment is the worst form of animal abuse,' said Leandro Valdés, a dog trainer and proud owner of Koffee, a rescued dog that has gone viral as he rides around Havana in the back of Valdés' motorcycle, wearing goggles and a seatbelt. 'The increase in migration has resulted in more pets being abandoned,' says Valdés, noting the 'loss of values' that resulted from Cuba's deepening economic crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cubans-searching-for-a-better-future-leave-pets-behind/7820566.html	2024-10-12T21:59:51-07:00	
Volunteers bring solar power to Hurricane Helene's disaster zone	BAKERSVILLE, North Carolina — Nearly two weeks after Hurricane Helene downed power lines and washed out roads all over North Carolina's mountains, the constant din of a gas-powered generator is getting to be too much for Bobby Renfro. It's difficult to hear the nurses, neighbors and volunteers flowing through the community resource hub he has set up in a former church for his neighbors in Tipton Hill, a crossroads in the Pisgah National Forest north of Asheville. Much worse is the cost: he spent $1,200 to buy it and thousands more on fuel that volunteers drive in from Tennessee. Turning off their only power source isn't an option. This generator runs a refrigerator holding insulin for neighbors with diabetes and powers the oxygen machines and nebulizers some of them need to breathe. The retired railroad worker worries that outsiders don't understand how desperate they are, marooned without power on hilltops and down in 'hollers.' 'We have no resources for nothing,' Renfro said. 'It's going to be a long ordeal.' More than 43,000 of the 1.5 million customers who lost power in western North Carolina still lacked electricity on Friday, according to Poweroutage.us. Without it, they can't keep medicines cold or power medical equipment or pump well water. They can't recharge their phones or apply for federal disaster aid. Crews from all over the country and even Canada are helping Duke Energy and local electric cooperatives with repairs, but it's slow going in the dense mountain forests, where some roads and bridges are completely washed away. 'The crews aren't doing what they typically do, which is a repair effort. They're rebuilding from the ground up,' said Kristie Aldridge, vice president of communications at North Carolina Electric Cooperatives. Residents who can get their hands on gas and diesel-powered generators are depending on them, but that is not easy. Fuel is expensive and can be a long drive away. Generator fumes pollute and can be deadly. Small home generators are designed to run for hours or days, not weeks and months. Now, more help is arriving. Renfro received a new power source this week, one that will be cleaner, quieter and free to operate. Volunteers with the nonprofit Footprint Project and a local solar installation company delivered a solar generator with six 245-watt solar panels, a 24-volt battery and an AC power inverter. The panels now rest on a grassy hill outside the community building. Renfro hopes his community can draw some comfort and security, 'seeing and knowing that they have a little electricity.' The Footprint Project is scaling up its response to this disaster with sustainable mobile infrastructure. It has deployed dozens of larger solar microgrids, solar generators and machines that can pull water from the air to 33 sites so far, along with dozens of smaller portable batteries. With donations from solar equipment and installation companies as well as equipment purchased through donated funds, the nonprofit is sourcing hundreds more small batteries and dozens of other larger systems and even industrial-scale solar generators known as 'Dragon Wings.' Will Heegaard and Jamie Swezey are the husband-and-wife team behind Project Footprint. Heegaard founded it in 2018 in New Orleans with a mission of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of emergency responses. Helene's destruction is so catastrophic, however, that Swezey said this work is more about supplementing generators than replacing them. 'I've never seen anything like this,' Swezey said as she stared at a whiteboard with scribbled lists of requests, volunteers and equipment. 'It's all hands on deck with whatever you can use to power whatever you need to power.' Down near the interstate in Mars Hill, a warehouse owner let Swezey and Heegaard set up operations and sleep inside. They rise each morning triaging emails and texts from all over the region. Requests for equipment range from individuals needing to power a home oxygen machine to makeshift clinics and community hubs distributing supplies. Local volunteers help. Hayden Wilson and Henry Kovacs, glassblowers from Asheville, arrived in a pickup truck and trailer to make deliveries this week. Two installers from the Asheville-based solar company Sundance Power Systems followed in a van. It took them more than an hour on winding roads to reach Bakersville, where the community hub Julie Wiggins runs in her driveway supports about 30 nearby families. It took many of her neighbors days to reach her, cutting their way out through fallen trees. Some were so desperate they stuck their insulin in the creek to keep it cold. Panels and a battery from Footprint Project now power her small fridge, a water pump and a Starlink communications system she set up. 'This is a game changer,' Wiggins said. The volunteers then drove to Renfro's hub in Tipton Hill before their last stop at a Bakersville church that has been running two generators. Other places are much harder to reach. Heegaard and Swezey even tried to figure out how many portable batteries a mule could carry up a mountain and have arranged for some to be lowered by helicopters. They know the stakes are high after Heegaard volunteered in Puerto Rico, where Hurricane Maria's death toll rose to 3,000 as some mountain communities went without power for 11 months. Duke Energy crews also restored infrastructure in Puerto Rico and are using tactics learned there, like using helicopters to drop in new electric poles, utility spokesman Bill Norton said. The hardest customers to help could be people whose homes and businesses are too damaged to connect, and they are why the Footprint Project will stay in the area for as long as they are needed, Swezey said. 'We know there are people who will need help long after the power comes back,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/volunteers-bring-solar-power-to-hurricane-helene-s-disaster-zone/7820560.html	2024-10-12T21:28:45-07:00	
Widespread fuel shortage hampers Florida’s Hurricane Milton cleanup	CORTEZ, Florida — Floridians recovering from Hurricane Milton, many of whom were journeying home after fleeing hundreds of miles to escape the storm, spent much of Saturday searching for gas as a fuel shortage gripped the state. In St. Petersburg, scores of people lined up at a station that had no gas, hoping it would arrive soon. Among them was Daniel Thornton and his 9-year-old daughter Magnolia, who arrived at the station at 7 a.m. and were still waiting four hours later. 'They told me they have gas coming but they don't know when it's going to be here,' he said. 'I have no choice. I have to sit here all day with her until I get gas.' Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters Saturday morning that the state opened three fuel distribution sites and planned to open several more. Residents can get 37.85 liters each, free of charge, he said. 'Obviously as power gets restored ... and the Port of Tampa is open, you're going to see the fuel flowing. But in the meantime, we want to give people another option,' DeSantis said. Officials were replenishing area gas stations with the state's fuel stockpiles and provided generators to stations that remained without power. Disaster hits twice Those who reached home were assessing the damage and beginning the arduous cleaning process. Some, like Bill O'Connell, a board member at Bahia Vista Gulf in Venice, had thought they were done after the condo association hired companies to gut, treat and dry the units following Hurricane Helene. Milton undid that work and caused additional damage, O'Connell said. 'It reflooded everything that was already flooded, brought all the sand back on our property that we removed,' O'Connell said. 'And also did some catastrophic wind damage, ripped off many roofs and blew out a lot of windows that caused more damage inside the units.' The two hurricanes left a ruinous mess in the fishing village of Cortez, a community of 4,100 along the northern edge of Sarasota Bay. Residents of its modest, single-story wood and stucco-fronted cottages were working to remove broken furniture and tree limbs, stacking the debris in the street much like they did after Hurricane Helene. 'Everything is shot,' said Mark Praught, a retired street sweeper for Manatee County, who saw 1.2-meter storm surges during Helene. 'We'll replace the electrical and the plumbing and go from there.' Praught and his wife, Catherine, have lived for 36 years in a low-lying home that now looks like an empty shell. All the furniture had to be discarded, the walls and the brick and tile floors had to be scrubbed clean of muck, and drywall had to be ripped out. Catherine Praught said they felt 'pure panic' when Hurricane Milton menaced Cortez so soon after Helene, forcing them to pause their cleanup and evacuate. Fortunately, their home wasn't damaged by the second storm. 'This is where we live,' Catherine Praught said. 'We're just hopeful we get the insurance company to help us.' In Bradenton Beach, Jen Hilliard scooped up wet sand mixed with rocks and tree roots and dumped the mixture into a wheelbarrow. 'This was all grass,' Hilliard said of the sandy mess beneath her feet. 'They're going to have to make 500 trips of this.' Hilliard, who moved to Florida six months ago and lives further inland, said she was happy to pitch in and help clean up her friend's home a block from the shore in Bradenton Beach. Furniture and household appliances sat outside alongside debris from interior drywall that was removed after Helene sent several feet of storm surge into the house. Inside, walls were gutted up to 1.2 meters, exposing the beams underneath. 'You roll with the punches,' she said. 'Community is the best part, though. Everybody helping each other.' Milton killed at least 10 people after it made landfall as a Category 3 storm, tearing across central Florida, flooding barrier islands and spawning deadly tornadoes. Officials say the toll could have been worse if not for the widespread evacuations. Overall, more than a thousand people had been rescued in the wake of the storm as of Saturday, DeSantis said. Property damage and economic costs in the billions On Sunday, President Joe Biden will survey the devastation inflicted on Florida's Gulf Coast by the hurricane. He said he hopes to connect with DeSantis during the visit. The trip offers Biden another opportunity to press Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to call lawmakers back to Washington to approve more funding during their preelection recess. It's something Johnson says he won't do. Biden is making the case that Congress needs to act now to ensure the Small Business Administration and FEMA have the money they need to get through hurricane season, which stretches through November in the Atlantic. DeSantis welcomed the federal government's approval of a disaster declaration announced Saturday and said he had gotten strong support from Biden. 'He basically said, you know, you guys are doing a great job. We're here for you,' he said when asked about his conversations with Biden. 'We sent a big request and we got approved for what we wanted.' Moody's Analytics on Saturday estimated economic costs from the storm will range from $50 billion to $85 billion, including upwards of $70 billion in property damage and an economic output loss of up to $15 billion. Safety threats remain, including rising rivers As the recovery continues, DeSantis has warned people to be cautious, citing ongoing safety threats including downed power lines and standing water. Some 1.3 million Floridians were still without power by Saturday afternoon, according to poweroutage.us. National Weather Service Meteorologist Paul Close said rivers will 'keep rising' for the next four or five days resulting in river flooding, mostly around Tampa Bay and northward. Those areas were hit by the most rain, which comes on top of a wet summer that included several earlier hurricanes. 'You can't do much but wait,' Close said of the rivers cresting. 'At least there is no rain in the forecast, no substantial rain. So we have a break here from all our wet weather.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/widespread-fuel-shortage-hampers-florida-s-hurricane-milton-cleanup/7820558.html	2024-10-12T21:02:20-07:00	
In Hiroshima, Nobel Prize brings survivors hope, sense of duty	HIROSHIMA, Japan — Almost eight decades after an atomic bomb devastated her hometown of Hiroshima, Teruko Yahata carries the scar on her forehead from when she was knocked over by the force of the blast. The U.S. bombs that laid waste to Hiroshima on the morning of August 6, 1945, and to Nagasaki three days later, changed the course of history and left Yahata and other survivors with deep scars and a sense of responsibility toward disarmament. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday to the Nihon Hidankyo group of atomic bomb survivors, for its work warning of the dangers of nuclear arms, has given survivors hope and highlighted their work still ahead, Yahata and others said. 'It felt as if a light suddenly shone through. I felt like I could see the light,' the 87-year-old said on Saturday, describing her reaction to hearing about the award. 'This feels like the first step, the beginning of a movement toward nuclear abolition,' she told Reuters at the site of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. She was just 8 years old and in the back garden of her home when the bomb hit. Although her house was 2.5 kilometers from the hypocenter, the blast was strong enough to throw her several meters back into her house, she said. Seventy-nine years later, and a day after the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the survivors the prize, a long line formed outside the museum, with dozens of foreign and Japanese visitors queuing up to get in. A bridge leading into the memorial park was decorated with a yellow sheet and other handmade signs against nuclear weapons. Campaigners gathered signatures for nuclear abolition from those passing by. Nihon Hidankyo, formed in 1956, has provided thousands of witness accounts, issued resolutions and public appeals, sent delegations to the U.N. and peace conferences, and collected signatures advocating nuclear disarmament. Yahata, who is not a Nihon Hidankyo member, said it was that drive to gather signatures that finally paid off after bearing little fruit for most of a century. 'It's this amount of sadness and joy that led them to this peace prize. I think it's something very meaningful,' she said. Nihon Hidankyo's co-chair, Toshiyuki Mimaki, said he felt the award meant more responsibility, adding that most atomic bomb survivors were more than 85 years old. 'Rather than feeling purely happy, I feel like I have more responsibility now,' he told Reuters, sitting in a Hidankyo office in Hiroshima in front of a map showing the impact of the bomb on the city. In rural areas the group is on the verge of falling apart, the 82-year-old said. 'The big challenge now is what to do going forward.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-hiroshima-nobel-prize-brings-survivors-hope-sense-of-duty/7820557.html	2024-10-12T20:37:15-07:00	
Beijing loyalists will vote to endorse former top judge as Macao's next leader	MACAO — About 400 Beijing loyalists were set to vote Sunday to endorse the sole candidate for the top job in the Chinese city of Macao in a largely ceremonial election that would make him the first leader of the casino hub to be born in mainland China. Former top judge Sam Hou Fai ’s expected victory within hours would be a departure from the long-standing custom of having chief executives who were born in the former Portuguese colony, typically from influential business families. The shift in the city’s leadership to someone from the legal profession will create expectations of a declining influence from business circles, which critics have often accused of colluding with officials, analysts say. They anticipate Beijing’s policy agenda for the city will take priority. Sam, 62, is widely seen to have Beijing’s blessings. He has already secured endorsements from 386 of the 400 election committee members who are to vote on Sunday. Most of the territory’s 687,000 residents lack voting rights, leading to mixed sentiments about the election. Some hope Sam will heed public opinion and avoid prioritizing business interests, while others feel disconnected from an election process they can’t participate in. Still, political observers said many residents are comfortable with Sam’s non-local origin in a city that has been home to migrants for decades. With Sam’s victory guaranteed, the real challenges await in the governance hurdles that lie ahead. Macao is the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Beijing has called for the city to diversify its gambling-reliant economy. Sam has promised to accelerate the current government’s plan to boost tourism and other sectors such as traditional Chinese medicine, finance, exhibitions and commerce. However, the city will still need to rely on the gambling industry for government revenues to support the city's welfare and accomplish other goals laid out by Beijing, analysts say. China wants Macao to develop into a world-class tourism and leisure center and play a bigger role as a bridge for trade between China and Portuguese-speaking countries. Small local businesses have been hurt by residents who spend money in the neighboring mainland city of Zhuhai, which offers a wider selection of items with good value for money. Chinese tourists are also now spending less than before. It remains to be seen whether Sam, with a lack of government leadership experience, can form a capable cabinet to tackle these pressing issues. Sam was born in neighboring Guangdong province in 1962. He graduated from the prestigious law school of Peking University in Beijing. He also studied the Portuguese language, culture and law at the University of Coimbra in Portugal, and once practiced law in mainland China. When Macao returned to Chinese rule in 1999, Sam was appointed the city’s top judge, a role in which he served for nearly 25 years before resigning in August to participate in the election. He handled some politically sensitive cases, including rejecting an appeal of a police ban on a vigil commemorating China’s bloody 1989 military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. His court also upheld a decision to bar pro-democracy figures from running in the 2021 legislative elections.	https://www.voanews.com/a/beijing-loyalists-will-vote-to-endorse-former-top-judge-as-macao-s-next-leader/7820551.html	2024-10-12T19:28:41-07:00	
US official accuses Russia, China of blocking Asia leaders' statement	washington — Russia and China blocked a proposed consensus statement for the East Asia Summit drafted by Southeast Asian countries, mainly over objections to language on the contested South China Sea, a U.S. official told Reuters on Saturday. A draft statement arrived at by consensus by the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations was put to the 18-nation East Asia Summit meeting in Laos on Thursday evening, the official said. 'ASEAN presented this final draft and said that, essentially, this was a take-it-or-leave-it draft,' the official said on condition of anonymity. The United States, Japan, Australia, South Korea and India all said they could support it, the official said, adding: 'The Russians and the Chinese said that they could not and would not proceed with a statement.' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news conference in Vientiane on Friday the final declaration had not been adopted because of 'persistent attempts by the United States, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand to turn it into a purely political statement.' China's Washington embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The U.S. official said there were a couple of issues of contention, but the key one was how it referred to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), going further than in the previous 2023 EAS statement. However, the official said, 'there was certainly no language that was getting into the nitty gritty of any particular standoff, no language that was favoring any claimant over any other.' China claims nearly all of the South China Sea and has stepped up pressure on rival claimants, including several ASEAN countries, notably the Philippines. ASEAN has spent years negotiating a Code of Conduct with Beijing for the strategic waterway, with some ASEAN states insisting it be based on UNCLOS. China says it backs a code but does not recognize a 2016 arbitral ruling that said its claim to most of the South China Sea had no basis under UNCLOS, to which Beijing is a signatory. According to a draft seen by Reuters, the proposed EAS statement contained an extra sub-clause over the 2023 approved statement, and this was not agreed to. It noted a 2023 U.N. resolution saying that UNCLOS 'sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out.' Another sub-clause not agreed said the international environment, including 'in the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, Myanmar, Ukraine and the Middle East ... present challenges for the region.' Chinese Premier Li Qiang told the summit Beijing was committed to UNCLOS and striving for an early conclusion of a Code of Conduct, while stressing its claims have solid historical and legal grounds. 'Relevant countries outside the region should respect and support the joint efforts of China and regional countries to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea, and truly play a constructive role for peace and stability in the region,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-official-accuses-russia-china-of-blocking-asia-leaders-statement/7820549.html	2024-10-12T18:14:48-07:00

Afghan man imprisoned in France, accused of planning 'violent action'	paris — A 22-year-old Afghan was indicted and imprisoned in France on Saturday, accused of supporting the ideology of the Islamic State (IS) and of having 'fomented' a 'plan for violent action' in a football stadium or a shopping center. His arrest, which took place Tuesday in Haute-Garonne, has 'links' with the arrest of an Afghan living in the United States and charged Wednesday with planning an attack on the day of the U.S. elections, the national anti-terrorist prosecutor's office (PNAT) said, confirming a source close to the case questioned by AFP. This 27-year-old Afghan, living in the southern U.S. state of Oklahoma, was in contact on the Telegram messaging service with a person identified by the FBI as an IS recruiter, according to American judicial authorities. According to the source close to the case, during their investigations, the American authorities transmitted information to the French authorities, triggering the opening of an investigation in Paris and leading to three arrests. On Tuesday morning in the southwest of France, three men, aged 20 to 31, two of whom are brothers, were arrested in Toulouse and Fronton by investigators from the General Directorate of Internal Security (DGSI), supported by the RAID, the police intervention unit, as part of a preliminary investigation opened on September 27 for 'terrorist criminal association with a view to preparing one or more crimes against persons.' 'The investigations carried out have highlighted the existence of a plan for violent action targeting people in a football stadium or a shopping center fomented by one of them, aged 22, of Afghan nationality and holder of a resident card, several elements of which also establish radicalization and adherence to the ideology of the Islamic State,' the PNAT told AFP on Saturday. His lawyer, Emanuel de Dinechin, did not wish to comment at this stage. In accordance with the PNAT requisitions, he was charged with terrorist criminal association by an investigating judge, then placed in provisional detention. According to a source close to the case, this young man comes from the Tajik community in Afghanistan and his project, which he reportedly spoke about on Telegram, remained rather vague and unfinished. According to another source close to the investigation, he has been living in France for around three years. The other two men were released after their police custody. Reconfiguration The last arrests for a plan for violent action in France date back to the end of July. Two young men, aged 18 and originally from Gironde in the southwest, were indicted on July 27, suspected of having created a group on social networks 'intended to recruit' people 'motivated (to) perpetrate a violent action' during the Paris Olympic Games. Three attacks were foiled during the Olympic period, according to the authorities. In addition to the two young people from Gironde, one of the plans targeted establishments, including bars, around the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium in Saint-Etienne (southeast), and the other came from a group that had planned attacks against institutions and representatives of Israel in Paris. Five people have been charged, including a minor teenager, in these cases. The 'jihadist threat represents 80% of the procedures' initiated by the PNAT, anti-terrorism prosecutor Olivier Christen recalled in mid-September. 'In the first half of 2024, there were approximately three times more procedures' of this type than in the same period in 2023, he added. According to him, this increase is explained by the 'geopolitical context,' but also by 'the reconfiguration, particularly in Afghanistan' of the Islamic State group. In September, two attacks by the Islamic State in Khorasan (IS-K) group, the regional branch of IS in Afghanistan, killed around 20 people in that country. The deadliest attack by ISIS left 145 dead in March at a concert hall in Moscow.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-man-indicted-imprisoned-in-france-for-planning-violent-action-/7820335.html	2024-10-12T17:25:01-07:00

Lithuanians elect new parliament amid cost of living, security worries	VILNIUS, Lithuania — Lithuanians elect a new parliament Sunday in a vote dominated by concerns over the cost of living and potential threats from neighboring Russia, with the opposition Social Democrats tipped to emerge as the largest party but well short of a majority. The outgoing center-right coalition of Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte has seen its popularity eroded by high inflation that topped 20% two years ago, by deteriorating public services and a widening gap between rich and poor. Polling stations open at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and close at 8 p.m. (1700 GMT). Results are expected after midnight local time. Opinion polls suggest Simonyte's Homeland Union will win just 9%, behind the Social Democrats at 18% and the anti-establishment Nemunas Dawn at 12%, though the eventual shape of a future coalition will depend on how smaller parties perform. The Baltic state of 2.9 million people has a hybrid voting system in which half of the parliament is elected by popular vote, with a 5% threshold needed to win seats. The other half is chosen on a district basis, a process which favors the larger parties. If no candidate gets over 50% of the vote in a district, its top two candidates face each other in a run-off on October 27. Domestic issues have loomed large in the election campaign, with the Social Democrats vowing to tackle increased inequality by raising taxes on wealthier Lithuanians to help fund more spending on healthcare and social spending. But national security is also a major concern in Lithuania, which is part of the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union and shares a border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad as well as with Belarus, a close Moscow ally.

Protesters rally against proposed nuclear plant near forest reserve, tourist hub in Kenya	KILIFI, Kenya — Dozens rallied against a proposal to build Kenya's first nuclear power plant in one of the country's top coastal tourist hubs which also houses a forest on the tentative list of the UNESCO World Heritage site. Kilifi County is renowned for its pristine sandy beaches where hotels and beach bars line the 165-mile-long coast and visitors boat and snorkel around coral reefs or bird watch in Arabuko Sokoke Forest Reserve, a significant natural habitat for the conservation of rare and endangered species, according to the United Nations organization. The project, proposed last year, is set to be built in the town of Kilifi — about 522 kilometers (324 miles) southeast of the capital, Nairobi. Many residents have openly opposed the proposal, worried about what they say are the negative effects of the project on people and the environment, leading to a string of protesters which at times turned violent. Muslim for Human Rights (MUHURI) led the march Friday in Kilifi to the county governor's office where they handed him a petition opposing the construction of the plant. Some chanted anti-nuclear slogans while others carried placards with 'Sitaki nuclear,' Swahili for 'I don't want nuclear.' The construction of the 1,000MW nuclear plant is set to begin in 2027 and be operational by 2034, with a cost of 500 billion Kenyan shillings ($3.8 billion). Francis Auma, a MUHURI activist, told the Associated Press that the negative effects of the nuclear plant outweigh its benefits. 'We say that this project has a lot of negative effects; there will be malformed children born out of this place, fish will die, and our forest Arabuko Sokoke, known to harbor the birds from abroad, will be lost,' Auma said during Friday's protests. Juma Sulubu, a resident who was beaten by the police during a previous demonstration, attended Friday's march and said: 'Even if you kill us, just kill us, but we do not want a nuclear power plant in our Uyombo community.' Timothy Nyawa, a fisherman, participated in the rally out of fear that a nuclear power plant would kill fish and, in turn, his source of income. 'If they set up a nuclear plant here, the fish breeding sites will all be destroyed.' Phyllis Omido, the executive director at the Center for Justice Governance and Environmental Action, who also attended the march, said Kenya's eastern coastal towns depended on eco-tourism as the main source of income and a nuclear plant would threaten their livelihoods. 'We host the only East African coastal forest, we host the Watamu marine park, we host the largest mangrove plantation in Kenya. We do not want nuclear (energy) to mess up our ecosystem,' she said. Her center filed a petition in Nov. 2023 in parliament calling for an inquiry and claiming that locals had limited information on the proposed plant and the criteria for selecting preferred sites. It also raised concerns over the risks to health, the environment and tourism in the event of a nuclear spill, saying the country was undertaking a 'high-risk venture' without proper legal and disaster response measures in place. The petition also expressed unease over security and the handling of radioactive waste in a country prone to floods and drought. The Senate suspended the inquiry until a lawsuit two lawyers filed in July seeking to stop the plant's construction, claiming public participation meetings were rushed and urging the Nuclear Power and Energy Agency (Nupea) not to start the project, was heard. Nupea said construction would not begin for years and environmental laws were under consideration, adding that adequate public participation was carried out. The nuclear agency also published an impact assessment report last year that recommended policies be put in place to ensure environmental protections, including detailed plans for the handling of radioactive waste, measures to mitigate environmental harm, such as setting up a nuclear unit in the national environment management authority, and emergency response teams.	https://www.voanews.com/a/planned-nuclear-plant-in-kenyan-tourist-hub-endangered-species-home-sparks-protest-/7820332.html	2024-10-12T16:19:45-07:00	
Chinese premier visits Vietnam, agrees to boost economic ties	hanoi, vietnam — Vietnam and China agreed on Saturday to boost defense and security cooperation despite their years-long maritime dispute in the South China Sea, said the Vietnamese government. China is Vietnam's largest trading partner and a vital source of imports for its manufacturing sector. The two countries on Saturday also agreed to boost economic ties, with China pledging to further open its market for Vietnamese farm produce while Vietnam would facilitate Chinese investment, the government added in a statement. It said the two countries will prioritize cooperation in developing railway links. The statement came after Chinese premier Li Qiang met Vietnamese President To Lam in Hanoi late on Saturday, as Li began his three-day state visit to Vietnam. Sources told Reuters on Friday that China and Vietnam are expected to sign new agreements — including pacts to boost railway links and agricultural trade — during the visit. Li is expected to meet Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and attend a business forum in Hanoi on Sunday. Early this month, Vietnam protested to China over what it said was an attack on a Vietnamese fishing boat in contested South China Sea waters that injured several fishermen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-premier-visits-vietnam-agrees-to-boost-economic-ties-/7820330.html	2024-10-12T15:57:33-07:00	
Pregnant Philippine women arrested in Cambodia for surrogacy could be prosecuted	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Thirteen pregnant Philippine women accused of illegally acting as surrogate mothers in Cambodia after being recruited online could face prison terms after giving birth, a senior Interior Ministry official said Saturday. Interior Ministry Secretary of State Chou Bun Eng, who leads the country's fight against human trafficking and sexual exploitation, said police found 24 foreign women, 20 Philippine and four Vietnamese, when they raided a villa in Kandal province, near the capital of Phnom Penh, on September 23. Thirteen of the Philippine women were found to be pregnant and were charged in court on October 1 under a provision in the law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation, she said. The law was updated in 2016 to ban commercial surrogacy after Cambodia became a popular destination for foreigners seeking women to give birth to their children. Developing countries have been popular for surrogacy because costs are much lower than in countries such as the United States and Australia, where surrogate services could cost around $150,000. The surrogacy business boomed in Cambodia after it was put under tight restrictions in neighboring Thailand, as well as in India and Nepal. In July 2017, a Cambodian court sentenced an Australian woman and two Cambodian associates to 1 1/2 years in prison for providing commercial surrogacy services. The new case is unusual because surrogates normally are employed in their own countries, not transported elsewhere. Cambodia already has a bad reputation for human trafficking, especially in connection with online scams in which foreigners recruited for work under false pretenses are kept in conditions of virtual slavery and help perpetrate criminal fraud online against targets in many countries. Details of the new surrogacy case remain murky, and officials have not made clear whether the women were arrested or whether anyone involved in organizing the scheme has been identified. Chou Bun Eng told The Associated Press that the business that recruited the surrogates was based in Thailand, and their food and accommodation in Cambodia were arranged from there. She said the authorities had not yet identified the business. She said the seven Philippine women and four Vietnamese women who were caught in the raid but who were not pregnant would be deported soon. The 13 pregnant women have been placed under care at a hospital in Phnom Penh, said Chou Bun Eng. She added that after they give birth, they could be prosecuted on charges that could land them in prison for two to five years. She said that Cambodia considered the women not to have been victimized but rather offenders who conspired with the organizers to act as surrogates and then sell the babies for money. Her assertion could not be verified, as the women could not be contacted, and it is not known if they have lawyers. The Philippine Embassy in Cambodia, in response to a local news account of the affair, issued a statement Wednesday confirming most of the details related to what it called the 'rescue of 20 Filipino women.' 'The Philippine Embassy ensured that all 20 Filipinos were interviewed in the presence of an Embassy representative and an interpreter in every step of the investigation process,' it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pregnant-philippine-women-arrested-in-cambodia-for-surrogacy-could-be-prosecuted-/7820323.html	2024-10-12T15:40:54-07:00	
US aviation authority approves SpaceX Starship 5 flight for Sunday	washington — The Federal Aviation Administration approved a license Saturday for the launch of SpaceX's Starship 5 on Sunday after earlier saying it did not expect to make a decision until late November. Reuters first reported this week the faster than expected timetable after the FAA in September had suggested a much longer review. SpaceX is targeting Sunday for the launch and said a 30-minute launch window opens at 7 a.m. CT (1200 GMT) The FAA said Saturday that SpaceX had 'met all safety, environmental and other licensing requirements for the suborbital test flight' for the fifth test of the Starship and has also approved the Starship 6 mission profile. The Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket are fully reusable systems designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon and beyond. The fifth test flight of the Starship/Super Heavy from Boca Chica, Texas, includes a return to the launch site of the Super Heavy booster rocket for a catch attempt by the launch tower, and a water landing of the Starship vehicle in the Indian Ocean west of Australia. The FAA said if SpaceX chooses an uncontrolled entry 'it must communicate that decision to the FAA prior to launch, the loss of the Starship vehicle will be considered a planned event, and a mishap investigation will not be required.' On Friday, the FAA approved the return to flight of the SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle after it reviewed and accepted the SpaceX-led investigation findings and corrective actions for the mishap that occurred September 28. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has harshly criticized the FAA, including for proposing a $633,000 fine against SpaceX over launch issues and for the delay in approving the license for Starship 5, which the company said has been ready to launch since August. Musk has called for the resignation of FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker and threatened to sue the agency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-aviation-authority-approves-spacex-starship-5-flight-for-sunday-/7820318.html	2024-10-12T14:37:16-07:00	
Taiwan's China Airlines denies facing pressure about aircraft order	taipei, taiwan — Taiwan's China Airlines is not facing any political pressure on its decision about whether to buy Boeing or Airbus aircraft for a refreshment of its long-haul fleet, the company's chairman said Saturday. Taiwan's largest carrier has been weighing Boeing's 777X and the Airbus A350-1000 as replacements for its fleet of 10 Boeing 777-300ERs, mostly used on U.S. and some high-density regional routes, according to industry sources. China Airlines Chairman Hsieh Shih-chien told reporters the company was still in the process of evaluating which aircraft to purchase and, asked if there was any political pressure on the decision, replied 'no.' 'When it comes to buying aircraft, it is only China Airlines ourselves who makes the assessment. I want to clarify this,' Hsieh said. Multibillion-dollar deals for new aircraft often must take political as well as business considerations into account — especially in the case of Taiwan, given its international situation and the pressure it faces to give in to China's sovereignty claims, which are rejected by the democratically elected government in Taipei. The United States is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier despite a lack of formal diplomatic ties, and China Airlines' majority owner is the Taiwan government. A senior industry source told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter, that on the China Airlines deal the timing was a complicating factor given November's U.S. election. In 2022, shortly after then-U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei — which set off Chinese war games — China Airlines announced a $4.6 billion order for Boeing's 787 to replace its aging fleet of Airbus A330s. China Airlines already operates 15 of the smaller Airbus A350-900s, as well as nine of the freighter versions of the 777. Hsieh said the 787s would start arriving from next year, while a further 11 Airbus A321s, which are replacing its older Boeing 737-800s, would all come before 2026.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-china-airlines-says-no-political-pressure-on-new-aircraft-order-/7820306.html	2024-10-12T13:56:56-07:00

Holding Super Bowl outside US is possible, says NFL's commissioner	london — The National Football League's aggressive international growth plan could include holding a Super Bowl outside the United States for the first time, Commissioner Roger Goodell said on Saturday. Goodell has shot down the idea in the past, but he told a fan forum in London that it's a possibility. 'We've always traditionally tried to play a Super Bowl in an NFL city — that was always sort of a reward for the cities that have NFL franchises,' he said in response to a question about moving the neutral-site game internationally. 'But things change. It wouldn't surprise me at all if that happens one day.' Goodell floated the idea as he outlined a plan that could include playing 16 international games every year if the regular season expands to 18 games. He added that he has 'no doubt' that Ireland will host a game soon. He named Rio de Janeiro as a likely new host and said the Jacksonville Jaguars are considering increasing the number of games they play in London during their stadium renovations at home. This season's Super Bowl — the 59th edition — will be played in New Orleans. In 2026, Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, will host, followed by SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, in 2027. Kansas City's 25-22 overtime victory over San Francisco in the last Super Bowl was the most-watched program in U.S. television history. Team owners already have authorized up to eight international games, but Goodell said they could double that number — creating a scenario where all 32 teams could play an international game each year. The key is expanding the regular season by one game and reducing the number of preseason games to two. 'If we do expand our season — our regular season — to an 18-and-two structure, I see us going to 16 of those games being in international markets,' Goodell said. He added that the plan could include a second bye week in the schedule. 'A lot of that depends on — can we continue to make the game safer, can we continue to modify the way we conduct the offseason as well as the training camp and as well as the season, so that these guys feel comfortable being able to play that period of time,' Goodell said. Under that scenario, he said, the season would start around Labor Day and conclude around Presidents Day — the third Monday of February. Moving to an 18th game is seen as inevitable. The players union has indicated it is open to an agreement before the current labor deal expires after the 2030 season. There are five international games this season, and Goodell said the league wants to increase to eight 'quickly.' Dublin has been seen as the next likely host — after Madrid gets its first game in 2025. 'I have no doubt that we're going to be playing in Ireland. I don't know if it will be next year, but it's coming soon,' Goodell said at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. He cited Rio de Janeiro as the possible host of the next Brazil game — Sao Paulo staged one this season. London, which could get a night game at some point, has hosted regular-season games since 2007 and Germany since 2022. 'We're looking at other markets in the other direction, toward Asia,' he said. 'There's probably more interest than we can handle.' Kickoff update Goodell expects some offseason tweaks to the new kickoff rules but on the whole said 'it's working.' The new rules have made kickoffs relevant again, he said, and the early data on injuries is promising. Just over 30% of kickoffs have been returned this season compared with 20% last season, he said. 'With that increase in returns, it's giving us more data to determine whether we can do it more safely. It actually is incredibly promising. We're seeing lower impacts that have led to less severe injuries and less number of injuries. So, I think it's working,' Goodell said. On average, kickoffs drives are starting just past the 29-yard line, compared with just past the 24 previously, he said. 'I think what we'll see ultimately is a change in the offseason,' Goodell said. 'Once we know it's a safer play, it will encourage more kickoffs. That could happen in a couple of ways. You could move the kickoff line back, so that they can't kick it out as easily. You could also say the penalty for kicking it out is going to go to the 35 instead of where we're at, the 30.' He said the 'great thing' about the new system is 'one little crease develops and that guy is gone. That's what I'm looking for is that long kickoff return to return to the game. I think we had four or five last year. We're already at that number at Week 6. That's pretty good.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/holding-super-bowl-outside-us-is-possible-says-nfl-s-commissioner-/7820235.html	2024-10-12T11:26:24-07:00	
Floridians evacuated for Hurricane Milton make their way back home	BRANDON, FLORIDA — Florida residents who fled hundreds of miles to escape Hurricane Milton made slow trips home on crowded highways, weary from their long journeys and the cleanup work awaiting them but also grateful to be coming back alive. 'I love my house, but I’m not dying in it,' Fred Neuman said Friday while walking his dog outside a rest stop off Interstate 75 north of Tampa. Neuman and his wife live in Siesta Key, where Milton made landfall Wednesday night as a powerful Category 3 hurricane. Heeding local evacuation orders ahead of the storm, they drove nearly 800 kilometers to Destin on the Florida Panhandle. Neighbors told the couple the hurricane destroyed their carport and inflicted other damage, but Neuman shrugged, saying their insurance should cover it. Nearby, Lee and Pamela Essenburm made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches at a picnic table as cars pulling off the slow-moving interstate waited for parking spaces outside the crowded rest stop. Their home in Palmetto, on the south end of Tampa Bay, had a tree fall in the backyard. They evacuated, fearing the damage would be more severe and worrying Milton might hit as a catastrophic Category 4 or 5 storm. 'I wasn't going to take a chance on it,' Lee Essenbaum said. 'It’s not worth it.' Milton killed at least 10 people when it tore across central Florida, flooding barrier islands, ripping the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays′ baseball stadium and spawning deadly tornadoes. Officials say the toll could have been worse if not for the widespread evacuations. The still-fresh devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene just two weeks earlier probably helped compel many people to flee. 'Helene likely provided a stark reminder of how vulnerable certain areas are to storms, particularly coastal regions,' said Craig Fugate, who served as the Federal Emergency Management Agency's administrator under President Barack Obama. 'When people see firsthand what can happen, especially in neighboring areas, it can drive behavior change in future storms.' In the seaside town of Punta Gorda, Mayor Lynne Matthews said rescuers had to save three people from floodwaters after Milton passed, compared with 121 rescues from Helene's flooding. 'So, people listened to the evacuation order,' Matthews told a news conference Friday, noting that local authorities ensured residents heard them. 'We had teams out with the megaphones going through all of our mobile home communities and other places to let people know that they needed to evacuate.' As of Saturday morning, the number of Floridians still without power had dropped to less than 1.6 million, according to poweroutage.us. St. Petersburg's 260,000 residents were told to boil water before drinking, cooking or brushing their teeth, until at least Monday. Traffic crawled along stretches of I-75 as evacuees’ vehicles crowded alongside a steady stream of utility trucks heading south toward Tampa. While the densely populated city and surrounding Hillsborough County accounted for nearly one-fourth of the remaining power outages, Milton spared Tampa a direct hit, and the lethal storm surge that scientists feared never materialized. On Sunday, President Joe Biden will survey the devastation inflicted on Florida’s Gulf Coast by the hurricane. He said he hopes to connect with Governor Ron DeSantis during the visit. The trip to Florida offers Biden another opportunity to press Republican Speaker Mike Johnson to call lawmakers back to Washington to approve further funding during their pre-election recess. It’s something the top House lawmaker says he won’t do. Biden is making the case that Congress needs to act now to ensure the Small Business Administration and FEMA have the money they need to get through hurricane season, which stretches through the end of November in the Atlantic. The president said Friday that Hurricane Milton caused $50 billion in estimated damages. As the recovery continues, DeSantis has warned people to be cautious, citing ongoing safety threats, including downed power lines and standing water that could hide dangerous objects. 'We’re now in the period where you have fatalities that are preventable,' DeSantis said Friday. 'You have to make the proper decisions and know that there are hazards out there.' National Weather Service Meteorologist Paul Close said rivers will 'keep rising' for the next four or five days resulting in river flooding, mostly around Tampa Bay and northward. Those areas were hit by the most rain, which comes on top of a wet summer that included earlier hurricanes. 'You can't do much but wait,' Close said of the rivers cresting. 'At least there is no rain in the forecast, no substantial rain. So, we have a break here from all our wet weather.' In coastal Pinellas County, the sheriff's office used high-water vehicles to shuttle people back and forth to their homes in a flooded Palm Harbor neighborhood where waters continued to rise.	https://www.voanews.com/a/floridians-evacuated-for-hurricane-milton-make-their-way-back-home/7820242.html	2024-10-12T11:13:21-07:00	
North Kosovo ethnic tensions at risk for violence, NATO official says	PRISTINA, KOSOVO — Persistent ethnic tension in north Kosovo could trigger a repeat of violence seen in the area last year when four people died in a gun battle and NATO peacekeepers were hurt in clashes, a senior official from the military alliance warned Saturday. Kosovo is predominantly ethnic Albanian, but about 50,000 Serbs in the north reject Pristina's government and see Belgrade as their capital. A former Serbian province, Kosovo declared independence in 2008, a decade after a guerrilla uprising. U.S. Navy Admiral Stuart B. Munsch, commander of the Allied Joint Force Command Naples — which oversees NATO's peacekeeping force in Kosovo — said the alliance remained concerned about the risk of repeated violence in the volatile north. 'Heated political rhetoric could inspire some nongovernment forces to commit violence such as what happened last year,' Munsch told reporters in Pristina. 'I would not say that definitely conflict is coming; I think there is a persistent risk,' he said, referring to a lack of progress in EU-mediated talks between Kosovo's government and Serbia. A police officer and three gunmen were killed in September 2023 when a group of heavily armed attackers entered from Serbia and attacked police in the village of Banjska. Four months earlier, more than 90 soldiers were injured when Serb protesters attacked NATO peacekeepers. Kosovo has accused Serbia of being behind the Banjska attack, but Belgrade has denied the accusations. The U.S. and the European Union, Kosovo's leading global allies, have criticized the Pristina government for taking unilateral actions in the north that could spark ethnic violence and risk the lives of some 4,000 NATO troops on duty there. Kosovo rejects such criticism, and the issue has strained Pristina's ties with its Western supporters. As part of the EU-mediated dialogue, Kosovo and Serbia have been holding talks for more than a decade to normalize their relations, but there has been little progress. Like the Serbs living in north Kosovo, Belgrade also considers Kosovo to be part of Serbia and refuses to recognize it as an independent state.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-kosovo-ethnic-tensions-at-risk-for-violence-nato-official-says/7820230.html	2024-10-12T10:59:30-07:00	
Powerful storm knocks out power to 1.6 million in Brazil's largest city	SAO PAULO — More than 1.6 million people in Sao Paulo were without power on Saturday more than 16 hours after a brief but powerful storm swept through South America's largest city. Officials in Sao Paulo state said that record wind gusts Friday night of up to 108 kilometers per hour knocked down transmission lines and uprooted trees, causing severe damage in some parts. The storm also shut down several airports and interrupted water service in several areas, according to the Sao Paulo state government. Authorities originally expected to restore power within a few hours. But several neighborhoods in the metropolitan area, which is home to 21 million people, were still in the dark on Saturday and authorities were urging residents to limit their consumption of water. One person died when a tree fell on an outdoor stall, authorities said. At least four other people in surrounding Sao Paulo state also died.	https://www.voanews.com/a/powerful-storm-knocks-out-power-to-1-6-million-in-brazil-s-largest-city/7820227.html	2024-10-12T10:48:45-07:00	
Iran sends satellites to Russia for rocket launch, Tasnim reports	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Iran has sent two locally made satellites to Russia to be put into orbit by a Russian space vehicle, the semi-official news agency Tasnim reported Saturday, in the latest space cooperation between the two U.S.-sanctioned countries. The development of Kowsar, a high-resolution imaging satellite, and Hodhod, a small communications satellite, is the first substantial effort by Iran's private space sector, the report said. Russia sent Iranian satellites into orbit in February and in 2022, when U.S. officials voiced concern over space cooperation between Russia and Iran, fearing the satellite will not only help Russia in Ukraine but also help Iran monitor potential military targets in Israel and the wider Middle East. Kowsar could be used in agriculture, natural resource management, environmental monitoring and disaster management, Tasnim said. Hodhod is designed for satellite-based communications and could be used in remote areas with little access to terrestrial networks. In September, Iran carried out its second satellite launch this year using a rocket built by its Revolutionary Guards. The launch came as the United States and European countries accuse Tehran of transferring ballistic missiles to Russia that could be used in its war with Ukraine. Iran has denied this.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-sends-satellites-to-russia-for-rocket-launch-tasnim-reports/7820222.html	2024-10-12T10:41:28-07:00	
North Korean leader's sister threatens South over drone flights	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday accused South Korea of deliberately avoiding responsibility for the alleged flights of South Korean drones over the North’s capital and warned of a 'terrible calamity' if they continue. The statement by Kim Yo Jong came a day after North Korea’s Foreign Ministry claimed that South Korean drones carrying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets were detected in the night skies over Pyongyang on Wednesday and Thursday, as well as on October 3. The ministry said North Korean forces will prepare 'all means of attack' capable of destroying the southern side of the border and the South Korean military — and respond without warning if South Korean drones are detected in its territory again. South Korea’s defense minister initially denied the accusation, but the South’s military later adjusted its response, saying it couldn’t confirm whether the North’s claims were true. In comments published through state media, Kim, one of her brother’s top foreign policy officials, said that the South Korean military’s vague statements should be taken as proof that it was 'either the main culprit or accomplice in this incident.' 'If the military stood by while its own citizens employed drones, a widely recognized multi-purpose military tool, to violate another country’s sovereignty, thereby increasing the risk of armed conflict with a potential adversary, this would amount to intentional acquiescence and collusion,' she said. 'The moment a South Korean drone is discovered once again in skies above our capital, a terrible calamity will surely occur. I personally hope that does not happen,' she said. South Korea’s military and government didn’t immediately respond to Kim’s comments. Tensions between the Koreas are now at their worst in years as the pace of both North Korea’s missile tests and the South’s combined military training with the United States have intensified in tit-for-tat. The animosity has been exacerbated by Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns between the Koreas in recent months. Since May, North Korea has sent thousands of balloons carrying paper waste, plastic and other trash to drop on the South, in what it described as retaliation against South Korean civilian activists who flew balloons with anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. South Korea’s military responded to the North’s balloon campaign by using border loudspeakers to broadcast propaganda and K-pop to North Korea. North Korea is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of the authoritarian government of leader Kim Jong Un and his family’s dynastic rule. South Korean officials have been raising concern that North Korea may seek to dial up pressure on Seoul and Washington ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. Experts say Kim's long-term goal is to eventually force Washington to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and to negotiate security and economic concessions from a position of strength. In written answers to questions by The Associated Press this month, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said North Korea is likely preparing major provocations around the U.S. election, possibly including a test detonation of a nuclear device or flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, as it tries to grab Washington’s attention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korean-leader-s-sister-threatens-south-over-drone-flights/7820218.html	2024-10-12T10:32:06-07:00

Norway introduces temporary border checks after terror threat level raised	OSLO, NORWAY — Norway is introducing temporary border checks on its frontiers with other Western European nations after the domestic security agency raised the terror threat level, police said Saturday. The checks will apply until October 22, according to a police statement. It cited 'a challenging threat picture' and the October 8 announcement by the security agency PST that it was increasing Norway's threat level from 'moderate' to 'high,' the second-highest level on a five-tier scale. PST pointed to an increased threat to Jewish and Israeli targets in particular. Norway isn't a member of the European Union, but the country is part of the European ID-check free-travel zone known as the Schengen area. It has land borders with EU and Schengen members Sweden and Finland. The border-free Schengen area guarantees free movement to more than 425 million EU citizens, along with non-EU nationals living in the EU or visiting the EU as tourists, as exchange students or for business purposes. That free movement of people is said to enable EU citizens to travel, work and live in an EU country without special formalities. The Schengen area encompasses most EU countries, with the exceptions of Cyprus and Ireland. Bulgaria and Romania are the newest countries to join the Schengen area, as of March 2024, meaning any person crossing the internal air and sea borders will no longer be subject to checks. Norway police said that the new temporary controls won't involve all travelers being checked, and that there's no reason to expect delays at border crossings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/norway-introduces-temporary-border-checks-after-terror-threat-level-raised/7820173.html	2024-10-12T09:25:50-07:00	
Election stress disorder is a real thing ahead of November voting	The American Psychiatric Association says that as elections approach, stress levels go up, regardless of political affiliation. The constant stream of news, stressful arguments and concerns about the country's future all put pressure on mental well-being. Some psychologists call it election stress disorder.

Poland to suspend asylum rights amid pressure on Belarusian border	WARSAW, POLAND — Poland's leader said Saturday that he plans to temporarily suspend the right to asylum as part of a new migration policy, pointing to its alleged abuse by eastern neighbors Belarus and Russia. Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that 'the state must regain 100% of the control over who enters and leaves Poland,' and that a territorial suspension of the right to asylum will be part of a strategy that will be presented to a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Polish news agency PAP reported. He didn't give details but said at a convention of his Civic Coalition that 'we will reduce illegal migration in Poland to a minimum.' Poland has struggled with migration pressures on its border with Belarus since 2021. Successive Polish governments have accused Belarus and Russia of luring migrants from the Middle East and Africa there to destabilize the West. Tusk pointed to alleged misuse of the right to asylum 'by [Belarusian President Alexander] Lukashenko, by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, by smugglers, human smugglers, human traffickers. How this right to asylum is used is in exact contradiction to the idea of the right to asylum.' He said that he would demand recognition of the decision on the right to asylum from the European Union, PAP reported. Tusk's comments came after Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski said Thursday that Poland will tighten its visa regulations, stepping up the vetting of applicants. That decision follows an investigation into a cash-for-visas scandal under the country's previous government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-to-suspend-asylum-rights-amid-pressure-on-belarusian-border/7820130.html	2024-10-12T08:31:01-07:00	
Harris' doctor reports she's in 'excellent health'	WASHINGTON — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is in 'excellent health' and 'possesses the physical and mental resiliency' required to serve as president, her doctor said in a letter released Saturday that summarizes her medical history and status. Dr. Joshua Simmons, a U.S. Army colonel and physician to the vice president, wrote that Harris, 59, maintains a healthy, active lifestyle and that her most recent physical, in April, was 'unremarkable.' She 'possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief,' he wrote in a two-page letter. Harris' campaign hopes to use the moment to draw a contrast with Republican Donald Trump, who has released only limited information about his health over the years, and raise questions about his fitness to serve, according to a campaign aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Trump has released very little health information, including after his ear was grazed by a bullet during an assassination attempt in July. Simmons, who said he has been Harris’ primary care physician for the past 3½ years, said the vice president has a history of allergies and urticaria, also known as hives, for which she has been on allergen immunotherapy for the past three years. Simmons said Harris’ latest blood work and other test results were 'unremarkable.' Also in the report: Harris wears contact lenses for mild nearsightedness; her family history includes maternal colon cancer; she is up to date on preventive care recommendations, including having a colonoscopy and annual mammograms. As Harris' office released the medical report, her campaign highlighted recent media reports raising questions about Trump's health and mental acuity and his failure to provide information about health status and medical history. Trump, 78, eagerly questioned President Joe Biden's health when the 81-year-old president was seeking reelection. Since Biden was replaced on the ticket with Harris, Trump's own health has drawn more attention. Last November, Trump marked Biden's birthday by releasing a letter from his physician that reported the former president was in 'excellent' physical and mental health. The letter, posted on Trump’s social media platform, contained no details to support its claims — measures such as weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, or the results of any test.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-doctor-reports-she-s-in-excellent-health-/7820112.html	2024-10-12T07:50:18-07:00	
US airstrikes target multiple militant camps in Syria	BEIRUT — A series of U.S. airstrikes targeted several camps run by the Islamic State group in Syria in an operation the U.S. military said will disrupt the extremists from conducting attacks in the region and beyond. The U.S. Central Command said the airstrikes were conducted Friday, without specifying in which parts of Syria. About 900 U.S. troops have been deployed in eastern Syria alongside the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces that were instrumental in the fight against IS militants. Despite their defeat, attacks by IS sleeper cells in Iraq and Syria have been on the rise over the past years, with scores of people killed or wounded. The Islamic State group seized territory at the height of its power and declared a caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014 but was defeated in Iraq in 2017. In March 2019, the extremists lost the last sliver of land they once controlled in eastern Syria. The U.S. military said the strikes will disrupt the ability of the Islamic State group to plan, organize and conduct attacks against the United States, its allies and partners, as well as civilians throughout the region and beyond. It said battle damage assessments were underway and there were no civilian casualties. Last month, Iraq’s military said that Iraqi forces and American troops killed a senior IS commander who was wanted by the United States, as well as several other prominent militants. At its peak, the group ruled an area half the size of the United Kingdom where it enforced its extreme interpretation of Islam, which included attacks on religious minority groups and harsh punishment of Muslims deemed to be apostates.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-airstrikes-target-multiple-militant-camps-in-syria/7820096.html	2024-10-12T07:36:51-07:00	
Cameroon urges awareness of breast cancer's early stages	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Humanitarian groups in Cameroon are visiting homes and villages in remote areas this week to mark Breast Cancer Awareness Month, advising women to go to hospitals for free screening and treatment. About 60% of the more than 7,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer in Cameroon this year have died because they were late in getting to hospitals, officials say. Breast cancer deaths are highly unreported because families abandon women to die at home. Thirty-year-old history student Emilie Nadege Atangana told a group of women and girls at the University of Yaounde 1 campus how she was psychologically and emotionally traumatized after receiving a diagnosis of breast cancer in 2020. Most of her relatives, friends and fellow students said she would not live long and abandoned her, she said. Atangana said she found hope when medical staff members of the Yaounde Gynaecology, Obstetrics and Pediatrics Hospital told her that 90% of early-stage breast cancers are curable. Cameroonian government officials and humanitarian groups say cancer survivors such as Atangana have been sent to towns and villages as part of activities marking 'Pink Month.' The World Health Organization designates October as Pink Month, a time to teach people about cancer, including early identification and signs and symptoms. Forty-two-year-old Mesode Ngwese Agbaw, a cancer survivor, said people should stop hiding cancer patients at home to die because of the false belief that cancer cannot be treated. 'You don't need to hide alone with your pain,' she said. 'Share it with somebody, and the people will be ready to help you. I was operated on and after the operation, I have been following treatment and till now, I am fine.' This year's theme for the month in Cameroon is 'No one Should Face Breast Cancer Alone and Yes, No One is Expected to Fight Breast Cancer Alone.' Ruth Amin, a public health specialist and project manager at the Yaounde-based Lifafa Research Foundation, said that sending people suspected of having breast cancer to hospitals would prevent many of the deaths caused because the women were abandoned or got to a hospital too late. 'We are calling on the men to support their spouses, to support their mothers, to support their sisters in raising awareness, in carrying them to the hospitals to be clinically examined by professionals,' she said. 'Women should speak up,' she said. 'Women should go toward the health facilities to get examined because the earlier they are being diagnosed, the easier it would be for them to be treated.' Amin spoke to VOA via a messaging app from Buea, a southern commercial city where humanitarian caravans were educating residents about breast cancer on Saturday. Cameroon says it has equipped all hospitals with qualified medical staff members and equipment to diagnose breast cancer. The World Health Organization estimates that Cameroon has about 20,000 new cancer cases, including breast cancers, each year, with 65% related deaths.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-urges-awareness-of-breast-cancer-s-early-stages/7820056.html	2024-10-12T06:36:50-07:00	
Ukraine, Russia each say they foiled dozens of drone attacks	Kyiv, Ukraine — Russia said on Saturday it had downed 47 Ukrainian drones while Kyiv reported neutralized 24 drones fired by Moscow. The Ukrainian air force said many missiles were fired from the Russian border region of Belgorod, without specifying the number or the type. It said Russia had fired 28 drones at Ukraine, of which 24 were destroyed in the Sumy, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Mikolayev and Kherson regions. The Ukrainian chief of staff also said Kyiv's forces had struck a fuel depot overnight in the eastern Russian-occupied Lugansk region, setting it on fire. It did not give any details. Moscow did not confirm the attack. But the Russian defense ministry said its forces had downed 47 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 17 in the southeastern Krasnodar region, 16 over the Azov Sea and 12 over the border region of Lursk. The Krasnodar governor said on Telegram that Ukrainian drone attacks had damaged three homes and set a vehicle on fire. Russian forces have made advances across the eastern front line and targeted Ukraine's power grid as the country faces its toughest winter since the full-scale Russian invasion started in February 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-russia-each-say-they-foiled-dozens-of-drone-attacks/7819948.html	2024-10-12T02:15:38-07:00	
Avian enthusiasts try to counter the deadly risk of Chicago high-rises for migrating birds	chicago — With a neon-green net in hand, Annette Prince briskly walks a downtown Chicago plaza at dawn, looking left and right as she goes. It's not long before she spots a tiny yellow bird sitting on the concrete. It doesn't fly away, and she quickly nets the bird, gently places it inside a paper bag and labels the bag with the date, time and place. 'This is a Nashville warbler,' said Prince, director of the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, noting that the bird must have flown into a glass window pane of an adjacent building. 'He must only weigh about two pennies. He's squinting his eyes because his head hurts.' For rescue groups like the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, this scene plays out hundreds of times each spring and fall after migrating birds fly into homes, small buildings and sometimes Chicago's skyscrapers and other hulking buildings. A stark sign of the risks came last fall, when 1,000 migrating birds died on a single night after flying into the glass exterior of the city's lakefront convention center, McCormick Place. This fall, the facility unveiled new bird-safe window film on one of its glass buildings along the Lake Michigan shore. The $1.2 million project installed tiny dots on the exterior of the Lakeside Center building, adorning enough glass to cover two football fields. Doug Stotz, senior conservation ecologist at the nearby Field Museum, hopes the project will be a success. He estimated that just 20 birds have died after flying into the convention's center's glass exterior so far this fall, a hopeful sign. 'We don't have a lot of data since this just started this fall, but at this point, it looks like it's made a huge difference,' Stotz said. But for the birds that collide with Chicago buildings, there is a network of people waiting to help. They also are aiming to educate officials and find solutions to improve building design, lighting and other factors in the massive number of bird collision deaths in Chicago and worldwide. Prince said she and other volunteers walk the streets downtown to document what they can of the birds that are killed and injured. 'We have the combination of the millions of birds that pass through this area because it's a major migratory path through the United States, on top of the amount of artificial lighting that we put out at night, which is when these birds are traveling and getting confused and attracted to the amount of glass,' Prince said. Dead birds are often saved for scientific use, including by Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History. Rescued birds are taken to local wildlife rehabilitation centers to recover, such as the DuPage Wildlife Conservation Center in suburban Illinois. On a recent morning, veterinarian Darcy Stephenson at DuPage gave a yellow-bellied sapsucker anesthetic gas before taping its wings open for an X-ray. The bird arrived with a note from a rescue group: 'Window collision.' Examining the results, she found the bird had a broken ulna — a bone in the wing. The center takes in about 10,000 species of animals annually and 65% of them are avian. Many are victims of window collisions and during peak migration in the fall, several hundred birds can show up in one day. 'The large chunk of these birds do actually survive and make it back into the wild once we're able to treat them,' said Sarah Reich, head veterinarian at DuPage. 'Fractures heal very, very quickly in these guys for shoulder fractures. Soft tissue trauma generally heals pretty well. The challenging cases are going to be the ones where the trauma isn't as apparent.' Injured birds go through a process of flight testing, then get a full physical exam by the veterinary staff and are rehabilitated before being set free. 'It's exciting to be able to get these guys back out into the wild, especially some of those cases that we're kind of cautiously optimistic about or maybe have an injury that we've never treated successfully before,' Reich said, adding that these are the cases 'clinic staff get really, really excited about.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/avian-enthusiasts-try-to-counter-the-deadly-risk-of-chicago-high-rises-for-migrating-birds/7819848.html	2024-10-12T00:47:44-07:00	
Ukraine's vast forests devastated in hellscape of war	Sviati Hory National Nature Park, Ukraine — Serhiy Tsapok surveyed the smoldering ruins of pine trees, blackened stumps as far as the eye could see. 'They're dead now,' the weary ranger said of the trees he'd nursed for almost two decades. The 41-year-old's daily route through the Ukrainian forests, once a joy, has become a nightmare. The fire he fought, caused by a blast of undetermined cause, wiped out three hectares of 80-year-old pine trees at the Sviati Hory National Nature Park in eastern Ukraine, according to officials there. Four-fifths of the park's nearly 12,000 hectares have been damaged or destroyed by fires or ordnance, they said. It's a tiny portion of the damage caused by the war, which has brutalized the landscape of Ukraine and much of its 10 million hectares of forests. Both Russian and Ukrainian armies blast thousands of shells at each other every day, shredding the earth in grinding combat that echoes the trench warfare of World War I. Reuters spoke to nearly 20 specialists in the field, including forest rangers, ecologists, demining experts and government officials, who provided a detailed picture of the ruin wrought on Ukraine's forests by the 31-month-old war. Russian authorities didn't respond to requests for comment for this article. 'Enormous' loss The director of the Sviati Hory park, Serhiy Pryimachuk, told Reuters that Russian munitions had burned vast tracts of the area, once a rare and beloved beauty spot in a heavily industrialized region. 'What we have lost is enormous,' he said. Tending to forests is now a perilous occupation, with mines and unexploded shells hidden in the ground posing the biggest threat. Ranger Oleksandr Polovynko, 39, nearly lost a foot after stepping on a mine while tending the forest last year. 'I crawled back to the car and drove home with one leg,' he recalled. It took him six months to return to work. All that remains of many forests in eastern Ukraine are fields of stripped, broken trunks. Local wildlife, including deer, boars and woodpeckers, have been badly affected by the loss of habitats, the experts said. In northern Ukraine's Chernobyl nature reserve, the pre-war population of over 100 Przewalski's horses - a globally endangered species of wild horse - has been hit hard by the conflict, according to Oleh Lystopad, an ecologist with the ANTS advocacy group who said landmines were making it difficult to extinguish fires. 'Right now, it's in question to what extent this species can continue to exist there,' Lystopad said. Bleak legacy The damage to forests is part of a broader trail of environmental destruction caused by the war, which could leave a bleak natural legacy for decades to come, having poisoned the soil and rivers, polluted the air and left vast tracts of the country riddled with mines, according to the experts. The dense pine forests common to eastern Ukraine catch alight easily and have been decimated by the conflict, said Brian Milakovsky, a U.S.-based forester who until recently lived and worked in Ukraine for eight years. The war has torn through the habitats of some unique flora such as the chalk pine, a rare subspecies of Scots pine, according to ecologists and park officials. Milakovsky said the environmental crisis was particularly acute in Russian-held areas - nearly a fifth of Ukraine - where occupation authorities appeared to have little capacity to extinguish forest fires. He estimated about 80% of the pine forests in the eastern region of Luhansk had been destroyed. About 425,000 hectares of forest across the country have been contaminated by mines and unexploded ordnance, according to the environment ministry. Authorities say they still need to inspect up to 3 million hectares of forest that are or have been occupied by Russian forces and are likely riddled with mines and ordnance. The foresters interviewed said the Russians were heavily dug in and left booby traps and tripwires behind as they retreated. 'If we want to extinguish a fire quickly, it's impossible because the entire territory is mined,' Ruslan Strilets, who was Ukraine's environment minister when he was interviewed in July. 'There is a risk of being killed or maimed.' Indeed, on top of serious injuries to rangers like Polovynko, 14 forest workers have been killed by landmines, booby traps or shelling during the conflict, according to environment ministry data. Decades of work, billions of dollars The specialists interviewed said repairing the damage to the forests would take decades and cost billions of dollars. Some doubted whether some heavily mined areas of forest would ever be cleared, citing past examples of forests declared no-go zones after previous European wars. The official estimate is that demining all contaminated territory, including forests and other areas such as agricultural land, will take 70 years, Strilets, who has since been replaced as environment minister, told Reuters in Kyiv on July 22. Four ecologists with expertise in Ukrainian forests said the subsequent process of regenerating damaged areas would be complex and could take decades, plus billions of dollars of investment. According to a June 2024 study on the Ukraine war's carbon emissions, conflict-related forest fires directly emitted greenhouse gases equivalent to 6.75 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of the annual emissions of Armenia. Ukraine has also lost the carbon capture potential of those burned trees. The World Bank estimated in February that the damage wrought by the war on forests and other protected natural areas, including marshes and wetlands, exceeded $30 billion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-s-vast-forests-devastated-in-hellscape-of-war-/7818546.html	2024-10-12T00:46:49-07:00	
Argentina's triple-digit inflation slows, but workers still struggle to pay bills	BUENOS AIRES — Argentina's triple-digit inflation, among the world's highest, is starting to slow down but this offers little relief for workers whose salaries have stayed the same while costs of basic goods skyrocketed and the government slashed state subsidies. 'We're losing track of what's expensive and what's cheap,' said university professor Daniel Vazquez while shopping in Buenos Aires. 'Prices keep going up and the only thing that isn't going up is salaries.' 'The gap is very, very big,' he said. While annualized inflation in September remained well into the triple digits at 209%, month-on-month price hikes slowed to their lowest level since late 2021 at 3.5%, data from the national statistics agency showed on Thursday. The data landed in line with the forecasts of analysts, who predict that inflation will end 2024 at 124%. Libertarian President Javier Milei has cut subsidies to sectors such as energy and transportation, while vowing to trim what he calls bloat in the public sector, shuttering some offices and trimming jobs. 'You've never seen inflation being fought like this before. It takes a little longer but it's genuine,' Milei wrote on X after the inflation data was published Thursday. The tough austerity drive has prolonged a recession and caused poverty rates to surge to around 53%. Computer programmer Ivan Cortesi, 30, said that while food prices remained similar to last month, utility costs rose significantly. 'This past month there has been a significant increase in all utilities,' he said. According to the statistics agency, rents as well as water, power and gas prices led monthly inflation, up over 7%, followed by clothing and shoes which rose 6% and education costs that increased over 4%. Food prices increased just 2% from last month but more than tripled their level from a year ago, while housing and utility costs nearly quadrupled. Cigarettes, alcohol, health care, transport and communications also tracked annual inflation well above 200%. Milei devalued the local currency when he took office in December, and the sharp spending cuts have particularly hit informal workers, civil servants, pensioners, doctors and teachers. On Wednesday, Argentina's Congress failed to overturn Milei's controversial veto of a law that would have shored up university spending in line with inflation, following mass protests by students and university workers against the measure. Milei has vowed to veto any law that threatens the fiscal balance.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentina-s-triple-digit-inflation-slows-but-workers-still-struggle-to-pay-bills/7818543.html	2024-10-12T00:46:11-07:00	
River guardians risk own lives as they work to protect, restore Colombia's Atrato	PAIMADO, Colombia — Sediment and pebbles are all that's left on the earth around much of Bernardino Mosquera's small riverside community in northwest Colombia's Choco region. Just a year ago, healthy shrubs and trees filled this important biodiversity spot teeming with species native to the land. But then illegal miners arrived, using their heavy machinery to dredge the riverbeds for gold. 'It's just desert here,' said Mosquera. 'Illegal mining affects the ecosystem in every way … it leads to degraded land. There are no trees. The water sources are drying up, it's polluted by mercury.' Mosquera is a river guardian, a title bestowed upon him and 13 others. The unpaid guardians serve as the eyes and ears of the Atrato River: They liaise with government institutions on environmental and social issues in the face of aggression from armed groups and hope to reverse the devastation they see along the river. But after eight years, they are increasingly disenchanted by the lack of support from institutions and growing threats from armed groups that control the region. Colombia's constitutional court declared in 2016 that the Atrato River running alongside this 2,500-person town was so important to life, it would have rights equivalent to a human. The region is home to thousands of species, with 25% of its plant and bird species endemic, according to the United Nations Development Programme. The river's legal status was a first for Latin America, and when the guardians were established. 'It's an unbreakable marriage between its inhabitants and the rivers,' Mosquera, 62, said. 'That's why we have to defend the Atrato.' Illegal gold mining has become the fastest-growing criminal economy over the past decade in South America. The boom began in Colombia and Peru and expanded to Ecuador, Venezuela and Brazil. Illegal mining rife in Choco Paimado, like many towns in the Choco region, is an illegal mining hub firmly in the control of the largest criminal organization in the country, known as Gulf Clan. Early each morning, small wooden boats carry plastic gasoline containers to feed the mining machinery dotted along the Atrato, a river that snakes some 750 kilometers (470 miles) through northern Colombian jungles. Dozens of illegal mines pepper the river between Mosquera's home in Paimado — which lies on Rio Quito, the Atrato River's main tributary — and the state capital Quibdo. Large wooden rafts propped on stilts reach deep into the riverbed to extract material that is sifted through the machine for gold. Deep inside the banks of the river, another type of mining takes place with heavier machinery. It is here that deforestation is glaringly evident. Drone footage taken by The Associated Press shows large patches of empty land that stretch long behind the riverbanks. 'Many people think that because it looks very green there is no deforestation,' said river guardian and agronomist Maryuri Mosquera, 42. High rates of poverty have pushed many into gold mining, work that destroys land and contaminates their river. That destruction then destroys the local economy, making communities even more dependent on mining. Colombia's human rights ombudsman's office said in April the government is failing to protect the river, saying 'there is no evidence of any progress' since the river gained personhood. It called on the environment ministry to comply with the 2016 ruling. In a written response, Colombia's environment ministry said its Minister Susana Muhamad has been coordinating efforts with the Ministry of Defense 'to protect this important ecosystem.' It added that a program will soon begin to work with the communities to restore the Atrato River basin and its tributaries. Community lifeline destroyed The Atrato River has long been an important source of water, food and transport for its rural, mostly Afro-Colombian residents who built communities on the riverbanks. The tiny village of El Arenal along the Atrato is home to river guardian Juan Carlos Palacios, 33, who said that his role is a triumph for the Black communities who fought for the 2016 ruling. 'It makes me feel very sad when I see machinery pass by continually, without any controls. They arrive on our land and we can't even say anything, because the miners come along with armed actors,' Palacios said. For most of his life — even sometimes now — Palacios has been involved in artisanal gold mining. A short canoe ride to the other side of the river from El Arenal is his mother, bent over with a hoe and a wooden gold sifting pan. This has been her life since she can remember. 'I think that if I stop doing this, I'll die quickly, because I'm so used to it,' said Ana Palacios Cuesta with a laugh. 'The dredgers have emptied the whole river, so we hardly get anything anymore.' The tiny amounts of gold sediment she collects are sold in the nearby town of Yuto, or in Quibdo, about 40 minutes away. 'No other option' Mercury and arsenic offer the industrial-scale miners a low-tech solution to extract the gold. But they get pumped into the water, poisoning the river and the surrounding lands. The tactic has been killing marine life, changing the natural flow of the river, and further debilitating some of the most vulnerable communities in the country. Palacios, who has a degree in biology, said fish in the river have been 'highly contaminated' by mercury, which gets passed through fish to humans and can cause damage to vital organs. 'Of course we continue to consume them because we have no other option,' he said. Local women and their children stand in the river to wash their dishes and clothes, something only the most rural and needy communities do nowadays over fear of the water's contamination. Guardians face violence, threats The guardians have a precarious job in an area controlled largely by rebel and criminal armed groups, like leftist guerrillas the National Liberation Army and Gulf Clan. Mining machinery along the banks are overseen by these groups and miners are forced to pay them protection money — known locally as 'vacuna' — to be allowed to operate freely without becoming targets. 'The act of raising awareness and denouncing the situations that the Atrato basin is experiencing means we face certain risks,' said guardian Maryuri Mosquera, especially her guardian colleagues in more rural areas. Guardian Bernardino Mosquera has a bulletproof vest provided by the state after he got multiple death threats over the years, the last one in March. He has been kidnapped by Gulf Clan and had bullet shells placed under his door on several occasions 'as warnings.' He almost quit. 'But I realized that if we pull out of the process, we are giving them strength ... no one is going to want to say what is happening, you'll end up riddled with bullets,' Mosquera said as the tropical rain lashed the tin roof of his home. 'We must continue to make the process visible. It's the only way for them (armed groups) to feel that we, too, are in the territory. So that stopped me and made me carry on ... And here I am.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/river-guardians-battle-to-protect-restore-atrato-amid-death-threats/7819850.html	2024-10-12T00:45:27-07:00	
Louisiana's Cajun and Creole heritage will be celebrated at 50th annual festival	new orleans, louisiana — Louisiana's Cajun and Creole heritage takes center stage this weekend when the Festivals Acadiens et Creoles marks a half-century of honoring and celebrating the culture through music, arts, food and community. What started as a one day concert in 1974 to entertain 150 French-speaking journalists gathered in Lafayette — considered the heart of Cajun country — has grown into a three-day event and possibly one of the largest Cajun and Zydeco festivals in the world, organizers said. And, they note, the entire event is free. Barry Jean Ancelet, one of the event's organizers, said when the idea formed 50 years ago, nobody knew if anyone would even come to hear the music. 'Cajun music at that time was largely considered 'old people's music,'' he said. 'You've got to remember, we were in the throes of Rock 'n' Roll at the time. The people here loved it when they encountered it in dance halls, but this concert was designed to call attention to the music in a different way, to point out its value. They had to sit — not dance — and pay attention. And they ended up hearing it in a different way. It was so successful. We ended up turning it into an annual event where we could call positive attention to this important asset and get people to consider it.' The festival, now held annually in Lafayette's Girard Park, brings together multi-generations of musicians and artists who annually fight to preserve a culture that continues to evolve. 'We've always been about celebrating the past and handing it off to the future,' Ancelet said. 'If you value and respect evolution, the culture will produce things that will continue to surprise you. It all comes out in the wash. What's good will last and what's not, won't.' Festival co-founder Pat Mould said the festival is a 'self-celebration of who we are, how we live, what we eat, the music and how we speak.' 'If you know nothing and want to learn about the culture, this one weekend out of the year allows you to find out everything. Everything you want to know is represented at the festival. It's a quick study of Cajun and Creole living,' he said. Event features homegrown talent On tap musically for the Friday through Sunday event are performances by 60 musicians — all homegrown talent — including Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys, Wayne Toups, CJ Chenier, Nathan and the Zydeco Cha Chas, Chubby Carrier and the Bayou Swamp Band, The Revelers, Beausoleil avec Michael Doucet and The Lost Bayou Ramblers. On Friday, contemporary artists will pay tribute to the 1974 concert house band that included Zydeco pioneer Clifton Chenier, Cajun accordion maker Marc Savoy, the Balfa Brothers, a Cajun music ensemble of five brothers, Cajun accordion players Nathan Abshire and Blackie Forrester, and Jimmy C. Newman, a country music and Cajun singer-songwriter and long-time star of the Grand Ole Opry. 'Get ready for Louisiana pure fun,' said Carrier, who's scheduled to perform with his band on Sunday. 'Get ready to eat some really good food and have the time of your life.' 'People all over the word have these dates circled on their calendar,' he continued. 'It's an event that helps the younger generations continue the traditions. I'm a third generation Zydeco musician. This is a family oriented festival that brings people together of all ages.' A 'celebration of everything Cajun' Riley, who's been performing at this festival since 1988, said he keeps returning for several reasons but especially because it helps preserve the culture. 'It's important to see us on stage, singing and speaking in French. That has an effect on people who come to see us and helps them fall in love with the culture,' he said. 'There are a lot of events leading up to the weekend that focuses on the importance of the language, the culture, the food and, of course, the music. There's none other that celebrates it like this one. I think it's the biggest complete celebration of everything Cajun. It's also inclusive of different generations, bands with lineage. That's key,' he said. Riley, now 55, said he's very proud that his three children play music. 'It's a beautiful thing for my family and others like mine,' he said. 'Having your kids play with you is awesome. Most kids don't want to have anything to do with what their parents do. Mine think what I do is fun and it is.' Riley said when he first started there weren't too many young bands playing Cajun music. 'There was real fear that the music would die off and dissipate like the language,' he said. 'The opposite has happened. More young folks are preserving and playing this music than ever. The Zydeco scene down here is packed with young people. It's super vibrant and alive. The same with the Cajun scene as well.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/louisiana-s-cajun-and-creole-heritage-will-be-showcased-at-50th-annual-festivals-acadiens-et-creoles-/7817127.html	2024-10-12T00:44:19-07:00	
Nazi-looted Monet artwork returned to family generations later	NEW ORLEANS — On the eve of World War II, Nazis in Austria seized a pastel by renowned impressionist artist Claude Monet, selling it off and sparking a family's decadeslong search that culminated Wednesday in New Orleans. At an FBI field office, agents lifted a blue veil covering the Monet pastel and presented Adalbert Parlagi's granddaughters with the artwork over 80 years after it was taken from their family. Helen Lowe said she felt that her grandfather would be watching and that he would be 'so, so proud of this moment.' Monet's 1865 Bord de Mer depicts rocks along the shoreline of the Normandy coast, where Allied forces stormed the beaches of Nazi-occupied France during D-Day in 1944, marking a turning point in the war. The Monet pastel is one of 20,000 items recovered by the FBI Art Crime Team out of an estimated 600,000 artworks and millions of books and religious objects stolen by the Nazis. 'The theft was not random or incidental, but an integral part of the Nazis' plan to eliminate all vestiges of Jewish life in Germany and Europe, root and branch,' U.S. State Department Holocaust adviser Stuart E. Eizenstat said in a March speech. After Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Adalbert Parlagi, a successful businessman and art lover, and his wife, Hilda, left behind almost everything they owned and fled Vienna, using British license plates to drive across the border, their granddaughters said. Though the Parlagis hadn't identified as Jewish for years and baptized their children as Protestants, they were still considered Jewish under Nazi laws, according to Austrian government records. Other relatives were killed in concentration camps. The Parlagis attempted to ship their valuable carpets, porcelain and artworks out of Vienna to London, but found out later that their property had been seized and auctioned off by the Gestapo to support the Third Reich. Multiple international declarations decried trading in Nazi-looted art, beginning with Allied forces in London in 1943. The 1998 Washington principles, signed by more than three dozen countries, reiterated the call and advocated for the return of stolen art. Yet Adalbert Parlagi's efforts were stonewalled by the Vienna auctioneer who had bought and sold the Monet pastel and another artwork owned by Parlagi. The records were lost after the fighting in Vienna, the auctioneer told Adalbert in a letter shortly after World War II, according to an English translation of a document prepared by an Austrian government body reviewing the Parlagi family's art restitution claims. 'I also cannot remember two such pictures either,' the auctioneer said. Many survivors of World War II and their descendants ultimately give up trying to recover their lost artwork because of the difficulties they face, said Anne Webber, co-founder of the London-based nonprofit Commission for Looted Art in Europe, which has recovered more than 3,500 looted artworks. 'You have to just constantly, constantly, constantly look,' Webber said. Adalbert Parlagi and his son Franz kept meticulous ownership and search records. After Franz's death in 2012, Françoise Parlagi stumbled upon her father's cache of documents, including the original receipt from her grandfather's purchase of the Monet pastel. She reached out to Webber's commission for help in 2014. The commission's research team reviewed archives and receipts, contacted museums and art experts and scoured the internet, but initially found 'absolutely no trace,' Webber said. Then, in 2021, the team discovered online that a New Orleans dealer acquired the Monet in 2017 and sold it to a Louisiana-based doctor and his wife. The FBI investigated the commission's research and, earlier this year, a federal court ruled the pastel should be returned to the Parlagis' descendants. 'There was never a question' of returning the art to the rightful owners after learning of its sordid history, said Bridget Vita-Schlamp, whose late husband had purchased the Monet pastel. 'We were shocked, I'm not going to lie,' she said. The family recovered another work in March from the Austrian government but there are still six more artworks missing, including from acclaimed artists Camille Pissarro and Paul Signac. The U.S. is likely the 'largest illegal art market in the world,' said Kristin Koch, supervisory special agent with the FBI's Art Crime Program. The art world has a greater responsibility to investigate the origins of artworks and a moral obligation to return looted works to their rightful owners, Webber said. 'They represent the life and the lives that were taken,' Webber said. 'They represent the world that they were exiled from.' The granddaughters of Adalbert and Hilda Parlagi say they are grateful for what they have already gotten back. Françoise Parlagi, a broad smile on her face, said she hoped to hang a copy of the pastel in her home. She said the moment felt 'unreal.' 'So many families are in this situation. Maybe they haven't even been trying to recover because they don't believe, they think this might not be possible,' she said. 'Let us be hope for other families.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nazi-looted-monet-artwork-returned-to-family-generations-later/7817126.html	2024-10-12T00:43:27-07:00

US voting systems are targets of conspiracy theories, but get tested for accuracy and security	ATLANTA — Voting machines have been at the center of a web of conspiracy theories after the 2020 election, with false claims that they were manipulated to steal the presidency from Donald Trump. There was no evidence of widespread fraud or rigged voting machines in the election, and multiple reviews in the battleground states where the Republican president disputed his loss to Democrat Joe Biden confirmed the results as accurate. In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems, one of the largest voting machine companies, $787 million to avoid a trial in a defamation lawsuit. In the years since his loss, Trump and his allies have continued to sow doubts about voting equipment. State and local election officials have tried to push back by explaining the layers of protection that surround voting systems and the measures they have in place to conduct fair and accurate elections. In November's presidential election, nearly every ballot cast will have a paper record that can be used to obtain an accurate count even if there are errors or cyberattacks. What is a voting machine? Election officials rely on various pieces of technology. Every office does things a little bit differently. Officials rely on a voter registration system that is a database of registered voters and have an election management system that workers use to create, issue and track ballots. They also use an election-night reporting system that reports unofficial results. Many jurisdictions use electronic pollbooks to check in voters at polling locations. All this depends on software and computers, a reliance that carries risks that officials work to identify and address. For example, election officials often will isolate critical systems from the internet and use storage devices, such as secured USB sticks, to transfer data. They limit access to sensitive equipment to only those who need it and have logs that track and monitor the devices. When an internet connection is needed, election officials will often use private networks to limit the risk of malicious activity and take other steps to scan their systems for potential vulnerabilities and threats. Voters in much of the country fill out ballots by hand, and then that ballot will be scanned and counted electronically. A few places, mostly small towns in the Northeast, will count their ballots by hand. In some areas, voters use a computer to mark their ballots electronically and then get a printout of their choices that they insert into a scanner for counting. In other cases, the ballot is cast electronically, and a paper record is printed that summarizes the votes cast. That record is then available if a hand-count is needed. Are voting machines connected to the internet? With a few exceptions, no. There are some jurisdictions in a few states that allow for ballot scanners in polling locations to transmit unofficial results, using a mobile private network, after voting has ended on Election Day and the memory cards containing the vote tallies have been removed. Election officials who allow this say it provides for faster reporting of unofficial election results on election night. They say the paper records of the ballots cast are used to authenticate the results during postelection reviews, and that those records would be crucial to a recount if one was needed. Computer security experts have said this is an unnecessary risk and should be prohibited. Are voting machines secure? Election officials say they have worked extensively to shore up security around their voting equipment after an effort by Russia to scan state voter registration systems for vulnerabilities in 2016. There was no evidence then that any data was changed or deleted, but it led the federal government to declare the nation's election systems as critical infrastructure. That allows the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to provide free cybersecurity reviews and vulnerability testing to election offices nationwide. 'Today, eight years later, because of all the incredible work by election officials to strengthen the security and resiliency of our election process, election infrastructure has never been more secure, and the election stakeholder community has never been stronger,' the agency's director, Jen Easterly, told reporters in September. Computer security experts have called for more to be done and for election officials to limit the use of certain technology, specifically machines that mark ballots for voters. A long-running court battle in Georgia has sought to compel the state to get rid of these machines in favor of hand-marked paper ballots. Experts have also raised particular concern about a series of security breaches that occurred after the 2020 election as Trump allies sought access to voting systems in Georgia and elsewhere as they tried to prove their unsubstantiated claims. The experts have warned that the public release of critical election software because of the breaches has raised 'serious threats' and have called for a federal investigation. How do election officials ensure accuracy? Election officials say there are safeguards in place to ensure that voting systems are not manipulated. That begins with physical security, such as locked rooms with limited access and the use of tamper-evident seals. In addition, voting equipment is tested before the election, a process that includes running test ballots through the equipment to ensure votes are being counted correctly. Postelection reviews are conducted to identify any mistakes or errors that may have occurred. Around 98% of all ballots cast in this year's election will include a paper record, according to a report by the Brennan Center for Justice based on data collected by Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group that tracks voting equipment in the U.S. Officials say that's important for ensuring that any error or cyberattack will not prevent officials from producing an accurate record of the vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voting-systems-are-targets-of-conspiracy-theories-but-get-tested-for-accuracy-and-security/7817078.html	2024-10-12T00:41:46-07:00	
China tees up fresh spending to boost ailing economy	beijing — China said Saturday it would issue special bonds to help its sputtering economy, signaling a spending spree to bolster banks, shore up the property market and ease local government debt as part of one of its biggest support packages in years. The plan is part of a series of actions undertaken by Beijing to draw a line under a years-long property sector crisis and chronically low consumption that has plagued the world's second-biggest economy. Beijing's planned special bonds are aimed at boosting the capital available to banks -- part of a push to get them lending in the hopes of firing up sluggish consumer spending. China is also preparing to allow local governments to borrow more to fund the acquisition of unused land for development, aimed at pulling the property market out of a prolonged slump. No figures were provided on the planned special bonds announced at a highly anticipated news conference by Finance Minister Lan Fo'an and other officials, following a series of steps launched in recent weeks that have included interest rate cuts and liquidity for banks. But Lan said China still has room 'to issue debts and increase the deficit' to fund the new measures. Officials have been battling to reverse China's slowdown and achieve a growth target of five percent this year -- enviable for many Western countries but a far cry from the double-digit expansion that for years boosted the Asian giant. On Saturday, Lan said Beijing was 'accelerating the use of additional treasury bonds, and ultra-long-term special treasury bonds are also being issued for use.' 'In the next three months, a total of 2.3 trillion yuan of special bond funds can be arranged for use in various places,' he added. On top of that, Beijing also plans to 'issue special government bonds to support large state-owned commercial banks,' Lan said, although he did not say how much. Chinese authorities have been urging commercial banks to lend more and lower mortgage rates -- measures that would put more cash into the pockets of consumers. Beijing's bonds would therefore offer banks help to shore up their capital, giving them greater leeway to lend more. Bonds for buildings And local governments will be issued special bonds enabling them to acquire unused and idle land for development, Vice Finance Minister Liao Min said, in action that could prop up the housing market. The move would 'help ease liquidity and debt pressures on local governments and real estate companies,' he explained. Beijing will also encourage the acquisition of existing commercial properties to be used as affordable housing. However, analysts expressed frustration that Beijing had refrained from putting a number on further fiscal stimulus. 'The key messages are that ... the central government has the capacity to issue more bonds and raise fiscal deficit, and... the central government plans to issue more bonds to help local governments to pay their debt,' Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said. Beijing was likely 'still working on the minute details of the fiscal stimulus,' Heron Lim at Moody's Analytics told AFP. 'In the meantime, investors might be taking a step back until they are absolutely certain of the direction fiscal policy is taking.' 'Lack of forward guidance' China's economic uncertainty is also fueling a vicious cycle that has kept consumption stubbornly low. Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, said that 'notably absent was any mention of large-scale handouts to consumers' on Saturday. 'The lack of forward guidance on the scale of next year's budget deficit means it is still difficult to judge how large and long-lasting the fiscal boost will be,' he pointed out. Chinese policymakers have in the last weeks unveiled a string of stimulus measures including a suite of rate cuts and a loosening of rules on buying homes, but economists said that more action is needed to pull the economy out of its slump for good. Earlier Saturday, China's top banks said they would cut lower interest rates on existing mortgages from October 25, state media said, following a government call for the action. 'Except for second mortgages in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and some other regions, the interest rates on other eligible mortgages will be adjusted' to no less than 30 basis points below the prime lending rate, the central bank's benchmark rate for mortgages, state broadcaster CCTV said. CCTV reported that major banks, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China and China Construction Bank had announced that they would make the adjustments 'in batches.' The People's Bank of China last month requested that commercial banks lower such rates by October 31. Beijing also last month slashed interest on one-year loans to financial institutions, cut the amount of cash lenders must keep on hand and pushed to lower rates on existing mortgages. And the central bank this week boosted support for markets by opening up tens of billions of dollars in liquidity for firms to buy stocks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-tees-up-fresh-spending-to-boost-ailing-economy/7819931.html	2024-10-12T00:38:54-07:00	
Alexey Navalny wrote he knew he would die in prison in new memoir	new york — Russian dissident Alexey Navalny, who was President Vladimir Putin's top political opponent before his death in February, believed he would die in prison, according to his posthumous memoir, which will be released October 22. The New Yorker published excerpts from the book Friday, featuring writing from Navalny's prison diary and earlier. 'I will spend the rest of my life in prison and die here,' he wrote on March 22, 2022. 'There will not be anybody to say goodbye to ... All anniversaries will be celebrated without me. I'll never see my grandchildren.' Navalny had been serving a 19-year prison sentence on 'extremism' charges in an Arctic penal colony. His death on February 16 at age 47 drew widespread condemnation, with many blaming Putin. Navalny was arrested in January 2021 upon returning to Russia after suffering a major health emergency from being poisoned in 2020. 'The only thing we should fear is that we will surrender our homeland to be plundered by a gang of liars, thieves, and hypocrites,' he wrote on January 17, 2022. The excerpts capture the loneliness of imprisonment, but also a touch of humor. For instance, on July 1, 2022, Navalny outlined his typical day: wake up at 6 a.m., breakfast at 6:20 a.m. and start work at 6:40 a.m. 'At work, you sit for seven hours at the sewing machine on a stool below knee height,' he wrote. 'After work, you continue to sit for a few hours on a wooden bench under a portrait of Putin. This is called 'disciplinary activity.'' The book, entitled Patriot, will be released by U.S. publisher Knopf, which is also planning a Russian version. 'It's impossible to read Navalny's prison diary without being outraged by the tragedy of his suffering, and by his death,' wrote New Yorker editor David Remnick. In the last excerpt published in the magazine, dated January 17, 2024, Navalny responds to the question asked to him by his fellow inmates and prison guards: Why did he return to Russia? 'I don't want to give up my country or betray it. If your convictions mean something, you must be prepared to stand up for them and make sacrifices if necessary,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/alexey-navalny-wrote-he-knew-he-would-die-in-prison-in-new-memoir/7819927.html	2024-10-12T00:18:14-07:00	
Israel observes Yom Kippur amid firestorm over Lebanon strikes	Jerusalem — Israel observed Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, on Saturday amid a firestorm of international criticism over its military offensive in Lebanon and its soldiers firing on peacekeepers. As the holy day got under way Friday from sundown, Israel faced diplomatic backlash over what it acknowledged was a 'hit' earlier in the day on a United Nations peacekeeping position in Lebanon. Two Sri Lankan peacekeepers were hurt in the second such incident in two days, the UNIFIL mission said Friday. The military said Israeli soldiers had responded with fire to 'an immediate threat' around 50 meters from the UNIFIL post. As Israel faced a chorus of condemnation from UN chief Antonio Guterres and Western allies, the military pledged to carry out a 'thorough review.' Lebanese militant group Hezbollah meanwhile warned Israelis to stay away from Israeli army sites in residential areas in the north of the country, alleging the military 'uses the homes' of locals and has military bases in residential neighborhoods. Hezbollah has repeatedly announced it has fired rockets at areas in northern Israel, where sirens blared in multiple locations early Saturday. 'Outrage' The UNIFIL peacekeepers have found themselves on the frontline of the Israel-Hezbollah war, which has killed more than 1,200 people in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures. The latest incident came a day after two Indonesian soldiers were hurt when, according to UNIFIL, tank fire hit a watchtower. Sean Clancy, the Irish military's chief of staff, said he did not believe Israel's explanation of Friday's incident. 'So from a military perspective, this is not an accidental act,' said Clancy, whose country has troops in UNIFIL. Guterres condemned the firing as 'intolerable' and 'a violation of international humanitarian law,' while the British government said it was 'appalled' by reports of the wounded. U.S. President Joe Biden said Friday he was 'absolutely' asking Israel to stop firing at UN peacekeepers, while the French, Spanish and Italian leaders issued a joint statement expressing 'outrage.' French President Emmanuel Macron renewed his call for an end to exports of weapons used by Israel in Gaza and Lebanon, while saying the UN peacekeepers had been 'deliberately targeted.' The incidents came more than two weeks into Israel's war with Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has seen Israeli warplanes conduct extensive strikes since September 23 on the militants' strongholds, with multiple civilian areas hit, and ground troops deployed across the border. 'Immediate cease-fire' Israeli and Hezbollah forces fought along the border on Friday, with Israeli air strikes reported in the south and east of Lebanon. It marked a tense start to Yom Kippur. From sundown on Friday until nightfall on Saturday, Israeli markets are closed, flights stopped and public transport halted as observant Jews fast and pray on the Day of Atonement. Diplomatic efforts to negotiate an end to the fighting in Lebanon and Gaza have so far failed, but Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said his government would ask the UN Security Council to issue a new resolution calling for a 'full and immediate ceasefire.' Leaders from nine European countries around the Mediterranean Sea on Friday also called for an end to fighting in Lebanon, as well as Gaza. Mikati said that only the Lebanese military and peacekeepers should be deployed in the south of the country -- the essence of existing Security Council Resolution 1701 -- and 'Hezbollah is in agreement on this issue.' U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein said the United States was working 'non-stop' towards a cease-fire. 'We want the whole conflict to end,' he told Lebanese television channel LBC from Washington. Lebanon's military said an Israeli strike on one of its positions in south Lebanon killed two of its soldiers on Friday. Hezbollah is heavily armed and controls large swathes of Lebanon, and successive Lebanese governments have failed to subdue it. The movement also fought Israeli troops during Israel's last invasion in 2006. Beirut attack In Beirut, residents of a central area of the capital targeted by twin Israeli air strikes on Thursday night salvaged their possessions and cleared rubble from the devastated streets. 'There are a lot of families living here,' said Bilal Othman, who explained that many people had sought shelter there from southern Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold, which has been pummeled by Israeli raids since last month. 'Do they want to tell us there is no safe place left in this country?' he said. The Israeli strikes apparently targeted Hezbollah's security chief Wafiq Safa, a source close to Hezbollah told AFP. Lebanon's health ministry said the strikes killed 22 people and wounded more than 100. Safa was close to Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike on south Beirut last month. Children in Gaza Hezbollah began firing on Israel in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas, following the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures, which includes hostages killed in captivity. Israel's military campaign has wrought devastation on Gaza and, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, killed 42,126 people, mostly civilians. Late Friday, Gaza's civil defense agency reported 30 people killed in Israeli strikes on Jabalia, north Gaza. An AFP journalist in Gaza reported heavy artillery shelling, explosions and gunfire Saturday further south in Gaza City's Zeitoun neighborhood. The co-head of a Japanese atomic bomb survivors' group awarded the Nobel Peace Prize said the situation for children in Gaza reminded him of the plight of survivors after World War II. 'It's like in Japan 80 years ago,' Toshiyuki Mimaki said in Tokyo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-observes-yom-kippur-amid-firestorm-over-lebanon-strikes/7819922.html	2024-10-12T00:02:21-07:00	
Florida residents slog through aftermath of Hurricane Milton	LITHIA, Florida — Florida residents slogged through flooded streets, gathered up scattered debris and assessed damage to their homes on Friday after Hurricane Milton smashed through coastal communities and spawned a barrage of deadly tornadoes. At least 10 people were dead, and rescuers were still saving people from swollen rivers, but many expressed relief that Milton wasn't worse. The hurricane spared densely populated Tampa a direct hit, and the lethal storm surge that scientists feared never materialized. Gov. Ron DeSantis warned people to not let down their guard, however, citing ongoing safety threats including downed power lines and standing water that could hide dangerous objects. 'We're now in the period where you have fatalities that are preventable,' DeSantis said. 'You have to make the proper decisions and know that there are hazards out there.' As of Friday night, the number of customers in Florida still without power had dropped to 1.9 million, according to poweroutage.us. St. Petersburg's 260,000 residents were told to boil water before drinking, cooking or brushing their teeth, until at least Monday. Also Friday, the owner of a major phosphate mine disclosed that pollution spilled into Tampa Bay during the hurricane. The Mosaic Company said in a statement that heavy rains from the storm overwhelmed a collection system at its Riverview site, pushing excess water out of a manhole and into discharges that lead to the bay. The company said the leak was fixed Thursday. Mosaic said the spill likely exceeded a 66,245-liter minimum reporting standard, though it did not provide a figure for what the total volume might have been. Calls and emails to Mosaic seeking additional information about Riverview and the company's other Florida mines received no response, as did a voicemail left with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The state has 25 such stacks containing more than 1 billion tons of phosphogypsum, a solid waste byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer mining industry that contains radium, which decays to form radon gas. Both radium and radon are radioactive and can cause cancer. Phosphogypsum may also contain toxic heavy metals and other carcinogens, such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and nickel. Florida's vital tourism industry has started to return to normal, meanwhile, as Walt Disney World and other theme parks reopened. The state's busiest airport, in Orlando, resumed full operations Friday. Arriving just two weeks after the devastating Hurricane Helene, Milton flooded barrier islands, tore the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays ' baseball stadium and toppled a construction crane. Crews from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office on Friday were assisting with rescues of people, including a 92-year-old woman, who were stranded in rising waters along the Alafia River. The river is 40 kilometers long and runs from eastern Hillsborough County, east of Tampa, into Tampa Bay. In Pinellas County, deputies used high-water vehicles to shuttle people back and forth to their homes in a flooded Palm Harbor neighborhood where waters continued to rise. Ashley Cabrera left with her 18- and 11-year-old sons and their three dogs, Eeyore, Poe and Molly. It was the first time since Milton struck that they had been able to leave the neighborhood, and they were now headed to a hotel in Orlando. 'I'm extremely thankful that we could get out now and go for the weekend somewhere we can get a hot meal and some gas,' Cabrera said. 'I thought we'd be able to get out as soon as the storm was over. These roads have never flooded like this in all the years that I've lived here.' Animals were being saved, too. Cindy Evers helped rescue a large pig stuck in high water at a strip mall in Lithia, east of Tampa. She had already rescued a donkey and several goats after the storm. 'I'm high and dry where I'm at, and I have a barn and 9 acres (3.6 hectares),' Evers said, adding that she will soon start to work to find the animals' owners. In the Gulf Coast city of Venice, Milton left behind dozens of centimeters of sand in some beachfront condos, with one unit nearly filled. A swimming pool was packed full of sand, with only its handrails poking out. Some warnings were heeded and lessons learned. When 2.4 meters of seawater flooded Punta Gorda during Hurricane Helene last month, 121 people had to be rescued, Mayor Lynne Matthews said. Milton brought at least 1.5 meters of flooding, but rescuers only had to save three people. 'So people listened to the evacuation order,' Matthews said. Heaps of fruit were scattered across the ground and trees toppled over after both Milton and Hurricane Helene swept through Polk County and other orange-growing regions, Matt Joyner of trade group Florida Citrus Mutual said Friday. Milton arrived at the start of the orange growing season, so it is still too early to evaluate the full scope of the damage. Florida has already seen orange production diminish over the years, with the industry still recovering from hurricanes of years past while also waging an ongoing battle against a deadly greening disease. Milton could be the knockout punch for some growers, Joyce said. In the western coastal city of Clearwater, Kelvin Glenn said it took less than an hour early Thursday for water to rise to his waist inside his apartment. He and seven children, ranging in age from 3 to 16, were trapped in the brown, foul floodwaters for about three hours before an upstairs neighbor opened their home to them. Later that day, first responders arrived in boats to ferry them away from the building. 'Sitting in that cold, nasty water was kind of bad,' Glenn said. Short-term survival is now turning into long-term worries. A hotel is $160 a night. Everything inside Glenn's apartment is gone. And it can take time to get assistance. 'I ain't going to say we're homeless,' Glenn said. 'But we've got to start all over again.' The Federal Emergency Management Agency has enough money to deal with the immediate needs of people impacted by Helene and Milton but will need additional funding at some point, FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said Friday. The disaster assistance fund helps pay for the swift response to hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other disasters. Congress recently replenished the fund with $20 billion — the same amount as last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-residents-slog-through-aftermath-of-hurricane-milton/7819902.html	2024-10-11T20:56:03-07:00

Meta removes fake accounts in Moldova ahead of presidential election	STOCKHOLM — Meta Platforms said on Friday that it had removed a network of group accounts targeting Russian speakers in Moldova ahead of the country's October 20 election, for violation of the company's policy on fake accounts. Authorities in Moldova, an ex-Soviet state lying between Romania and Ukraine, said they had blocked dozens of Telegram channels and chat bots linked to a drive to pay voters to cast 'no' ballots in a referendum on European Union membership held alongside the presidential election. Pro-European President Maia Sandu is seeking a second term in the election and called the referendum on joining the 27-member bloc as the cornerstone of her policies. The fake Meta accounts posted criticism of Sandu, pro-EU politicians and close ties between Moldova and Romania, and supported pro-Russia parties in Moldova, the company said. The company said its operation centered on about a dozen fictitious, Russian-language news brands posing as independent entities with presence on multiple internet services, including Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram, as well as Telegram, OK.ru and TikTok. Meta said it removed seven Facebook accounts, 23 pages, one group and 20 accounts on Instagram for violating its 'coordinated inauthentic behavior policy.' About 4,200 accounts followed one or more of the 23 pages and about 335,000 accounts followed one or more of the Instagram accounts, Meta said. In Chisinau, the National Investigation Inspectorate said it had blocked 15 channels of the popular Telegram messaging app and 95 chat bots offering voters money. Users were told the channels 'violated local laws' on political party financing. It had traced the accounts to supporters of fugitive businessman Ilan Shor — members of the banned party bearing his name or the 'Victory' electoral bloc he had set up in its place from his base of exile in Moscow. Moldovan police said on Thursday that they searched homes of leaders linked to Shor as part of a criminal investigation into election-meddling. Police have said tens of thousands of voters were paid off via accounts in a Russian bank to derail the vote. Shor was sentenced to 15 years in jail in absentia last year in connection with the 2014 disappearance of $1 billion from Moldovan banks. He denies allegations of trying to bribe voters. Sandu accuses Moscow of trying to topple her government while Moscow has accused her of fomenting 'Russophobia.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/meta-removes-fake-accounts-in-moldova-ahead-of-presidential-election-/7819601.html	2024-10-11T16:45:31-07:00	
US sues Virginia over alleged violation of federal election law	washington — The U.S. Department of Justice said Friday that it had sued the state of Virginia for violating the federal prohibition on systematic efforts to remove voters within 90 days of an election. On August 7, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order requiring the commissioner of the Department of Elections to certify that the department was conducting 'daily updates to the voter list' to remove, among other groups, people who are unable to verify that they are citizens to the Department of Motor Vehicles. U.S. citizens who were identified and notified and did not affirm their citizenship within 14 days would be removed from the list of registered voters, the Justice Department said. It said this practice has led to citizens having their voter registrations canceled ahead of the November 5 election. 'By canceling voter registrations within 90 days of Election Day, Virginia places qualified voters in jeopardy of being removed from the rolls and creates the risk of confusion for the electorate,' said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke. 'Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too often disenfranchise qualified voters,' Clarke added. The department said it was seeking injunctive relief that would restore the ability of affected eligible voters to cast their votes unimpeded on Election Day and would prohibit future violations. Youngkin called the move politically motivated and an attempt to interfere in the election. 'With the support of our attorney general, we will defend these common sense steps that we are legally required to take with every resource available to us,' he said in a statement on Friday. Republicans across the U.S. have pushed against noncitizen voting, which is already illegal, ahead of the November election. Some election officials have warned that the move could penalize eligible voters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sues-virginia-over-alleged-violation-of-federal-election-law-/7819619.html	2024-10-11T16:38:16-07:00

Experts: Future of US-South Korea defense cost-sharing deal remains uncertain	washington — U.S. national security experts say it is unclear whether a new cost-sharing agreement with South Korea, hailed by the State Department as 'a significant accomplishment,' will survive if former President Donald Trump returns to the White House next year. Concluded last week and effective from 2026, the five-year Special Measures Agreement, or SMA, requires South Korea to raise its contribution to the cost of stationing of U.S. troops in the country by 8.3% to $1.47 billion in the first year. The two allies reached the agreement earlier than expected, a move widely seen as key for Seoul and Washington to clinch before the U.S. presidential election in November, in which Trump is the Republican Party candidate. The U.S. State Department hailed the agreement as a 'a significant accomplishment for both sides' in a statement released on October 4. But Trump, both in office and as a candidate, has consistently demanded that South Korea contribute significantly more to the cost of supporting U.S. forces in Korea. Most recently in April, Trump told Time magazine that 'I want South Korea to treat us properly,' adding that Seoul is 'paying virtually nothing for' the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. ‘Trump factor’ John Bolton, a former White House national security adviser during the Trump administration, told VOA Korean by phone on Friday that 'it’s very likely that Trump would ask to renegotiate it.' 'I know that the administration [of President Joe Biden] here tried to rush the coming-to-an-agreement on it, so that Trump couldn’t meddle with it, but that won’t slow him down at all,' said Bolton, who also served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 2005-06. 'He never thinks his predecessors make good enough deals, and in part, it’s not just the question of economics, but he doesn’t understand collective defense alliances,' Bolton said. 'He thinks that not just with respect to the Republic of Korea, but also with NATO or Japan or whatever that we’re defending, these countries don’t pay us enough money.' The Republic of Korea is South Korea’s formal name. Bruce Klingner, the senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, pointed out the pact is 'an executive agreement,' which makes it easier for Trump to undo since it does not require approval from Congress. 'We really don’t know whether he would just see it as a done deal, or if he will seek to renegotiate it upward, where South Korea would pay much more,' Klingner said. 'If you take a step back, it’s in our strategic interest to have allies, it’s in our strategic interest to have our forces stationed overseas, because actually, they’re less costly to the United States when they’re stationed overseas than when they’re stationed domestically.' Robert Rapson, who served as charge d'affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA Korean last week that he was concerned that the agreement wouldn't pass muster with a Trump administration should the former president win a second term in November. 'Given his demands and expectations of U.S. allies with respect to security burden sharing, my strong fear is that he will seek to renegotiate today’s agreement with a much higher number in mind,' said Rapson, who was directly involved in the two sets of SMA negotiations in 2013-14 and in 2019-21. Evans Revere, who served as acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told VOA Korean on Thursday via email that he suspected there was 'considerable dissatisfaction with the recently concluded SMA agreement in the Trump camp,' knowing how strongly the former president feels about the burden-sharing issue. Revere said he could not rule out the possibility that Trump will come up with 'a demand to reopen talks on the SMA issue, and toward that end, he might make major new demands of Seoul' if he takes office again. 'It's in our interest' Other former government officials, like Klingner, believe it is too early to predict whether Trump will try to revise the cost-sharing agreement between the U.S. and South Korea. Richard Armitage, who served as deputy secretary of state during the George W. Bush administration, told VOA Korean on Wednesday on the phone, 'He might try, but let’s not get fearful about this too soon.' 'If he comes to the White House, he will have a secretary of state, defense, national security adviser, et cetera, who may have slightly different views and can help moderate Mr. Trump.' 'Seoul and Washington understand that Trump is very transactional,' Armitage said. 'But American soldiers are not Hessians. We’re not for rent. We’re in Korea because it’s in our interest.' VOA Korean contacted the Trump campaign this week and asked what Trump’s stance was on the newly reached agreement, but did not receive a reply by the time this article was published. Joeun Lee contributed to this report, which originated in VOA’s Korean Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-future-of-us-south-korea-defense-cost-sharing-deal-remains-uncertain-/7819599.html	2024-10-11T16:05:34-07:00	
US soldier sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to assist Islamic State	washington — A U.S. Army soldier was sentenced to 14 years in prison for attempting to help the Islamic State conduct a deadly ambush of U.S. troops, the Department of Justice said on Friday. Cole Bridges, also known as Cole Gonzales, 24, will undergo supervised release for 10 years following his release from prison, the department said. Bridges, who was a private first class at the time of his arrest, was charged in 2021 with giving 'military advice and guidance on how to kill fellow soldiers to individuals he thought were part of ISIS,' the department said. Bridges pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in June 2023. He joined the Army in 2019. Before joining, according to the department, he began researching and consuming online propaganda 'promoting jihadists and their violent ideology, and began to express his support for ISIS and jihad on social media.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-soldier-sentenced-to-14-years-in-prison-for-attempting-to-assist-islamic-state-/7819588.html	2024-10-11T15:45:54-07:00	
Despite tariffs, China drives toward dominating EV market all over world	washington — As China pursues tit-for-tat actions against the European Union in response to tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, Beijing's drive for global dominance in the automotive sector continues unabated. Over the past year, companies such as EV giant BYD and others have made inroads in markets from Southeast Asia to Latin America and Africa, even as they face tariffs of up to 100% in Canada and the United States, and up to 45% in the European Union. Chinese EV companies have announced plans to invest millions to build new factories in Thailand and Brazil, and they have opened showrooms in Zambia, Kenya and South Africa. And while most Chinese EV makers say they will continue to sell cars in Europe and not boost prices to offset the tariffs, analysts say it makes sense that they are equally focused, if not more so, on markets in the developing world as well. Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the EV market is like a balloon that is fully blown up. 'When countries like the U.S., the EU, Canada and others squeeze [the balloon], the air is going to go elsewhere. Well, the air right now is going to go to the developing world countries that haven't put the tariffs on Chinese cars in the first place,' Berg said. Bangkok, Brazil and Ethiopia In Thailand, companies such as Great Wall and BYD are leading the way. BYD opened a production facility in Thailand in July and its company chairman, Wang Chuanfu, said BYD has already captured 40% of the market for EVs. Earlier this year, Great Wall became the first Chinese EV company to mass-produce electric vehicles overseas through its production facilities in Thailand. In addition to Thailand, BYD has also captured a large market share in Singapore and Malaysia. According to government statistics, the EV behemoth ranked as Singapore's second-most popular car brand by sales in the first half of 2024. BYD ranked among the top 10 car brands in Malaysia when compared with all registered vehicles, following BMW and Mercedes-Benz. In Latin America, BYD plans to launch a partnership with Uber that aims to bring 100,000 Chinese-made EVs to Uber drivers globally. In addition, BYD is planning a new auto factory in eastern Brazil to come online in 2025. Both BYD and Great Wall have local R&D, production and sales centers in Brazil. John Helveston, an assistant professor in engineering management at George Washington University, said from a business perspective, it makes sense for Chinese EV companies to move to markets where there is more room for profit. 'I mean, just like we have Toyota and GM and Ford and Volkswagen … these companies like BYD very much are also global companies,' Helveston told VOA. 'They want to expand just like any other successful business.' Paul Nantulya, a China specialist at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense University in Washington, said Africa provides huge market opportunities for Chinese EV companies. That opportunity, however, comes with its challenges. As in other countries, there is still a lack of infrastructure for EVs in Africa such as charging stations. Nantulya, who attended the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), said Beijing and Africa are building long-term relationships, particularly when it comes to green energy and EV sectors. About '122 green energy projects have been implemented since the last FOCAC, so between 2021 and 2024, 122 green energy projects have been implemented across the African continent across 40 countries. So, the demand is huge, and it is steady,' he told VOA. 'Chinese state-owned enterprises that are in this sector have been making a very, very aggressive push in developing economies … you know, the uptick of that technology in Africa is extremely high,' he said. In March, China partnered with Ethiopia to announce an ambitious plan to shift toward electric mobility. The plan aims to introduce nearly half a million electric vehicles in Ethiopia over the next decade. Mutual benefits All three analysts said Beijing's penetration of global markets is boosted by the economic benefits that China offers in exchange. For example, Helveston said, many countries are willing to 'leverage market access' in exchange for improved infrastructure and technology. Chinese companies have built roads, trains, schools and hospitals in some of the poorest countries in the world, and developing countries see 'automotive trade [as] just building on top of those relationships that have already been there a while,' he said. 'It's a very transactional relationship.' CSIS's Berg said countries in Latin America 'have been really keen to court Chinese investment in technological industries like the EV industry.' He noted that Latin American countries see the EV industry as 'reliable' and 'plentiful in terms of job opportunities.' Nantulya added that Chinese technology is seen as a way to help African countries address energy challenges such as blackouts. 'When you look at it from the African perspective, [China's presence] is helping them diversify their energy grids, which is a significant issue. It's also contributing to improving their energy mix,' Nantulya said. China has taken a proactive approach by building large infrastructure projects in developing countries, whereas the United States has not yet undertaken projects of similar scale, he said. 'I think that we're looking at some pretty big shifts in, let's say, 10 years from now with what the global situation might be. … A lot of these countries might be much more comfortable working with China than the U.S.,' Helveston said. Washington, however, is not sitting back. At the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in 2022, the United States committed to $55 billion in pledges over three years that included investments in renewable energy infrastructure, clean energy and efforts to mitigate climate change. Berg said geopolitics also is a motivating factor in Beijing's push into developing countries in South America. 'They are in their geopolitical competition with [the United States], engaging in reciprocity ... showing that they can be extremely active in some ways and especially in the economic domain in our neighborhood,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/despite-tariffs-china-drives-toward-dominating-ev-market-all-over-world/7819564.html	2024-10-11T15:42:30-07:00	
Boeing lawyers argue for settlement opposed by relatives of those killed in 737 Max crashes	fort worth, Texas — Relatives of passengers who died in two crashes of Boeing 737 Max planes came to a federal court in Texas on Friday to listen as their lawyers asked a judge to throw out a plea agreement that the aircraft manufacturer struck with prosecutors and put the company on trial. Their lawyers argued that Boeing's punishment — mainly a fine amounting to about $244 million — would be too light for misleading regulators about a flight-control system that malfunctioned before the crashes. They accused Boeing and the Justice Department of airbrushing facts and ignoring that 346 people died in the crashes. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor asked a Boeing lawyer why he should accept the prepackaged plea deal and a sentence negotiated by a defendant. The Boeing lawyer, Ben Hatch, said Boeing 'is a pillar of the national economy and the national defense' and needs to know the punishment before it agrees to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud, a felony. Otherwise, he said, the company could be disbarred from federal contracting. 'All the employees of the company, the shareholders of the company and a global and national supply chain ... all of those are put into doubt if the sentencing' isn't known, possibly for months, Hatch said. The answer stunned and angered relatives of the victims. 'Boeing is too important for the economy — they're too big to jail. That's what he's saying,' Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya died in the second crash, said after the hearing. 'It allows them to kill people with no consequences because they're too big and because their shareholders won't like it.' The government joined Boeing in asking the judge to accept the deal that they struck in July. Sean Tonolli, senior deputy chief of the Justice Department's fraud section, said the conspiracy count is the most serious crime prosecutors can bring — they can't prove that Boeing's deception of regulators caused the crashes. And, he said, going to trial is risky. 'We are confident in our case, but we don’t take for granted that we might not win,' he said. The judge, who had received written arguments from all sides before the hearing in Fort Worth, asked questions but gave no indication if he is leaning one way or the other. He has expressed sympathy for the passengers' families before, writing in a 2023 ruling about 'Boeing’s egregious criminal conduct.' 'You have given me a lot to think about,' O'Connor said to all the lawyers as Friday's hearing ended. 'I'll get a ruling out just as soon as I can.' In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count of conspiracy to commit fraud for allegedly deceiving Federal Aviation Administration regulators who were writing pilot-training requirements for the Max. The FAA approved minimal, computer-based training for Boeing 737 pilots before they could fly the Max, the latest version of the 737. That helped Boeing by avoiding the need for training in flight simulators, which would have raised the cost for airlines to operate the Max. Airlines began flying the Max in 2017. The first crash occurred in Indonesia in October 2018, followed in March 2019 by the second, in Ethiopia. The plea agreement calls for Boeing to pay a fine of up to $487.2 million, but the fine would be cut in half by giving the company credit for $243.6 million it paid as part of a $2.5 billion settlement in 2021 to avoid prosecution. The Justice Department decided in May that Boeing violated terms of that settlement, leading to the new plea deal. Boeing, which is based in Arlington, Virginia, would also invest $455 million in compliance and safety programs, and be placed on probation for three years. The case is among a host of issues with which the manufacturer most contend. Talks broke down this week with striking factory workers who assemble some of the company’s best-selling planes. The company withdrew its offer and S&P Global Ratings put it on its credit watch list, citing increased financial risk because of the labor unrest. On Thursday, the company filed a complaint over what it calls unfair labor practices against the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Boeing in its complaint with the National Labor Relations Board said that the union’s public narrative is misleading and has made it difficult to reach a resolution.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7819575.html	2024-10-11T15:04:49-07:00	
UK government is urged to raise pro-democracy tycoon's case with China	london — The U.K. government was urged Friday to raise the case of jailed pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai with China, after reports that David Lammy, the foreign minister, is heading to Beijing. Lai, 76, is the founder of the now-shuttered popular Chinese-language tabloid Apple Daily, which supported mass pro-democracy protests in the economic hub. Detained in 2020, he is awaiting trial on charges including colluding with foreign forces and sedition. In London, his legal team said they hoped Lammy would put Lai's case 'front and center' during his visit, which has not been confirmed by his department. Lawyer Caoilfhionn Gallagher told reporters it had been 'made crystal clear to the U.K.' government that if it is looking to reset relations with China, it needed to use the case 'as leverage to ensure that Jimmy Lai is released.' At a Reporters Without Borders (RSF) event in London, Lai's son Sebastien said his father, who holds British citizenship, was in deteriorating health after being in prolonged solitary confinement for nearly four years. 'His health could get much worse at any time,' he added. Lai's delayed trial began in December 2023, and he is due to testify for the first time on November 20. 'The [U.K.] government does need to stand behind him - much stronger than they even have before,' said Sebastien Lai. Give priority to it Both the legal team and Sebastien have met U.K. foreign ministry officials, but Gallagher said they were disappointed that neither Lammy nor British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had yet met Lai's son. 'If this is a top-priority case for the U.K. government, why is Sebastien not being met by the foreign secretary directly?' asked Gallagher. 'Why is Sebastien not being met by the prime minister directly?' Gallagher works for the law firm Doughty Street Chambers, where Starmer made his name as a human rights lawyer before entering politics. The U.K. Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) in response said Lammy had raised Lai's case when he met his Chinese counterpart in July. 'British national Jimmy Lai's case is a priority for the U.K. government,' an FCDO spokesperson added. 'We continue to call on the Hong Kong authorities to end their politically motivated prosecution and immediately release Jimmy Lai.' Lai denies the charges, which were brought under sweeping national security laws meant to quell dissent in the former British colony, which was returned to China in 1997. If convicted, he could face life imprisonment. Six other senior Apple Daily staff members are also in prison. Britain has been critical of China's crackdown on press freedom and protests in Hong Kong, which has strained diplomatic ties. RSF head of campaigns Rebecca Vincent said no one from the organization would be able to attend Lai's trial. A staff member was detained and deported while trying to enter Hong Kong to monitor the trial previously.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-government-is-urged-to-raise-pro-democracy-tycoon-s-case-with-china-/7819577.html	2024-10-11T15:00:08-07:00	
Sky-gazers treated to another aurora show	paris — Scientist Jim Wild has traveled to the Arctic Circle numerous times to study the northern lights, but Thursday night he needed only to look out of his bedroom window in Lancaster, England. For at least the second time this year, sky-gazers in many parts of the world were treated to colorful auroras at latitudes beyond the polar extremes where they normally light up the skies. The dazzling celestial shows were caused by a gigantic ball of plasma — and an accompanying magnetic field — that erupted from the sun earlier this week. When this eruption, called a coronal mass ejection (CME), arrived at Earth about 1600 GMT on Thursday, it triggered a strong geomagnetic storm. This storm in turn sparked northern and southern lights — aurora borealis and aurora australis — in swaths of Europe, the United States, Australia and elsewhere. While Wild could see the shimmering reds and greens from his back garden, he jumped in the car with his family to get a better look away from the bright lights of Lancaster. 'All the little backroads and parking spots were full of people with flasks of coffee and deck chairs looking at the northern lights,' he told AFP. 'It was a party atmosphere,' he said, comparing the scenes to UFO spotters looking up at the sky in the movie 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.' While Wild was explaining the phenomenon to his 11- and 13-year-old children, another nearby sky-gazer approached and asked how come he knew so much about it. 'Well, actually, this is what I study for a living,' responded the professor in space physics at Lancaster University, who specializes in how solar weather disrupts power grids and transport here on Earth. Perfect hit Auroras were also visible across northern Europe, including near London and Berlin, and as far south in the U.S. as the state of Georgia. In the Southern Hemisphere, areas of Australia and New Zealand were also treated to a show, AFP photos showed. The CME that triggered Thursday's auroras erupted from a spot on the sun pointed directly at Earth, said Juha-Pekka Luntama, the head of the European Space Agency's Space Weather Office. 'It was a perfect hit,' he told AFP. The CME caused a 'severe' geomagnetic storm given a rating of G4. This fell narrowly short of the highest level of G5, which was seen in May, when auroras delighted many sky-gazers across swaths of the world. Storms on the sun have been intensifying as solar activity approaches — or may have already reached — the peak of its 11-year cycle. While such storms offer pretty light shows for sky-gazers, they can pose a serious threat to satellites, GPS services, power grids and even astronauts in space. The U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center warned Thursday that the geomagnetic storm could disrupt emergency services already stretched thin by two deadly hurricanes, Helene and Milton. Luntama said the European Space Agency had not received any information about disruptions caused by the latest storm, but sometimes this can take days. The storm is 'gradually dissipating,' he added, which means that any auroras seen Friday night or over the weekend will likely be farther north in Europe, such as central Sweden. Delighted But for those still hoping to see an aurora, there could be some more chances in the next couple of years. Luntama explained that during past solar cycles, the biggest eruptions have come in the two years after the sun passed its peak. Wild also did not expect a repeat of Thursday's 'magical' display. But space weather — like Earth's weather — is not an 'exact art,' he emphasized. And if there is an aurora lighting up the sky nearby, it is worth seeking out. Wild said his neighbors had traveled to Norway twice to see the northern lights, but had been foiled by clouds both times. Then, Thursday night, they saw an aurora from their garden. 'They were really delighted to finally have seen it,' Wild said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sky-gazers-treated-to-another-aurora-show-/7819567.html	2024-10-11T14:47:49-07:00	
Exclusive: Hezbollah running out of money amid Israeli bombardment	WASHINGTON — Lebanese militia Hezbollah is running out of money, researchers tell VOA, as a weekslong Israeli offensive against the Iran-backed group disrupts three of its key sources of cash. U.S. and Lebanon-based researchers and U.S. Treasury Department reports identify Hezbollah’s main cash source as Al-Qard al-Hasan, or AQAH, a Lebanese quasi-banking institution operated by the U.S.-designated terror group without a government banking license. The researchers say the group’s other cash sources include Lebanon’s insolvent but licensed commercial banks and arrivals of cash-bearing planes at Beirut’s airport. The Israeli military escalated its attacks on Hezbollah leaders and facilities last month, after 11 months of limiting its responses to the militia’s daily attacks on northern Israel in support of Hamas. The Palestinian terror group, also backed by Iran, invaded southern Israel from Gaza last October, sparking a fierce Israeli response. Hezbollah founded AQAH in 1982 as a charitable institution providing interest-free loans to needy Lebanese, primarily fellow Shiites, according to Israel's Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, or ITIC, a nongovernmental research group of Israeli intelligence community veterans. ITIC says AQAH has since grown into a major institution with branches in Hezbollah’s southern Beirut stronghold of Dahiyeh and other Hezbollah-dominated parts of Lebanon. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned AQAH in 2007. In a 2021 announcement of further sanctions on AQAH employees, it said the institution had amassed about half a billion dollars. AQAH was hit hard by Israel’s initial airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Dahiyeh in late September, according to MTV Lebanon, one of the country’s leading TV networks. In a September 30 Arabic-language report, MTV Lebanon said the Israeli airstrikes had targeted Hezbollah’s 'cash storage centers, including a large part of the AQAH vaults,' leaving the group in what it called a 'financial crisis.' Hilal Khashan, a political science professor at the American University of Beirut, said in a Wednesday phone interview that Israel 'destroyed' most of AQAH’s branches in the airstrikes. 'Hezbollah is facing a very serious financial problem. They are unable to pay rank and file members who have fled their homes and need to feed their families,' Khashan said. The Treasury Department’s 2021 announcement of sanctions against six AQAH employees said they had used personal accounts at licensed Lebanese banks to transfer more than $500 million to and from AQAH over the previous decade. It said that activity gave AQAH access to the international financial system through the employees’ personal accounts at the Lebanese banks. David Asher, a former U.S. Defense and State Department official who targeted Hezbollah’s global drug trafficking and money laundering networks, said in a separate interview Wednesday that the group is in 'deep trouble' because it also is losing access to the Lebanese banking system. 'I’m hearing from Lebanese bankers, including Hezbollah financiers, that Lebanon’s wealthiest bankers who can afford to fly have fled to Europe and the Gulf, fearing they could be targeted next by Israel for helping Hezbollah,' said Asher, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Hudson Institute. Asher said he is in contact with Lebanon-based sources whom the U.S. recruited over the years to provide information about Hezbollah. 'These Lebanese bankers, most of them billionaires, see the wind is blowing against Hezbollah, so they are not going to let it take millions of dollars out of their banks, which still have cash despite being bankrupt on paper,' Asher said. 'They know that if they do, Israel probably will eliminate them, too.' Another Hezbollah funding source that has dried up, according to Asher and Khashan, is deliveries of cash on planes flying to Beirut’s airport, particularly from Iran, the group’s main patron. Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari told reporters on September 27 that Israeli warplanes had begun patrolling the airspace of Beirut’s airport and would not allow hostile flights carrying weapons to land at a civilian facility. He did not mention the issue of cash being transported aboard what Israel deems to be hostile flights. The next day, Lebanon’s Transport Ministry told Lebanese and Western media that it ordered an Iranian plane bound for Beirut to turn away from Lebanese airspace. The ministry attributed the move to an Israeli warning to Beirut’s air traffic control tower that Israel would use force if the plane landed there. 'I’ve heard from my Israeli counterparts that the Iranians are scared to send money to Lebanon right now because Israel is threatening to target flights into Beirut. The Israelis are warning they will target flights full of money, not just weapons,' Asher said. Khashan said Iran used to organize regular flights from Tehran to Beirut to smuggle cash to Hezbollah without going through the Lebanese government's customs department. 'In the weeks since Israel escalated its attacks on Beirut’s southern suburbs, the Lebanese government has asserted more control over the airport, and now there is no cash flow to Hezbollah,' Khashan said. Lebanese Minister of Public Works and Transport Ali Hamieh told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday that the Beirut airport 'is subject to Lebanese laws and to the scrutiny of various relevant departments and security agencies.' Hamieh added that any plane carrying weapons must be approved by the Lebanese army and be licensed by his ministry. Saudi TV network Al Arabiya in a Thursday report cited a Lebanese army source saying the army and other security agencies have been 'scrambling' to assert control over the airport by starting inspections of cargo shipments to ensure their contents are as declared. Khashan said Hezbollah’s lack of cash is unlikely to stop its thousands of operatives from fighting Israeli forces anytime soon. 'Keeping up the fight depends more on the availability of food and ammunition,' he said. 'When your fight is motivated by religious zeal, you have more fundamental issues to worry about than the availability of cash.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/exclusive-hezbollah-running-out-of-money-amid-israeli-bombardment/7819533.html	2024-10-11T14:30:34-07:00	
US expands sanctions against Iran's oil industry after attack on Israel	washington — The United States hit Iran's oil and petrochemicals sectors with fresh sanctions Friday in response to Tehran's October 1 attack against Israel, designating dozens of new companies and firms. In a statement Friday, the Treasury Department said it was going after Iran's so-called 'shadow fleet' of ships involved in selling Iranian oil in circumvention of existing sanctions, designating 10 companies and 17 vessels as 'blocked property' over their involvement in 'shipments of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products.' The State Department announced it was sanctioning an additional six firms and six ships for 'knowingly engaging in a significant transaction for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran.' The sanctions form part of the U.S. response to Iran's attack, in which it launched some 200 ballistic missiles against Israel in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed militant leaders and a general from Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Israel has said its response to Iran's second direct attack against its territory this year would be 'deadly, precise, and surprising.' U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters last week that Israel should consider 'other alternatives than striking oil fields,' amid reports it was planning to do so. 'In response to Iran's attack on Israel, the United States is taking decisive action to further disrupt the Iranian regime's ability to fund and carry out its destabilizing activity,' Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. 'Today's sanctions target Iranian efforts to channel revenues from its energy industry to finance deadly and disruptive activity — including development of its nuclear program, the proliferation of ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles,' she added. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had made clear after the October 1 attack that Tehran would face consequences. 'To that end, we are taking steps today to disrupt the flow of revenue the Iranian regime uses to fund its nuclear program and missile development, support terrorist proxies and partners, and perpetuate conflict throughout the Middle East,' he said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-expands-sanctions-against-iran-s-oil-industry-after-attack-on-israel/7819539.html	2024-10-11T14:28:32-07:00	
Iran says it has recovered body of general killed alongside Nasrallah	Tehran, Iran — Iran said Friday that it had recovered the body of a Revolutionary Guard general killed alongside Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli strike last month in Beirut. 'With hard work and efforts around the clock, the body of martyr Abbas Nilforushan has been discovered,' the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement. 'The time of transferring the body of martyr Nilforushan to the Islamic homeland and the funeral and burial plans will be announced later,' the statement said. Nilforushan, a top commander of the Quds Force, the IRGC's foreign operations arm, was killed September 27 alongside Nasrallah. On October 1, the Revolutionary Guards fired 200 missiles at Israel in retaliation for the killing of the general, as well as Nasrallah and Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas who was assassinated in Tehran in late July. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant vowed this week that his country's response would be 'deadly, precise and surprising.' Iran has promised to respond if it is targeted by arch-enemy Israel. In an address to the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, Iran's permanent representative to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, said the Islamic Republic 'stands fully prepared to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression targeting its vital interests and security.' Iran, he said, was not seeking 'war or escalation' but would exercise its 'inherent right to self-defense fully in line with international law and will notify the Security Council of its legitimate response.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-it-has-recovered-body-of-general-killed-alongside-nasrallah-/7819547.html	2024-10-11T14:18:53-07:00	
Russian, Iranian presidents meet as concerns grow over Middle East attacks	ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan — Russian President Vladimir Putin met Iran’s president Friday, at a time when Tehran is supplying weapons for Moscow’s war in Ukraine and concerns are growing over escalating attacks between Israel and Iran and its militant allies. Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian discussed the situation in the Middle East on the sidelines of an international forum in the Turkmen capital, Ashgabat, Russian state media said. Moscow and Tehran signed a $1.7 billion deal for Iran to export drones to Russia after Putin invaded Ukraine in 2022, and the U.S. also believes it has transferred short-range ballistic missiles. Both countries were accused this week by Ken McCallum, the head of Britain’s domestic intelligence agency MI5, of carrying out a 'staggering' rise in attempts at assassination, sabotage and other crimes on U.K. soil. McCallum said his agents and police have tackled 20 'potentially lethal' plots backed by Iran since 2022 and warned that it could expand its targets in the U.K. if conflicts in the Middle East deepen. During the two presidents' meeting, Putin told Pezeshkian that Moscow and Tehran's positions on international events are often very close, according to Russian state news agency Tass. He also invited the Iranian leader to visit Russia and Pezeshkian accepted, Tass said. 'We have many opportunities now, and we must help each other in our relationships. Our principles, our positions in the international arena are similar to yours,' Pezeshkian said at the start of his meeting with Putin. Pezeshkian said that Israel's 'savage attacks,' on Lebanon are 'beyond description.' The Israeli military sent ground troops into southern Lebanon and is carrying out airstrikes in the country against Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters. Speaking Friday as the forum opened, Putin said he wants to create a 'new world order' of Moscow’s allies to counter the West, according to video provided by the Kremlin. The conference is being attended by other regional leaders including Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and the heads of the other Central Asian nations, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Putin is also expected to hold talks with Turkmen President Serdar Berdymukhamedov. Berdymukhamedov was elected in March 2022 to succeed his father, Gurbanguly, who had run the gas-rich country since 2006. Turkmenistan has remained largely isolated under autocratic rulers since it became independent following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-iranian-presidents-meet-as-concerns-grow-over-middle-east-attacks-/7819540.html	2024-10-11T14:12:11-07:00	
Report focuses attention on Serbia's spread of Russian propaganda	washington — A media watchdog group's report is prompting renewed scrutiny of the role Serbia is playing in the dissemination of Russian propaganda in the Balkans, particularly as it concerns Moscow's war on Ukraine. 'Thanks to the Serbian government's grip on the media and favorable political environment, RT — formerly Russia Today — uses its Belgrade office to adapt the Kremlin's narratives before disseminating them across southeastern Europe,' said the report from Reporters Without Borders (RSF), which was updated early this week. The Paris-based watchdog group added that it 'calls on the European Union (EU) and its member states to hold Serbia accountable for hosting [Russian President] Vladimir Putin's factory of lies.' The EU's response was not long in coming. On Tuesday, EU spokesperson for external affairs Peter Stano called on Serbia to take urgent measures to counter Russian media manipulation and interference. 'The European Union has adopted sanctions against Russian state-owned media, including RT,' Stano told Agence France-Presse, adding that those outlets have become an instrument of Russia's war against Ukraine and 'a channel for the dissemination and manipulation of information.' A day earlier, Pavol Szalai, head of the Europe and Balkans desk at RSF, told AFP that the Serbian government was allowing the country, an EU candidate nation, to be used as 'an amplifier and translator of Kremlin propaganda in the Balkans.' In a post on X, Arno Guyon, who heads the Serbian government's Office for Public and Cultural Diplomacy, responded to the comments by the EU's Stano and RSF's Szalai, calling them 'very worrying.' 'It reminds of the period of communism during which censorship was applied in Yugoslavia in the name of fighting against 'harmful or undesirable ideas.' It contradicts the values of pluralism, tolerance and freedom of speech, which the Serbs believe in and for which numerous Serbian intellectuals who were imprisoned and killed because of it fought.' Asked by VOA's Serbian Service about the accusations concerning the Serbian government's alleged role in disseminating Russian disinformation, the U.S. State Department responded: 'Media manipulation and interference poses significant risks to democratic processes and societal stability in Serbia and the Western Balkans. The Department of State's Global Engagement Center previously warned that the Kremlin's state-funded and state-directed media outlets RT and Sputnik are critical elements in Russia's disinformation and propaganda ecosystem.' The State Department added that it would continue its cooperation with Serbian partners in responding to RT's activities. In September, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration announced new measures to thwart the activities of the Russian state-funded and -directed media company Rossiya Segodnya, and five of its subsidiaries, including RT. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said those Russian state media entities 'are no longer merely firehoses of Russian Government propaganda and disinformation,' but are engaged in 'covert influence activities aimed at undermining American elections and democracies, functioning like a de facto arm of Russia's intelligence apparatus.' 'Thanks to new information — much of which originates from RT employees — we know that RT possess cyber capabilities and engaged in covert information and influence operations and military procurement,' Blinken said. 'As part of RT's expanded capabilities, the Russian Government embedded within RT a unit with cyber operational capabilities and ties to Russian intelligence. RT's leadership had direct, witting knowledge of this enterprise.' RT Balkan, which has existed in Serbia since 2022, publishes its content on the internet and social media. Sputnik Serbia, a subsidiary of Russia's Sputnik state news agency, arrived in the country a little earlier, in 2017. Ruslan Trad, a resident fellow for security research with the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, told VOA that the Serbian government is providing Russia with a platform for building a serious infrastructure, which also includes a media presence. 'Russian propaganda media use Serbia to establish a presence in the wider region,' he said. 'They use different methods, such as advertising platforms on Google that users have confidence in, in order to redirect them to the contents of 'Russia Today' or other Russian or pro-Russian media in the Serbian language.' Trad believes that the Serbian authorities will ignore the criticism expressed by the European Union and non-governmental organizations. 'Belgrade 's position is clear. The European Union, which has economic interests in Serbia related to lithium, will do little more than comment,' he said. '[Serbian President Aleksandar] Vucic doesn't see it as a problem, so things will continue to work in the same way.' Still, Trad said the Serbian government's relationships with Russia and the West are provisional, not set in stone. 'It is obvious that Belgrade enables all this out of interest, and not because it is pressed against the wall,' he said. 'Unlike other countries in the region, Serbia sees the Russian Federation as an ally, but not as a partner at any cost. It is no coincidence that Belgrade also has ties with China, the U.S. and European countries such as France.' He added: 'However, if it wants to become a part of the European family, Belgrade will have to implement the rule of law and improve the situation in the media environment.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-focuses-attention-on-serbia-s-spread-of-russian-propaganda/7819500.html	2024-10-11T13:55:25-07:00	
EU condemns China for human rights violations against Uyghurs	London — The European Parliament overwhelmingly passed an emergency resolution Thursday condemning the Chinese government's persecution of Uyghurs and urging China to immediately and unconditionally release detainees, including Uyghur economist Ilham Tohti and Gulshan Abbas. The resolution is fueled by widespread concern from the international community and highlights its continued concern about the human rights situation in Xinjiang. The resolution, which was adopted by a vote of 540 in favor, 23 against and 47 abstentions, strongly condemns China's 'repression and targeting of Uyghurs with abusive policies, including intense surveillance, forced labor, sterilization, birth prevention measures and the destruction of Uyghur identity, which amount to crimes against humanity and a serious risk of genocide.' The European Parliament's resolution pays attention to the cases of two high-profile Uyghurs. Ilham Tohti, a 54-year-old economist, was sentenced to life in prison in 2014 on charges of 'separatism.' Tohti has long worked to promote dialogue between Uyghurs and the Han Chinese and is considered a moderate intellectual. In 2019, the European Parliament awarded him the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought for his efforts to uphold human rights. Gulshan Abbas, a 62-year-old retired doctor, was detained in 2018 and sentenced to 20 years in prison on terrorism-related charges. Abbas's sister, Rushan Abbas, is a Uyghur human rights activist in the United States. Ziba Murat, daughter of Gulshan Abbas, told the nonprofit group International Services for Human Rights, 'My mother was a medical professional who dedicated her life to helping others and saving lives. She is a non-politicized, warm-hearted and loving mother. The accusations against her are absurd and baseless. My mother is suffering only because her family in the United States has spoken out against the Chinese government's unfair treatment of Uyghurs. This is an obvious example of kinship punishment and transnational repression.' Rushan Abbas told VOA, 'The adoption of this resolution by the European Parliament signifies more than symbolic recognition; it is a decisive step toward accountability and justice for the countless Uyghur lives devastated by China’s oppressive policies, including my sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas and Ilham Tohti. It is imperative that EU member states not only recognize their moral duty but also seize this political moment to implement sanctions that reinforce this resolution. Our collective demand for justice and the protection of human rights must manifest in substantive measures.' Rahima Mahmut, executive director of the group Stop Uyghur Genocide, told VOA, 'I welcome this decision that is so important. In my opinion, especially for Ilham Tohti’s 10th anniversary this year, and then along with so many thousands of intellectuals, linguistics, artists, scholars, religious leaders and many, many imprisoned unlawfully, serving long-term prison sentences. They are all innocent people, never committed any crime in any standard, even under the Chinese constitution.' Raphaël Viana David, program manager of International Service for Human Rights, told VOA, 'There is indisputable evidence that when governments and U.N. experts press Beijing publicly, in a coordinated and sustained fashion, the wall will eventually crack. It is now the moment for global actors to step up pressure in calling out acts of transnational repression by Beijing, and to call for the release of Dr. Abbas.' Mahmut said, 'I believe the EU and countries, especially democratic countries like the U.K., should impose sanctions against China for illegally detaining millions of people, putting people on forced labor. This is not a new thing anymore. It's not news anymore. 'There are so many other things that the EU and the U.K. government can do to really show their support to the Uyghurs and the Tibetans and the Hong Kongers. We are suffering under this regime for too long,' she added. Michael Polak, an international criminal lawyer from London's Church Court Chambers who is involved in a universal jurisdiction case concerning Uyghurs in Argentina, said, 'Five hundred and forty out of 610 members of the European Parliament voted to recognize the repression of the Uyghur people and particularly the continued detention of well-known individual Uyghur leaders.' He emphasized the legal implications of the vote and said, 'This is the biggest Parliament in the world, as far as I'm concerned, to recognize what's happening to the Uyghur people, which are crimes against humanity and genocide.' David said, 'In the last June session of the Human Rights Council, the high commissioner [the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights] also called out a ‘pattern emerging of transnational repression’ in Southeast Asia ‘whereby human rights defenders seeking refuge in neighboring countries have been subject to rendition and refoulement or disappeared and even killed,’ making implicit reference to the unlawful refoulement of lawyer Lu Siwei from Laos to China. Just today, we received reports that Lu Siwei has been arrested: Governments have to firmly condemn this and urge his release.' Rushan Abbas said, 'I urge each EU member state to not only support this resolution but to actively enforce sanctions against Chinese officials and entities directly responsible for the detention and persecution of Uyghurs. ... It is crucial that these sanctions are robust and targeted towards CCP [Chinese Communist Party] officials that aid and abet human rights abuses. 'EU member states should enforce strict compliance with the new EU forced labor regulations. Companies operating within their borders must be transparent about their supply chains and ensure they are not complicit in the exploitation of the Uyghur people,' she added. The human rights situation in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has been the focus of international attention in recent years. Several Western countries and human rights groups have accused China of setting up 're-education camps' in Xinjiang and mass detaining Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities. Human Rights Watch reports that hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs may have been held in so-called 're-education camps' since 2017. Analysis of satellite imagery from the Australia Strategic Policy Institute shows many suspected detention facilities in Xinjiang. However, the Chinese government firmly denies those allegations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson has repeatedly said that Xinjiang's measures are aimed at combating terrorism and extremism and ensuring regional security and development. The Chinese government has not yet officially responded to the European Parliament’s decision. The Chinese Mission to the European Union did not respond to VOA’s request for comment.

Undersea cables emerge as source of friction in South China Sea	WASHINGTON — A new source of tension in the South China Sea — until now focused on fisheries, resource extraction and freedom of navigation — is beginning to get attention: the undersea fiber-optic cables that crisscross the strategic waterway and carry almost all of the region's internet and other telecommunications traffic. Since 2020, according to published reports, the United States has been urging countries in the region to avoid using a Chinese company to repair or lay new cables at the bottom of the sea out of concern that China could intercept and monitor sensitive communications passing through the cables. It has also been urging companies to route new cables around the perimeter of the sea, avoiding the central part of the waterway claimed by China based on historic maps showing a 10-dash line that infringes on the exclusive economic zones of several other countries. In what may be an act of retaliation, according to a Washington Post report this month, China has been delaying — sometimes for months — its approval of permits for companies to repair or lay new cables under the sea. The delays have been particularly troublesome for countries such as Vietnam, which is anxious to replace five aging cables that have failed repeatedly, slowing internet traffic in the country. In the past four years, the U.S. government has blocked at least three cable projects that would have linked the United States to Hong Kong because of concerns that China could spy on or sabotage communications, the Post reported. Concerns were also raised at last month's U.N. General Assembly meetings, where the U.S. and other countries, including Australia, France, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and the U.K., issued a joint statement calling for undersea cables to be kept secure from risks that included surveillance, intentional damage and compromise of data and communications. 'There is a risk of surveillance and snooping in by the Chinese telecom companies, and similar kind of surveillance risk exists also for undersea cables,' said Sameer Patil, director of the Center for Security Strategy and Technology at the Observer Foundation. The kind of data that the Chinese military could gather in real time through undersea cables includes information about U.S. military personnel, the movement of U.S. naval warships and other military assets, Patil told VOA. Although the U.S. and some other countries have undersea cables that are exclusive for military use, countries in the Indo-Pacific do not have the financial means to maintain dual sets of cables, said Patil, who is based in New Delhi and has been closely following the issue. This means these countries may transmit sensitive military data and civilian data over the same sets of cables, he said. At the center of the concerns is China's HMN Technologies, the latest entrant into the specialized field of cable laying that previously was dominated by just three companies: U.S.-based SubCom, French firm Alcatel Submarine Networks and Japan's Nippon Electric Company. HMN Technologies was once owned by Huawei and is still considered by the U.S. to be an affiliate of the Chinese tech giant, whose equipment has been banned in the United States and other countries over fears that it can be used to facilitate Chinese espionage. Reuters news agency reported exclusively last month that the United States is pressing Vietnam to avoid using HMN Technologies in its plans to build 10 new undersea cables by 2030. It said U.S. officials and companies have held at least a half-dozen meetings with Vietnamese and foreign officials and business executives on the matter this year. Reuters also quoted multiple sources saying U.S. officials have separately shared intelligence about possible sabotage of Vietnam's subsea cables. The Post said concerted U.S. lobbying has led to three other U.S.-financed transpacific cable projects being routed through the coastal waters of Indonesia and the Philippines to avoid Beijing-claimed waters, driving up the costs of the projects. Meanwhile, according to executives at seven cable companies cited by the Post, permits for cable work that were once approved by China in less than 10 days now are taking up to four months and are sometimes rejected with little justification. While China's claim to most of the South China Sea has been rejected by an international tribunal, the companies say they are unwilling to risk working in the area without Beijing's approval. 'What we're seeing is China essentially retaliating by delaying permits that it can grant,' said Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security. 'The U.S. government is concerned about China listening in on existing cables,' and Beijing is retaliating against the U.S. for trying to dissuade countries from using Chinese companies, Braw told VOA. Beijing rejected that interpretation in response to questions this week from VOA. 'The Chinese government has always welcomed and supported the laying of international submarine cables by other countries and telecommunications companies in waters under China's jurisdiction,' said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington. 'Over the years, China has actively promulgated relevant laws and regulations to clarify the rights and obligations of all countries to lay submarine cables in waters under China's jurisdiction' to 'provide a sound legal guarantee for the transit of international submarine cables in waters under China's jurisdiction,' he said. Erin Murphy, a senior fellow for the Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told VOA that China may have its own concerns about espionage or sabotage operations when cable-laying ships from the United States or other Western countries operate in areas it claims as being under its jurisdiction. 'There's also the economic competition angle. Preventing non-Chinese companies from operating in their perceived backyard is one way to continue to dominate the network, providing ongoing business for its companies and fulfill its digital Silk Road ambitions,' she said. Braw at the Atlantic Council said Chinese companies, while relatively new to the field, have become highly competitive with Western cable-laying companies by offering to build and repair subsea cables at cheaper costs. An estimated 400 to 600 fiber-optic cables crisscross the world's seabed with a total length of 1.4 million kilometers, according to TeleGeography, a research firm monitoring the telecommunications industry. That is enough to wrap around the earth's circumference about 35 times. These cables carry more than 95% of global data, including voice communications, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. Commerce Department.	https://www.voanews.com/a/undersea-cables-emerge-as-source-of-friction-in-south-china-sea/7819426.html	2024-10-11T12:50:51-07:00

UN warns widening Middle East conflict threatens health of millions	GENEVA — United Nations human rights officials warn the widening conflict and military escalation across the Middle East are putting 'the lives and well-being of potentially millions of people across the region at risk' and diminishing prospects for peace. 'I’m having trouble finding the right words today to just describe how terrible this situation has been for civilians' on the ground in Lebanon, Gaza, Israel and Syria, Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, told journalists at a briefing in Geneva Friday. 'This is going to have an impact that will reverberate across many generations of people in the Middle East,' she said. 'Children who have been out of school for so long, children who have had their limbs amputated, who will be living with lifelong injuries, as well as the trauma of the impunity that has marked this conflict, means that it is going to continue to feed cycles of revenge and injustice.' The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, reports more than 2,000 people have been killed and nearly 10,000 injured in fighting in Lebanon over the past year. About one-fifth of those killed were women and children. According to Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health, at least 22 people were killed and over 100 injured Thursday night when Beirut was bombed 'in the heaviest strike yet on the central part of the city.' Essential civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, clinics, ambulances, schools and housing, reportedly have been destroyed or damaged. While the Lebanese people are bearing the brunt of this latest phase of conflict, Hezbollah and other armed groups continue to fire rockets into Israel, resulting in the deaths of two people on Oct. 9, 'the first civilian fatalities in northern Israel since the most recent escalation of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon last month,' Shamdasani said. 'Amidst this escalating violence, we are appalled by sweeping inflammatory language on multiple sides,' Shamdasani said. 'Recent language threatening Lebanese people as a whole and calling on them to either rise up against Hezbollah or face destruction like Gaza' risks being understood as encouraging violence against civilians and civilian objects, 'in violation of international law,' she said. This was a reference to a threat made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a video address Wednesday. Shamdasani said that 'ongoing denigration of the U.N., in particular UNRWA, is unacceptable. This kind of toxic rhetoric, from any source, must stop.' UNRWA is the U.N. agency that supports Palestinian refugees. Gaza suffering continues Meanwhile, the suffering of the population in the Gaza Strip goes on. Gaza’s Ministry of Health reports more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, many of them women and children, and 96,600 people have been injured since Israel began its military offensive in the Palestinian enclave a year ago. The offensive was triggered by the surprise Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people; some 250 others were taken hostage. Over the last week, Israel has intensified its military operation in northern Gaza. 'We are greatly concerned about the safety of patients and the health workers amid these intensifying hostilities and the current evacuation orders covering Kamal Adwan, Al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals in northern Gaza,' said Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization’s representative to the occupied Palestinian territories, said on a video link from Jerusalem. 'We had three missions planned over the last week' to assist in the transfer of 'critical nonwalking patients from these hospitals,' he said, adding that 'none have been successful.' He said that the mission to Kamal-Adwan hospital was impeded after delays at the checkpoint, and a mission to resupply As-Sahaba hospital with fuel, blood units and medical supplies was denied October 9 and impeded on October 10. 'Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda remain partially functional but are struggling due to shortage of supplies, including blood, trauma disposables and medications for patients with noncommunicable diseases and fuel,' he said, adding that Indonesian Hospital 'is no longer able to provide services and accommodate patients.' Attacks on health care locations The World Health Organization recorded 18 attacks on health care facilities, resulting in 72 deaths and 40 injuries among health staff since Sept. 17. It reported 96 primary health care centers and health facilities were forced to close in the south due to rising hostilities. Five hospitals were reported nonfunctional 'due to physical or infrastructural damage, and four hospitals were partially evacuated, requiring the transfer of patients,' the WHO said. Amid this chaos, confusion and multiple challenges, UNICEF and WHO officials said, the second round of emergency polio vaccinations is scheduled to go ahead Monday in Gaza. The first round, held Sept. 1-12, successfully vaccinated an estimated 591,700 children against the crippling disease. As in the first round, the second round will have three phases, each involving three campaign days and one catch-up day in the central, the south and the north of the Gaza Strip. 'Local teams will be deployed in areas that need special coordination to reach children, including those who could not receive vaccines in the first round. It is critical they are reached,' Peeperkorn said. Speaking from Jerusalem, Jean Gough, UNICEF special representative, said one of the challenges facing vaccinators is the 'endless population movements.' 'Once again, it will be absolutely critical that not only the localized humanitarian pauses are respected in the north, but also that people are not forced to move from one area to the other,' she said. 'This will be essential for us to be able to vaccinate at least 90% of children under the age of 10 among the population in the north. We have reassurance from COGAT that these humanitarian pauses will take place.' She said U.N. agencies overseeing the campaign will be meeting every day with COGAT, an Israeli unit that is responsible for implementing Israel’s civilian and humanitarian policies in the Palestinian territories. 'So, we are confident that the humanitarian pause will continue' throughout the campaign, Gough said. 'It worked for round one, and we are confident that it will work for round two.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-warns-widening-middle-east-conflict-threatens-health-of-millions/7819309.html	2024-10-11T11:20:22-07:00

Back-to-back hurricanes reshape 2024 campaign’s final stretch	WASHINGTON — A pair of unwelcome and destructive guests named Helene and Milton have stormed their way into this year's U.S. presidential election. The back-to-back hurricanes have jumbled the schedules of Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, both of whom devoted part of their recent days to tackling questions about the storm recovery effort. The two hurricanes are forcing basic questions about who as president would best respond to deadly natural disasters, a once-overlooked issue that has become an increasingly routine part of the job. And just weeks before the November 5 election, the storms have disrupted the mechanics of voting in several key counties. Vice President Harris is trying to use this as an opportunity to project leadership, appearing alongside President Joe Biden at briefings and calling for bipartisan cooperation. Former President Trump is trying to use the moment to attack the administration's competence and question whether it is withholding help from Republican areas, despite no evidence of such behavior. Adding to the pressure is the need to provide more money for the Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would require House Republicans to work with the Democratic administration. Biden said Thursday that lawmakers should address the situation immediately. Timothy Kneeland, a professor at Nazareth University in Rochester, New York, who has studied the issue, said, 'Dealing with back-to-back crises will put FEMA under more scrutiny and, therefore, the Biden administration will be under a microscope in the days leading up to the election. 'Vice President Harris must empathize with the victims without altering the campaign schedule and provide consistent messaging on the widespread devastation that makes FEMA’s work even more challenging than normal,' Kneeland said. Already, Trump and Harris have separately gone to Georgia to assess hurricane damage and pledge support, and Harris has visited North Carolina, requiring the candidates to cancel campaign events elsewhere and use up time that is a precious resource in the final weeks before any election. Georgia and North Carolina are political battlegrounds, raising the stakes. Campaign language altered The hurricane fallout is evident in the candidates' campaign events as well. On Thursday, the first question Harris got at a Univision town hall in Las Vegas came from a construction worker and undecided voter from Tampa, Florida. Ramiro Gonzalez asked about talk that the administration has not done enough to support people after Helene, and whether the people in Milton's path would have access to aid — a sign that Trump’s messaging is breaking through with some potential voters. Harris has called out the level of misinformation being circulated by Republicans, but her fuller answer revealed the dynamics at play just a few weeks before an election. 'I have to stress that this is not a time for people to play politics,' she said. On the same day, Trump opened his speech at the Detroit Economic Club by praising Republican governors in the affected states and blasting the Biden-Harris administration. 'They’ve let those people suffer unjustly,' he said about those affected by Helene in North Carolina. Voting systems affected The storms have also scrambled the voting process in places. North Carolina’s State Board of Elections has passed a resolution to help people in the state's affected counties vote. Florida will allow some counties greater flexibility in distributing mail-in ballots and changing polling sites for in-person voting. But a federal judge in Georgia said Thursday the state doesn't need to reopen voter registration despite the disruptions by Helene. Tension and controversy have begun to override the disaster response, with Biden on Wednesday and Thursday saying that Trump has spread falsehoods that are 'un-American.' Candace Bright Hall-Wurst, a sociology professor at East Tennessee State University, said that natural disasters have become increasingly politicized, often putting more of the focus on the politicians instead of the people in need. 'Disasters are politicized when they have political value to the candidate,' she said. 'This does not mean that the politicization is beneficial to victims.' As the Democratic nominee, Harris has suddenly been a major part of the response to hurricanes, a role that traditionally has not involved vice presidents in prior administrations. On Thursday, she participated virtually at a Situation Room briefing on Milton while she was in Nevada for campaign activities. She has huddled in meetings about response plans and on Wednesday phoned into CNN live to discuss the administration's efforts. At a Wednesday appearance with Biden to discuss Milton ahead of it making landfall, Harris subtly tied back the issues into her campaign policies to stop price gouging on food and other products. 'To any company that — or individual that — might use this crisis to exploit people who are desperate for help through illegal fraud or price gouging — whether it be at the gas pump, the airport or the hotel counter — know that we are monitoring these behaviors and the situation on the ground very closely and anyone taking advantage of consumers will be held accountable,' she said. Harris warned that Milton 'poses extreme danger.' It made landfall in Florida late Wednesday and left more than 3 million without power. But the storm surge never reached the same levels as Helene, which led to roughly 230 fatalities and for a prolonged period left mountainous parts of North Carolina without access to electricity, cell service and roads. Misinformation about Helene Trump and his allies have seized on the aftermath of Helene to spread misinformation about the administration's response. Their debunked claims include statements that victims can only receive $750 in aid, as well as false charges that emergency response funds were diverted to immigrants. The former president said the administration's response to Helene was worse than the George W. Bush administration's widely panned handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which led to nearly 1,400 deaths. 'This hurricane has been a bad one; Kamala Harris has left them stranded,' Trump said at a recent rally in Juneau, Wisconsin. 'This is the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we’ve ever seen ever. Probably worse than Katrina, and that’s hard to beat, right?' Asked about the Trump campaign's strategic thinking on emphasizing the hurricane response, campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it reflects a pattern of 'failed leadership' by the Biden administration that also includes the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and security at the U.S. southern border. John Gasper, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who has researched government responses to natural disasters, said storm victims generally want to ensure foremost that they get the aid they need. 'These disasters essentially end up being good tests of leadership for local, state and federal officials in how they respond,' he said. But Gasper noted that U.S. politics have gotten so polarized and other issues such as the economy are shaping the election, such that the debate currently generating so much heat between Trump and the Biden administration might not matter that much on Election Day.	https://www.voanews.com/a/back-to-back-hurricanes-reshape-2024-campaign-s-final-stretch/7819253.html	2024-10-11T10:45:24-07:00

US lawmakers seek answers from telecoms on Chinese hacking report	WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers asked AT&T, Verizon Communications, and Lumen Technologies on Friday to answer questions after a report that Chinese hackers accessed the networks of U.S. broadband providers. The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday hackers obtained information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorized wiretapping, and said the three companies were among the telecoms whose networks were breached. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican, and the top Democrat on the committee Representative Frank Pallone along with Representatives Bob Latta and Doris Matsui asked the three companies to answer questions. They are seeking a briefing and detailed answers by next Friday. 'There is a growing concern regarding the cybersecurity vulnerabilities embedded in U.S. telecommunications networks,' the lawmakers said. They are asking for details on what information was seized and when the companies learned about the intrusion. AT&T and Lumen declined to comment, while Verizon did not immediately comment. It was unclear when the hack occurred. Hackers might have held access for months to network infrastructure used by the companies to cooperate with court-authorized U.S. requests for communications data, the Journal said. It said the hackers had also accessed other tranches of internet traffic. China's foreign ministry said on Sunday that it was not aware of the attack described in the report but said the United States had 'concocted a false narrative' to 'frame' China in the past.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-seek-answers-from-telecoms-on-chinese-hacking-report-/7819230.html	2024-10-11T10:09:58-07:00	
Mozambique extends voting in some districts and for German diaspora	Maputo, Mozambique — Mozambique's electoral body extended voting until Saturday in some areas and in one overseas location because material didn't arrive on time. Most of the country completed voting Wednesday and now awaits results. National Electoral Commission spokesperson Paulo Cuinica told reporters on Friday that voting did not take place in some districts of Zambezia province, in central Mozambique, partly due to problems getting voting materials in time. 'As a result of this fact, 23 polling stations did not open in the province of Zambezia, [or in the coastal circle of Zambezia], with 4 in Maganja da Costa and 19 in the district of Gilé,' Cuinica said. Voting outside the country also had hiccups, he said, noting that 670 Mozambicans living in Germany in were unable to vote. He said voting materials were shipped to Germany on September 27th, but were held up in Cologne and did not reach Berlin until Thursday, the day after the election. As a result, Cuinica said voting is being extended in affected areas. He said voters can cast ballots from 7 am to 6 pm Saturday in the districts of Gilé and Maganja, and from 9 am to 9 pm in Germany. Meanwhile, election monitors in Mozambique gave preliminary assessments of the process. Laura Valerin, a member of parliament from Spain and chief observer of the European Union election mission, told VOA monitors observed about 800 polling stations. While she praised the peaceful campaign and orderly voting, she said there were issues. 'We saw the counting phase,' she said. 'Our observers saw the processes were in many times very long, really slow with some difficulties foreseen by polling staff, with some doubts about how the process had to take place.' She said that before election day, the EU team's engagement with political parties, media and civil society indicated that there is widespread mistrust about the independence of the electoral bodies. Succès Masra, a former prime minister of Chad and head of the observer mission for the U.S.-based International Republican Institute, said his organization had teams from 20 countries, including 12 in sub–Saharan Africa, deployed across Mozambique. Masra praised the democratic spirit of Mozambicans but said his teams had reservations about the electoral process. 'Citizens were not deterred from exercising their right to determine their future,' he said. 'Our observations show delayed accreditation for observers and party agents, late changes to electoral laws and the misuse of state resources during the campaign. These issues raised concerns about public confidence in the process and independence of institutions.' Masra said he hopes that Mozambicans can address the issues to strengthen their democratic institutions. Now Mozambique awaits the results from this, the country's seventh general elections since the advent of multiparty democracy 30 years ago. The first official results from the National Electoral Council could come as early as Saturday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-extends-voting-in-some-districts-and-overseas-locations/7819236.html	2024-10-11T10:09:18-07:00	
FIFA urged to put more human rights scrutiny into 2034 World Cup deal with Saudi Arabia	zurich — Two months before FIFA is set to confirm Saudi Arabia as the 2034 World Cup host, the soccer body was urged again Friday to allow independent scrutiny of the kingdom's human rights obligations for the tournament. A group of law and human rights experts plus Saudi activists abroad want FIFA to mandate ongoing reviews — and a potential termination clause — into the 2034 World Cup hosting contract. The advisers who came to Zurich on Friday want FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who is closely tied to Saudi political and soccer leaders, to learn from how Qatar was picked to host the 2022 World Cup. Qatar won in 2010 with little thought from FIFA's then-leaders about legal safeguards and reputational challenges. Saudi Arabia, like Qatar, is a traditionally conservative society and needs a huge construction project relying on migrant workers to build stadiums and other infrastructure for global soccer's biggest event. 'There are really no excuses now,' British lawyer Rodney Dixon told The Associated Press. 'If it means that they therefore have to come to a different kind of agreement in December, that is what they should do.' World Cup hosting contracts will be signed after the Dec. 11 decision by more than 200 FIFA member federations at an online meeting. Saudi Arabia is the only candidate for 2034. Promising not to be confrontational with FIFA, Dixon said: 'We are not naive. It is not FIFA's role to change the world. They are not the UN.' The briefing in FIFA's home city came two days after the UN General Assembly in New York rejected a Saudi bid to get a seat on the 47-nation Human Rights Council for the next three years. On Friday, the would-be FIFA advisers cited Saudi Arabia's record on freedom of speech and assembly, and laws on labor and male guardianship that limit women's freedoms. After Infantino was first elected in 2016, when scrutiny was intense on Qatar and its treatment of migrant workers, FIFA demanded a human rights strategy from future World Cup hosts. Bid rules for the 2030 and 2034 men's tournaments refer to 'activities in connection with the bidding for and hosting' rather than rights in wider society. In May, FIFA got an offer from the law and human rights experts to create an independent process for monitoring progress in Saudi Arabia. Swiss law professor Mark Pieth, an anti-corruption advisor to FIFA from 2011-14, said they had been ignored and 'we are here in Zurich to try again.' In July, Saudi plans for the World Cup were published including a review of its human rights strategy by lawyers it chose, and 15 stadium projects. Human Rights Watch researcher Joey Shea said Friday it documented 'grave labor violations' against migrant workers who number more than 13 million, or about 40% of the kingdom's population. The scale of construction required for the World Cup and potential for labor abuses 'is really, really chilling,' Shea said in a live link from London. She cautioned that while rights groups had limited access to operate in Qatar ahead of the 2022 World Cup, there is 'zero access' to Saudi Arabia. Saudi soccer officials have consistently said the kingdom is making progress on social reforms as part of the Vision 2030 drive by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to modernize and create a post-oil economy. The 2034 bid campaign was contacted for comment Friday. In a video message from Washington D.C., Abdullah Alaoudh of the Middle East Democracy Center insisted 'the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia has worsened under Mohamed bin Salman's leadership.' Saudi Arabia was ranked No. 131 of 146 nations on gender issues by the World Economic Forum, Dixon noted. '[There are] so many laws that prejudice women,' he said. 'None of them are addressed by the Saudi bid.' FIFA is evaluating World Cup bidders with reports likely in early December. It also must assess the human rights strategy of the sole candidate for the 2030 World Cup: co-hosts Spain, Portugal and Morocco with single games in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. FIFA and Infantino have not held a news conference to take any questions on World Cup bids since the 2034 edition was fast-tracked toward Saudi Arabia one year ago. Any protest among FIFA voters on Dec. 11 has been made less likely because of how the organization is structuring the voting. FIFA said last week both 2030 and 2034 awards will be combined in a single vote. Any European opposition to the Saudi bid also would count against Spain and Portugal. Victory by acclamation without an itemized vote is possible.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fifa-urged-to-put-more-human-rights-scrutiny-into-2034-world-cup-deal-with-saudi-arabia-/7819168.html	2024-10-11T09:40:32-07:00

Partial remains of British climber believed found 100 years after Everest ascent	LONDON — Climbers believe they have found the partial remains of a British mountaineer who might — or might not — have been one of the first two people to climb Mount Everest, a century after their attempt on the world's highest peak, according to an expedition led by National Geographic. Ahead of the release of a documentary film, the television channel said Friday that the expedition found a foot encased in a sock embroidered with 'AC Irvine' and a boot that could be that of Andrew 'Sandy' Irvine, who disappeared at the age of 22 along with his co-climber, the legendary George Mallory, near Everest's peak on June 8, 1924. The pair, who were seeking to become the first people to conquer Everest, were last seen around 800 feet (245 meters) from the summit. Their fate has been debated by climbers and historians alike, with some postulating that they had stood atop of the world before disappearing on the way down. In his final letter to his wife, Ruth, before he vanished on Mount Everest a century ago, the 37-year-old Mallory, who once famously said he wanted to conquer Everest 'because it's there,' tried to ease her worries even as he said his chances of reaching the world's highest peak were '50 to 1 against us.' Mallory's body was found in 1999 but there was no evidence that could point to the two having reached Everest's summit at 29,032 feet (8,849 meters). There is still no such evidence, though the apparent discovery of Irvine's remains could narrow the search for a Kodak Vest Pocket camera lent to the climbers by expedition member Howard Somervell. For mountaineers, it's the equivalent of the Holy Grail — the possibility of photographic proof that the two did reach the summit, almost three decades before New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa Tenzing Norgay got there on May, 29, 1953. The sock and boot were found at a lower altitude than Mallory's remains, on the Central Rongbuk Glacier below the North Face of Mount Everest. 'This was a monumental and emotional moment for us and our entire team on the ground, and we just hope this can finally bring peace of mind to his relatives and the climbing world at large,' said climb team member and National Geographic explorer Jimmy Chin. Chin did not say exactly where the remains were found because he wants to discourage trophy hunters. But he's confident that other items — and maybe even the camera — are nearby. 'It certainly reduces the search area,' he told National Geographic. The Irvine family has volunteered to compare DNA test results with the remains to confirm his identity. His great-niece and biographer, Julie Summers, said she reacted emotionally when she found out about the discovery. 'I have lived with this story since I was a 7-year-old when my father told us about the mystery of Uncle Sandy on Everest,' she said. 'When Jimmy told me that he saw the name AC Irvine on the label on the sock inside the boot, I found myself moved to tears. It was and will remain an extraordinary and poignant moment.' The find, made by Chin along with climbers and filmmakers Erich Roepke and Mark Fisher, was reported to the London-based Royal Geographical Society, which jointly organized Mallory and Irvine's expedition along with the Alpine Club. 'As joint organizer of the 1924 Everest expedition, the society deeply appreciates the respect Jimmy Chin's team has shown Sandy Irvine's remains and their sensitivity toward Sandy's family members and others connected to that expedition,' said Joe Smith, director of the society. The partial remains are now in the possession of the China Tibet Mountaineering Association, which is responsible for climbing permits on Everest's northern side.	https://www.voanews.com/a/partial-remains-of-british-climber-believed-found-100-years-after-everest-ascent-/7819145.html	2024-10-11T09:19:41-07:00	
Myanmar crisis dominates ASEAN talks as consensus plan languishes	VIENTIANE, LAOS — Myanmar’s worsening violence took center stage at this week’s Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Vientiane, Laos, as regional leaders grappled with the inability to implement their Five-Point Consensus. This outline for peace agreed upon nearly four years ago, calls for an end to the violence in the country, constructive dialogue among the parties, humanitarian aid and appointment of a special envoy from each ASEAN country to facilitate peace talks. The Myanmar junta’s noncompliance is widely blamed for the slow progress since the drafting of the consensus in early 2021 in Jakarta, Indonesia, frustrating ASEAN leaders. This year, for the first time since being barred for noncompliance in late 2021, a senior official from Myanmar’s Foreign Affairs Ministry was allowed to attend the summit, including a two-day retreat attended by the foreign ministers of the nine other ASEAN countries. This development followed Laos' behind-the-scenes negotiations between its special envoy and the Myanmar junta, a senior ASEAN diplomat told VOA. 'Laos, as the rotating chairman, negotiated with the junta, which allowed Myanmar’s representative to attend,' the diplomat said. It remains uncertain if this will lead to meaningful progress on the crisis. The last junta representative to attend an ASEAN meeting was its leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. Days after agreeing to the consensus, he characterized it as 'suggestions by ASEAN leaders' that it would consider 'when the situation returns to stability.' An ASEAN diplomat who attended the summit confirmed to VOA that Myanmar's representative, Permanent Secretary Aung Kyaw Moe, did not speak during the summit meetings. However, at the ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting before the summit, he expressed Myanmar’s appreciation for ASEAN’s efforts and urged caution in the language used when discussing Myanmar-related issues. Diverse ASEAN approaches emerge Thailand reiterated its long-standing stance that any resolution to the Myanmar crisis must come from within the country itself. 'Thailand remains committed to facilitating internal consultations. Any solution must be Myanmar-led and Myanmar-owned,' Nikorndej Balankura, a spokesperson for Thailand's Foreign Ministry, told VOA. 'Thailand,' he said, 'has always shown its readiness to assist when needed. We have consistently emphasized that solutions should come from within Myanmar, and we encourage that approach. That's why we've provided a platform for internal consultations [in ASEAN]. Some refer to it as the 'Troika Plus,' which includes the past, present and future ASEAN chairs — Indonesia, Laos and Malaysia — along with other ASEAN member countries involved in the peace process. Ultimately, it's about facilitating dialogue, which will take place in Thailand.' Indonesian Vice President Ma’ruf Amin emphasized the importance of upholding international law. 'The crisis not only brings suffering to the people of Myanmar, but it also poses a threat to regional stability,' he said. Amin reaffirmed ASEAN’s commitment to the Five-Point Consensus while calling for increased humanitarian assistance. He also highlighted the need to resolve the Rohingya issue as part of addressing the broader Myanmar crisis. Indonesia has seen an influx of thousands of Rohingya refugees fleeing persecution in Myanmar since 2017, many of whom have died attempting the treacherous journey by sea. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. expressed frustration about the lack of progress in addressing the Myanmar crisis. 'We are firmly behind the ASEAN proposal of the Five-Point Consensus,' he told reporters outside the meeting room. 'But we have not been very successful in actually changing the situation. We are trying to formulate new strategies, and that’s what we will be discussing.' Summit’s regional dynamics The summit saw participation from many ASEAN country leaders, including the sultan of Brunei and the prime ministers of Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Despite efforts by this year’s chair, Laos, to engage Myanmar in the talks, no clear solution to the crisis has emerged. Myanmar remains a daunting challenge to the region’s stability. Myanmar’s presence at the summit, although controversial, is seen as progress by some. Countries such as Thailand, Laos and Cambodia have long advocated for its inclusion in the meetings as a practical matter to make Myanmar 'more presentable' as a member of ASEAN and to facilitate humanitarian aid entering the country. 'In a sense, they are accepting the Five-Point Consensus. They may have thought that it's better to have their own voice heard rather than be on the outside,' one diplomat told Agence France-Presse. Myanmar’s representative, Aung Kyaw Moe, however, remained silent, refusing to answer reporters' questions. Inadequate implementation Many Southeast Asian leaders have criticized Myanmar’s implementation of the Five-Point Consensus as 'substantially inadequate.' The junta has continued its violent crackdown on dissent and has been accused of widespread atrocities, including bombing of civilians, torture of political prisoners and journalists, and even genocide. Malaysia’s incoming ASEAN chair, Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan, underscored that 'we have to approach everybody in Myanmar,' signaling a possible shift toward broader dialogue as the bloc seeks to resolve the conflict. Assuming the helm of ASEAN next year, Malysia faces a daunting set of challenges, including a rise in transnational crime, growing food instability and humanitarian crises in the region, largely because of the conflict in Myanmar. An ASEAN diplomat, who requested anonymity and attended the ASEAN-China Summit, told VOA, 'In general terms, some ASEAN member countries reiterated their support for the Five-Point Consensus and urged China to play a role in working with ASEAN to find a solution, given China's influence as a neighboring country. However, there were no specific details provided regarding China's involvement.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-crisis-dominates-asean-talks-as-consensus-plan-languishes/7819127.html	2024-10-11T09:13:44-07:00

Trade plummets along Nigeria-Cameroon southern border after new ban	Yaounde, Cameroon — Trade and maritime traffic between Cameroon and Nigeria nosedived this week after a Cameroonian state governor ordered a temporary trade ban Wednesday in the Bakassi Peninsula, in response to the abduction of two officials from the area. Cameroon reports about 35 percent of Nigerian petroleum products and basic commodities imported by Cameroon pass through the peninsula. Nigeria also depends on Bakassi for most of its cocoa and fish imports from Cameroon. Aboko Patrick, mayor of Kombo Abedimo, a locality in Bakassi, told VOA that several thousand merchants have been unable to transport their goods out of the area since the ban. 'All petroleum products come from Nigeria, even food items come from Nigeria,' he said. 'The fish which is caught in our territorial waters is carried to Nigeria. Today those fishermen, those who were doing legal business, are bound to suffer, but if this suffering can lead us to have peace, I think it is better that we go for it.' On Wednesday, Bernard Okalia Bilai, governor of Cameroon's Southwest Region, ordered the suspension of trade and maritime activity with Nigeria in the peninsula because suspected gunmen from Nigeria allegedly abducted Roland Ewane, the division officer (D.O.) of the Idabato district. 'It is well established that the D.O was kidnapped with the complicity of the population of Idabato who are 95% Nigerians who refuse to pay taxes,' Bilai said, adding, 'and once the D.O. want(ed) to fight illegal activities and to request the payment of taxes, he (was) attacked, kidnapped and carried to Nigeria. It is well established that he is now in Nigerian territory. They should release the D.O.' Ewane was abducted alongside Ismael Etongo, an Idabato district council staff member, and taken to Nigeria in a speedboat, Bilai said. Nigeria ceded control of Bakassi to Cameroon in the early 2000s, after a long legal battle in international courts. However, Cameroon has complained that most of the area’s 300,000 inhabitants, most of whom are Nigerians, refuse to pay taxes. Merchants say Cameroon has deployed troops to enforce tax payments, something that Cameroon officials deny. Cameroon says it has written to Nigerian authorities to help secure the release of the two abducted officials. Joseph Vincent Ntuda Ebode, an expert on international security at the University of Yaounde-Soa, told VOA by telephone that it would be helpful if merchants paid taxes to the Cameroonian government. It is a civic duty for all civilians to pay their taxes, he said, adding that Bakassi needs schools, hospitals, markets and lots of other infrastructure that can be developed with the money. The trade ban appears to be having an impact, as Nigerian merchants say they have not received goods from Bakassi for the past two days. Nigeria has not commented on the abductions or the ban on trade.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trade-plummets-along-nigeria-cameroon-southern-border-after-new-ban-/7819057.html	2024-10-11T08:58:30-07:00

North Korea accuses South of drone leaflet drops, Seoul denies	Seoul, South Korea — North Korea on Friday accused South Korea of sending drones to drop anti-regime leaflets over Pyongyang, an accusation that Seoul immediately denied. According to the state-run Korean Central News Agency, North Korea's foreign ministry said South Korean drones have entered Pyongyang at night on three occasions since October 3, scattering 'numerous' leaflets. The ministry called the alleged incursion a 'grave political and military provocation' that requires retaliation, warning that the situation could lead to an armed conflict or even war. South Korea’s military denied involvement, stating it did not send any drones but that it would investigate whether private groups may have launched the leaflets, reported the South’s Yonhap news agency. In recent months, North Korea has launched thousands of trash-filled balloons into South Korea as retaliation against activists who float anti-Pyongyang leaflets northward across the border. While South Korean activists have recently employed more advanced types of balloons to send leaflets into North Korea, there are no known reports of them using drones. The leaflets often criticize North Korea's human rights abuses or mock its leader Kim Jong Un and are sometimes accompanied by valuable items like dollar bills or USB drives. North Korea is governed by a third-generation hereditary dictatorship that views virtually all outside information as an existential threat. In the past, North Korea has used the leaflets as a justification to ramp up cross-border tensions. When the North began sending waste-filled balloons to the South in May, some analysts cautioned that Kim may be preparing to conduct a more serious cross-border confrontation. In one particularly provocative move, North Korea in late 2022 sent five small reconnaissance drones across the border, with one making it all the way to the northern edge of the capital, Seoul. In response, South Korea’s military said it sent a drone into North Korea on a reconnaissance mission. There have been no subsequent reports that South Korea’s military has flown drones into the North.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-accuses-south-of-drone-leaflet-drops-seoul-denies-/7818942.html	2024-10-11T07:07:22-07:00	
UN mourns ban on Afghan girls’ education on international girl child day	Islamabad — The United Nations expressed 'a great deal of sorrow' Friday over the continued ban on girls’ secondary school education in Taliban-led Afghanistan as the world body marked the International Day of the Girl Child. Roza Otunbayeva, the head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, renewed her appeal to Taliban leaders to 'change course' by lifting the restrictions. She lamented that over 1,100 days have passed since the de facto Afghan authorities imposed the ban on educating girls over the age of 12. 'This is more than three years of lost opportunity – not just for millions of girls, but for families, communities, and the entire country,' Otunbayeva stated. 'As each day passes, even greater damage is being done to the lives of women and girls. Afghanistan is being taken backwards, not forwards, in its quest for peace, recovery, and prosperity,' the U.N. envoy added. Otunbayeva pledged that her organization will continue to advocate for Afghan women and girls, even in the face of attempts to silence them. The Taliban have enforced their strict interpretation of Islamic law since regaining control of the impoverished country in 2021. Girls ages 12 and older are barred from attending school, making Afghanistan the only country with that restriction. Female students have been prohibited from attending universities, and most Afghan women are banned from working in both public and private sectors, including the U.N. They are also forbidden from visiting public places such as parks and gyms. Islamist leaders enacted contentious 'vice and virtue' laws last month, which solidified existing restrictions on women’s freedoms and deemed the sound of a female’s voice in public as a moral violation. The decree requires women to cover their entire bodies and faces when outdoors and forbids them from looking at men to whom they are not related and vice versa, sparking a global outcry and calls for reversing the curbs. The Taliban government, which is officially not recognized by any country, defends its policies as being aligned with Sharia and Afghan customs, rejecting international criticism as an interference in the internal affairs of the country. The United Nations recognizes October 11 as the International Day of the Girl Child to acknowledge girls' rights and the challenges they face worldwide.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-mourns-ban-on-afghan-girls-education-on-international-girl-child-day/7818949.html	2024-10-11T07:07:04-07:00	
Taiwan says 4 Foxconn workers detained in China	Taipei, Taiwan — Four people working for Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn in China have been detained, Taipei said Friday, describing the circumstances as 'quite strange'. The employees were detained by public security in the central city of Zhengzhou for the equivalent of 'breach of trust' under Taiwan law, Taipei's top China policy body, the Mainland Affairs Council, said in a statement to AFP. 'The circumstances surrounding this case are quite strange,' the council said. Foxconn 'has declared the company suffered no losses, and the four employees did not harm the company's interests in any way,' it said, without providing details about when they were detained or their roles. Foxconn, also known by its official name Hon Hai Precision Industry, is the world's biggest contract electronics manufacturer and assembles devices for major tech companies, including Apple. Most of its factories are in China, including Zhengzhou, which is dubbed 'iPhone City' as the home of the world's biggest factory for the smartphone. The Straits Exchange Foundation, a semi-official body in Taiwan handling people and business exchanges with China, told AFP the four detainees were Taiwanese. The case 'may involve corruption and abuse of power by a small number of public security officials, which has severely damaged business confidence,' the Mainland Affairs Council said. 'We urge the relevant authorities across the strait to investigate and address the matter promptly.' A Foxconn spokesman declined to comment when contacted by AFP. China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said she was 'not aware of the specific situation'. China and Taiwan have been locked in a decades-long dispute, with Beijing claiming the self-ruled island as part of its territory, which the Taipei government rejects. Many Taiwanese companies set up factories in China over the past four decades, taking advantage of the shared language and cheaper operating costs, but investment has fallen sharply in recent years over regional tech disputes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-says-4-foxconn-workers-detained-in-china-/7818843.html	2024-10-11T05:43:05-07:00	
Blinken warns China against provocations toward Taiwan	VIENTIANE, LAOS — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken Friday warned China against military provocations toward Taiwan, following Beijing's strong reaction to an annual speech by the leader of the self-ruled democracy. 'I can tell you that with regard to the so-called Ten Ten speech, which is a regular exercise, China should not use it in any fashion as a pretext for provocative actions,' Blinken told reporters during a press conference in Vientiane, Laos. He was referring to October 10, known as Double Ten Day, when Taiwan celebrates the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, just months after an uprising that began on October 10, 1911. The People's Republic of China celebrates its national day on October 1, marking the founding of the country in 1949. China has continued to ramp up its military threats against Taiwan, following President Lai Ching-te's Thursday speech, which rejected China’s claim of sovereignty over the island. Blinken was in Vientiane for meetings with leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and participated in the East Asia Summit. He said there is a strong desire among all ASEAN countries, along with others present, to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, with neither side taking actions that undermine the status quo. Earlier on Friday, Taiwan detected 20 Chinese military aircraft and 10 naval vessels around Taiwan. Thirteen of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan’s northern and southwestern Air Defense Identification Zone, according to a posting on social media platform X by Taiwan’s defense ministry. Between Wednesday and Thursday, Taiwan also detected 27 Chinese military aircraft, nine naval vessels, and five official ships. In Beijing, Chinese officials said Taiwan 'has no so-called sovereignty.' Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, slammed Lai, accusing him of having 'the ill intention of heightening tensions in the Taiwan Strait for his selfish political interest.' Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong's communists took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang nationalists in a civil war, prompting the nationalists' relocation to the island. Washington switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing to counter the then-Soviet Union in 1979. Since then, relations between the U.S. and Taiwan have been governed by the Taiwan Relations Act that Congress passed in April 1979, under which the U.S. provides defense equipment to Taiwan. In September, Taiwan President Lai said if China’s claims over Taiwan are truly based on concerns about territorial integrity, it should also seek to reclaim the 600,000 square kilometers of land it ceded to Russia in the 19th century — an area almost the size of Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-warns-china-against-provocations-toward-taiwan/7818840.html	2024-10-11T05:22:49-07:00	
Noel Tata takes the reins at powerful charity arm of India's Tata group	NEW DELHI — The half-brother of Ratan Tata was appointed on Friday as the head of the powerful and influential philanthropic arm of India's Tata group, giving him indirect control of the $165 billion conglomerate. Tata Trusts said Noel Tata, 67, will be its new chairman after the death this week of Ratan Tata, one of India's best-known corporate titans. The decision followed 'many old-timers' in the group wanting him to lead the venture, said one Tata executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The parent company, Tata Sons, oversees 30 firms across consumer goods, hotels, automobiles and airlines and has become a global juggernaut over the years, with brands such as Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley Tea in its stable. It owns Tata Consultancy Services, Taj Hotels and Air India and counts Starbucks SBUX.O and Airbus as partners in India. Tata Trusts has a 66% ownership of Tata Sons, giving it power over big investment, philanthropic and strategic decisions by the conglomerate, company executives say. Noel Tata, who is half-French, was already among the many trustees of the philanthropic arm, and also chairman of Tata's retail fashion brand Trent as well as vice chairman of Tata Steel TISC.NS. The trust earns dividends from Tata Sons but has no direct say over its operations. However, it appoints a third of the directors to Tata Sons who have veto power over board decisions. The chairman of Tata Trusts 'is powerful enough to decide board and key personnel' appointments at Tata Sons, a second senior company executive said. While Tata Sons is not compelled to seek advice or guidance from the philanthropic arm, it's an 'unsaid understanding' that there is consultation between leadership on both sides, the first executive added. Noel’s journey The Tata group was set up in 1868 by Ratan's great grandfather, Jamsetji Tata. A few years later, Jamsetji started charity work that has since expanded to sectors such as healthcare and sports, through many of the trusts in the philanthropic arm. Ratan Tata started working at the family firm in 1962 and became the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991, taking the group to new heights while gaining a reputation as an extremely shy, soft-spoken executive with sharp business acumen. Noel Tata is a graduate of Sussex University who has been associated with the group for more than 40 years. He serves on the board of various Tata companies. As a previous managing director of Tata International, Noel grew the turnover of the trading arm to more than $3 billion from $500 million, a Tata Group website said. The Tatas belong to the tiny Parsi community, which has included some of India's biggest business names, top nuclear scientists, world-class musicians and senior military officers. Parsis follow the Zoroastrian faith, an ancient pre-Islamic religion of Iran. Some of its tenets, such as charity and doing good to others, have long been woven into the Tata heritage and business ethos. Much of the dividend paid out by Tata Sons gets funneled into charitable trusts involved in philanthropic work. Although the trusts' influence over the group is not often on display, the starkest such example was in 2016, when Ratan Tata had a falling out with Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry that led to the latter's ouster. Mistry, another Parsi billionaire whose family owns a stake of about 18% in Tata Sons, died in a car accident in 2022. One of his former advisers told Reuters this week that the Tata Trusts 'without a doubt' exert unparalleled power over Tata Sons' functions, adding that they 'work behind a veil.' Noel is an Irish citizen married to Mistry's sister.	https://www.voanews.com/a/noel-tata-takes-the-reins-at-powerful-charity-arm-of-india-s-tata-group-/7818805.html	2024-10-11T04:44:34-07:00	
Who are Japan's Nobel Peace Prize winners Nihon Hidankyo?	STOCKHOLM — Japanese organization Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots movement of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki who are also known as Hibakusha, won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. Below are some facts about the background and efforts of the movement. Atomic bombing of Japan In 1945 the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan to bring an end to World War II and avoid a hugely costly invasion of the Japanese home islands. The two bombs killed an estimated 120,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, while many thousands more died of burns and radiation injuries in the following years. The two atomic bombs remain the only nuclear weapons used in war. Local associations The fates of those who survived the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings were long concealed and neglected, especially in the initial years after the end of the war. Local Hibakusha associations, along with victims of nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific, formed the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organisations in 1956. The organisation, whose name was shortened in Japanese to Nihon Hidankyo, would become the largest and most influential Hibakusha organisation in Japan. Witness accounts Through the years, Nihon Hidankyo has provided thousands of witness accounts relating the experience of the nuclear bombs. It has issued resolutions and public appeals, and sent annual delegations to bodies such as the United Nations and peace conferences to advocate nuclear disarmament. The movement has helped drive global opposition to nuclear weapons through the force of the survivors' testimonies while also creating educational campaigns and issuing stark warnings about the spread and use of nuclear arms. Future With each passing year, the number of survivors from the two nuclear blasts in Japan nearly 80 years ago grows smaller. But the grassroots movement has played a part creating a culture of remembrance, allowing for new generations of Japanese to carry on the work.

Russian strikes on Ukraine's Odesa region kill 4, governor says	kyiv, Ukraine — A Russian missile slammed into a commercial building in Ukraine's southern Odesa region overnight, killing four people including a 16-year-old girl, regional governor Oleh Kiper said on Friday. It was the fourth Russian attack on the Black Sea port of Odesa and the nearby region in the last five days. Kiper said a day of mourning had been announced for Friday in the region to remember people killed in a Russian drone attack on October 9. 'In two days Russian terrorists killed 13 civilian people in the Odesa region and most of them are youth,' Kiper said on the Telegram messaging app. The ability to maintain exports through the Black Sea ports is vital for the Ukrainian economy which has been hit hard by Russia's war in Ukraine. The Prosecutor General's office said Russian forces had struck civilian infrastructure with a ballistic Iskander missile at about 22:35 (19:35 GMT) on Thursday night. A two-story commercial building hosting food production facilities where civilians worked was hit and 10 more people were wounded, officials said. Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said the Russian attacks targeted civilian infrastructure and strived to create impossible living conditions for millions of Ukrainians. The Ukrainian air force said it had shot down 29 out of 66 Russian drones launched at Ukraine overnight. Moscow also fired two missiles, it said, and 31 drones were 'locationally lost,' an apparent reference to electronic warfare, while two drones returned towards Russian territory. Zelenskyy meets foreign leaders The new wave of strikes on Ukrainian Black Sea ports has coincided with visits by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this week to meet leaders in London, Paris, Rome and Berlin to discuss his proposed 'victory plan.' There was no immediate comment from Moscow on the strike on Odesa. Russia, which invaded in February 2022, denies targeting civilians. It says it targets only military infrastructure and other military targets although towns and cities across Ukraine have been struck repeatedly. A Russian missile hit a Palau-flagged vessel in Odesa port Monday, while on Sunday, another Russian missile damaged a civilian Saint Kitts and Nevis-flagged vessel loaded with corn in the port of Pivdennyi. Ukrainian officials said Russia had carried out almost 60 attacks on ports over the past three months, resulting in the damage and destruction of almost 300 port infrastructure facilities, 177 vehicles and 22 civilian vessels. 'They are trying from all sides to suppress our intentions to develop, maintain our economy,' Kiper said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-strikes-on-ukraine-s-odesa-region-kill-4-governor-says/7818712.html	2024-10-11T02:45:09-07:00

Cameroon bans any talk about 91-year-old president's health	YAOUNDE, cameroon — Cameroon has outlawed any discussion about the health of 91-year-old President Paul Biya, a letter shared by the interior ministry said, after Biya's prolonged absence fueled widespread speculation he was unwell. Earlier this week, the authorities put out statements saying the president was on a private visit to Geneva and in good health, dismissing reports he had fallen ill as 'pure fantasy.' In the letter to regional governors dated October 9, Interior Minister Paul Atanga Nji said discussing the president's health was a matter of national security. From now on, 'any debate in the media about the president's condition is therefore strictly prohibited. Offenders will face the full force of the law,' Nji said. He ordered the governors to set up units to monitor broadcasts on private media channels, as well as social networks. Cocoa and oil-producing Cameroon, which has had just two presidents since independence from France and Britain in the early 1960s, is likely to face a messy succession crisis if Biya became too ill to remain in office or died. Cameroon’s media regulator, the National Communication Council, could not immediately be reached for comment. The move faced criticism as an act of state censorship. 'The president is elected by Cameroonians and it's just normal that they worry about his whereabouts,' said Hycenth Chia, a Yaounde-based journalist and talk show host on privately owned television Canal2 International. 'We see liberal discussions on the health of Joe Biden and other world leaders, but here it is a taboo,' he told Reuters. Press freedom advocacy group Committee to Protect Journalists said it was gravely concerned. 'Trying to hide behind national security on such a major issue of national importance is outrageous,' said Angela Quintal, head of the CPJ's Africa Program. Biya has not been seen in public since attending a China-Africa forum in Beijing in early September. His failure to appear as scheduled at a summit in France last weekend further stoked public discussion about his health.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-bans-any-talk-about-91-year-old-president-s-health-/7818693.html	2024-10-11T01:43:42-07:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy city-hops across Europe, promoting 'victory plan'	ROME — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was city-hopping across Europe on Thursday to promote a 'victory plan' that he said 'aims to create the right conditions for a just end to the war' against Russia, detailing the proposals to European allies after a summit with President Joe Biden was derailed by Hurricane Milton. Zelenskyy's talks in London with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte were quickly followed by another meeting in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron, who just the previous day sent a strong signal of support for Ukraine by visiting Ukrainian troops being trained in France. Zelenskyy posted on X that he 'outlined the details' of the Ukrainian victory plan to Starmer and added: 'We have agreed to work on it together with our allies.' Starmer's Downing Street office said the leaders discussed the blueprint, the challenges for Ukraine of the approaching winter and 'how investment in the country's security today would support Europe's broader security for generations to come.' The Ukrainian leader also met Rutte with Starmer. Zelenskyy posted afterward that they discussed trans-Atlantic cooperation and further reinforcing Ukraine militarily. He gave no details but posted that 'these are the steps that will create the best conditions for restoring a just peace.' Zelenskyy has yet to publicly present his proposals for victory. But the timing of his efforts to lock in European support appeared to have the looming U.S. election in mind. Former President Donald Trump has long been critical of U.S. aid to Ukraine. Zelenskyy had planned to present his blueprint at a weekend meeting of Western leaders in Germany, but it was postponed after Biden stayed home because of the hurricane that struck Florida. Zelenskyy then embarked on his whistle-stop tour of European capitals that have been among Ukraine's staunchest allies outside of the United States. In Paris, Macron and Zelenskyy hugged before talks on the plan at the French presidential Elysee Palace. Afterward, Zelenskyy said 'all the details' would come in November and that he's talking with allies about securing more military aid and permission for Ukrainian forces to carry out long-range strikes. Kyiv wants Western partners to allow strikes deep inside Russia, using long-range weapons they provide. Some, including the U.K. and France, appear willing, but Biden is reticent about escalating the conflict. 'The situation looks bleak for all sides,' Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said Thursday on X. 'The West hesitates amid internal divisions, Ukraine struggles while bracing for a harsh winter, and Russia presses forward without any strategic shifts in its favor, yet grows increasingly impatient.' Later Thursday, Zelenskyy met in Rome with Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who ensured Italy's full and continued support 'at both bilateral and multilateral level in order to put Kyiv in the best position possible to build a just and lasting peace.' Meloni said the meeting provided an opportunity to discuss the situation on the ground and Ukraine's 'most immediate military, financial and humanitarian needs, as well as the forthcoming diplomatic initiatives and the pathway to bring an end to the conflict.' She added that Rome will continue to do its part also in the future reconstruction of Ukraine and announced the dates for the next Ukraine recovery conference, which will be held in Rome in July 2025. Zelenskyy stressed that his priority is to strengthen Ukraine's position, with the help of its international partners, to create the necessary conditions for diplomacy. 'Russia is not really looking for a diplomatic path,' he said. 'If we are able to implement the victory plan, Russia won't be able to continue the war.' Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet Pope Francis Friday morning for a half-hour audience, the Vatican said. Later in the day, he'll meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin. Ukraine relies heavily on Western support, including tens of billions of dollars' worth of military and financial aid, to keep up the fight against its bigger enemy after almost 1,000 days of fighting since the full-scale Russian invasion began in 2022. Fearing that crucial help could be in jeopardy due to political changes in donor countries, Ukraine has been building up its domestic arms industry. It also wants to raise more money from taxpayers to pay for the war effort. The Ukrainian parliament passed a bill on second reading Thursday that raises the so-called military tax from 1.5% to 5%. Some amendments are expected before it becomes law. Zelenskyy's tour comes as Russia continues a slow but relentless drive deeper into Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region and targets key infrastructure with airstrikes. Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the victory plan seeks to strengthen Ukraine 'both geopolitically and on the battlefield' before any kind of dialogue with Russia. 'Weakness of any of our allies will inspire (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,' he said. 'That's why we're asking them to strengthen us, in terms of security guarantees, in terms of weapons, in terms of our future after this war. In my view, he (Putin) only understands force.' The death toll from a Russian ballistic missile strike on Ukraine's southern city of Odesa rose Thursday to eight, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said. It was the latest in a string of assaults on the Black Sea port. Authorities in Kyiv also announced Thursday that Ukrainian journalist Viktoria Roshchyna died while being in Russian captivity, although the circumstances of her death remained unknown. Moscow admitted detaining Roshchyna, who went missing in 2023 while on a reporting trip to Russia-occupied areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-s-zelenskyy-city-hops-across-europe-promoting-victory-plan-/7818676.html	2024-10-11T01:00:57-07:00	
US still believes Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon, US officials say	WASHINGTON — The United States still believes that Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon despite Tehran's recent strategic setbacks, including Israel's killing of Hezbollah leaders and two largely unsuccessful attempts to attack Israel, two U.S. officials told Reuters. The comments from a senior Biden administration official and a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) added to public remarks earlier this week by CIA Director William Burns, who said the United States had not seen any evidence Iran's leader had reversed his 2003 decision to suspend the weaponization program. 'We assess that the Supreme Leader has not made a decision to resume the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003,' said the ODNI spokesperson, referring to Iran's leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The intelligence assessment could help explain U.S. opposition to any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear program in retaliation for a ballistic missile attack that Tehran carried out last week. U.S. President Joe Biden said after that attack he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites, but did not explain why he had reached that conclusion. His remarks drew fierce criticism from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump. U.S. officials have long acknowledged that an attempt to destroy Iran's nuclear weapons program might only delay the country's efforts to develop a nuclear bomb and could even strengthen Tehran's resolve to do so. 'We're all watching this space very carefully,' the Biden administration official said. Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment but Tehran has repeatedly denied ever having had a nuclear weapons program. Key Iran ally weakened In the past weeks, Israel's military has inflicted heavy losses on Hezbollah, the most powerful member of the Iran-backed network known as the Axis of Resistance. The group's setbacks have included the killing of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike last month. The weakening of a key Iranian ally has prompted some experts to speculate that Tehran may restart its efforts to acquire a nuclear bomb to protect itself. Beth Sanner, a former U.S deputy director of national intelligence, said the risk of Khamenei reversing his 2003 religious dictum against nuclear weapons is 'higher now than it has been' and that if Israel were to strike nuclear facilities Tehran would likely move ahead with building a nuclear weapon. That would still take time, however. 'They can't get a weapon in a day. It will take months and months and months,' said Sanner, now a fellow with the German Marshall Fund. Iran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the 90% of weapons grade, at two sites, and in theory it has enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for almost four bombs, according to a yardstick of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. watchdog. The expansion in Iran's enrichment program has reduced the so-called breakout time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb to 'a week or a little more,' according to Burns, from more than a year under a 2015 accord that Trump pulled out of when president. Actually making a bomb with that material would take longer. How long is less clear and the subject of debate. Possible Israeli attack Israel has not yet disclosed what it will target in retaliation for Iran's attack last week with more than 180 ballistic missiles, which largely failed thanks to interceptions by Israeli air defenses as well as by the U.S. military. The United States has been privately urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to a nuclear attack and concerns about a strike on Iran's energy infrastructure. Israel, however, views Iran's nuclear program as an existential threat. The conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and Iran and Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen have become campaign issues ahead of the November 5 presidential election, with Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, positioning themselves as pro-Israel. Speaking at a campaign event last week, Trump mocked Biden for opposing an attack on Iran's nuclear sites, saying: 'That's the thing you wanna hit, right?' Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence officer and government official, said Iran still had space to compensate for setbacks dealt to its proxies and missile force without having to resort to developing a nuclear warhead. 'The Iranians have to recalculate what's next. I don't think at this point they will rush to either develop or boost the (nuclear) program toward military capacity,' he said. 'They will look around to find what maneuvering space they can move around in.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-still-believes-iran-has-not-decided-to-build-a-nuclear-weapon-us-officials-say/7818664.html	2024-10-11T00:05:22-07:00	
Nobel Prize winner Han Kang's books fly off the shelves in South Korea	seoul, south korea — South Koreans flocked to bookstores Friday and crashed websites in a frenzy to snap up copies of the work of novelist Han Kang in her home country, after her unexpected win of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Literature. However, the author herself was keeping out of the limelight. The country's largest bookstore chain, Kyobo Book Centre, said sales of her books had rocketed on Friday, with stocks almost immediately selling out and set to be in short supply for the near future. 'This is the first time a Korean has received a Nobel Prize in Literature, so I was amazed,' said Yoon Ki-heon, a 32-year-old visitor at a bookstore in central Seoul. 'South Korea had a poor achievement in winning Nobel Prizes, so I was surprised by news that (a writer of) non-English books, which were written in Korean, won such a big prize.' Soon after Thursday's announcement, some bookstore websites could not be accessed due to heavy traffic. Out of the current 10 bestsellers at Kyobo, nine were Han's books on Friday morning, according to its website. Han's father, well-regarded author Han Seung-won, said the translation of her novel The Vegetarian, her major international breakthrough, had led to her winning the Man Booker International Prize in 2016 and now the Nobel prize. 'My daughter's writing is very delicate, beautiful and sad,' Han Seung-won said. 'So, how you translate that sad sentence into a foreign language will determine whether you win ... It seems the translator was the right person to translate the unique flavor of Korean language.' Han's other books address painful chapters of South Korean history, including Human Acts which examines the 1980 massacre of hundreds of civilians by the South Korean military in the city of Gwangju. Another novel, We Do Not Part, looks at the fallout of the 1948-54 massacre on Jeju island, when an estimated 10% of the island's population were killed in an anti-communist purge. 'I really hope souls of the victims and survivors could be healed from pain and trauma through her book,' said Kim Chang-beom, head of an association for the bereaved families of the Jeju massacre. Park Gang-bae, a director at a foundation that honors the victims and supports the bereaved families and survivors of the Gwangju massacre, said he was 'jubilant and moved ' by her win. 'The protagonists in her book (Human Acts) are people we meet and live with every day, on every corner here, so this is deeply moving,' Park said. Han's father told reporters on Friday that she may continue to shun the limelight after giving no separate comments or interviews and eschewing media scrutiny since Thursday's win. 'She said given the fierce Russia-Ukraine, Israel-Palestine wars and people dying every day, how could she celebrate and hold a joyous press conference?' her father said. Han Kang received the news of her win about 10 to 15 minutes before the announcement, her father said, and was so surprised that she thought it might be a scam at one point.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nobel-prize-winner-han-kang-s-books-fly-off-the-shelves-in-south-korea/7818658.html	2024-10-10T23:14:57-07:00	
Gunmen kill 20 miners, wound others in attack in southwest Pakistan	QUETTA, Pakistan — Gunmen killed 20 miners and wounded another seven in Pakistan’s southwest, a police official said Friday, drawing condemnation from authorities who have ordered police to trace and arrest those who are behind the killings. It’s the latest attack in restive Balochistan province and comes days ahead of a major security summit being hosted in the capital. Police official Hamayun Khan Nasir said the gunmen stormed the accommodations at the coal mine in Duki district late Thursday night, rounded up the men and opened fire. Most of the men were from Pashtun-speaking areas of Balochistan. Three of the dead and four of the wounded were Afghan. No group claimed immediate responsibility for the attack, but the suspicion is likely to fall on the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, which often targets civilians and security forces. The group committed multiple attacks in August that killed more than 50 people, while authorities responded by killing 21 insurgents in the province. Those killed included 23 passengers, mostly from eastern Punjab province, who were fatally shot after being taken from buses, vehicles and trucks in Musakhail district in Baluchistan. The latest attack drew a strong condemnation from Sarfraz Bugti, the chief minister in Balochistan, who said the 'terrorists have once again targeted poor laborers.' He said the attackers were cruel and had an agenda to destabilize Pakistan. 'The killing of these innocent laborers would be avenged,' he said in a statement. The province is home to several separatist groups who want independence. They accuse the federal government in Islamabad of unfairly exploiting oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan at the expense of locals. On Monday, a group called the Baloch Liberation Army said it carried out an attack on Chinese nationals outside Pakistan's biggest airport. There are thousands of Chinese working in the country, most of them involved in Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. The explosion, which the BLA said was the work of a suicide bomber, also raised questions about the ability of Pakistani forces to protect high-profile events or foreigners in the country. Islamabad is hosting a summit next week of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a grouping founded by China and Russia to counter Western alliances. Authorities have beefed up security in the capital by deploying troops to prevent any acts of terrorism. The Ministry of Interior this week had alerted the country's four provinces to take additional measures to enhance security as the separatist groups and Pakistani Taliban could launch attacks at public places and government installation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunmen-kill-20-miners-wound-others-in-attack-in-southwest-pakistan/7818644.html	2024-10-10T21:59:45-07:00	
Blinken tells ASEAN the US is worried about China's actions in South China Sea	VIENTIANE, Laos — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Southeast Asian leaders Friday that the U.S. is concerned about China's 'increasingly dangerous and unlawful' activities in the disputed South China Sea during an annual summit meeting and pledged the U.S. will continue to uphold freedom of navigation in the vital sea trade route. The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ meeting with Blinken followed a series of violent confrontations at sea between China and ASEAN members Philippines and Vietnam, which have fueled concerns that China’s increasingly assertive actions in the waterways could spiral into a full-scale conflict. China, which claims almost the entire sea, has overlapping claims with ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei, as well as Taiwan. About a third of global trade transits through the sea, which is also rich in fishing stocks, gas and oil. Beijing has refused to recognize a 2016 international arbitration ruling by a U.N.-affiliated court in the Hague that invalidated its expansive claims and has built up and militarized islands it controls. 'We are very concerned about China’s increasingly dangerous and unlawful activities in the South China Sea which have injured people, harm vessels from ASEAN nations and contradict commitments to peaceful resolutions of disputes,' said Blinken, who is filling in for President Joe Biden, in his opening speech at the U.S.-ASEAN summit. 'The United States will continue to support freedom of navigation, and freedom of overflight in the Indo Pacific.' The United States has no claims in the South China Sea but has deployed navy ships and fighter jets to patrol the waters in a challenge to China’s claims. Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam said last week that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in the disputed sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones. The United States has warned repeatedly that it’s obligated to defend the Philippines — its oldest treaty ally in Asia — if Filipino forces, ships or aircraft come under armed attack, including in the South China Sea. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. complained to summit leaders on Thursday that his country 'continues to be subject to harassment and intimidation' by China. He said it was 'regrettable that the overall situation in the South China Sea remains tense and unchanged' due to China’s actions, which he said violated international law. He has called for more urgency in ASEAN-China negotiations on a code of conduct to govern the South China Sea. Singaporean leader Lawrence Wong earlier this week warned of 'real risks of an accident spiraling into conflict' if the sea dispute isn't addressed. Malaysia, who takes over the rotating ASEAN chair next year, is expected to push to accelerate talks on the code of conduct. Officials have agreed to try and complete the code by 2026, but talks have been hampered by sticky issues including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding. Chinese Premier Li Qiang was defiant during talks on Thursday. He called South China Sea a 'shared home' but repeated China’s assertion that it was merely protecting its sovereign rights, officials said. Li also blamed meddling by 'external forces' who sought to 'introduce bloc confrontation and geopolitical conflicts into Asia.' Li didn’t name the foreign forces, but China has previously warned the U.S. not to meddle in the region’s territorial disputes. In another firm message to China, Blinken said the United States believed 'it is also important to maintain our shared commitment to protect stability across the Taiwan Strait.' China claims the self-ruled island of Taiwan as its own territory and bristles at other countries’ patrolling the body of water separating it from the island. Blinken also attended an 18-nation East Asia Summit, along with the Chinese premier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and leaders from Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand. ASEAN has treaded carefully on the sea dispute with China, which is the bloc's largest trading partner and its third largest investor. It hasn't marred trade relations, with the two sides focusing on expanding a free trade area covering a market of 2 billion people. Blinken said the annual ASEAN summit talks were a platform to address other shared challenges including the civil war in Myanmar, North Korea’s 'destabilizing behavior' and Russia’s war aggression in Ukraine. He said the U.S. remained the top foreign investor in the region and aims to strengthen its partnership with ASEAN.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-tells-asean-the-us-is-worried-about-china-s-actions-in-south-china-sea/7818641.html	2024-10-10T21:49:47-07:00	
New Zealand official: No, ship didn't sink because its captain was a woman	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand's defense minister issued stinging rebukes of what she said were 'vile' and 'misogynistic' online remarks by 'armchair admirals' about the woman captain of a navy ship that ran aground, caught fire and sank off the coast of Samoa. 'Seriously, it's 2024,' Judith Collins told reporters Thursday. 'What the hell's going on here?' After days of comments on social media directed at the gender of Commander Yvonne Gray, Collins urged the public to 'be better.' Women members of the military had also faced verbal abuse in the street in New Zealand since the ship — one of nine in the country's navy — was lost on Sunday, Collins said. All 75 people on board evacuated to safety with only minor injuries after the vessel ran aground on the reef it was surveying about a mile off the coast of Upolu, Samoa's most populous island. The cause of the disaster is not known. 'The one thing that we already know did not cause it is the gender of the ship's captain, a woman with 30 years' naval experience who on the night made the call to get her people to safety,' Collins said. One of the posters was a truck driver from Melbourne, Australia, she added. 'I think that he should keep his comments to people who drive trucks rather than people who drive ships,' Collins said. 'These are the sorts of people I'm calling out and I'm happy to keep calling them out for as long as it takes to stop this behavior.' About 20% of New Zealand's uniformed military members are women. Collins is New Zealand's first woman defense minister and said she stood alongside Gray and Maj. Gen. Rose King, the country's first woman army chief, who assumed her role in June. 'We are all appointed on merit, not gender,' said Collins. The sinking prompted fears of a major fuel spill. On Thursday, officials in Samoa said while the vessel was leaking oil from three places, the amount was reducing each day and was dissipating quickly due to strong winds in the area. Most of the ship's fuel appeared to have burned out in the fire, according to a statement by the Marine Pollution Advisory Committee. Officials were due to meet with locals Thursday to discuss how to remove the vessel's anchor and three shipping containers from the reef without further damaging the fragile marine ecosystem. New Zealand's government has ordered a military court of inquiry into the episode, which will be led by senior military officers. It will assemble for the first time on Friday. Passengers, including civilian scientists and foreign military personnel, left the vessel on lifeboats in 'challenging conditions' and darkness, New Zealand's Chief of Navy Rear Admiral Garin Golding told reporters after the sinking. Those on board have since returned to New Zealand by plane. The specialist dive and hydrographic vessel had been in service for New Zealand since 2019 but was 20 years old and had previously belonged to Norway. The military said the ship, purchased for $100 million NZ dollars ($61 million), was not covered by replacement insurance. The state of New Zealand's aging military hardware has prompted warnings from the defense agency, which in a March report described the navy as 'extremely fragile,' with ships idle due to problems retaining the staff needed to service and maintain them. Of the navy's eight remaining ships, five are currently operational. Golding said the HMNZS Manawanui underwent a maintenance period before the deployment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-official-no-ship-didn-t-sink-because-its-captain-was-a-woman/7818637.html	2024-10-10T21:29:55-07:00	
Hurricane Milton disrupts Yom Kippur plans for Jews in Florida	WINTER PARK, Florida — Many Jews worldwide will mark Yom Kippur in fasting and prayer at their synagogues this weekend. But for the faithful in Florida, destructive Hurricane Milton has disrupted plans for observing the Day of Atonement — the holiest day of the year in the Jewish faith — that begins Friday evening and caps off the High Holy Days that began with Rosh Hashana on October 2. Across the storm-threatened areas, rabbis and their congregants spent part of the Days of Awe — the span between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur — protecting their homes and synagogues as Milton churned off the coast, spiraling into a Category 5 storm. Many — though not all — evacuated, heeding the voluntary and mandatory orders, and found safekeeping for their synagogues' Torah scrolls and themselves. Milton hit Florida's Gulf Coast on Wednesday as a Category 3 cyclone, with damaging winds, heavy rains and tornadoes. By Thursday, the storm had moved eastward into the Atlantic Ocean. Why this rabbi decided against evacuating before storm Rabbi Yitzchok Minkowicz evacuated most of his family ahead of the storm, but chose to ride it out with his son, also a rabbi, at Chabad Lubavitch of Southwest Florida near Fort Myers. The center is hosting people displaced by the storm, including doctors, first responders and elderly who cannot evacuate. It's important to be 'with the people and for the people,' and provide emotional and spiritual support, he said as the storm approached. Near midnight Thursday, the Chabad center and the rest of the neighborhood lost power, said Minkowicz, making them among the millions without it. The center was spared from the storm surge, but homes and other buildings in the area were not, he said. 'Our pressing need is for Power so that we can help our community & hold Yom Kippur services,' Minkowicz told The Associated Press via email Thursday. 'We're praying for this to be resolved asap.' The center planned to host Yom Kippur observances regardless of the storm. He said it was similar two years ago, when the holy day followed the major hurricane, Ian. 'Yom Kippur is a day that you open up your soul to God and you totally connect with God,' Minkowicz said. 'When you go through a hurricane, anything materialistic is not important. They're already in that zone where they're totally focused on God.' Congregation Beth Am in the Tampa Bay area also lost power and plans to hold Yom Kippur services online, said Rabbi Jason Rosenberg of the Reform synagogue. 'It's important to keep perspective. Having a service online is not what anybody wants, but it could've been a lot worse,' he said. 'This feels like a blessing.' The storm underscored one of Yom Kippur's annual reflections. An implicit question, he said before Milton's landfall, is 'If this was going to be your last year on earth, how would you want to act differently? ... When you've got a historical storm, a potentially life-threatening and life-altering storm bearing down on you, that message is really present.' Milton disrupts Yom Kippur and October 7 commemoration Like most of her congregants, Rabbi Nicole Luna had evacuated after helping secure Temple Beth El in Fort Myers, and entrusting several Torah scrolls to congregants should the threatened surge devastate the synagogue. While the congregation braved Hurricanes Irma in 2017 and Ian in 2022, Milton's timing hit especially hard, having already forced the postponement of community-wide commemoration of Hamas attacking Israel on October 7, 2023. The war that followed is ongoing. 'It just feels like too much for our hearts to carry right now,' Luna said from Miami ahead of the storm. 'It's all very heavy.' After the storm passed through, Luna told her congregation that their synagogue had emerged undamaged, though it lost power. She announced plans for a service via Zoom on Friday evening, and in-person services Saturday. 'We hope by Saturday more traffic lights will be restored but please only come if you can safely navigate the roads,' she said in her message. Luna said she was grateful for the 'big outpouring of support' she received from fellow rabbis across the East Coast of Florida, who were opening their temples for the holidays to evacuees and have emphasized they can come as they are since few grabbed 'holiday-appropriate clothing' in the rush to escape Milton's fury. The Chabad of Southwest Broward near Fort Lauderdale is hosting several evacuees from areas most affected by the storm, ranging from a mother with her newborn to an elderly couple, said director Rabbi Pinny Andrusier. They are invited to spend Yom Kippur with the Cooper City-based group, including sharing kosher meals before and after the day of fasting. 'We were spared, thank God,' Andrusier said of the storm. 'We've been able to open up our doors' for those in the hurricane zone. Synagogue skips holding Yom Kippur services Hundreds of Jewish families on Longboat Key, a barrier island off Sarasota Bay, won't be able to observe Yom Kippur in their synagogue for the very first time in their 45-year history, said Shepard Englander, CEO of The Jewish Federation of Sarasota-Manatee. Access to the island, specifically the John Ringling Causeway, was closed ahead of the storm. The congregation decided it wasn't worth risking Milton's might for Day of Atonement services. They had celebrated Rosh Hashana in their building despite a number of nearby homes being damaged by Hurricane Helene, which made landfall last month. Englander said he and his family evacuated from their home on a riverbank outside Sarasota and were hunkered down at a friend's home inland. From there, he was trying to make sure community members from Longboat Key and other temples that won't have services can say their prayers and break their daylong Yom Kippur fast at a newly constructed conference center in Sarasota with food items like blintzes, bagels, cream cheese and smoked salmon. Ahead of the storm, people were scattered in the region at emergency shelters or staying with family or friends, Englander said. 'It's in difficult times that you really understand the power of community,' he said. 'And this is a caring, tight-knit, generous Jewish community.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-milton-disrupts-yom-kippur-plans-for-jews-in-florida/7818633.html	2024-10-10T21:18:34-07:00

Chinese entries skyrocket at this year's Taiwan Golden Horse Awards	Taipei, Taiwan — Organizers of Taiwan's premier film festival report a huge increase this year in entries from China, despite a ban imposed by Beijing six years ago on participation in the festival by Chinese filmmakers and actors. As many as 100 Chinese entries had been submitted for Golden Horse Awards in recent years, in defiance of the ban and without apparent consequences. But this year organizers say the number of movies and documentaries submitted from China shot up to 276. More than a dozen of the Chinese films are potential finalists, some in multiple categories. The winners will be announced on November 23. Industry analysts and directors say many of the Chinese filmmakers may have turned to the Golden Horse Awards to earn exposure for their movies, fearing they would be banned at home. Others point to the festival's reputation for hosting a diversity of films. According to a list of finalists released on October 2, Chinese director Lou Ye's pseudo-documentary, An Unfinished Film, and Geng Jun's black-and-white gay film Bel Ami were shortlisted for multiple awards. Wonder Weng, executive director of the Taiwan Film Critics Society in Taipei, said both movies are likely to be banned in China. He said that Lou, a regular participant in the Golden Horse Awards, has never bowed to the Chinese system and that his An Unfinished Film deviates from Beijing's favored narratives about the COVID-19 pandemic. Geng's Bel Ami, Weng added, challenges the values of the Chinese Communist Party amid a heavy-handed crackdown on the LGBTQ community. Among this year's entrants is Zheng Yu, a 27-year-old independent director from Inner Mongolia who specializes in expressing thoughts and emotions through images and who has been involved in film and television production for eight years. His entry, Her Dream in the Living Room is a short film that records how life for his family was changed by an elder's chronic disease. Although he was not shortlisted in the end, he told VOA that he still dreams of standing on the stage of the Golden Horse Awards one day. Zheng said there are three golden awards in the Chinese film industry: the Taiwan Golden Horse, the Hong Kong Golden Statue and the China Golden Rooster Awards. Among the three, 'The Golden Horse Awards are more welcoming to varieties of films, and it is also more supportive of young directors, so this is why I wanted to apply for the Golden Horse Awards,' he said. In addition to the film entries from China, this year's festival includes 277 entries from Taiwan, 72 from Hong Kong, 17 from Macau, 21 from Malaysia, 17 from Singapore and 67 from other countries. Ng Kwok Kwan, an associate professor at the Academy of Film at Hong Kong Baptist University, said the Golden Horse Awards are the oldest Chinese film awards on either side of the Taiwan Strait. Although entries from China, Hong Kong and Macao have been discouraged by politics, the Golden Horse Awards are still seen as major awards in the Chinese film industry, and being nominated for a festival award will greatly enhance a film's visibility, he said. Ng added that the festival has become the best channel for Chinese-speaking audiences to access excellent works, and it is also the ideal outlet for some non-mainstream Hong Kong and Chinese filmmakers. He said Hong Kong-made films received a total of 18 nominations at last year's Golden Horse Awards and finally won four awards: Best New Director, Best New Actor, Best Feature Short Film and Best Animated Short Film. 'In recent years, some of the Hong Kong films nominated have been very good. They belong to a relatively niche and non-mainstream, and [the festival] has a special [interest] in the themes of non-mainstream, social issues, and experimental films, and I think it really has a certain contribution [to Hong Kong films],' he said. Seventy-two Hong Kong films participated in this year's Golden Horse Awards. From Now On, which explores the situation of older lesbians, was shortlisted for the Best Feature Film, Best Director and Best Actress awards. Among the five shortlisted films for Best Short Film, three are Hong Kong films, including Colour Ideology Sampling.mov, Something About Us and Letters from the Imprisoned: Chow Hang Tung.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-entries-skyrocket-at-this-year-s-taiwan-golden-horse-awards/7818588.html	2024-10-10T19:38:45-07:00

Afghan charged in Election Day terror plot passed multiple screenings	washington — The Afghan national charged in a plot to carry out an Election Day terror attack in the United States passed multiple background checks before being allowed to enter the country, U.S. officials told VOA. FBI agents arrested Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on Monday, alleging he and a juvenile co-conspirator had been in contact with a recruiter for the Islamic State terror group and had been planning to die in a mass shooting. Court documents also stated that Tawhedi hoped to relocate most of his family, including his wife and 1-year-old daughter, back to Afghanistan to live according to what he described as 'pure Islam.' However, U.S. officials, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of a case still under investigation, said Thursday that there were no indications Tawhedi was sympathetic to the Islamic State, also known as IS, ISIS or Daesh, either when he worked for the United States in Afghanistan or when he was screened immediately before to coming to the U.S. three years ago. 'Every Afghan being resettled in the United States undergoes a rigorous screening and vetting process, no matter which [U.S.] agency they worked with,' the official said. 'That process includes checking against a full range of relevant U.S. records and holdings,' the official added. 'Tawhedi would not have been admitted to the United States had information of concern surfaced.' Kinds of data A second U.S. official told VOA that Tawhedi's vetting included checks that involved both biometric data collected by the U.S. Department of Defense and the FBI, and classified information held by U.S. intelligence agencies. Subsequent screenings that allowed him to be approved for a Special Immigrant Visa after he entered the U.S. also came up clean. 'Vetting is a point-in-time check that evaluates information available to the U.S. government at that time,' the official said. The second official also said the government can take additional actions 'if individuals who have entered the country are later found to be associated with information indicating a potential national security or public safety concern.' NBC News, which first reported that Tawhedi's background checks failed to detect any red flags, quoted sources as saying he had worked as a security guard for the CIA before being resettled in the U.S. When reached by VOA, the CIA declined comment. But the arrest has raised concerns among some U.S. lawmakers. The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Republican Representative Mark Green, sent a letter Wednesday to the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security demanding more information. 'These recent arrests raise serious concerns about the ongoing threat that ISIS and its fanatical supporters pose to U.S. national security, as well as the shortfall in the Biden-Harris administration's screening and vetting capabilities,' Green wrote. 'Additionally, news of these potential Afghan terrorists comes when only months ago, it was widely reported that eight Tajikistanis with ties to ISIS were arrested in Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia after they had illegally crossed the border,' Green added. The FBI confirmed receipt of Green's letter but declined further comment. A Homeland Security spokesperson did not comment on the letter but described the vetting process for Afghans fleeing Taliban rule as 'multilayered.' 'Afghan evacuees who sought to enter the United States were subject to multilayered screening and vetting against intelligence, law enforcement and counterterrorism information,' the spokesperson told VOA in an email. 'If new information emerges after arrival, appropriate action is taken.' When was he radicalized? But in the case of Tawhedi, questions remain. 'What's not clear from the information currently available is exactly when Tawhedi was radicalized to the Islamic State ideology,' said Austin Doctor, the director of counterterrorism research initiatives at the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology and Education Center (NCITE). 'We don't know yet whether he radicalized after arriving to the United States or if he already held pro-ISIS beliefs prior to leaving Afghanistan,' Doctor told VOA. 'This matters.' According to court documents, a search of Tawhedi's phone and social media accounts showed he had been doing internet searches to find and consume IS propaganda, though when that started is not clear. The earliest date for any involvement with IS, according to the criminal complaint filed Monday, is sometime around March of this year, when Tawhedi made two cryptocurrency transfers worth at least $540 to what prosecutors described as a charity that fronts for IS. About four months later, in July, someone made a video recording – saved to Tawhedi's phone – of Tawhedi reading to a nephew and his daughter about the rewards waiting for martyrs in the afterlife. The first indications of a possible terror plot emerged that same month, when the FBI said Tawhedi did online searches about webcams for the White House and the Washington Monument, as well as about procuring guns. It also remains unclear whether Tawhedi's Islamic State contact was working for the group's Afghan affiliate, known as IS-Khorasan or ISIS-K. 'We've seen ISIS-K make a concerted effort to recruit from diaspora communities,' NCITE's Doctor told VOA. 'And facilitating external operations and inspiring homegrown violent extremist attacks are both prominent elements of the group's playbook.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-charged-in-election-day-terror-plot-passed-multiple-screenings/7818235.html	2024-10-10T16:56:18-07:00	
Russian propagandists push fake story that Zelenskyy bought Hitler's car	washington — The article in the Seattle Tribune had everything: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Adolf Hitler and a $15 million classic car. Unsurprisingly, it spread like wildfire across Russia's state and pro-Kremlin media. But the subject was a strange one for a news site about a U.S. city; such outlets usually cover only local stories. In fact, the article with headline 'Hitler's parade car bought by Ukraine's Zelensky' was another fake spread by Russian propaganda. There is no such media outlet as the Seattle Tribune, just a website masquerading as a full-fledged publication. And the article itself was a compilation of Russia's disinformation 'greatest hits' about Ukraine — 'Nazism,' 'unrestrained corruption' and 'wasting American aid.' According to the phony news article, Zelenskyy was spotted in Kyiv exiting a Mercedes-Benz 770K Grosser Offener Tourenwagen, Adolf Hitler's parade car. The sighting supposedly occurred just days after the Ukrainian leader returned from Washington, where the U.S. government had allocated an $8 billion aid package to his country. The article featured a screenshot of a post by the Ukrainian Telegram messenger channel Realna Viyna ('Real War' in Ukrainian) featuring a photo of the vehicle parked in front of the Ukrainian presidential administration building in Kyiv. However, beyond the Seattle Tribune news site not actually existing, the article had several other glaring problems. First, Realna Viyna did not publish the post in the screenshot. Second, the image of 'Hitler's car' was stolen from a photo widely available on the internet that was digitally edited into an image of the Ukrainian presidential administration building. VOA found that the angle of photo in the screenshot, a black spot on the asphalt under the car's running board, and the reflection on the front windshield completely match the image of the Mercedes-Benz 770K found across the internet. Third, the Seattle Tribune website was registered on October 3, 2024, just six days before the fake article was published. And the registration was set for only one year. The Seattle Tribune appears to belong to a network of disinformation websites controlled by John Mark Dougan, an American living in Russia, according to Shayan Sardarizadeh, a journalist who fact checks and debunks disinformation at the BBC. He noted on social network X that creating fake local American news sites is Dougan's standard approach. That conclusion matches VOA's observations about Dougan's network. A former deputy sheriff in Florida, Dougan was charged with extortion and wiretapping in the United States. In 2016, he fled to Russia and later received political asylum there. He now operates at least 167 disinformation sites that often publish narratives serving Russian interests, according to a May 2024 investigation by NewsGuard. Dougan's sites previously attracted widespread attention for spreading a fake story claiming that Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, had purchased a $4.8 million Bugatti supercar during a visit to France for commemorations of the D-Day landing. That story seemed to be aimed at a Western audience. The fake 'Hitler car' story, however, is mostly spreading in the Russian information space. In a message on the Telegram messenger, Dougan told VOA that he was unaware of the Seattle Tribune. 'Never heard of it. But I looked it up [and] heard there's lots of great information on there. A real pillar of journalistic integrity, on par with the NYT, CNN and MSNBC,' he wrote, referring to The New York Times and two major U.S. TV news channels. As is often the case with higher-quality fakes, the phony story about Hitler's parade car combines a fictitious narrative about Zelenskyy with real facts about the sale of a former Nazi parade car in the United States. The factual information comes from an article in a real American newspaper: The Seattle Times, which reported in February 2018 that the Mercedes-Benz 770K had briefly appeared in the Seattle area after having been put up for auction in Scottsdale, Arizona, a month earlier. While the vehicle did not sell at the auction, it soon found a buyer. After that, the 'Hitler car' was briefly unloaded from a truck in the wealthy Seattle suburb of Medina, where it attracted the attention of a local resident, who told The Seattle Times about it. Later, the car was likely reloaded onto the truck and taken way. The director of the auction company Worldwide Auctioneers, Rod Egan (his name was also mentioned in the fake Seattle Tribune story), refused to tell The Seattle Times the buyer of the car, citing a non-disclosure agreement. However, Egan said the car's ultimate destination was 'very, very far away' outside the United States. The Seattle Times article also cited a German media report that six such cars were bought by a Russian billionaire in 2009. Among them was the vehicle mentioned in the fake article. The fake story about Zelenskyy and the 'Hitler car' also recalled a scene from the 2001 American comedy film 'Rat Race,' in which actor Jon Lovitz steals Hitler's parade car from a fictional museum of Nazi SS officer Klaus Barbie and then crashes it into a gathering of American World War II veterans. Asked whether he was familiar with the film and scene, Dougan replied, 'Comedy gold right there.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-propagandists-push-fake-story-that-zelenskyy-bought-hitler-s-car/7818175.html	2024-10-10T15:53:50-07:00

Pakistan's banned PTM: A movement for Pashtun rights	washington — This week, Pakistan banned a grassroots protest movement advocating for the rights of Pashtuns, an ethnic minority inhabiting the country's northwestern region. The government in Islamabad contends the movement, known as PTM, poses a threat to national sovereignty and security, but human rights groups view the move as part of a larger crackdown on dissent. The ban, enacted Sunday under Pakistan's anti-terror law, comes as tensions are mounting ahead of a PTM-planned jirga, or council of elders, on Friday. Here is what you need to know about PTM: What is it? The Pashtun Tahafuz (Protection) Movement grew out of the turmoil of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan and Pakistan's counterterrorism operations in the tribal region. With the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan driving the Taliban and al-Qaida into the region, the Pakistani military launched a series of operations over the next two decades to hunt down the militants. The consequences were devastating for the local population. Tens of thousands were killed, thousands were forcibly disappeared and millions more were displaced. These experiences fueled a growing sense of resentment and injustice among the Pashtuns. In response to the alleged human rights abuses by the army and extremists, a group of eight university students from the Mehsud tribe formed the Mehsud Tahafuz Movement in 2014. The movement gained national attention in 2018 after leading a 300-kilometer march to the capital to protest the killing of a Pashtun man by Pakistani police. The group then rebranded as the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, or PTM, giving fellow Pashtuns a cause to rally around. PTM co-founder Manzoor Pashteen, known for his charismatic personality and oratorical skills, has become the face of the movement. Other key leaders include Ali Wazir and Mohsin Dawar, both of whom served as independent lawmakers in Pakistan's parliament. Along with other PTM leaders and activists, they've been repeatedly arrested on a variety of charges. How large is PTM? While there are no figures on PTM membership, it has emerged as a formidable grassroots movement in recent years. Its rallies routinely attract tens of thousands of people. What does PTM want? PTM began with a narrow set of demands, including the removal of military checkpoints, clearance of landmines and recovery of missing persons. But its campaign has evolved over the years into a broader struggle for justice, even as the government has met some of its demands. What methods does it use? Modeling itself on a British-era Pashtun civil disobedience movement, PTM uses a variety of peaceful methods such as marches, protests, processions through bazaars and open-air meetings known as jalsas. The groups have reportedly formed study circles to promote nonviolence and have called for a peace-and-reconciliation commission for justice. How does the Pakistani government view PTM? Though the movement has drawn support from other Pashtun groups, as well as progressive Pakistani activists and politicians, it has become, as one expert said, a 'thorn in the side' of Pakistan's powerful army. The army, which rejects accusations that it has committed egregious human rights abuses, views PTM as a threat to its legitimacy. As Madiha Afzal, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, noted in a 2020 report, by 'calling the army to account' and questioning its integrity, PTM effectively undermines the authority of an institution that sees itself as the guardian of the nation. But the army's hostility stems from a deeper fear: Pashtun nationalism. Pakistan, created in 1947 out of several ethnolinguistic parts of then-British India, has long been wary of 'strong ethnic loyalties,' according to Afzal. While PTM has remained peaceful, it is seen by the army as a potential threat to Pakistani sovereignty, as is a violent Baluch insurgency the army has been battling for decades. Since the early days of the movement, the army has used a variety of tactics to try to shut it down, censoring media coverage of its activities, arresting and jailing PTM leaders, and launching a disinformation campaign to brand PTM activists as traitors and terrorists supported by India and Afghanistan. But PTM has shown few signs of faltering, combining peaceful protests with legal battles and political activism while resisting the urge to turn violent. As one activist told researcher Qamar Jafri, 'We defend against attacks through resistance driven by legal activism and remaining resilient.' What is next? Human rights groups such as Amnesty International have called on Pakistan to revoke its ban on PTM. But Pakistani officials say PTM has ties to both the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban, a charge the group denies. Meanwhile, the government says PTM's planned three-day jirga will not be allowed to proceed. At least three people were killed and several others injured as police clashed with activists near the site of the gathering on Wednesday.

Russian opposition politician Kara-Murza: 'Putin must lose in Ukraine'	WASHINGTON — Russian opposition politician and journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza was released from a Russian prison on August 1 as part of a wide-ranging exchange of prisoners between Russia and several Western countries. He had been jailed in April 2022 on charges of treason for criticizing Russia's war in Ukraine. He was almost fatally poisoned twice, in 2015 and 2017. Since his release, Kara-Murza has been actively involved in the Russian opposition’s diplomatic efforts, meeting with the U.S. and French presidents and the German chancellor. During a recent visit to Washington, he sat down for interviews with Voice of America journalists. Speaking to VOA’s Ukrainian Service, he discussed the agenda that the Russian opposition is promoting in the West. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: After your release, you met with [U.S.] President [Joe] Biden, [French] President [Emmanuel] Macron and [German] Chancellor [Olaf] Scholz. What was your main message to them about policy toward Russia? Vladimir Kara-Murza, Russian opposition politician: There are two main messages. The first message is that [Russian President] Vladimir Putin must lose the war in Ukraine, because if he does win, that means that in a year or a year and a half, we will be talking about another war or another Russian invasion, because this is what this man does. The second message is that the democratic nations of the free world must have a strategy. We know from the last couple of centuries of Russian history that failed wars of aggression always lead to political changes at home. Once Putin is defeated in Ukraine, there must be a prepared strategy for reintegrating a new, changed, post-Putin democratic Russia back into Europe, back into the civilized world, and back into what we call the international rules-based order. VOA: If Putin loses power, how can democratization possibly happen? Someone from his inner circle would most likely grab power. Kara-Murza: I hope he doesn't die in office and that's how it ends. I'm a Christian, and I know that everybody gets a trial up there, and so will he. But I really want that man to get a trial in this life, too. On the question of change, this is a personalistic dictatorship. It is not an ideological dictatorship like in Soviet times, with the collective Politburo, when you could replace the person at the top without replacing the regime. This system is going to collapse very quickly, as we saw in 1953 after [Josef] Stalin's death. VOA: But [Nikita] Khrushchev, who replaced Stalin, was from his inner circle; he wasn't an outsider. Kara-Murza: Even if the next leader comes from the same circle, they always base their rule on a complete denial of everything that happened before. Khrushchev was one of Stalin's closest entourage. He was the one who released millions of people from the gulag and engaged in a very incomplete, very imperfect but nevertheless de-Stalinization process that we had in the late 1950s, early 1960s — the so-called 'Thaw.' VOA: What kind of preparations should be made? How could democratic forces seize power? Kara-Murza: The domestic aspect concerns reflection and accountability, which I call a truth-and-reconciliation process. That is necessary for any society that has undergone the trauma of totalitarian rule. All the people who are responsible for the crimes against Russian citizens, like the assassination of Boris Nemtsov, the assassination of Alexei Navalny and the persecution of hundreds and hundreds of political prisoners, have to be brought to justice. All the archives and the documents of all the crimes committed must be made public. VOA: What about confronting the Russian imperialist mentality? Should Russia also confront all the crimes it has committed toward other people throughout its history? Kara-Murza: It is part of the totalitarian past, because for years and years, for decades, the regime in the Kremlin has been committing crimes against our people in Russia and against other countries, other people and other nations. Look at the aggression and the wars this regime has conducted against the Chechens, against the Georgians, against Ukraine — let's not forget, starting in 2014. Then, in Syria, of course, let's not forget [Sergei] Shoigu, [Putin’s] defense minister, boasted about new armaments they had tested — tested! — on people, on civilians in residential areas. VOA: I want to address your main argument about integrating Russia into the West after democratization and liberalization. The main argument against this would be that the West already tried that in the 1990s. Russia was part of the G8. NATO and the EU engaged with Russia. It received assistance. However, as Russia became richer, it became more aggressive. The more it became integrated with the West, the more efficient its malicious activities against the West became. Kara-Murza: Here is where I fundamentally disagree, because the whole problem is that the West did not do that in the 1990s. Yes, there were some symbolic steps, like the G8, which is just a summit meeting. But, unlike other countries of the former Warsaw Pact, Russia in the 1990s was never offered a prospect of what I would call first-tier European or Atlantic integration with tangible benefits like free trade, visa-free travel and common security guarantees. VOA: But it requires time. Ukraine still hasn't been offered NATO membership ... Kara-Murza: But the problem is that these windows of opportunity are, by definition, short and brief. They last a few months at best, and the West lost that window of opportunity in Russia in the early 1990s. We cannot allow that to happen again. In 1943, as WWII was ongoing, the U.S. government developed the Morgenthau Plan for postwar Germany. It was about dismembering, de-industrializing, humiliating and basically destroying Germany as a functioning state. Given the horrors committed at the time of the war, it was emotionally very understandable. However, leaders of Western-allied nations realized that they could not base long-term strategic policy on emotion. So, the Morgenthau Plan was abandoned in favor of the Marshall Plan, which was the exact opposite: to rebuild and reconstruct Germany after the war, to make it a successful market economy and a functioning liberal democracy. VOA: Should this happen before or after Russia pays reparations for the destruction of Ukraine? Kara-Murza: It should be simultaneous. The only way we can ensure long-term peace, stability, security and democracy on the European continent is with a democratic Russia. It's not going to happen any other way.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-opposition-politician-kara-murza-putin-must-lose-in-ukraine-/7818173.html	2024-10-10T15:02:47-07:00

Houthis strike tanker off Yemen, causing minor damage, no injuries	CAIRO — A Liberia-flagged tanker was struck twice with missiles and drones in the Red Sea on Thursday morning, in an attack claimed by Iran-aligned Houthi militants. The Olympic Spirit was hit about 135 kilometers southwest of the Yemeni port of Hodeidah, British maritime security firm Ambrey said. The tanker, en route from Saudi Arabia's Jeddah to Muscat in Oman, was struck on its starboard side. The projectile hit the bridge and caused minor damage, Ambrey said. Four hours later, two additional projectiles reportedly detonated within half a kilometer of the vessel’s port side. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations agency said in a statement that the captain of the Olympic Spirit did not report any fires or casualties. 'The damage is minor. The vessel has some technical issues, but it is seaworthy and continues its journey,' a maritime security source said. '[The crew members] are all safe.' The vessel is proceeding to its next port of call, the British maritime agency said. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement said later Thursday it had targeted the Olympic Spirit with 11 ballistic missiles and two drones. It said that it had also targeted a vessel it identified as St. John in the Indian Ocean with a winged missile, as part of attacks it launches on global shipping over Israel's war in Gaza. Houthi fighters in Yemen have carried out nearly 100 attacks on ships crossing the Red Sea since November and say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Israel's year-long war in Gaza. They have sunk two vessels, seized another and killed at least four seafarers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/houthis-strike-tanker-off-yemen-causing-minor-damage-no-injuries/7818145.html	2024-10-10T14:22:33-07:00	
Turkey evacuates upwards of 900 people from Lebanon via naval ships	BEIRUT / ISTANBUL — Hundreds of Turkish citizens seeking refuge from Israel's attacks on the armed group Hezbollah were evacuated from Lebanon Thursday on board two Turkish naval ships. The two vessels — the TCG Sancaktar and TCG Bayraktar — also delivered 300 tons of humanitarian aid, including food, blankets and tents, upon arrival at Beirut’s port on Wednesday. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said the ships are carrying 878 Turkish citizens, 24 Turkish Cypriots from northern Cyprus and 64 of their first-degree relatives. The Turkish ambassador to Lebanon, Ali Baris Ulusoy, told Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency on Wednesday that about 13,000 to 14,000 Turkish citizens live in Lebanon and that 2,000 Turkish citizens had applied for the latest evacuation. 'Our country will continue to extend a helping hand to the people of the region in the face of the humanitarian crisis created by the war spread by Israel in the region and will continue to take every step to protect the life and property of its citizens abroad,' Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan wrote on social media platform X. Fidan noted that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan gave the evacuation order. After a period of relative calm, Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel following Hamas' October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel, displacing tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border and leading to the current escalation. The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah recently intensified, with Israel launching a ground operation in south Lebanon and bombing Beirut's southern suburbs. Eyup Sabri Kirgiz, a Turkish engineer who has lived in Lebanon since 2003, was among the Turkish citizens who waited at the Beirut port to be evacuated. Kirgiz said that Lebanon was never calm but that it was manageable until the recent escalation. 'Where we live is close to the area that was bombed. Each time a bomb was dropped, the house shook, the windows opened and the doors made noise. I have two children, my wife and mother-in-law. So, we could not stand it anymore,' Kirgiz told VOA’s Turkish Service before boarding one of the ships in Beirut with his family, two dogs and a turtle. 'There is nowhere else to go. For instance, if you go somewhere else, the rent is four or five times higher than it used to be, and they also ask for four or five months of rent up front. Lebanon is already in crisis. Thank God, our state has taken care of us,' Kirgiz said. Kirgiz also said that he and his family want to return to Lebanon when things get better. 'My job and everything are here,' he said. 'My children were born here. They grew up here. So, they feel like they are half Lebanese and half Turkish.' Several people with dual Lebanese and Turkish citizenship were among the evacuees. Maya, a 20-year-old Lebanese Turkish woman who did not give her surname, was waiting with her family to board the ship and said she is grateful to Turkey for taking its citizens out of Lebanon. 'We were living under great pressure and in difficult conditions. We have to leave our university and our home in Lebanon and go to Turkey,' Maya told VOA’s Turkish Service. 'There was so much bombardment, it was absolutely impossible to sleep because of the noise. Thank God, nothing happened to our house,' she said, adding that she and her family aim to return to Lebanon when the situation calms down. Turkey's Ministry of National Defense announced that the ships are expected to reach port in Turkey's southern Mersin province on Thursday. The voyage on the Mediterranean Sea is expected to take about 12 hours. In a statement shared on X, the ministry also noted that two frigates and two patrol ships will escort the naval ships for protection. A source in the Turkish Foreign Ministry said that Turkey is collecting the names of its citizens who want to leave Lebanon for further evacuation efforts. According to the Turkish Embassy in Lebanon, Ankara is also planning to organize a limited number of charter flights from Beirut to Istanbul or Adana. Hundreds of people of different nationalities have fled Lebanon through a commercial ferry line that operates twice a week from Tripoli port to Turkey's Tasucu port in southern Mersin province. The United States also has evacuated more than 1,000 U.S. citizens and their dependents via U.S.-chartered flights arriving in Turkey. In an interview in Istanbul, U.S. Consul General Julie Eadeh said, 'It's the fastest, safest way to get Americans out of harm's way. 'The security situation is dynamic, so we have been planning for months for all contingencies. Given the airport in Beirut remains operational and open, our focus is on facilitating departures by air,' Eadeh said. According to another U.S. official, reported by the Reuters news agency, 10 of 12 U.S. chartered flights from Beirut have arrived in Istanbul carrying 1,025 citizens and immediate family members since October 2. Reuters also reported that U.S. citizens and those arriving on chartered flights from some other Western countries must continue onward from Turkey within 72 hours of arrival under an agreement with Ankara. Two other U.S.-chartered flights arrived in Frankfurt, Germany, and Doha, Qatar, and U.S. authorities expect to continue providing such flights for remaining U.S. citizens who wish to leave Lebanon.

2 Pakistani police, 4 insurgents killed ahead of Asian security summit	PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Militants opened fire on a police vehicle and killed two officers on Thursday in restive northwest Pakistan before fleeing the scene, police said, a sign of increasing violence ahead of a summit of an Asian security grouping in the capital, Islamabad. Hours later, the military said it killed four militants in North Waziristan, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan. The latest attack on police happened in the city of Tank, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, local police official Sher Afzal said. No group has claimed responsibility, but suspicion is likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, who often target security forces. The TTP are outlawed in Pakistan. They are separate from but a close ally of the Afghan Taliban who control neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant violence in recent months. On Wednesday, a suicide bomber dispatched by the Baloch Liberation Army, an outlawed separatist group, struck a convoy carrying Chinese nationals outside an airport in Karachi on Sunday, killing two engineers and wounding another. The latest violence comes ahead of the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which will take place in Islamabad on October 15. The Asian group was established in 2001 by China and Russia to discuss security concerns in Central Asia. Its other members are Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The killing of the Chinese has drawn condemnation from Pakistan's leaders. On Thursday, President Asif Ali Zardari visited the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad, where he met with Ambassador Jiang Zaidong to offer condolences. Zardari denounced the attack and promised that those behind it would be punished, a government statement said. Also on Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a news conference in Beijing that 'China will work with Pakistan to protect the safety and security of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.' But she said she didn't know if the movement of the Chinese nationals was being restricted because of the summit. Security in Islamabad was beefed up, with the authorities deploying troops, shutting schools and closing two restaurants on the road that will take guests from the airport to the summit venue. Thursday's developments came a day after at least three people were killed in clashes in the northwestern town of Jamrud between police and supporters of a banned organization, the Pashtun Protection Movement, or PTM, which authorities say supports TTP. The government has also barred PTM from holding rallies in the northwest, allegedly because the demonstrations are against the interests of Pakistan. PTM denies backing the Pakistani Taliban, and tension was growing Thursday after the group vowed to resist the ban on its rallies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-police-4-insurgents-killed-in-the-restive-northwest-ahead-of-asian-security-summit/7818101.html	2024-10-10T13:44:54-07:00	
Indonesia arrests suspect wanted by China for running $14 billion investment scam	JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia's immigration officers on the tourist island of Bali have arrested a Chinese suspect sought by Beijing for helping run over $14 billion investment scam to clients in China, officials said Thursday. The 39-year-old man, identified only by his initial, LQ, was arrested on October 1, when an immigration auto-gate in Bali's Ngurah Rai international airport denied him departure for Singapore. The biometric data in the computer registry at the airport identified him as a suspect wanted by Beijing, which led to his arrest, according to Silmy Karim, the immigration chief at Indonesia's law and human rights ministry. He had been listed on an Interpol warrant since late September. The suspect first arrived in Bali from Singapore with a Turkish passport as Joe Lin on September 26, just a day before Interpol released a so-called Red Notice for him, a request to law enforcement agencies worldwide to detain or arrest a suspect wanted by a specific country. Indonesian authorities brought the suspect, wearing a detainee's orange shirt and a facemask, before reporters to a news conference Thursday in the capital of Jakarta. The suspect did not make any statements and was not asked any questions. 'He was wrong to use Indonesia as a transit country, let alone as a destination country to hide,' said Karim, lauding technological advances and cooperation between immigration and the national police. Krishna Murti, the chief of the international division of the National Police, said the decision to deport or to extradite the suspect to China will take some time. Indonesia needs to confirm whether he has truly become a Turkish citizen in the meantime or if he used a fake passport to enter Indonesia. 'We have to respect the suspect's rights,' Murti said, adding that the suspect has not committed any violations inside Indonesia. The man was named as a suspect by Beijing, which requested the Red Notice from Interpol, after he allegedly collected more than 100 billion Chinese Yuan ($14 billion) from more than 50,000 people in a Ponzi scheme. Indonesia, an archipelago nation on the crossroads between Asia and the South Pacific, is attractive to local, regional and global organized crime because of its geographical location and its multi-cultural society. Last month, Indonesia arrested Alice Guo, a fugitive former mayor of a town in the Philippines accused of having links to Chinese criminal syndicates. She has since been deported to the Philippines. In June, Chaowalit Thongduang, one of Thailand's most wanted fugitives, was escorted back to Thailand on a Thai air force plane after being arrested in Bali following months on the run in connection with several killings and drug trafficking charges in his homeland.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-arrests-a-suspect-wanted-by-china-for-running-a-14-billion-investment-scam/7818080.html	2024-10-10T13:17:26-07:00	
China to lift 4-year ban on Australian lobster imports, Australia's prime minister says	MELBOURNE, Australia — China will resume importing Australian live lobsters by the end of the year, removing the final major obstacle to bilateral trade that once cost Australian exporters more than 20 billion Australian dollars ($13 billion) a year, Australia's prime minister said Thursday. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese made the announcement after meeting Premier Li Qiang on the sidelines of a Southeast Asian summit in Vientiane, Laos. The ban on lobsters was the last of a series of official and unofficial trade barriers that Beijing has agreed to lift since Albanese's center-left Labor Party government was elected in 2022. 'I'm pleased to announce that Premier Li and I have agreed on a timetable to resume full lobster trade by the end of this year,' Albanese told reporters. 'This of course will be in time for Chinese New Year, and this will be welcomed by the people engaged in the live lobster industry,' he added. Albanese has given assurances that relations with China have been improved without compromising Australian interests. Beijing is unhappy with restrictions Australia has placed on some Chinese investments because of security concerns. 'What's important is that friends are able to have direct discussions. It doesn't imply agreement, it doesn't imply compliance, and I'll always represent Australia's national interest. That's what I did today. It was a very constructive meeting,' Albanese said. 'I'm encouraged by the progress that we have made between Australia and China's relationship in producing stabilization to the benefit of both of our nations and with the objective of advancing peace and security in the region,' Albanese added. China's embassy in Australia did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Australian lobster exports to China had been worth $700 million Australian dollars ($470 million) in 2019. Beijing ended trade with Australia in 2020 on a range of commodities including lobster, coal, wine, barley, beef and wood as diplomatic relations plumbed new depths. Conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison had angered Beijing that year by demanding an independent investigation into the origins of and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tom Ryan, a manager at lobster exporter Five Star Seafoods at Port MacDonnell in South Australia state, said he was disappointed that his trade would be the last to resume with China. 'It's been a long time coming,' Ryan told Australian Broadcasting Corp. of Albanese's announcement. 'Between myself and other people in Port MacDonnell, it's an absolute relief,' he added. The industry had found new markets for lobster products but at lower profit margins, Ryan said. Li said during a state visit to Australia in June that he had agreed with Albanese to 'properly manage' their nations' differences. Beijing had severed minister-to-minister contacts during the conservatives' nine years in power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-lift-4-year-ban-on-australian-lobster-imports-australia-s-prime-minister-says-/7818067.html	2024-10-10T13:05:15-07:00	
Israel says Hezbollah was planning Hamas-like attack	When it invaded Lebanon, Israel said its goal was to push Hezbollah back from the border to enable more than 60,000 residents to return to their homes in the north. But since then, its troops have been making some disturbing discoveries. Linda Gradstein reports from Jerusalem.

Police investigate shooting near Israeli target in Sweden; no injuries reported	STOCKHOLM — Swedish police said on Thursday they were investigating a shooting near an Israeli target in the city of Gothenburg, which the national broadcaster said was a unit of Israeli defense electronics firm Elbit Systems. Police said in a statement it had apprehended a young suspect at the scene and launched a probe into suspected attempted murder and serious weapons crimes. They did not identify the company, but Elbit Systems Sweden CEO Tobias Wennberg told Reuters there had been a serious incident outside its premises on Thursday, adding that no one was injured in the incident. 'Elbit Systems Sweden otherwise has no knowledge of the incident. Our operations continue as usual,' he said in an email. A police spokesperson said there was only one suspect, and investigators were not aware of any concrete threats against other Israeli targets in the city on Sweden's west coast. The suspect is under 15 years of age, public broadcaster SVT and other Swedish media reported, without identifying their sources. The Israeli Embassy in Stockholm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Swedish police in May said they had stepped up security around Israeli and Jewish interests in the Nordic country after officers on patrol heard suspected gunshots near Israel's embassy in Stockholm. Sweden has seen an epidemic of gun violence in recent years, driven by criminal gangs feuding over drugs and other illicit activities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-investigate-shooting-near-israeli-target-in-sweden-no-injuries-reported-/7818029.html	2024-10-10T12:45:10-07:00	
Florida residents take shelter, lean on federal program for assistance	When major disasters like hurricanes and floods hit the United States, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, coordinates major rescue efforts that would overwhelm local officials.

Hurricane disinformation leads to danger, experts say	WASHINGTON — Disinformation and conspiracy theories have spread quickly in response to natural disasters in the southeastern United States, creating distrust in the government response, according to the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 'It is absolutely the worst I have ever seen,' FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters on a Tuesday call. The spread of lies surrounding the natural disasters comes at a time when social media infrastructure will allow 'virtually any claim' to amplify and spread, experts say. Hurricane Helene left more than 200 people dead and many more injured or without power, and Hurricane Milton has left at least four dead after ravaging Florida, according to the Associated Press. Some frequently spread falsehoods include accusations that FEMA prevented Florida evacuations and claims that funding for storm victims was instead given to undocumented migrants. Such misinformation is 'demoralizing' to first responders, Criswell said in the press call. Additionally, the fabrications could put first responders and residents of impacted areas in even more danger, according to Matthew Baum, a Harvard University professor who focuses on fake news and misinformation. 'When you're talking about life-and-death situations, [misinformation] can cause people not to take advantage of help that's available to them, and it can also be dangerous for first responders who are being accused of all sorts of badness,' Baum told VOA. 'And if first responders start to worry about their own safety, that's going to undermine how they do their jobs.' Many of the other falsehoods stem from former President Donald Trump’s campaign and allies. In an October 3 rally, the former president falsely claimed that the Biden-Harris administration was diverting FEMA funding to house illegal migrants. Last week, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, claimed that 'they control the weather' in a post on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. She did not specify who 'they' are. To combat popular conspiracies surrounding hurricane relief efforts, FEMA launched a 'Hurricane Rumor Response' webpage to 'help correct rumors and provide accurate information,' according to a press release. Baum, however, told VOA that those who believe the false claims may not be swayed by the government-funded website, as they are already 'deep down the rabbit hole of conspiratorial thinking.' 'I don’t think the website will have a significant effect, but it’s still worth doing because journalists read it and having that information out there gets it into the news ecosystem,' Baum said. 'But fundamentally, it's not likely to reach many of the people that are at risk of being harmed by this disinformation.' FEMA put up a similar rumor response webpage during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. On social media platforms such as X, misinformation tends to spread faster than true stories, a 2018 MIT study found. False news stories are 70% more likely to be reposted than true ones are. Media scholar Matt Jordan told VOA the vast amount of disinformation circulating is part of a 'firehose of falsehood' strategy, in which bad actors publish so much 'garbage' that people don’t know what to believe. 'It's a way of eliminating the capacity for the press to help generate democratic consensus by just putting so much garbage into the zone,' the Penn State professor said. U.S. President Joe Biden said during a Tuesday morning briefing that this misinformation 'misleads' the public. 'It’s un-American, it really is,' he said in his remarks. 'People are scared to death; people know their lives are at stake.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-disinformation-leads-to-danger-experts-say/7817837.html	2024-10-10T10:37:33-07:00	
Cameroonians wait for news on president, said to be alive in Geneva	Yaounde, Cameroon — The condition and exact whereabouts of Cameroon’s President Paul Biya remain unclear Thursday, two days after the government was forced to announce Biya was alive in Geneva, Switzerland, in response to rumors on social media that he had died. Biya has not been seen in public for more than five weeks, since he attended the Africa-China forum in Beijing in early September. Cameroon's Territorial Administration minister Paul Atanga Nji told residents of Massock, a village near the Atlantic coast, that Biya dispatched him to provide humanitarian assistance to victims of floods sweeping across the central African state. Nji, like many Cameroon senior state functionaries, told civilians that Biya is in good health, and that information circulating on social and mainstream media about the 91-year-old president's death is being spread by people who want to see Cameroon devolve into chaos. 'The president of our nation Cameroon cannot be dead,' Gregory Mewano, a member of Biya’s Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement party, said Thursday on Cameroon state radio. 'And you find the prime minister in Germany with a whole entourage, the minister of interior taking care of internal politics and the minister of public works inspecting projects.' Officials say Biya will return to Cameroon soon, but they have not said when. There was no indication he was unwell in Beijing. He was scheduled to attend a meeting of French and African leaders in Paris afterward, but he did not appear, and no reason was given for his absence. Cameroon opposition and civil society groups say they are concerned about Biya's absence and health, and ask government officials to present Biya to civilians instead of simply saying he is alive. With elections only a year away, some groups say it is time to begin thinking about a new, much younger candidate who could take the country forward. 'We have had to make it clear to both national and international opinions that a number of opposition political parties are … consulting with regards to the happenings of Cameroon, and this rumor [about Biya’s death] is not an exception,' said Michael Ngwese Eke Ekosso, president of the opposition United Socialist Democratic Party. 'Decisions will be arrived at with regards to the upcoming presidential elections.' Some opposition political parties have proposed uniting behind Akere Muna, an English-speaking anti-corruption lawyer and good governance crusader, as a candidate in the October 2025 presidential election. Muna, who is 72, said if elected, he would launch a three-year transitional period to lift Cameroon from Biya's iron-fisted 42-year rule. 'Our profound reflection is that a non-renewable transition is essential,' Muna said. 'The vision we are proposing is to strengthen democracy and governance, adopt a new constitution that incarnates the present and future aspirations of the people of Cameroon, and promote free and fair elections.' If elected, Muna would be Cameroon’s first leader from the western regions where English is the primary language. His supporters say having a president from that area may help end a seven-year insurgency by English-speaking armed groups, who say English-speakers in Cameroon are marginalized by the French-speaking majority. Opposition parties blame Biya for not being able to solve the crisis. Meanwhile, Cameroonians of all parties wait anxiously for concrete signs that Biya is alive and will be returning to his country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroonians-wait-for-news-on-president-said-to-be-alive-in-geneva/7817801.html	2024-10-10T10:03:38-07:00	
Blinken builds ties with Thailand, Malaysia after turbulence	VIENTIANE, LAOS — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken voiced hope Thursday for cooperation with Thailand and Malaysia after recent turbulence as he met their prime ministers at an Asia summit. In a shift of focus after exhaustive diplomacy on the Middle East crisis, Blinken is representing the United States in Laos at the annual East Asia Summit, which President Joe Biden is skipping for the second straight year. Blinken met Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the 38-year-old heir of a political dynasty who took over a month ago after her predecessor was ousted and the main opposition party dissolved. Blinken said the United States hoped to work with Shinawatra to 'focus on things that we can do to better the lives of our people,' including on the economy, security and climate change. 'The two countries have such an extraordinary history together, and we simply want to build on it,' Blinken told her. Shinawatra told Blinken of northern Thailand's recent deadly floods and voiced support for long-term relations with the United States. Thailand is the oldest U.S. ally in Asia, but Washington has repeatedly criticized its record on democracy, although usually gently. The State Department voiced alarm in August after a Thai court dissolved the reformist Move Forward Party and banned from politics the kingdom's most popular politician, Pita Limjaroenrat. Blinken, wearing a dark blue, traditional Laotian jacket, later met separately with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has been a vocal critic of U.S. support for Israel. Neither mentioned the Middle East in brief remarks in the presence of reporters, with Blinken instead noting that the United States is the top foreign investor in Malaysia. 'I think this is a tremendous sign of both trust and confidence, because the investments don't happen unless there's tremendous confidence in the country,' Blinken told Anwar. U.S. officials privately say that they understand the political pressure in the Muslim-majority country and that they seek a cooperative relationship with Anwar, who enjoyed strong advocacy from Washington when he was controversially imprisoned. Thailand has taken a lead at the Laos summit in seeking diplomatic progress on the crisis engulfing its neighbor Myanmar, whose military junta sent a representative to a top-level Southeast Asian gathering for the first time in more than three years. The United States, while backing diplomatic efforts, said it would press for sustained pressure on the junta, seeing no progress on key concerns such as freeing political prisoners and reducing violence. Blinken, who met two weeks ago with his Chinese counterpart in New York, will also back efforts by Southeast Asia to raise concerns with Beijing about its actions in the South China Sea. The summit marks a rare occasion in which Blinken is in the same room as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, but no talks between the two are expected. The Biden administration, including presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, has ruled out talks with Russia on its invasion of Ukraine without involving Kyiv.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-builds-ties-with-thailand-malaysia-after-turbulence/7817731.html	2024-10-10T09:17:01-07:00	
Ethel Kennedy, social activist and widow of Robert F. Kennedy, dies at 96	Boston, Massachusetts — Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy who raised their 11 children after he was assassinated and remained dedicated to social causes and the family's legacy for decades thereafter, died on Thursday, her family said. She was 96. Kennedy had been hospitalized after suffering a stroke in her sleep on Oct. 3, her family said. 'It is with our hearts full of love that we announce the passing of our amazing grandmother,' Joe Kennedy III posted on X. 'She died this morning from complications related to a stroke suffered last week.' 'Along with a lifetime's work in social justice and human rights, our mother leaves behind nine children, 34 grandchildren and 24 great-great grandchildren along with numerous nieces and nephews, all of whom love her dearly,' the family statement said. The Kennedy matriarch, whose children were Kathleen, Joseph II, Robert Jr., David, Courtney, Michael, Kerry, Christopher, Max, Douglas and Rory, was one of the last remaining members of a generation that included President John F. Kennedy. Her family said she had recently enjoyed seeing many of her relatives, before falling ill. A millionaire's daughter who married the future senator and attorney general in 1950, Ethel Kennedy had endured more death by the age of 40, for the whole world to see, than most would in a lifetime. She was by Robert F. Kennedy's side when he was fatally shot in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968, just after winning the Democratic presidential primary in California. Her brother-in-law, President John F. Kennedy, had been assassinated in Dallas less than five years earlier. Her parents were killed in a plane crash in 1955, and her brother died in a 1966 crash. Her son David Kennedy later died of a drug overdose, son Michael Kennedy in a skiing accident and nephew John F. Kennedy Jr. in a plane crash. Another nephew, Michael Skakel, was found guilty of murder in 2002, although a judge in 2013 ordered a new trial and the Connecticut Supreme Court vacated his conviction in 2018. In 2019, she was grieving again after granddaughter Saoirse Kennedy Hill died of an apparent drug overdose. 'One wonders how much this family must be expected to absorb,' family friend Philip Johnson, founder of the Robert F. Kennedy Foundation, told the Boston Herald after Michael Kennedy's death. Ethel Kennedy sustained herself through her faith and devotion to family. 'She was a devout Catholic and a daily communicant, and we are comforted in knowing she is reunited with the love of her life, our father, Robert. F. Kennedy; her children David and Michael; her daughter-in-law Mary; her grandchildren Maeve and Saorise and her great-grandchildren Gideon and Josie. Please keep our mother in your hearts and prayers,' the family statement said. Ethel's mother-in-law, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, initially worried about how she would handle so much tragedy. 'I knew how difficult it was going to be for her to raise that big family without the guiding role and influence that Bobby would have provided,' Rose recalled in her memoir, 'Times to Remember.' 'And, of course, she realized this too, fully and keenly. Yet she did not give way.' She founded the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights soon after husband's death and advocated for causes including gun control and human rights. She rarely spoke about her husband's assassination. When her filmmaker daughter, Rory, brought it up in the 2012 HBO documentary, 'Ethel,' she couldn't share her grief. 'When we lost Daddy ...' she began, then teared up and asked that her youngest daughter 'talk about something else.' Presidential Medal of Freedom In 2008, she joined brother-in-law Ted Kennedy and niece Caroline Kennedy in endorsing Sen. Barack Obama for president, likening him to her late husband. She made several trips to the White House during the Obama years, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014 and meeting Pope Francis in 2015. Many of her progeny became well known. Daughter Kathleen became lieutenant governor of Maryland; Joseph represented Massachusetts in Congress; Courtney married Paul Hill, who had been wrongfully convicted of an IRA bombing; Kerry became a human rights activist and president of the RFK center; Christopher ran for governor of Illinois; Max served as a prosecutor in Philadelphia and Douglas reported for Fox News Channel. Her son Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also became a national figure, although not as a liberal in the family tradition. First known as an environmental lawyer, he evolved into a conspiracy theorist who spread false theories about vaccines. He ran for president as an independent after briefly challenging President Joe Biden, and his name remained on ballots in multiple states after he suspended his campaign and endorsed Donald Trump. Ethel Kennedy did not comment publicly on her son's actions, although several other family members denounced him. Decades earlier, she seemed to thrive on her in-laws' rising power. She was an enthusiastic backer of JFK's 1960 run and during the Kennedy administration hosted some of the era's most well-attended parties at their Hickory Hill estate in McLean, Virginia, including one where historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. was pushed fully clothed into the swimming pool. In the Kennedy spirit, she also was known as an avid and highly competitive tennis player and a compulsive planner. 'Petite and peppy Ethel, who doesn't look one bit the outdoorsy type, considers outdoor activity so important for the children that she has arranged her busy Cabinet-wife schedule so she can personally take them on two daily outings,' The Washington Post reported in 1962. In February of that year, she accompanied her husband on a round-the-world goodwill tour, stopping in Japan, Hong Kong, Italy and other countries. She said it was important for Americans to meet ordinary people overseas. 'People have a distinct liking for Americans,' she told the Post. 'But the Communists have been so vocal, it was a surprise for some Asians to hear America's point of view. It is good for Americans to travel and get our viewpoint across.' Kennedy was born Ethel Skakel on April 11, 1928, in Chicago, the sixth of seven children of coal magnate George Skakel and Ann Brannack Skakel, a devout Roman Catholic. She grew up in a 31-room English country manor house in Greenwich, Connecticut, and attended Greenwich Academy before graduating from the Convent of the Sacred Heart in the Bronx in 1945. She met Robert Kennedy through his sister Jean, her roommate at Manhattanville College in New York. They moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, where he finished his last year of law school at the University of Virginia, and then in 1957, they bought Hickory Hill from by John and Jacqueline Kennedy, who had bought it in 1953. Robert Kennedy became chief counsel to the Senate Select Committee in 1957. He later was appointed attorney general by his brother, the newly elected President Kennedy. She had supported her husband in his successful 1964 campaign for the U.S. Senate in New York and his subsequent presidential bid. Pregnant with their 11th child when he was gunned down by Sirhan Sirhan, her look of shock and horror was captured by photographers in images that remained indelible decades later. The assassination traumatized the family, especially son David Kennedy, who watched the news in a hotel room. He was just days before his 13th birthday and never recovered, struggling with addiction problems for years and overdosing in 1984. In 2021, she said Sirhan Sirhan should not be released from prison, a view not shared by some others in her family. Two years later, a California panel denied him parole. Although Ethel Kennedy was linked to several men after her husband's death, most notably singer Andy Williams, she never remarried. In April 2008, Ethel Kennedy visited Indianapolis on the 40th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. A monument there commemorated King's death and the speech her husband had given that night in 1968, which was credited with averting rioting in the city. 'Of all the Kennedy women, she was the one I would end up admiring the most,' Harry Belafonte would write of her. 'She wasn't playacting. She looked at you and immediately got what you were about. Often in the coming years, when Bobby was balking at something we wanted him to do for the movement, I'd take my case to Ethel. 'We have to talk to him,' she'd say, and she would.' Ethel Kennedy joined President Obama and former President Bill Clinton — each held one of her hands — as they climbed stairs to lay a wreath at President Kennedy's gravesite during a November 2013 observance of the 50th anniversary of JFK's death. The nonprofit center she founded remains dedicated to advancing human rights through litigation, advocacy, education and inspiration, giving annual awards to journalists, authors and others who have made significant contributions to human rights. She also was active in the Coalition of Gun Control, Special Olympics, and the Earth Conservation Corps. And she showed up in person, participating in a 2016 demonstration in support of higher pay for farmworkers in Florida and a 2018 hunger strike against the Trump administration's immigration policies. Hickory Hill was sold in 2009 for $8.25 million, and Ethel Kennedy divided her time between homes in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, and Palm Beach, Florida.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethel-kennedy-social-activist-and-widow-of-robert-f-kennedy-dies-at-96/7817743.html	2024-10-10T09:08:25-07:00	
Bangladeshi Hindus voice fear, anxiety as Durga Puja begins	WASHINGTON — Sharadiya Durga Puja, the largest Hindu festival in Bangladesh, started Wednesday under a cloud of concern following recent acts of vandalism. Reports of idol desecration in various regions have raised concerns about the safety of religious minorities. On Tuesday, vandals damaged five idols at the Sajjankanda District Road Transport Owner Oikya Parishad temple in Rajbari. This is the latest incident of vandalism of Durga idols reported in the media. Ranadash Dasgupta, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council’s general secretary, told VOA, 'In the last 15 days, idols of Durga Puja have been damaged in 19 Puja [ritual prayer] pavilions in 14 districts of the country.' Dasgupta said Hindu minorities are worshipping in fear of attacks. 'The minority community is in a sense of trauma. While they want to celebrate Puja, they also feel the risk of attack,’ he said. Longtime lawyer Subrata Chowdhury said attacks on Hindu minorities have been taking place since the country became independent. 'The first attacks on Durga idols took place in Chattogram and Dhaka in 1972. Since then, hundreds of such attacks have taken place. Justice was not ensured in any of these incidents and perpetrators not identified,' Chowdhury told VOA. According to a report by Ain O Salish Kendro, a Dhaka-based human rights organization, there were 12 attacks on religious minorities, 17 temples set on fire, five people injured and three homes attacked in 2022. In 2023, there were 22 incidents of violence, 43 idols vandalized, five reported home invasions and 19 people injured. 'Law enforcers have failed miserably here,' Chowdhurry said, 'and we saw the judiciary's reluctance to ensure fair trial over such incidents.' Dasgupta said that violence against Hindu minorities continues because attackers face no consequences. Heightened security in Puja pavilions Army Chief General Waker-uz-Zaman announced on October 5 that the Bangladeshi Army has made extensive preparations to ensure security during Durga Puja. The interim government has issued directives to maintain order, including deploying police, the Rapid Action Battalion and all local forces. Inspector General of Police Mohammad Moinul Islam confirmed increased security at 31,000 festivals. Several arrests have been made, and police officials in Barisal, Pabna and Kishoreganj have been removed following vandalism incidents. Special Assistant to the Chief Adviser Mahfuz Alam said Tuesday that action would be taken on complaints and that financial assistance would be provided to those affected. But recent reports of vandalism have left many unsatisfied with the security measures. Moni Mitra, who works for an online news outlet in Dhaka, said, 'Every year before the start of Puja, we get reports of attacks in different parts of the country. This time too was no exception. We want to perform the Puja without fear. This is what we as a citizen of the country want from the government.' Concern in India over safety of minorities India has voiced concerns about idol vandalism and the safety of Hindus in Bangladesh. Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on October 4 that concerns for minority safety include Durga Puja and Vijayadashami. He urged the Bangladeshi government to ensure security for minority communities. In response, Bangladeshi Foreign Adviser Md Touhid Hosasin said Bangladesh will address any attacks on puja mandaps without foreign interference. The Indian government on several other occasions expressed concerns over the safety and security of minorities in Bangladesh since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government on August 5. At a news conference on September 18, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council reported 2,010 incidents of communal violence across the country from August 4 to 20. They included nine deaths, four rapes or gang rapes, and attacks on 69 places of worship, which were vandalized or set on fire. Additionally, 953 businesses were attacked, vandalized, looted, or burned. The organization also reported 38 cases of physical assault and 21 instances of illegal land and business seizures. US concerned, too Concerns about the safety of religious minorities in Bangladesh were also raised by the United States. On September 20, the chairs of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee — Senators Ben Cardin, Chris Murphy, Chris Van Hollen and Jeff Merkley — wrote to the chief adviser of the interim government, urging stronger law enforcement and prompt action against those responsible for attacks on vulnerable communities, including Hindus. On September 26, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken met with Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus. They discussed strengthening the partnership between the countries and highlighted the need to protect human rights for all Bangladeshis, particularly minority communities.

US inflation reaches lowest point since February 2021, though price pressures remain	WASHINGTON — Inflation in the United States dropped last month to its lowest point since it first began surging more than three years ago, adding to a spate of encouraging economic news in the closing weeks of the presidential race. Consumer prices rose 2.4% in September from a year earlier, down from 2.5% in August, and the smallest annual rise since February 2021. Measured from month to month, prices increased 0.2% from August to September, the Labor Department reported Thursday, the same as in the previous month. But excluding volatile food and energy costs, 'core' prices, a gauge of underlying inflation, remained elevated in September, driven higher by rising costs for medical care, clothing, auto insurance and airline fares. Core prices in September were up 3.3% from a year earlier and 0.3% from August. Economists closely watch core prices, which typically provide a better hint of future inflation. Taken as a whole, the September figures show that inflation is steadily easing back to the Fed's 2% target, even if in a gradual and uneven pattern. Apartment rental costs grew more slowly last month, a sign that housing inflation is finally cooling, a long-awaited development that would provide relief to many consumers. Overall inflation last month was held down by a big drop in gas prices, which fell 4.1% from August to September. Grocery prices jumped 0.4% last month, after roughly a year of mild increases, though they're 1.3% higher than a year earlier. Restaurant food prices increased 0.3% last month and are up 3.9% in the past year. And clothing prices rose 1.1% from August to September and are up 1.8% from a year ago. The improving inflation picture follows a mostly healthy jobs report released last week, which showed that hiring accelerated in September and that the unemployment rate dropped from 4.2% to 4.1%. The government has also reported that the economy expanded at a solid 3% annual rate in the April-June quarter. Growth likely continued at roughly that pace in the just-completed July-September quarter. Cooling inflation, solid hiring and healthy growth could erode former President Donald Trump's advantage on the economy in the presidential campaign as measured by public opinion polls. In some surveys, Vice President Kamala Harris has pulled even with Trump on the issue of who would best handle the economy, after Trump had decisively led President Joe Biden on the issue. At the same time, most voters still give the economy relatively poor marks, mostly because of the cumulative rise in prices over the past three years. For the Fed, last week's much-stronger-than-expected jobs report fueled some concern that the economy might not be cooling enough to slow inflation sufficiently. The central bank reduced its key rate by an outsized half-point last month, its first rate cut of any size in four years. The Fed's policymakers also signaled that they envisioned two additional quarter-point rate cuts in November and December. In remarks this week, a slew of Fed officials have said they're still willing to keep cutting their key rate but at a deliberate pace, a signal that any further half-point cuts are unlikely. The Fed 'should not rush to reduce' its benchmark rate 'but rather should proceed gradually,' Lorie Logan, president of the Federal Reserve's Dallas branch, said in a speech Wednesday. Inflation in the United States and many countries in Europe and Latin America surged in the economic recovery from the pandemic, as COVID closed factories and clogged supply chains. Russia's invasion of Ukraine worsened energy and food shortages, pushing inflation higher. It peaked at 9.1% in the U.S. in June 2022. Economists at Goldman Sachs projected earlier this week that core inflation will drop to 3% by December 2024. And few analysts expect inflation to surge again unless conflicts in the Middle East worsen dramatically. Though higher prices have soured many Americans on the economy, wages and incomes are now rising faster than costs and should make it easier for households to adapt. Last month, the Census Bureau reported that inflation-adjusted median household incomes — the level at which half of households are above and half below — rose 4% in 2023, enough to return incomes back to their pre-pandemic peak. In response to higher food prices, many consumers have shifted their spending from name brands to private labels or have started shopping more at discount stores. Those changes have put more pressure on packaged foods companies, for example, to slow their price hikes. This week, PepsiCo reported that its sales volumes fell after it imposed steep price increases on its drinks and snacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-inflation-reaches-lowest-point-since-february-2021-though-price-pressures-remain-/7817555.html	2024-10-10T07:30:10-07:00	
Prayer camps in Nigeria attract 'miracle seekers'	The power of simple prayer to heal illness is not clear, according to scientists, and is difficult to study.

Uzbekistan accepts ambassador from Taliban-led Afghanistan	Islamabad, Pakistan — Afghanistan’s Taliban said Thursday that Uzbekistan had accepted their appointed ambassador, and both sides marked the action as an important advancement in strengthening diplomatic ties between the neighboring countries. The action is seen as a rare diplomatic achievement for the internationally isolated Taliban leaders since they regained control of the country three years ago. Until now, China and the United Arab Emirates were the only two countries that had formally accredited a Taliban-appointed ambassador since Afghan insurgents regained power in Kabul. None of the three nations has recognized the Taliban as the official government of Afghanistan, and neither has the rest of the world, citing concerns about inclusivity, terrorism, and restrictions on women's access to education and work. The Taliban's foreign ministry identified its diplomat to Tashkent as Sheikh Abdul Ghafar Bahr, saying he formally presented a copy of his credentials to Uzbek Minister of Foreign Affairs Bakhtiyor Saidov on Wednesday. 'Bahr described the upgradation of bilateral relations as a pivotal phase, hoping for further progress,' the Taliban quoted their ambassador as saying at Wednesday’s ceremony to welcome him in the Uzbek capital. The statement quoted Saidov as noting that 'both countries enjoy shared interests and have achieved substantial economic growth over the past three years.' The Taliban said that Bahr 'is expected to present his original letter of credence' to President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan. 'Our countries share a common history and interests of prosperity that serve as an impetus for the development of cooperation ties in all areas,' Saidov said on his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, after Wednesday’s ceremony. 'We also discussed the acute topics on bilateral, regional, and global agendas,' the Uzbek foreign minister wrote. The Taliban separately stated Thursday that their Ministry of Mines and Petroleum had signed a 10-year contract with an Uzbek company for the exploration and extraction of gas in Afghanistan. The announcement said the agreement requires the Uzbek company to invest $100 million in the first year and $1 billion over the next 10 years. The investment will target the gas reserves of the Totimaidan field in the northern Afghan province of Faryab, which spans an area of about 7,000 square kilometers. Russia reported last week that a 'principal decision' had already been made to remove the Taliban from its list of transnational terrorist organizations, saying relevant Russian agencies were 'putting finishing touches' on the delisting in line with federal law. U.S.-led Western countries have been pressing the Taliban to reverse restrictions on women’s freedoms and their right to education as well as employment before they could consider engaging diplomatically with Kabul. Washington also wants the de facto Afghan rulers to address regional and international terrorism concerns. 'We have not changed our designation of the Taliban as a specially designated global terrorist organization, and we continue to make clear that any significant steps towards normalization of relations is contingent upon a profound shift in the Taliban’s human rights conduct,' Matthew Miller, the U.S. State Department spokesperson said on Tuesday. 'We continue to work with our allies and partners to press the Taliban to reverse their discriminatory edicts, and we make sure that any significant steps toward normalization of relations are contingent upon profound improvements in their treatment of women and girls, including but not limited to allowing women and girls back in school and lifting the restrictions on women’s employment,' Miller explained. Taliban leaders defend their governance, arguing that it is in line with their interpretation of the Islamic law of Sharia. They also rejected criticism of their curbs on Afghan women’s access to education, employment, and public life at large. Abdul Kabir, the Taliban's deputy prime minister for political affairs, reportedly said Thursday that their government aims to maintain positive relations with all countries. However, he emphasized that 'they will not sacrifice Islamic principles or values to please others.' Kabir asserted in his remarks that the Taliban are currently in control of '40 diplomatic missions in different countries and engagement with the world is moving in a positive direction.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uzbekistan-accepts-ambassador-from-taliban-led-afghanistan/7817434.html	2024-10-10T06:13:23-07:00	
China defiant over South China Sea skirmishes in ASEAN talks, blames meddling by foreign forces	Vientiane, Laos — Southeast Asian leaders stepped up pressure on China to respect international law following clashes in the disputed South China Sea during annual summit talks on Thursday, but Chinese Premier Li Qiang was defiant as he blamed 'external forces' for interfering in regional affairs. The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations' meeting with Li followed recent violent confrontations at sea this year between China and ASEAN members Philippines and Vietnam that heightened unease over China's increasingly assertive actions in the contested waters. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who will take over the rotating ASEAN chair next year, said the bloc has called for an early conclusion to a code of conduct to govern the South China Sea. Talks on the code of conduct have been ongoing for years, hampered by sticky issues including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding. ASEAN reiterated the need to maintain peace and security in the strategic waterway, he said, according to Malaysian national news agency Bernama. But Li said meddling by foreign forces is creating conflicts within the region. 'We must realize that our development is also facing some unstable and uncertain factors. In particular, external forces frequently interfere and even try to introduce bloc confrontation and geopolitical conflicts into Asia,' Li said during an ASEAN meeting with China, Japan and South Korea. He called for more dialogue between countries to ensure disputes are resolved amicably. Li didn't name the foreign forces but China has previously warned the U.S. not to meddle in the region's territorial disputes. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who arrived in Vientiane on Thursday for the meetings, is expected to raise the issue of China's aggression in the sea, officials said. The U.S. has no claims but it has deployed Navy ships and fighter jets to patrol the waterway and promote freedom of navigation and overflight. ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei along with Taiwan have overlapping claims with China, which claims sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea. Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam said last week that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in the disputed sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones. Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. made clear to Li during talks Thursday that ASEAN-China cooperation cannot be separated from the sea dispute, according to an ASEAN official who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the discussion. Li responded by saying the South China Sea is 'a shared home' and that China has an obligation to protect its sovereignty, the official said. The Philippines, a longtime U.S. ally, has been critical of other ASEAN countries for not doing more to get China to back away. Aside from regional security issues, China's Li also emphasized Beijing and ASEAN's economic ties, saying intensifying trade relations and creating an 'ultra large-scale market' are keys to economic prosperity amid rising trade protectionism. ASEAN and China said they expect to conclude negotiations to upgrade their free trade pact next year. Since the two sides signed the pact covering a market of 2 billion people in 2010, ASEAN's trade with China has leaped from $235.5 billion to $696.7 billion last year. China is ASEAN's No. 1 trading partner and its third-largest source of foreign investment — a key reason why the bloc has been reluctant to criticize Chinese actions in the South China Sea. ASEAN leaders, who held a summit among themselves on Wednesday, also separately met with new Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. ASEAN elevated its ties with South Korea to a 'comprehensive strategic partnership.' Yoon said the new designation will further help both sides to 'create a new future together.' Ishiba also pledged to boost the Japan-ASEAN relationship by providing patrol vessels and training on maritime law enforcement, strengthening economic security through financial and other support and bolstering cybersecurity. 'Japan shares principles such as freedom, democracy and the rule of law, and would like to create and protect the future together with ASEAN,' he said. The bloc is also holding individual talks with dialogue partners India, Australia, Canada, the U.S. and the United Nations that will culminate in an East Asia Summit of 18 nations including Russia and New Zealand on Friday. Former ASEAN Secretary-General Ong Keng Yong said that despite challenges in addressing disputes in the South China Sea and the Myanmar civil war, ASEAN's central role in the region is undisputable. 'ASEAN and its diplomatic maneuvers have sustained the relative peace and progress of Southeast Asia to date. ASEAN will continue to be useful in that regard. Big powers cannot do what they wish in the region,' said Ong, who is now deputy chairman of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. Nearly 6,000 people have been killed and over 3 million displaced in a civil war after the Myanmar army ousted an elected government in 2021. The military has backtracked on an ASEAN peace plan it agreed to in late 2021 and fighting has continued with pro-democracy guerillas and ethnic rebels.

Hong Kong court rejects activist Jimmy Lai's bid to have a jury trial for libel case	HONG KONG — A Hong Kong court rejected jailed publisher Jimmy Lai 's request to have a jury trial for his libel case against a pro-Beijing newspaper Thursday, the latest setback for the activist who suffered multiple blows in other legal battles. Lai, the founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, is one of the city's leading activists who was prosecuted under a sweeping national security law during Beijing's crackdown on dissent. He has been the subject of criticism by pro-Beijing media outlets for years. The 76-year-old brought the case against Ta Kung Pao in 2020, alleging that the publication had maliciously suggested he was planning to illegally abscond from the city and would breach his bail condition. On Thursday, judge Queeny Au Yeung ruled against Lai's bid, saying the case requires a prolonged examination of documents. '(It) is not suitable for jury trial and plainly not suitable for putting only one or some questions to the jury, leaving the rest to the trial judge,' she wrote in her judgment. The libel case centered on an article published by Ta Kung Pao headlined 'Leaders who create chaos in Hong Kong plotting escape, escape route exposed, charge one million dollars' on June 25, 2020. The article named Lai as a potential suspect who intended to abscond and evade criminal liability. The paper denied the libel charge. Many of Hong Kong's most prominent activists were arrested, forced into self-exile or silenced since the 2020 security law came into force. Lai's Apple Daily was shut down after the arrests of its top management in 2021. The closure was widely seen as an erosion of freedoms that were promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Lai has suffered setbacks in his landmark security trial. Last December, judges rejected his bid to throw out a sedition charge against him. The court last year also refused to overturn Hong Kong national security authorities' decision to block him from hiring veteran British lawyer Timothy Owen. Lai will testify in court in his defense for that security trial next month. Lai is now serving a jail term of over five years after being convicted in a separate fraud case. He has been in custody since December 2020. The U.S. and U.K. governments have called for Lai's release and have criticized the security law, which the Beijing and Hong Kong governments say is necessary for the city's stability.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-court-rejects-activist-jimmy-lai-s-bid-to-have-a-jury-trial-for-libel-case-/7817249.html	2024-10-10T02:38:44-07:00

Taiwan celebrates National Day holiday against background of Chinese threats	TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan celebrated its National Day holiday Thursday against the background of threats from China, which claims the self-governing island republic as its own territory. The celebration marks the establishment of the Republic of China, which overthrew the Qing Dynasty in 1911 and fled to Taiwan as Mao Zedong's Communists swept to power on the mainland during a civil war in 1949. Taiwan was run under martial law until transitioning to full democracy in the 1980s and 1990s but maintains the original constitution brought from China and the ROC flag. President Lai Ching-te took office in May, continuing the eight-year rule of the Democratic Progressive Party that rejects China's demand that it recognize Taiwan is a part of China. The Nationalists adhere to a unification stance that recognizes both sides of the Taiwan Strait as a single nation. Thursday's commemorations were to include speeches by Lai and others, performances in front of the Presidential Office Building in Taipei, including an honor guard, military marching band and overflight by military aircraft, but no display of heavy military equipment as seen in years past. Maintaining its military pressure on Taiwan, China's People's Liberation Army sent 15 planes across the median line in the Taiwan Strait, prompting Taiwan to scramble jets, dispatch ships and activate missile systems.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-celebrates-national-day-holiday-against-background-of-chinese-threats/7817179.html	2024-10-09T21:32:49-07:00

Russia-Ukraine war appears frozen in place as winter approaches	WASHINGTON — Neither rising death tolls nor plunging temperatures are likely to change the trajectory of Russia's war against Ukraine, according to senior U.S. officials charged with supporting Kyiv's fight against Moscow's forces. The officials, briefing reporters Wednesday on the condition of anonymity to discuss battlefield developments, said fighting over the past several weeks has resulted in only minor changes to the front lines, with few indications Russia is making any adjustments. 'It's an attritional strategy,' said a senior U.S. military official. 'It's kind of the Russian way of war that they continue to throw mass into the problem.' That willingness to try to overwhelm Ukrainian positions with sheer numbers has cost Russia's military, according to the latest U.S. military assessments. The U.S. estimates Russian forces have suffered 600,000 casualties, killed and wounded, since Moscow first launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 — a toll that U.S. officials said surpasses the number of Russian casualties in any conflict since World War II. September has been especially costly, with Russia sustaining more casualties last month than in any other month of the war, officials said. Russia's military has also suffered in other ways. Senior U.S. officials estimate Ukraine has destroyed or damaged more than 30 medium to large Russian ships stationed in the Black Sea, forcing Russia to relocate its Black Sea fleet. Ukraine is also thought to have destroyed more than two-thirds of Russia's prewar tank inventory. '[It is] forcing the Russian military to dig into Soviet-era stockpiles and fuel tanks from World War II,' said a senior U.S. defense official. And then there are the Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian ammunition depots, believed to have destroyed hundreds of thousands of Russian and North Korean-made rounds. U.S. officials said the damage would likely slow delivery of ammunition and artillery rounds to the front lines. Still, they warned, the Kremlin appears undeterred, even it means more Russian casualties. 'Russia does continue to devote significant amounts of resources and … lives toward a grinding campaign, redoubling its efforts in the east,' said the senior defense official. 'Russia has also demonstrated time and time again a willingness to do whatever it takes to attempt to force the Ukrainians to capitulate, including purposely targeting Ukrainian civilians and critical infrastructure.' For now, senior U.S. officials assess that Russian President Vladimir Putin has managed to avoid calling for a mass mobilization, like the call-up of some 300,000 reservists back in September 2022, thanks in part to pay increases for Russian volunteers. But just how long Putin can sustain Russia's efforts without new troops is not clear. As for Ukraine, senior U.S. officials point to the country's success with its domestically produced drones and even its offensive into Russia's Kursk region as reasons for hope. 'My assessment is that the Ukrainians will be able to maintain their position in Kursk for some amount of time, here into the future,' said the senior U.S. military official. 'Several months and potentially beyond.' The official said Ukraine's military leadership appears to be looking at the big picture. 'Certainly, they're focused on how they get through the winter, but they're thinking a little bit longer term about how they set conditions for success next year,' the official said. 'The Ukrainians are thinking forward to 2025,' the U.S. official added. 'That includes things like ensuring that the additional brigades can come online as they increase their recruitment, as they get better equipment and training, reconstituting brigades that they're cycling off the front line and really building up their combat power for the future.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-war-appears-frozen-in-place-as-winter-approaches/7817119.html	2024-10-09T20:06:34-07:00	
On TikTok, AI-generated 'Russian' women deliver pro-China messages with sales pitch	WASHINGTON — 'What Americans are really worried about now is not wars, shootings or homelessness. It’s the puzzling absence of any issues with China,' declares a blonde influencer on TikTok, speaking in near-fluent Mandarin. 'A U.S. presidential candidate recently stated that America should learn from China and stop causing trouble,' she added, displaying an image of President Biden. The influencer, who says her name is Alina and claims to be a Russian living in Singapore, promotes what she says are 'high-quality Russian and Chinese products' on her account. However, the same blonde Russian woman also appears in other posts on TikTok and goes by the name Lisa. Lisa likes to discuss such topics as 'celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of China,' 'Germany is facing a dead-end,' and 'the U.S. is on the brink of bankruptcy.' In one video posted on September 17, she talked about the two assassination attempts against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, suggesting that the intensifying political rivalry is fueling violence in the U.S. and could lead to further societal division. Patriotism before commerce A joint investigation by Voice of America and social media analytics firm Doublethink Lab uncovered several accounts on TikTok like Alina's and Lisa’s that feature videos of Russian women generated by artificial intelligence, or AI. All the accounts emerged around July and August and followed a similar pattern of leveraging patriotic sentiment to bolster China-Russia ties before going on to promote products. Earlier this year, VOA noted a similar trend on Chinese social media platforms like Douyin and Xiaohongshu, and the use of AI-manipulated videos of young, purportedly Russian women to rally support for China-Russia ties and stoke patriotic fervor before selling products such as snacks, nutritional supplements and drinks. It is hard to tell whether the creators of the videos have an ideological motive or are simply trying to exploit Chinese patriotism to sell their products, said Wei-Ping Li, who holds a fellowship at the Taiwan FactCheck Center. 'I still think they are more like aiming to sell products rather than state-sponsored influence campaigns,' she told VOA. Either way, the use of Russian AI personas to foster patriotism was once limited to Chinese social media sites targeting domestic audiences. The accounts identified on TikTok, however, appear to be operated from Singapore, indicating that the use of attractive blonde Russian women to push patriotism, propaganda and products has expanded beyond China. TikTok is unavailable in China. Most users download its Chinese counterpart, Douyin. Both platforms are owned by the same parent company, ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing. When VOA contacted TikTok to find out more about the accounts Tuesday, they were taken down several hours later. TikTok spokesperson Ariane de Selliers told VOA that TikTok does 'not allow account behavior that may spam or mislead our community.' According to TikTok’s rules, creators are required to label realistic AI-generated content. The accounts discovered by VOA uniformly claim to be from Russia and to love China, often highlighting China's economic achievements and its status as a global friend while criticizing Japan and Western nations like the U.S. and Germany. Most of the content does not appear to come from original creators because the posts are similar or identical to content on other social media platforms. For the most part, it appears that these accounts have been largely republishing videos from Chinese social media platforms such as Douyin, Xiaohongshu and possibly WeChat and bilibili. Some accounts, however, seek to make their postings look legitimate by having the AI-generated Russian women talk about their lives and experiences in China and why they like the country. Interestingly, while many of these characters on Chinese platforms talk about their desire to 'marry a Chinese man,' videos targeting Chinese overseas do not talk about that at all. Li of the Taiwan FactCheck Center said the TikTok accounts seem aimed at older Chinese audiences overseas, diverging from the previous focus on younger males with patriotic inclinations and military backgrounds. This shift can be observed in the use of hashtags such as #Singapore, #Malaysia and #OverseasChinese. 'For the target audiences of these Singaporean accounts, imagine a 65-year-old Chinese [males or females] living in Southeast Asia or even Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., whose friends often share TikTok or Douyin videos,' she said. 'These videos first employ nationalistic themes to attract viewers before promoting their products,' she added. Why Russians? Once these videos gain traction, they pivot to sales. One post claimed, 'China will always be the big brother of Russia,' before recommending a health product: 'I suggest Sinopharm Group's Glucosamine Chondroitin for joint protection.' By featuring foreign women praising China’s political and economic systems, these videos convey a message designed to instill pride among Chinese viewers, aligning with their patriotic sentiments. But why the focus on Russian women? Li attributes this trend to cultural connections, noting that since the 2010s, Chinese men have sought brides in Russia. A 2016 report from China's state media highlighted this phenomenon, suggesting that 'a Chinese husband and a Russian wife make a perfect match.' 'The rhetoric we see in these TikTok videos are exactly the same,' Li pointed out. Additionally, economic factors play a role. As Russia’s economic growth lags China’s, some Chinese individuals may seek partnerships in economically disadvantaged areas. Li emphasized that the TikTok videos aimed at Southeast Asian audiences feature Russian women probably because their creators believe that viewers will appreciate foreign endorsements of China and Singapore. 'In addition, using these existing Russian women’s images (on Chinese social media), producers can churn out videos more easily,' she added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-tiktok-ai-generated-russian-women-deliver-pro-china-messages-with-sales-pitch/7817142.html	2024-10-09T19:44:41-07:00

Three African countries on cusp of death penalty abolition	Harare, zimbabwe — The international human rights organization Amnesty International says three sub-Saharan African countries considering ending the death penalty should do it now and pave the way for others around the world to follow in their footsteps. There hasn't been an execution in Gambia, Kenya or Zimbabwe in over a decade, Amnesty has said, and all three nations have commuted multiple death sentences during that time. Lucia Masuka, head of Amnesty in Zimbabwe, said most countries in the world are moving away from the death penalty, and she urged African countries to follow suit. 'It's time for all countries to move away from this cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment once and for all,' Masuka said. 'Zimbabwe’s president himself was sentenced to death for terrorism, as a young man, due to his involvement in Zimbabwe's liberation struggle. He narrowly avoided execution. He was below the age of 21 at the time, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison instead. 'The president knows what it is like to be facing the death penalty, and he now has the opportunity to ensure that no one else goes through that.' Addressing Parliament this month, President Emmerson Mnangagwa stuck to his 2017 promise that he would not allow the death penalty to stand in Zimbabwe. 'Parliament has an obligation to expedite the enactment of all bills that, for one reason or another, are outstanding from previous sessions,' he said. 'You can carry the burden.' Bills relating to death penalty abolition 'should be passed.' Casten Matewu, a legislator from the country’s main opposition party, the Citizens Coalition for Change, and a member of the justice, legal and parliamentary affairs committee, said Mnangagwa should not be worried about the death penalty abolition bill. 'I am for the abolition of the death penalty, and this must be abolished before December,' Matewu said. 'This is going to sail through seamlessly through Parliament, because there is a majority of parliamentarians, both from both sides of the house, who are actually in support of this bill.' But not everyone agrees. Zachariah Choga, an attorney who formerly practiced in South Africa and is now practicing law in Harare, said the death penalty 'should not be abolished.' 'I've had the privilege to practice in the South African legal system,' he said. 'If you look at statistics since 1994, when the death penalty was abolished in South Africa, the increase has been a super-increase in heinous crimes, violent crimes and crimes of passion. So I’m actually of the opinion that the death penalty is a deterrent to crime. I think the fear of one losing their life can assist, or can be a deterrent, when one considers committing a crime.' Amnesty International’s Masuka has a different opinion. 'Countries that still retain the death penalty in their laws often resort to the death penalty, believing the punishment can make their people and communities safer,' she said. 'However, that is a misconception. The death penalty does not have a unique, deterrent effect, and it violates the right to life, as proclaimed in the universal declaration of human rights. The small minority of countries that insist on using this punishment must move with the times and abolish the death penalty once and for all.' According to Amnesty International, 24 countries across sub-Saharan Africa have abolished the death penalty for all crimes, while two countries have abolished it for ordinary crimes only. Zimbabwe’s last known execution was in 2005, though courts continue to impose death sentences. All of the condemned were sentenced to life imprisonment by Mnangagwa’s amnesty in April this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/three-african-countries-on-cusp-of-death-penalty-abolition/7817102.html	2024-10-09T18:46:14-07:00

UN calls for safer migration from Horn of Africa to Gulf countries	Addis Ababa, ethiopia — The head of the U.N. International Organization for Migration, or IOM, is calling for safe migration to and from the Gulf countries as the dangerous eastern Horn of Africa route claims more lives. The so-called eastern route runs from the Horn of Africa to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf by way of Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia and Yemen. Migrant workers, mainly from Ethiopia but also from other East African countries, travel over the route in search of jobs and economic opportunities. At least 48 people died and 75 others were missing or presumed dead after smugglers forced migrants off two boats on October 1 in the Red Sea, off the coast of Djibouti. Almost all of the migrants were Ethiopians. Speaking at the IOM’s regional review of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration held Wednesday in Ethiopia, Director-General Amy Pope said more people were being harmed on the eastern route than on any other migration route in the world, though it does not get a lot of attention. 'What it demonstrates is that we need to build up safe and regular ways for people to move because we know, for example, within the Gulf, there are tremendous opportunities for people to go and live and work, whether they're going in low-skilled sectors or they're going in higher-skilled sectors,' she said, commenting on the recent deaths off the Djibouti coast. 'There should be no reason for people to have to move through a smuggler, through a trafficker, a route that will subject them to exploitation and often abuse,' she said. Pushed into the sea Frantz Celestin, IOM regional director for East, Horn and Southern Africa, told VOA's Horn of Africa Service that smugglers forced migrants on two fully loaded boats to jump into the sea about 3 a.m. on October 1. In an email, Celestin said the first boat, which had two pilots, was carrying 100 migrants voluntarily returning from Yemen to Djibouti who had paid for and planned their trip. 'The two pilots forced them off the boat, even though they had not reached the shore. There were 99 migrants who survived, and one woman died. The pilots were able to flee the arrival of the coast guard and return to Yemen,' he said. The second boat, with three pilots, had 220 migrants on board who were forced to return from Yemen to Djibouti. They were being brought back either from prison or from several other places in Yemen, Celestin said. Two or three of the migrants were returning voluntarily. 'They forced, pushed or threw the migrants into the sea far from the shore. The pilots abandoned their boat and fled by land,' Celestin said. 'The Djiboutian coast guard brought many survivors from the sea point back to shore.' One of the survivors, who did not want to be identified for safety reasons, told VOA Horn of Africa that the pilots asked them to 'get out.' 'They asked us to get out of the boat into the seawater,' the survivor said, adding that the Yemeni pilot told them how to get to land. 'But all of us could not make it as it was dark and lack of swimming experience.' 'We are peaceful people who want to work and help our families back home,' a second survivor said. Root causes At the regional review, Pope called on the international community to address the root causes of migration, including conflicts, development and climate shocks. 'The drivers of migration are really complex; some of it is about peace. We see, for example, the situation in Sudan, where there are millions of people who have been pushed out of their homes. The solution, the root cause of that, is the conflict, and until there's peace in Sudan, then people will continue to move,' she said. 'In other cases, it's the impact of poverty and the lack of economic opportunity for people at home, and the answer to that is about development and governance,' Pope said, adding that countries need to assume responsibility and address climate change, which she identified as one of the drivers of migration. 'On the one hand, it means that governments need to take seriously their obligations to mitigate the impact of climate change, but importantly, that is just not going to be enough, because we know people are being forced to move now,' she said. 'So, working with communities to adapt to climate change and ensuring there are resources to help people who've already been displaced by climate change will be critical moving forward.' Pope urged governments to work together to ensure people vulnerable to exploitation — especially people who are being recruited by smugglers and traffickers — can migrate safely and obtain the information they need to access a regular pathway for migration.

Last-minute change in US swing state's election rules alarms some	leesburg, georgia — In the town of Leesburg in the U.S. state of Georgia, slightly more than a dozen election workers sit at card tables, each thumbing through stacks of 50 blank pieces of paper, practicing counting ballots by hand. With the U.S. presidential vote only weeks away, the Georgia State Election Board, led by a pro-Donald Trump majority, passed a controversial requirement in September that counties manually hand count their ballots, a move that has caused alarm in the closely watched swing state. Veronica Johnson, who is leading the training session as the Lee County director of elections and registration, says hand counting the ballots is unlikely to pose major operational problems in her small county. But logistics are far from election officials' only concern. Georgia officials from both sides of the political aisle say the count is not only superfluous — machines already count the ballots — but also a potential tool to sow doubt by slowing the process and creating space for disinformation should discrepancies arise via error-prone human counting. 'I don't feel it's necessary. I have no problem saying that. I think that at our precincts here in Lee County we're already balancing our numbers,' Johnson told AFP. The change is all the most notable given Republican candidate Trump's alleged election tampering in the state in 2020, pushing for Georgia officials to 'find' enough votes to overturn President Joe Biden's victory. 'Misguided' Lee is among Georgia's 159 counties, which encompass major metropolitan areas such as Atlanta and rural regions like the area surrounding Leesburg, with populations ranging from majority white to majority Black. Like many of its rural counterparts, Lee County voted heavily in 2020 for Trump, who received 72 percent of its votes. Poll workers such as those at the training will be stationed across the county's 10 voting precincts on November 5, when U.S. voters choose between Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, in addition to candidates in hundreds of down-ballot races. Because of lawsuits, Johnson is unsure if hand counting will actually happen. 'Honestly, every election director I know really just wants to serve the people and not get bogged down by the political ramifications,' she said, emphasizing that ballots are already counted by machine three times. Calling the rule change 'misguided,' Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said that 'activists seeking to impose last-minute changes in election procedures' only 'undermine voter confidence and burden election workers,' while Georgia's Republican attorney general has stated the new rule is likely illegal. The Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Georgia sued to block the rule last week with the Harris campaign's backing. 'Untrusting' The state election board passed the rule by a three-to-two vote — those in favor being staunch Trump backers praised by the ex-president as 'pit bulls' fighting for 'victory.' Along the same three-to-two lines, the board passed another rule in August allowing county election boards to conduct a 'reasonable inquiry' before certifying results. Like the hand count requirement, the measure is being challenged in court, with critics particularly worried about the vagueness of the word 'reasonable.' Mitchell Brown, director of the election administration program at Auburn University in Alabama, told Agence France-Presse that such a rule is unnecessary given that election officials 'have meetings regularly where they go through the documentation and the information with the certifying body.' 'The bigger, more interesting question to me is, what happens if a body chooses not to certify?' Back in Lee County, Donna Mathis, who has served as a poll worker since 2018, noted that the 'country is divided so much.' Asked about the hand count and reasonable inquiry rule, she said, 'the hand count doesn't bother me' given how quickly they were able to tabulate the votes. But 'I think you can inquire too much, it ties things up,' she added. 'People are just so untrusting anymore that they question everything.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/last-minute-change-in-us-swing-state-s-election-rules-alarms-some/7816784.html	2024-10-09T16:51:40-07:00

China tries to silence critics in Japan, new report finds	taipei, taiwan — China has used transnational harassment and intimidation to prevent Chinese people living in Japan from engaging in protests and activism, a new report by Human Rights Watch said. Most of the 25 Chinese people interviewed by Human Rights Watch, including ethnic minorities from Xinjiang, Tibet and Inner Mongolia, said Chinese police have warned them, sometimes through their relatives in China, against taking part in activities or peaceful protests critical of the Chinese Communist Party and its rule over China. 'Several ethnic Uyghurs from Xinjiang said that Chinese authorities contacted them through their relatives back home, and the police told them to either stop their anti-Chinese government activities in Japan or pressed them to share information about Japan’s Uyghur community,' the report said. Analysts say that while Chinese authorities haven’t used physical violence to intimidate Chinese people in Japan, they are still able to deter them from continuing their activism abroad. 'Beijing’s strategies targeting the Chinese diaspora community in Japan are sophisticated, because while they keep their threats relatively low-key — which is less likely to attract the Japanese government’s attention — it’s still enough to scare members of the diaspora community,' Teppei Kasai, Asia program officer at Human Rights Watch, told VOA by phone. Some Japanese experts say Beijing’s transnational repression has created a chilling effect within the Chinese diaspora in Japan. 'More and more Chinese and Hong Kong people in Japan are minimizing their participation in public events, especially those related to sensitive issues, because they are concerned about facing retaliation from the Chinese government,' said Tomoko Ako, a China studies professor at the University of Tokyo. The Chinese foreign ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Japan didn’t respond to VOA’s requests for comments. When responding to a similar question in August, the Chinese Embassy in Washington told VOA that China 'strictly abides by international law and fully respects the law enforcement sovereignty of other countries.' Targeting activists’ families Human Rights Watch said Chinese authorities often try to intimidate activists in Japan by targeting their family members in China. In one case, a Chinese activist in Japan told Human Rights Watch that local police in Inner Mongolia interrogated his relatives, restricted their freedom of movement and prevented them from getting their passports after he took part in public protests against the Chinese government’s policy of replacing the Mongolian language with Mandarin Chinese at school. The activist, who used the pseudonym A.B. because of security concerns, said the pressure his family members face has instilled in him a sense of guilt. 'My [relatives] tell me they’re afraid of the pressure they’re feeling, and that has been tough on me,' he told Human Rights Watch. In another case, Hong Kong activist Alric Lee told VOA that his parents received a letter listing all the activities he had joined in Japan and demanded that they publicly apologize for 'his wrongdoings.' 'They were asked to apologize for what I’ve done in Japan and publicly renounce their relationship with me,' he said in a phone interview, adding that his parents asked him to stop his activism in Japan after receiving the letter. Since the letter included detailed records of his activities in Japan, Lee said he thought the threat might have been initiated by the Hong Kong government. In addition to threats against family members, Lee said he and other members of the Hong Kong diaspora in Japan have been followed by unknown individuals after organizing or taking part in public activities. Lee said these threats have forced him to reevaluate the potential consequences of his activism in Japan. 'I’m definitely thinking twice before taking part in activities, but since I don’t think I have done anything wrong, I don’t think I’ll change anything concerning my activism in Japan,' he told VOA. No confidence in Japan Despite the threats, some Chinese people told Human Rights Watch that they didn’t seek help from the Japanese police because of fear of reprisal or because they didn’t think doing so would resolve the problems they were facing. 'Some people said they think Japanese authorities can’t do much about what the Chinese police have done to them, and they feel that the Chinese government would find out if they try to seek help from the Japanese police,' Kasai told VOA. In a written response to inquiries from VOA, the Japanese foreign ministry declined to comment on transnational repression against Chinese people in Japan and what the Japanese government can do to safeguard their basic rights. Officials said both matters were related to 'foreigners in Japan.' Ako said the Japanese government’s reluctance to comment on Beijing’s transnational repression against Chinese people in Japan reflects Tokyo’s attempt to avoid increasing tensions between the two countries. 'The Japanese government probably doesn’t want to heighten tensions with China, but I think it is their basic responsibility to publicly comment on this concerning trend that’s happening in Japan,' she told VOA by phone. Kasai said since Japan and 54 other countries at the U.N. Human Rights Council condemned transnational repression and vowed to hold those responsible accountable in June, Tokyo should consider establishing mechanisms to help protect the basic rights and safety of those being intimidated. 'The Japanese police should try to create a system that allows Chinese people to report their experiences of facing transnational repression initiated by the Chinese government,' he told VOA, adding that such a system should include safeguards for individuals’ privacy. Kasai and Ako said they thought the Japanese government should go further. 'I think human rights should remain an important aspect of Japan’s bilateral engagement with China, so I believe Tokyo should try to raise the issue of Beijing’s transnational repression against Chinese people in Japan during bilateral meetings,' Ako said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-tries-to-silence-critics-in-japan-new-report-finds/7816790.html	2024-10-09T16:46:39-07:00	
Observers: Chinese-made fighter jets play key role in deadly airstrikes in Myanmar	Washington — Local media in Myanmar are reporting that six FTC-2000G fighter jets purchased from China have arrived, and observers are concerned that Chinese military support for the Myanmar military is prolonging the conflict and worsening civilian suffering. China's supply of fighter jets, such as the FTC-2000G, has helped the junta maintain air superiority, and that has caused widespread casualties across Myanmar. According to media reports, this delivery in August 2024 is the second batch of FTC-2000G jets received by Myanmar’s military. The junta took delivery of the first batch in November 2022. Military-controlled media later showed the FTC-2000G aircraft at a Myanmar Air Force ceremony on Dec. 15, 2022. The second batch is widely expected to be showcased at this year’s Air Force Day celebration in December. Zay Ya, a former sergeant in the Myanmar Air Force, explained to VOA from an undisclosed location on the Thai-Myanmar border, 'Many of the Russian-made Yak-130s are out of service, so the Chinese jets are now critical to the military’s operations.' He added that the Chinese jets are already used in combat, with several stationed at key air bases. Zay Ya, who served in Myanmar’s Air Force for nearly a decade, deserted the military following the February 2021 overthrow of an elected government and is now assisting fellow former service members who have joined the Civil Disobedience Movement against the military junta. Based on his hands-on experience with the Myanmar Air Force, Zay Ya pointed out that Russia’s aircraft are high-cost and fuel-consuming, while Chinese planes are more compatible with Myanmar’s existing defense industry. 'The Russian-made Sukhoi Su-30 — four of them arrived before the FTC-2000G — but the FTC-2000G can be used immediately,' Zay Ya said. VOA’s Burmese Service contacted the Myanmar government’s military information team in Nay Pyi Taw and the Chinese Embassy in Yangon and Washington, D.C., regarding the delivery of FTC-2000G jets but has not yet received a response. Use of FTC-2000G The FTC-2000G’s ability to carry missiles, rockets and bombs has significantly enhanced the junta’s airstrike capabilities, particularly in conflict zones like northern Shan State and areas controlled by the Brotherhood Alliance, an ethnic armed group near the Chinese border, according to the observers. A report by Justice for Myanmar and Info Birmanie highlighted how China's FTC-2000G aircraft have been used for air raids on civilian areas. On Jan. 16, 2024, opposition forces downed an FTC-2000G jet involved in an attack over the Namhpatkar region in northern Shan State. In December 2023, another FTC-2000G jet dropped bombs on residential buildings near Namkham. ‘It will not shift the balance’ Dr. Abdul Rahman Yaacob, an expert on Southeast Asia’s defense and security issues with Lowy Institute, commented on the broader implications of the jet deliveries. 'China is clearly taking sides in the civil war,' he told VOA. 'It shows that China is not a neutral actor in the Myanmar crisis by supplying arms to the junta.' While the delivery of combat aircraft may give the junta some tactical advantage, Yaacob said, 'Overall, it will not shift the balance to the side of the junta. The junta is actually facing a counterinsurgency. An insurgency campaign cannot be dealt with just by air power alone. It has to be fought by foot soldiers. And this is where the junta is facing a major problem — it has a shortage of manpower.' Several experts believe China’s actions are about more than military support. Jason Tower, the country director for the Burma program at the United States Institute of Peace, or USIP, told VOA, 'It’s very clear that China still sees the Myanmar military as the government of Myanmar, and it seems unlikely that over the short term, China’s posture is going to change.' He argues that the sale of the fighter jets signals China’s intention to maintain stability in Myanmar and convince other international actors to accept the military junta. Thomas Kean, a senior consultant at the International Crisis Group, said China’s goal is to stabilize Myanmar and protect its strategic interests. 'I think China wants stability and a degree of normalization,' Kean said. 'China is pushing for a deal between the military and ethnic armed groups.' Civilian impact, international calls The conflict has displaced millions, with the United Nations estimating that more than 2.3 million people have fled their homes since the coup. Bombings have targeted schools, hospitals, and residential areas with little regard for civilian lives, according to the U.N. The international community has condemned Myanmar’s military for its atrocities. In a statement to the U.N. Human Rights Council, Nicholas Koumjian, head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, said, 'In many instances, civilians are not just collateral damage but the target of attacks, which appear intended to create terror.' Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Justice for Myanmar, have called on China to stop arms transfers to the junta.	https://www.voanews.com/a/observers-chinese-made-fighter-jets-play-key-role-in-deadly-airstrikes-in-myanmar/7816747.html	2024-10-09T15:45:21-07:00	
Though voter fraud rare, US election offices feature safeguards to catch it	NEW YORK — You've heard the horror stories: Someone casting multiple ballots, people voting in the name of dead relatives, mail-in ballots being intercepted. Voter fraud does happen occasionally. When it does, we tend to hear a lot about it. It also gets caught and prosecuted. The nation's multilayered election processes provide many safeguards that keep voter fraud generally detectable and rare, according to current and former election administrators of both parties. America's elections are decentralized, with thousands of independent voting jurisdictions. That makes it virtually impossible to pull off a large-scale vote-rigging operation that could tip a presidential race — or almost any other race. 'You're probably not going to have a perfect election system,' said Republican Trey Grayson, a former Kentucky secretary of state and the advisory board chair of the Secure Elections Project. 'But if you're looking for one that you should have confidence in, you should feel good about that here in America.' What's stopping people from committing voter fraud? Voting more than once, tampering with ballots, lying about your residence to vote somewhere else, or casting someone else's ballot are crimes that can be punished with hefty fines and prison time. Non-U.S. citizens who break election laws can be deported. For anyone still motivated to cheat, election systems in the United States are designed with multiple layers of protection and transparency intended to stand in the way. For in-person voting, most states either require or request voters provide some sort of ID at the polls. Others require voters to verify who they are in another way, such as stating their name and address, signing a poll book or signing an affidavit. People who try to vote in the name of a recently deceased friend or family member can be caught when election officials update voter lists with death records and obituaries, said Gail Pellerin, a Democratic in the California Assembly who ran elections in Santa Cruz County for more than 27 years. Those who try to impersonate someone else run the risk that someone at the polls knows that person or that the person will later try to cast their own ballot, she said. What protections exist for absentee voting? For absentee voting, different states have different ballot verification protocols. All states require a voter's signature. Many states have further precautions, such as having bipartisan teams compare the signature with other signatures on file, requiring the signature to be notarized or requiring a witness to sign. That means even if a ballot is erroneously sent to someone's past address and the current resident mails it in, there are checks to alert election workers to the foul play. A growing number of states offer online or text-based ballot tracking tools as an extra layer of protection, allowing voters to see when their ballot has been sent out, returned and counted. Federal law requires voter list maintenance, and election officials do that through a variety of methods, from checking state and federal databases to collaborating with other states to track voters who have moved. Ballot drop boxes have security protocols, too, said Tammy Patrick, chief executive officer for programs at the National Association of Election Officials. She explained the boxes are often designed to stop hands from stealing ballots and are surveilled by camera, bolted to the ground and constructed with fire-retardant chambers, so if someone threw in a lit match, it wouldn't destroy the ballots inside. Sometimes, alleged voter fraud isn't what it seems After the 2020 election, social media surged with claims of dead people casting ballots, double voting or destroyed piles of ballots on the side of the road. Former President Donald Trump promoted and has continued to amplify these claims. But the vast majority of them were found to be untrue. An Associated Press investigation that explored every potential case of voter fraud in the six battleground states disputed by Trump found there were fewer than 475 out of millions of votes cast. That was not nearly enough to tip the outcome. Democrat Joe Biden won the six states by a combined 311,257 votes. The review also showed no collusion intended to rig the voting. Virtually every case was based on an individual acting alone to cast additional ballots. In one case, a man mistakenly thought he could vote while on parole. In another, a woman was suspected of sending in a ballot for her dead mother. Former election officials say that even more often, allegations of voter fraud turn out to result from a clerical error or a misunderstanding. Pellerin said she remembered when a political candidate in her county raised suspicion about many people being registered to vote at the same address. It turned out the voters were nuns who all lived in the same home. Patrick said that when she worked in elections in Maricopa County, Arizona, mismatched signatures were sometimes explained by a broken arm or a recent stroke. In other cases, an elderly person tried to vote twice because they forgot they had already submitted a mail ballot. 'You really have to think about the intent of the voter,' Patrick said. 'It isn't always intuitive.' Why voter fraud is unlikely to affect the presidential race It would be wrong to suggest that voter fraud never happens. With millions of votes cast in an election year, it's almost guaranteed there will be a few cases of someone trying to game the system. There also have been more insidious efforts, such as a vote-buying scheme in 2006 in Kentucky. In that case, Grayson said, voters complained, and an investigation ensued. Then participants admitted what they had done. He said the example shows how important it is for election officials to stay vigilant and constantly improve security in order to help voters feel confident. But, he said, it would be hard to make any such scheme work on a larger scale. Fraudsters would have to navigate onerous nuances in each county's election system. They also would have to keep a large number of people quiet about a crime that could be caught at any moment by officials or observers. 'This decentralized nature of the elections is itself a deterrent,' Grayson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/though-voter-fraud-rare-us-election-offices-feature-safeguards-to-catch-it/7816733.html	2024-10-09T15:26:18-07:00

Ukrainian news outlet says it faces 'pressure' from Zelenskyy's office	WASHINGTON — A prominent Ukrainian news outlet reported Wednesday it is facing 'ongoing and systematic pressure' from the office of the Ukrainian president that is threatening the outlet’s work. In a statement on its website, the online newspaper Ukrainska Pravda said officials are being blocked from communicating with the outlet’s journalists, its reporters are being denied access to official events and businesses are being pressured to stop advertising on its website. In the statement, the outlet also highlighted a tense exchange between Ukrainska Pravda journalist Roman Kravets and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a recent press conference. During the interaction, Zelenskyy questioned the outlet’s editorial independence. Ukrainska Pravda editor-in-chief Sevgil Musayeva told VOA it was important for the outlet to be honest with readers about the pressure it faces from the government. 'Ukraine is fighting for the right to exist but also for the right to be democratic, independent and transparent,' Musayeva said from Kyiv. 'And freedom of press and freedom of speech is one of [the] essential values of democracy. That’s why we will protect this value as much as we can,' Musayeva continued. Ukrainska Pravda said it views the government’s actions as attempts to influence the outlet’s editorial policy. The outlet has been facing this kind of pressure for about one year, but it has become even worse over the past two months, according to Musayeva. From now on, Ukrainska Pravda said, it will make public any attempts by the president’s office to pressure the outlet, according to the statement. 'Each such attempt only strengthens our motivation to expose corruption and mismanagement in the highest ranks of power,' the statement said. 'We call on everyone who values freedom of speech and the independence of Ukrainian journalism to join us in defending these values.' Media watchdogs — and Ukrainian journalists — have expressed concern about the state of press freedom in Ukraine in recent months amid Russia’s war on the country. In June, Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, said press freedom was 'shrinking' in Ukraine, with challenges that include rising political pressure, surveillance and threats. 'The pressure, threats and interference must stop,' Jeanne Cavelier, head of RSF’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk, said in the June statement. 'Despite their admirable resilience after Russia launched its full scale invasion on 24 February 2022, the Ukrainian media landscape remains fragile.' The Ukrainian president’s office, the Foreign Ministry and Ukraine’s Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA emails requesting comment for this story. Musayeva told VOA she believes the pressure is in response to critical coverage Ukrainska Pravda has produced about the Ukrainian government, including on misconduct and corruption. Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Musayeva said, there has been a sense of less tolerance for news stories critical of the government. Still, the outlet will continue to cover all aspects of government, good or bad, she said. 'We continue our critical coverage on some bad governance,' she said. 'We still see that corruption didn’t disappear.' Musayeva said she recognizes the importance for the media to cover positive stories about Ukraine. 'But at the same time, the role of independent media in democratic countries is to provide information for the people and truthful information for the people about the current situation,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-news-outlet-says-it-faces-pressure-from-zelenskyy-office/7816617.html	2024-10-09T13:13:06-07:00	
Pakistan counters criticism of crackdown on ethnic rights group	Islamabad — Pakistan has justified its decision to outlaw a regional ethnic rights movement, citing alleged incitement of violence against the state and attempts to establish a 'parallel judicial system' under the guise of peaceful public gatherings. The group, known as the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), has openly criticized the powerful Pakistani military and mainly gets support from residents of the militancy-hit northwestern tribal districts bordering Afghanistan. On Sunday, the government listed the PTM as a proscribed organization, saying it was engaged in activities 'prejudicial to the peace and security of the country.' The ban drew backlash from local and international human rights groups. Wednesday, Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told a televised news conference in Islamabad that PTM leaders were using 'abusive language' against security institutions at their rallies and promoting 'racial discrimination' in Pakistan. The ban under the country’s anti-terrorism law allowed authorities to seal PTM offices, assets and bank accounts; seize literature; and prohibit public advocacy such as media statements or speeches. Naqvi spoke hours after hundreds of enraged PTM supporters clashed with police near Peshawar, the capital of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa border province, resulting in the deaths of at least three activists. The violence took place in an area where the PTM had planned to hold a three-day public gathering Friday, called a 'Pashtun National Jirga [assembly] Court.' It was intended to protest the civilian casualties and regional losses of property and commerce due to the increased Islamist militancy and army operations to counter the threat. 'We cannot allow anyone to set up a parallel judicial system in the country,' the minister said. 'You are allowed to engage in discussions about politics and rights, but you are not allowed to encourage people to revolt against national institutions or to provoke them to take up arms against these institutions,' Naqvi stated. The independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, or HRCP, denounced the ban on the PTM as 'neither transparent nor warranted' and criticized the subsequent use of force by police against the group’s members. 'We oppose any use of unwarranted and unlawful force against those protesters who are unarmed. The state has already taken disproportionate measures by proscribing the PTM and attempting to prevent it from holding this assembly,' the watchdog said. The HRCP noted that a provincial high court ruling had protected PTM supporters’ 'right to assemble peacefully.' Amnesty International has also demanded Pakistan immediately revoke the ban on the PTM. 'The listing of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement as a proscribed organization, days ahead of their gathering scheduled on 11 October, is part of a systematic and relentless clampdown by the Pakistani authorities on peaceful protests and assemblies by dissenting groups,' the global rights defender said in a Tuesday statement. 'This latest arbitrary ban under overbroad powers of the terror law is only the tip of the iceberg — for years, the Pakistani authorities have suppressed such movements from marginalized regions by resorting to unlawful use of force, enforced disappearances, and media bans on the coverage of protests or rallies,' said Babu Ram Pant, Amnesty’s deputy regional director for South Asia. Pakistan has experienced a surge in terrorist attacks claimed by or blamed on Tehrik-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, which is listed as a terrorist group by the United Nations. An alliance of banned Pakistani groups, TTP is commonly known as the Pakistani Taliban, and its fighters are mainly active in border districts, allegedly conducting cross-border attacks from sanctuaries in Afghanistan with the support of the Taliban government there.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-counters-criticism-of-crackdown-on-ethnic-rights-group/7816630.html	2024-10-09T13:02:41-07:00

Las Vegas says goodbye to Tropicana with flashy casino implosion	LAS VEGAS — Sin City blew a kiss goodbye to the Tropicana before first light Wednesday in an elaborate implosion that reduced to rubble the last true mob building on the Las Vegas Strip. The Tropicana's hotel towers tumbled in a celebration that included a fireworks display. It was the first implosion in nearly a decade for a city that loves fresh starts and that has made casino implosions as much a part of its identity as gambling itself. 'What Las Vegas has done, in classic Las Vegas style, they've turned many of these implosions into spectacles,' said Geoff Schumacher, historian and vice president of exhibits and programs at the Mob Museum. Former casino mogul Steve Wynn changed the way Las Vegas blows up casinos in 1993 with the implosion of the Dunes to make room for the Bellagio. Wynn thought not only to televise the event but created a fantastical story for the implosion that made it look like pirate ships at his other casino across the street were firing at the Dunes. From then on, Schumacher said, there was a sense in Las Vegas that destruction at that magnitude was worth witnessing. The city hasn't blown up a Strip casino since 2016, when the final tower of the Riviera was leveled for a convention center expansion. This time, the implosion cleared land for a $1.5 billion baseball stadium for the relocating Oakland Athletics, part of the city's latest rebrand into a sports hub. That will leave only the Flamingo from the city's mob era on the Strip. But, Schumacher said, the Flamingo's original structures are long gone. The casino was completely rebuilt in the 1990s. The Tropicana, the third-oldest casino on the Strip, closed in April after welcoming guests for 67 years. Once known as the 'Tiffany of the Strip' for its opulence, it was a frequent haunt of the legendary Rat Pack, while its past under the mob has long cemented its place in Las Vegas lore. It opened in 1957 with three stories and 300 hotel rooms split into two wings. As Las Vegas rapidly evolved in the following decades, including a building boom of Strip megaresorts in the 1990s, the Tropicana also underwent major changes. Two hotel towers were added in later years. In 1979, the casino's beloved $1 million green-and-amber stained glass ceiling was installed above the casino floor. The Tropicana's original low-rise hotel wings survived the many renovations, however, making it the last true mob structure on the Strip. Behind the scenes of the casino's grand opening, the Tropicana had ties to organized crime, largely through reputed mobster Frank Costello. Costello was shot in the head in New York weeks after the Tropicana's debut. He survived, but the investigation led police to a piece of paper in his coat pocket with the Tropicana's exact earnings figure, revealing the mob's stake in the casino. By the 1970s, federal authorities investigating mobsters in Kansas City charged more than a dozen operatives with conspiring to skim $2 million in gambling revenue from Las Vegas casinos, including the Tropicana. Charges connected to the Tropicana alone resulted in five convictions. There were no public viewing areas for the event, but fans of the Tropicana did have a chance in April to bid farewell to the vintage Vegas relic. 'Old Vegas, it's going,' Joe Zappulla, a teary-eyed New Jersey resident, said at the time as he exited the casino, shortly before the locks went on the doors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/las-vegas-says-goodbye-to-tropicana-with-flashy-casino-implosion-/7816292.html	2024-10-09T09:17:49-07:00	
Kenyan lawmakers impeach deputy president for abuse of office	Nairobi — Kenya’s National Assembly has impeached the country's deputy president over accusations of corruption and abuse of office. Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to remove Rigathi Gachagua from office in the vote Tuesday night. The fate of the deputy president now rests in the hands of the Senate. The process to consider removal of Kenya's deputy president from office moved to the Senate Wednesday after parliamentarians approved a motion to do so Tuesday night. Ahead of the vote, embattled deputy president Rigathi Gachagua and his allies presented his defense to the National Assembly for more than 90 minutes. But the lawmakers were not swayed, and 281 of them approved a motion to remove Gachagua from office. Forty-four others voted against the motion, and one abstained. Gachagua was accused of acquiring properties through corrupt means, though he argued the assets belonged to his late brother. He is also accused of practicing ethnic politics and acting to undermine the government. The impeachment comes after Gachagua's fell out with President William Ruto. The deputy president has denied all the allegations against him, calling them outrageous and saying they are propaganda meant to tarnish his name. Political commentator Martin Andati said the way in which Gachagua works with other politicians and the people cost him his job. 'His fate is sealed. He antagonized the MPs, he antagonized the Senate by talking badly about the chambers and the speakers, and generally, he is not a pro-people person. He has poor people management skills,' he said. Some members of parliament, like Robert Mbui, who is also deputy leader of the minority, were against the impeachment. He said the house should concentrate on public issues instead of debating one man. 'The cost of living has gone too high, people have no jobs, Mr. Speaker. Those are the things that this house should passionately deal with, but for a whole day, even the last two or three weeks to deal with one matter, I think we are losing direction. It's important that we deal with things that are affecting our people,' he said. In the past four months, Kenya has witnessed a wave of protests aimed at President Ruto's government over allegations of corruption by some politicians and government officers. Kenyans also protested high taxes and parliament’s alleged failure to act independently from the president. Some politicians have accused the deputy president of helping to organize anti-government protests, an accusation Gachagua denies. Kenyan political expert Harman Manyora said the parliament is setting a dangerous precedent that threatens the country's political future and ethnic cohesion. '[It] should not surprise us. In the future, we can have governments fall in the manner in which governments come and go in parliamentary democracies like India, Israel, the UK, and Italy, which I doubt we can withstand. From a political front, this is also a country with a lot of flashpoints. It is an ethnically charged country, and a move like this has the potential of negatively impacting the country by causing division, and you can never know where it can lead us,' said Manyora. The debate and voting about Gachagua’s conduct will continue next week. After that, some believe the issue may go to court, where he could seek legal help to either keep his job or clear his name of the allegations against him.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-lawmakers-impeach-deputy-president-for-abuse-of-office/7816273.html	2024-10-09T08:58:15-07:00	
Republicans, Democrats work to preempt fraud claims ahead of election	ANN ARBOR, FLINT AND DETROIT, MICHIGAN — U.S. election officials in battleground states are pushing back against disinformation about election integrity and working to assure Americans that their votes will be counted. Officials from both major parties in six states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — met in Ann Arbor, Michigan, last month for panel discussions hosted by the nonpartisan group Keep our Republic. The group seeks to educate the American public about threats to the U.S. election system and build trust in the electoral system. They’re working to avoid a repeat of November 2020 scenes in nearby Detroit and other American cities where supporters of then-President Donald Trump, riled up by his baseless accusations of election fraud, pressured officials to stop counting the votes. This year, many Trump supporters who spoke with VOA say they worry about fraud in this election. 'Right now, our government, you're going to question everything about it,' said Marvin Minton, a Trump supporter who attended the Republican presidential nominee's town hall event in Flint, Michigan, in September. 'I wish I could say differently, but that's not how America feels. We don't trust nobody.' Angelina Kandow, who was also at the Flint event, said, 'Was [the 2020 election] stolen or not? One case, one case is enough to question the whole system.' Some Trump supporters quoted alleged instances of 2020 election fraud that were disproven during court cases triggered by the more than 60 lawsuits filed by Republicans and the Trump campaign after that year’s election. Disinformation around election integrity has gained traction among Republicans, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and USAFacts poll, released in August. The poll found 67% of Republicans trust Trump and his campaign for accurate information on the outcome of the election. Only 51% of Republicans said they trust the government’s certification of election results. In contrast, 87% of Democrats trust government certifications, while 82% trust Vice President Kamala Harris, the party’s presidential nominee, and her campaign. Dangerous disinformation Officials in battleground states say disinformation can be dangerous. 'They can in some cases lead to people making threats to election officials or worse, based on lies or misinformation they have been told about elections,' said Jonathan Brater, director of the Michigan Bureau of Elections. 'Even if it doesn't result in any sort of physical violence, it does undermine trust long term in the election system, which is bad for our republic and is bad for our democracy,' he told VOA. Meagan Wolfe, an election official in Wisconsin, another battleground state, has been targeted with intimidation, even death threats. Republicans loyal to Trump have attempted to oust her over false claims that she helped to rig the 2020 vote in favor of President Joe Biden. Wolfe encouraged people who don’t trust the election process to become involved. 'They can become a poll worker. They can become a poll observer. They can watch the audits of the voting equipment,' she told VOA.' All of that is open for [the] public to view.' In many states, efforts to ensure voters that elections are secure are supported by Republicans. Justin Roebuck, a Republican election official in Ottawa County, Michigan, acknowledges it’s an uphill battle. 'Our political leaders at every level need to also seek facts and to seek data,' he told VOA. 'And I think until that happens, we will have a problem in terms of our confidence and trust in the process.' Roebuck said he is working directly with citizens, instead of through the campaigns. 'We have very decentralized elections in the United States. There are always things that we can do better,' he said. 'Sometimes we have to work through those challenges and work through those messes.' Messy in Michigan It’s already looking like it could become messy in Michigan. Republicans loyal to Trump have sued Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, over absentee ballot processing guidelines and voter registration lists. 'If Jocelyn Benson is not responding to what is required under the law, we will take her to court to get the courts to compel her to do that,' Michigan Republican Party chairperson Pete Hoekstra told VOA. Benson dismissed it as a Republican strategy to create a 'false sense of irregularities in the process.' 'In general, we see lawsuits masquerading as a legal strategy when they're really a PR strategy to get misinformation or sow seeds of doubt about our elections into the narrative,' she told VOA. She said that there are 'more checks and balances in place than ever before' to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the election process. Both parties have launched election-related lawsuits in various battleground states, which could mean chaos in the November election. 'Any kind of legal challenge happening this close to an election, typically, is lawyers putting a placeholder in case they may not win in a state or may not have an outcome they like, and it gives them the ability to challenge the election after the fact,' said Kim Wyman, senior fellow with the Bipartisan Policy Center's Elections Project in Washington. There are other potential disruptions, including efforts to delay election certification by county officials who support Trump. 'We've seen some legal maneuvers and some boards of elections that have changed the rules that allow more scrutiny over the canvas period and the certification of the election,' Wyman told VOA. After Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 loss culminated in the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, Congress sought to prevent such events from recurring by passing the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act. Mandatory deadline The reforms set a new mandatory December 11 deadline for states to submit certified slates of presidential electors, provided expedited court access to resolve challenges and raised the threshold for objecting to election results in Congress. Battleground states Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina have passed legislation to ensure that canvasses, recounts, audits and legal challenges meet the new deadline. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have not, leaving their electoral systems vulnerable to partisan lawsuits and political pressures that could force them to miss the certification deadline. This could leave uncertain the fate of 29 electoral college votes. A presidential candidate needs at least 270 electoral college votes to win.

Taliban publicly flog 9 Afghan men, women despite UN outcry	ISLAMABAD — Hardline Taliban authorities in Afghanistan reported Wednesday that nine people, including at least two women, were publicly flogged after being convicted of various crimes, such as adultery. Five of the punishments took place at a sports stadium in Kandahar, capital of the eponymous southern province. Local Taliban officials, judicial officers, and ordinary Afghans were among the onlookers. The Taliban’s Supreme Court announced the details, saying the five individuals were found guilty of adultery, sodomy, and robbery, with each of them receiving 39 lashes and prison sentences ranging from two to seven years. It did not say whether females were among the convicts. The court separately announced that two men and two women were publicly flogged Wednesday for adultery in the northern Afghan provinces of Takhar and Samangan. Hundreds of men and women have been lashed in sports stadiums across Afghanistan since the Taliban regained power in 2021. In June this year, the Islamist leaders carried out a mass lashing of 63 convicts, including 14 women, in a packed northern sports stadium for committing 'immoral crimes,' such as adultery and homosexuality. The Taliban have also executed at least five Afghan murder convicts in crowded sports stadiums, citing the Islamic concept of retributive justice known as qisas. Global outcry The executions and corporeal punishments have drawn an outcry and calls from the United Nations to immediately end them for being in breach of human rights and international law. Taliban leaders defend their criminal justice system, arguing that it is in line with their interpretation of the Islamic law of Sharia. They also rejected criticism of their curbs on Afghan women’s access to education, employment, and public life at large. The United States and the world at large have refused to recognize Taliban authorities as the official government of Afghanistan, citing their treatment of women, among other human rights concerns. 'We continue to make clear that any significant steps towards normalization of relations is contingent upon a profound shift in the Taliban’s human rights conduct,' said Matthew Miller, the U.S. State Department spokesperson, speaking to reporters Tuesday. 'And there has been remarkable unity among the international community on that question.' Girls ages 12 and older are not allowed to attend secondary school, making Afghanistan the only country in the world with this restriction, while female students have been barred from universities. Most Afghan women are prohibited from working in both public and private sectors, including the U.N. The Taliban last month enacted so-called 'vice and virtue' laws that, according to critics, have dealt another blow to women’s rights in Afghanistan. The contentious decree deems the sound of a woman’s voice in public a moral violation and requires them to cover their entire bodies and faces when outdoors. It also forbids women from looking at men to whom they are not related and vice versa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-publicly-flog-9-afghan-men-women-despite-un-outcry/7816230.html	2024-10-09T08:44:12-07:00	
Expansion of ASEAN-China free-trade pact questioned amid summit	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — As Laos hosts this year’s summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Beijing is calling for additions to its free-trade agreement with the regional forum that focus on smart cities, 5G, artificial intelligence and e-commerce. Ahead of the ASEAN summit, which began Sunday and ends Friday, Chinese state media have stepped up efforts to promote the benefits of what they call an upgrade to the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area, or CAFTA, agreement. Analysts point out that the two sides have not reached agreement on what’s being called 'CAFTA 3.0,' and that it remains to be seen whether including China's electric vehicles and e-commerce would benefit Southeast Asian industries that are struggling to compete with their Chinese counterparts. 'The establishment of a free-trade demonstration zone is actually nothing more than the hope that things can be sold into China,' Ming-Fang Tsai, a professor in the Department of Industrial Economics at Taiwan’s Tamkang University, told VOA. However, he said the Chinese market is facing a lack of domestic demand and overproduction, leading to price competition. 'So, is the FTA 3.0 really an upgrade? Actually, it is a big question mark,' he said by email. Nevertheless, some specific areas in the 3.0 agreement still attract the attention of experts, including its focus on the EV industry. Although ASEAN is also actively developing an EV industry, He Jiangbing, a China-based economist and finance commentator, told VOA if China's major EV manufacturers pour into Southeast Asia through changes in the agreement, it would likely have a huge impact on the local automobile industries. 'China’s mainland started relatively early in new-energy vehicles and has developed rapidly for 10 years. But the automotive industry in ASEAN is relatively weak. If China's new-energy vehicles are sold in ASEAN, it will be difficult for Southeast Asian [traditional] car companies to resist,' He said. Southeast Asia's own automobile industry will be greatly affected or cease to exist, He said. But Lu Xi, a senior lecturer at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, told VOA that most of China's EVs are not getting into Southeast Asia through exports but through production-line transfer, similar to joint ventures, so a price war should not cause a negative impact. 'With the transfer of [China's EV] manufacturing industry chain, the economic structure of Southeast Asia will undergo a huge transformation,' Lu said by email. 'Depending on the current political and economic situation between China and the US, Southeast Asia itself also has a very broad local market and a very good young population structure, so on the whole, the Southeast Asian market should be one of the important engines of economic growth in the whole region in the future.' Tsai noted that Chinese manufacturers will set up factories in Southeast Asia to avoid the 'Made in China' label and restrictions on Chinese products. 'U.S. controls on technology may affect the components of EVs in the future,' he said, 'which brings great pressure to Chinese manufacturers.' In addition to EVs, the 3.0 agreement also focuses on smart cities, 5G, artificial intelligence and e-commerce. Analysts say China’s e-commerce is already having a negative impact on the region as orders of cheaper Chinese imports and knockoffs are flooding Southeast Asia. Half of the ceramic factories in Thailand's northern Lampang province have closed, and Indonesian textile workers are facing mass layoffs, the South China Morning Post and the Bangkok Post reported. 'In the face of the massive entry of the [Chinese] e-commerce, frankly speaking, these Southeast Asian countries are relatively uncompetitive,' said Tsai. 'Because first, [they] will not be able to compete with China in marketing and sales. Second, [China's] own products are cheaper. 'If my entire e-commerce system is better than yours,' Tsai said, 'and my products are not more expensive than yours, then how can you compete with me?' Nonetheless, in a September speech for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, in Nanning, China, ASEAN Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn called on businesses to take full advantage of the partnership as they move toward the changes. He touted the RCEP, the world’s largest trade bloc, covering nearly 30% of global gross domestic product at $29 trillion and 2.3 billion people across the Asia Pacific region. 'ASEAN’s multidirectional economic relations have been a major driver behind the use of RCEP,' said Hourn, according to a written statement. 'China, for example, has remained ASEAN’s largest trading partner for the past 15 years and has also climbed from the 5th largest source of FDI to ASEAN in 2022 to the 3rd largest in 2023. With both RCEP and ACFTA 3.0 in place, I am confident that trade and investment between ASEAN, China, and the rest of the RCEP partners will continue to flourish for the benefit of the people in this wider region.' ASEAN calls the free-trade agreement ACFTA; Beijing refers to it as CAFTA. The agreement was established by China and ASEAN in 2009, and the ASEAN-China Summit announced the launch of negotiations for the changes in November 2022.

Wimbledon tennis tournament replaces line judges with AI in break with tradition	LONDON — That long-held Wimbledon tradition of line judges dressed in elegant uniforms is no more. The All England Club announced Wednesday that artificial intelligence will be used to make the 'out' and 'fault' calls at the championships from 2025. Wimbledon organizers said the decision to adopt live electronic line calling was made following extensive testing at the 2024 tournament and 'builds on the existing ball-tracking and line-calling technology that has been in place for many years.' 'We consider the technology to be sufficiently robust and the time is right to take this important step in seeking maximum accuracy in our officiating,' said Sally Bolton, chief executive of the All England Club. 'For the players, it will offer them the same conditions they have played under at a number of other events on tour.' Bolton said Wimbledon had a responsibility to 'balance tradition and innovation.' 'Line umpires have played a central role in our officiating setup at the championships for many decades,' she said, 'and we recognize their valuable contribution and thank them for their commitment and service.' Line-calling technology has long been used at Wimbledon and other tennis tournaments to call whether serves are in or out. The All England Club also said Wednesday that the ladies' and gentlemen's singles finals will be scheduled to take place at the later time of 4 p.m. local time on the second Saturday and Sunday, respectively — and after doubles finals on those days. Bolton said the moves have been made to ensure the day of the finals 'builds towards the crescendo of the ladies' and gentlemen's singles finals, with our champions being crowned in front of the largest possible worldwide audience.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/wimbledon-tennis-tournament-replaces-line-judges-with-ai-in-break-with-tradition-/7816112.html	2024-10-09T07:07:00-07:00	
Mozambicans casts ballots in election that may prolong ruling party dominance	Maputo — Mozambicans vote Wednesday between the party that has dominated their country’s political landscape for nearly 50 years or something different. Whoever wins will inherit major challenges, including an insurgency in the oil and gas-rich area of Cabo Delgado. Voters braved morning rain in Maputo to line up as early as 7:00 am to cast their ballots. They have four candidates to choose from; Daniel Chapo, the ruling Frelimo party leader; Ossufo Momade, the candidate of one main opposition party that came in second in the last presidential election; Lutero Simango, the leader of the Mozambique Democratic Movement and Venancio Mondlane, an independent who seems popular among youth. Aslak Ore, a researcher on Mozambique at the Christian Michelsen Institute in Norway, said that while supporters of Mondlane have shown excitement, he still faces stiff challenges. 'There’s been a lot of enthusiasm about his candidature, however he doesn’t have the electoral organization of either Renamo or Frelimo. The question is if he’s going to be able to convert that obvious enthusiasm among the population… into the votes,' he said. At a polling place at the Josina Machel secondary school in Maputo, 22-year-old Augusto Paz said he waited about an hour, but he had to make sure to vote. 'As a young Mozambican man, I feel like this is important because it might be the choice that would change things in our country. I am talking about healthcare, education, and development in general,' he said. After casting his ballot, Sergio Pantie, a member of parliament and Frelimo supporter, told us he is confident his party will win. 'People continue to love and highly consider Frelimo as an option to continue running this country... the results will prove, once again, that Frelimo is loved and esteemed by the Mozambican people,' he said. Two of the candidates, Momade and Simango, voted at the same polling place where outgoing President Filipe Nyusi casts his ballot. Former St. Lucia prime minister Dr. Kenny Anthony, who arrived in Maputo on October 2nd, heads the Commonwealth International Observers’ delegation. He told VOA his group was still visiting other polling stations and getting reports from other parts of the country. Meanwhile... 'There seems to be some optimism that this is going to be a better administered election than previous elections. Whether that will be the case, I don’t know… we’ve just visited this polling station, and all seem to have gone on very well here,' he said. Whoever wins these elections will inherit many challenges starting with the economy and debt repayments, Ore said. 'It’s between 12 and 14 billion dollars in external debt. Recently they have been able to pay back much of that debt, but they have done so by way of accumulating a lot of domestic debt. The state takes up loans from the banking system and institutions locally, so they are accumulating debt at the same time as they are paying back the external debt,' said Ore. In addition to debt challenges, the government has been battling an insurgency in the gas- and oil-rich Cabo Delgado province, where about 4,000 people have been killed and about 1 million displaced since 2017, hindering multibillion-dollar oil and gas projects. Some countries, including Rwanda, have stepped in recently to help quell the insurgency -- an act that Adriano Nuvunga, a social activist and director of the Center for Democracy and Human Rights in Mozambique, disagrees with. 'Mozambique, big as it is, massive as it is… 33 million people… but it needs to import soldiers from Rwanda to protect its sovereignty… Rwanda, a tiny country of 13 million people to protect us here,' said Nuvunga. Ruling party candidate Chapo said if he wins, securing the Cabo Delgado area will be his top priority because without security, there is no development he recently told supporters. Nuvunga said while Frelimo was seen as a liberation movement 50 years ago, times have changed. 'The people here, they have nothing to do with what people did five decades ago. It’s about today; are you able to put in place credible policies and put in place a credible system of governance that would work for the people,' said Nuvunga. More than 17 million people are registered to vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambicans-casts-ballots-in-election-that-may-prolong-ruling-party-dominance/7816076.html	2024-10-09T06:49:51-07:00

Study: Climate change made deadly Hurricane Helene more intense	Washington — Hurricane Helene's torrential rain and powerful winds were made about 10% more intense due to climate change, according to a study published Wednesday by the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group. Although a 10% increase 'might seem relatively small... that small change in the hazard really leads to big change in impacts and damage,' said climate scientist Friederike Otto, who heads the research organization. The study also found that fossil fuels — the primary cause of climate change — have made hurricanes like Helene 2.5 times more likely to occur. In other words, storms of Helene's magnitude were formerly anticipated once every 130 years, but now the probability is closer to once every 53 years, on average. To conduct the study, researchers focused on three aspects of Hurricane Helene: precipitation, winds and the water temperature of the Gulf of Mexico — a key factor in its formation. 'All aspects of this event were amplified by climate change to different degrees,' Ben Clarke, a co-author of the study and researcher at Imperial College London, told a press conference. 'And we'll see more of the same as the world continues to warm,' he continued. The research by WWA, an international group of scientists and meteorologists who study the role of climate change in extreme weather events, comes as the southeastern US state of Florida prepares for the arrival of another major hurricane, Milton, just 10 days after it was hit by Helene. Destruction Helene made landfall in northwestern Florida on September 26 as a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 140 mph (225 kph). The storm then moved north, causing heavy rain and devastating floods in several states, including North Carolina, where it claimed the highest death toll. The authors of the study emphasized that the risk posed by hurricanes has increased in scope beyond coastal areas. Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at NGO Climate Central, said Helene 'had so much intensity' that it would take time for it to lose strength, but the 'storm was moving fast... so it could go farther inland pretty quickly.' This study utilized three methodologies to examine the three aspects of the storm, and was conducted by researchers from the US, the UK, Sweden and the Netherlands. To study its rainfall, researchers used an approach based on both observation and climate models, depending on the two regions involved: one for coastal areas like Florida, and another for inland areas like the Appalachian mountains. In both cases, the study found precipitation had increased by 10 percent because of global warming, which is currently at 1.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. To study Helene's winds, scientists looked at hurricane data dating back as far as 1900. They determined Helene's winds were 11 percent stronger, or 13 mph (21 kph), as a result of climate change. Lastly, the researchers examined the water temperature in the Gulf of Mexico, where Helene formed, finding it was around 2 degrees Celsius above normal. This record temperature was made 200 to 500 times more likely due to climate change, the study asserts. Warmer oceans release more water vapor, providing more energy for storms as they form. 'If humans continue to burn fossil fuels, the US will face even more destructive hurricanes,' Clarke warned in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/study-climate-change-made-deadly-hurricane-helene-more-intense/7815932.html	2024-10-09T04:33:35-07:00

China says Taiwan president increasing 'hostility'	BEIJING — China has accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of escalating 'hostility' and pursuing independence, as the self-ruled island prepared to celebrate its National Day. China, which split with Taiwan at the end of a civil war in 1949, regards the island as part of its territory that must eventually be reunified, by force if necessary. Lai, who took power in May after his Democratic Progressive Party won a record third term, has been a vocal defender of Taiwan's sovereignty, angering Beijing. Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman for a Chinese body in charge of Taiwan affairs, said Lai had 'recycled the 'Taiwan independence' fallacy once again' and exposed 'his malicious intent to escalate hostility and confrontation.' Zhu's remarks, reported by state media late Tuesday, were in response to Lai saying it was 'impossible' for China to be the 'motherland' of Taiwan. 'One of the most important meanings of these celebrations is that we must remember that we are a sovereign and independent country, and we must always cherish and love our country,' Lai said Saturday ahead of Taiwan's National Day. Three members of the U.S. Congress will be among the foreign guests in attendance when Lai delivers his National Day speech on Thursday, which will likely touch on the island's China policies. China's defense spokesman Wu Qian said Wednesday that the United States was 'adding fuel to the fire on the Taiwan issue' by providing arms to Taipei, and 'pushing Taiwan step by step into a dangerous situation of war.' Taiwan was on alert for Chinese military drills near the island on National Day after observing 'some maritime deployments,' a senior security official told AFP on Wednesday. Beijing maintains a near-daily military presence around Taiwan and in the past two years China has held three rounds of large-scale war games, deploying aircraft and ships to encircle the island. Chinese President Xi Jinping recently used his country's national day celebrations to reiterate his call for the reunification of China and Taiwan. 'Achieving complete national reunification is the common aspiration of the Chinese people,' Xi said. 'It is an irreversible trend, a matter of justice, and it is in accordance with the popular will. No one can stop the march of history,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-taiwan-president-increasing-hostility-/7815846.html	2024-10-09T02:41:05-07:00

China says anti-dumping move on EU brandy is legitimate trade measure	BEIJING — China's anti-dumping measures against brandies imported from the European Union are 'legitimate trade remedy measures,' the commerce ministry said on Wednesday, a day after imposing the temporary curb. French brands such as Hennessy and Remy Martin will face the strictures, adopted just days after the 27-nation bloc voted for tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs), sparking its biggest trade row with Beijing in a decade. China's commerce ministry said preliminary findings of an investigation showed that dumping of brandy from the European Union threatened 'substantial damage' to domestic industry. On Wednesday the ministry said the EU's actions against Chinese EVs 'seriously lack a factual and legal basis' and 'clearly violate' World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. China has protested strongly to the WTO, it added. Trade tensions have surged since the European Commission said last week it would press ahead with tariffs on China-made EVs, even after Germany, the bloc's largest economy, rejected them. Another sign of rising trade tension was the ministry's remarks on Tuesday that an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into EU pork products would deliver 'objective and fair' decisions when it wraps up. It also said it was considering a hike in tariffs on imports of large-engine vehicles, which would hit German producers hardest. German exports to China of vehicles with engines 2.5 liters in size, or larger, reached $1.2 billion last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-anti-dumping-move-on-eu-brandy-is-legitimate-trade-measure/7815829.html	2024-10-09T01:45:11-07:00	
British Foreign Secretary Lammy to visit China in bid to reset ties, sources say	BEIJING — Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy will visit China next week, sources familiar with the plan said, as the new Labor government seeks less confrontational ties with the world's second-largest economy and to resume trade and investment talks. British officials have said they want to recalibrate many of the previous Conservative Party-led government's positions on China, which it described as an 'epoch-defining challenge,' particularly around accepting Chinese job-creating investment. But Britain is unlikely to budge on issues such as Chinese firms' involvement in providing key infrastructure, human rights and restoring the license of state broadcaster CGTN, as it is controlled by China's ruling Communist Party. Lammy, who has vowed to overhaul Britain's ties with China, will meet Chinese officials in Beijing and representatives of British firms in Shanghai, two of the four sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. His itinerary has not yet been finalized, however, another person familiar with the planning said. A Foreign Office spokesperson said ministerial travel would be announced in the usual way. China's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. During a telephone call in August, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who took office the previous month, told Chinese President Xi Jinping their countries must be able to talk frankly about disagreements while pursuing closer economic ties and co-operation on global issues. British finance minister Rachel Reeves is also considering traveling to China in the near future, said two sources. Her visit will aim to revive trade and investment talks that are supposed to take place annually. The last round of the UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue, as it is called, was held in 2019. China is Britain's sixth largest trading partner, accounting for 5% of total trade, British government figures show. But questions on Hong Kong, espionage accusations, and plans for a new Chinese embassy in London await resolution and may slow plans to resume talks and promises of fresh investment. Last week, two Britons, including a former researcher for a senior British lawmaker, pleaded not guilty to a charge of spying for China. That followed China's accusation in June that British foreign intelligence service MI6 recruited two staff members from unnamed state bodies to act as spies. Beijing is also waiting for a go-ahead on plans to build a new embassy in London after they were thrown out on security grounds in December 2022. In recent years, the two countries have also traded barbs on Hong Kong, a former British colony handed back to Beijing in 1997.

US considers breakup of Google in landmark search case	NEW YORK — The U.S. said on Tuesday it may ask a judge to force Alphabet's Google to divest parts of its business, such as its Chrome browser and Android operating system, that it says are used to maintain an illegal monopoly in online search. In a landmark case, a judge in August found that Google, which processes 90% of U.S. internet searches, had built an illegal monopoly. The Justice Department's proposed remedies have the potential to reshape how Americans find information on the internet while shrinking Google's revenues and giving its competitors more room to grow. 'Fully remedying these harms requires not only ending Google's control of distribution today, but also ensuring Google cannot control the distribution of tomorrow,' the Justice Department said. The proposed fixes will also aim to keep Google's past dominance from extending to the burgeoning business of artificial intelligence, prosecutors said. The Justice Department might also ask the court to end Google's payments to have its search engine pre-installed or set as the default on new devices. Google has made annual payments - $26.3 billion in 2021 - to companies including Apple and other device manufacturers to ensure that its search engine remained the default on smartphones and browsers, keeping its market share strong. Google, which plans to appeal, said in a corporate blog post that the proposals were 'radical' and said they 'go far beyond the specific legal issues in this case.' Google maintains that its search engine has won users with its quality, adding that it faces robust competition from Amazon and other sites, and that users can choose other search engines as their default. The world's fourth-largest company with a market capitalization of over $2 trillion, Alphabet is under mounting legal pressure from competitors and antitrust authorities. A U.S. judge ruled on Monday in a separate case, that Google must open up its lucrative app store, Play, to greater competition, including making Android apps available from rival sources. Google is also fighting a Justice Department case that seeks the breakup of its web advertising business. As part of its efforts to prevent Google's dominance from extending into AI, the Justice Department said it may seek to make available to rivals the indexes, data and models it uses for Google search and AI-assisted search features. Other orders prosecutors may seek include restricting Google from entering agreements that limit other AI competitors' access to web content and letting websites opt out of Google using their content to train AI models. Google said the AI-related proposals could stifle the sector. 'There are enormous risks to the government putting its thumb on the scale of this vital industry — skewing investment, distorting incentives, hobbling emerging business models — all at precisely the moment that we need to encourage investment,' Google said. The Justice Department is expected to file a more detailed proposal with the court by Nov. 20. Google will have a chance to propose its own remedies by Dec. 20. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta's ruling in Washington was a major win for antitrust enforcers who have brought an ambitious set of cases against Big Tech companies over the past four years. The U.S. has also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Apple claiming they illegally maintain monopolies. Some of the ideas in the Justice Department's proposals to break up Google had previously garnered support from Google's smaller competitors such as reviews site Yelp and rival search engine company DuckDuckGo. Yelp, which sued Google over search in August, says spinning off Google's Chrome browser and AI services should be on the table. Yelp also wants Google to be prohibited from giving preference to Google's local business pages in search results.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-considers-breakup-of-google-in-landmark-search-case/7815797.html	2024-10-09T00:44:25-07:00	
Grazer beats the behemoth that killed her cub to win Alaska's Fat Bear Contest	ANCHORAGE, Alaska — In a storyline better befitting a melodrama than a popularity vote, Grazer won her second Fat Bear Contest Tuesday by defeating the male behemoth that killed her cub this summer. Grazer beat Chunk by more than 40,000 votes cast by fans watching live cameras at explore.org of Alaska’s Katmai National Park and Preserve. Fans cast votes online for their favorite chunky competitor in tournament-style brackets that begins with 12 bears. They picked the bear they believe best exemplifies winter preparedness by the fat they have accumulated over the summer feeding on the sockeye salmon that return to Brooks River. The bears often perch at the top of a falls in the river, grabbing leaping salmon out of the air as the fish attempt to hurdle the waterfall to spawn upstream. This is where Grazer’s cub died after it slipped over the waterfall and was killed by Chunk, perhaps the most dominant brown bear on the river. Grazer fought Chunk in an effort to save the cub, but it later died. The death was captured on the live cameras. Another death was captured live by the cameras just last week, delaying the release of the tournament bracket for a day. Bear 402, a female bear that was supposed to be a contestant in this year’s contest, was killed by a male brown bear the day the brackets were expected to be released. Grazer has conspicuously blond ears and a long, straight muzzle, according to her bio page at explore.org. 'She is a formidable presence on Brooks River. Her fearlessness and strength have earned her respect, with most bears avoiding confrontation,' it says. Her other surviving cub from her third litter placed second two weeks ago in the Fat Bear Junior contest. Chunk is perhaps the largest bear on the river, with narrow-set eyes, dark brown fur and a distinctive scar across his muzzle, his bio says. He used his size to rise to the top of the river hierarchy this year and secured the prime fishing spots. 'Chunk’s confidence and aggression paid off, allowing him to feast on 42 salmon in 10 hours,' it says. 'His physical success is evident in his bulky form.' Adult male brown bears typically weigh 270 to 410 kilograms in mid-summer. By the time they are ready to hibernate after feasting on migrating and spawning salmon — each eats as many as 30 fish per day — large males can weigh well over 454 kilograms. Females are about one-third smaller. The annual contest, which drew more than 1.3 million votes last year, is a way to celebrate the resiliency of the 2,200 brown bears that live in the preserve on the Alaska Peninsula, which extends from the state’s southwest corner toward the Aleutian Islands. In addition to the live cameras, Katmai has become a bucket list tourist destination and viewing stands have been built on the river to allow people to watch the brown bears fish for salmon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/grazer-beats-the-behemoth-that-killed-her-cub-to-win-alaska-s-fat-bear-contest-/7815789.html	2024-10-09T00:31:44-07:00	
Brazilian nun awarded UN refugee prize for work with migrants	BRASILIA, Brazil — A Brazilian nun who has helped refugees and migrants for 40 years on Wednesday won the Nansen prize awarded every year by the U.N. High Commission for Refugees for outstanding work to protect internally displaced and stateless people. Sister Rosita Milesi, 79, is a member of the Catholic order of the Scalabrini nuns, who are renowned for their service to refugees worldwide. Her parents were poor farmers from an Italian background in southern Brazil, and she became a nun at 19. As a lawyer, social worker and activist, Milesi championed the rights and dignity of refugees and migrants of different nationalities in Brazil for four decades. The UNHCR Nansen Refugee Award was established in 1954 in honor of Norwegian humanitarian, scientist, explorer, and diplomat Fridtjof Nansen. UNHCR announced the award in Geneva. Milesi joins a long list of distinguished global laureates, including former U.S. first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, the first person to receive the award when it was set up in 1954, the charity Medecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) and Germany's former chancellor Angela Merkel. She is the second Brazilian to receive the award. Former Sao Paulo Archbishop Dom Paulo Evaristo Arns won the prize in 1985. Milesi leads the Migration and Human Rights Institute (IMDH) in Brasilia, through which she has helped thousands of forced migrants and displaced people access essential services such as shelter, healthcare, education and legal assistance. She coordinates RedeMIR, a national network of 60 organizations that operates throughout Brazil, including in remote border regions, to support refugees and migrants. Her work has had a significant impact on Brazil's legal landscape, including the shaping of its 1997 refugee law and the 2017 migration law, which enshrined critical protections for displaced people and reduced the risk of statelessness, UNHCR said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazilian-nun-awarded-un-refugee-prize-for-work-with-migrants/7815775.html	2024-10-09T00:04:01-07:00

Renewable energy to fall short of UN goal to triple by 2030, IEA says	LONDON — Renewable energy sources are set to meet nearly half of all electricity demand by the end of the decade, but to fall short of a U.N. goal to triple capacity to reduce carbon emissions, an International Energy Agency (IEA) report showed on Wednesday. The world is set to add more than 5,500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity between now and 2030, almost three times the increase between 2017 and 2023, the IEA Renewables 2024 report said. It said the increase is equivalent to the current power capacity of China, the European Union, India and the United States combined, but not enough to meet a target set at the COP28 U.N. climate conference. For the world to triple capacity, governments need to intensify efforts to integrate renewables into power grids. This requires the building and modernizing of 25 million kilometers of electricity grids and reaching 1,500 GW of storage capacity by 2030, the IEA said. Solar photovoltaic (PV) is set to account for 80% of the growth in renewable energy capacity to 2030. The wind sector is also forecast to recover and double its rate of expansion to 2030 compared with 2017-2023. Global solar manufacturing capacity is expected to be more than 1,100 GW by the end of 2024, more than double the estimated demand by then. This supply glut has helped to cheapen solar module prices but also means many manufacturers are experiencing large financial losses, the report added. While the U.N. target is a challenge, national governments are hitting their goals, with 70 countries, accounting for 80% of global renewable power capacity, estimated to reach or surpass their renewable energy targets for 2030. 'Renewables are moving faster than national governments can set targets for,' IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said. 'This is mainly driven not just by efforts to lower emissions or boost energy security: it's increasingly because renewables today offer the cheapest option to add new power plants in almost all countries around the world.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/renewable-energy-to-fall-short-of-un-goal-to-triple-by-2030-iea-says/7815765.html	2024-10-08T23:29:40-07:00	
ASEAN holds summit in Laos as Thailand floats new plan for Myanmar	Vientiane, Laos — Southeast Asian leaders met in Laos on Wednesday for a summit expected to find ways of tackling a worsening civil war in Myanmar, with Thailand set to propose a new path for a political solution after a regional peace effort made scant progress. Chaos has prevailed in Myanmar since a 2021 military coup sparked a nationwide rebellion and a civil war that has ravaged the nation of 55 million. The ruling junta has so far refused to hold talks with its opponents, whom it calls terrorists. Thailand offered this week to host an 'informal consultation' of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in December to try to find a way out of the intractable conflict that has displaced millions of people. 'We want to see a political solution,' Nikorndej Balankura, a spokesperson of Thailand's foreign ministry, told reporters. 'Thailand is ready to coordinate with all other member countries so there would be a concerted ASEAN effort that could lead to peace in Myanmar.' Thailand's initiative would complement existing ASEAN peace efforts, but may not immediately involve countries beyond the region, he added. The proposal, floated at Tuesday's meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers, comes as the bloc runs low on options to tackle the Myanmar crisis. There has been no progress on its 'Five-Point Consensus' peace plan unveiled months after the coup, or a drive by Indonesia to persuade anti-junta groups to start dialog. In previous months, Thailand has suggested that Myanmar's other influential neighbors, China and India, might play a role in the peace effort, but the latest plan is limited to the ASEAN bloc. Any decision on whether Myanmar's ruling generals or their opponents would be invited to the informal talks would be up to ASEAN chair Laos and the other member states, Nikorndej added. Myanmar's civil war and troubles in the disputed South China Sea are key issues set to dominate the ASEAN leaders' meeting in Vientiane, which will be followed by two days of summits with premiers and top diplomats from regional and world powers. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Japanese premier Shigeru Ishiba, Chinese premier Li Qiang and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov are among those set to attend. Opening Wednesday's summit, Laos Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone said ASEAN faced many challenges and had its own ways to tackle them. 'Laos deems that ASEAN's past successes are due to our understanding of each other,' he said. 'We help each other, and co-operate with each other, with an ASEAN way and principles. ' Ahead of Blinken's trip, the United States' top diplomat for East Asia, Daniel Kritenbrink, told reporters there had been 'virtually zero progress' in efforts to get Myanmar's junta to reduce violence, free political prisoners and talk to the democratic opposition. 'The secretary will continue to emphasize to partners in the region that we must keep up pressure on the regime,' he said, of Blinken's visit. Since ASEAN has barred the Myanmar generals from its summits until they can meet requirements of the peace plan, the country is represented in Laos by a senior foreign ministry official. Nikorndej said Myanmar's representative urged ASEAN foreign ministers on Tuesday to understand and sympathize with the military government and use more 'moderate language' in discussing the crisis. ASEAN must not bend to accommodate the junta's demands, including recognizing its own five-step 'roadmap' for what is expected to be a one-sided election, however, former Thai diplomat Korbsak Chutikul warned. 'Care must be exercised not to be roped into going along with Myanmar's own five-point plan, like to hold elections next year for a semblance of legitimacy,' Korbsak said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/asean-holds-summit-in-laos-as-thailand-floats-new-plan-for-myanmar-/7815760.html	2024-10-08T23:16:28-07:00	
Daughter of Singapore's founding father dies at 69	SINGAPORE — The estranged sister of Singapore's former Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong died on Wednesday at 69, after being diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy in 2020. The death of Lee Wei Ling, a doctor, was announced by her younger brother Lee Hsien Yang on Facebook. The siblings are the children of Singapore's founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and have been embroiled in a public dispute around what to do with their late father's house after the elder Lee died in 2015. The former PM Lee, now a senior minister in the cabinet, wrote on Facebook that despite the rift between him and his siblings, 'I held nothing against Ling, and continued to do whatever I could to ensure her welfare.' He described his sister as a fighter who was 'fiercely loyal to friends, sympathized instinctively with the underdog, and would mobilize actively to do something when she saw unfairness, or suspected wrongdoing.' The late doctor earned the prestigious President's scholarship and topped her cohort in medical school. Lee never married and stayed with her parents until their deaths. She helped set up Singapore's National Neuroscience Institute and served as its director for 11 years. She also regularly contributed columns to the national newspaper, The Straits Times. Senior minister Lee said his sister had diagnosed herself before the doctors did. 'She took it with her usual fortitude and stoicism and posted about it as one of those things in life to be borne and endured. She knew what it meant, and made the most of the time she had, even as her health declined,' he wrote. When announcing her illness, Wei Ling wrote: 'My immediate reaction to the news was 'ren', or endure in Chinese, of which the traditional character has a knife above a heart. I have been practicing 'ren' since I was in Chinese school, recognizing that life has many unpleasant, unavoidable situations.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/daughter-of-singapore-s-founding-father-dies-at-69/7815752.html	2024-10-08T22:39:39-07:00

Cameroon citizens want proof their 91-year-old president is alive	Yaounde, Cameroon — Cameroon government officials said the central African state’s 91-year-old president, Paul Biya, is in good health, contrary to information circulating on social and mainstream media. Biya has not been seen in public since his official visit to China more than 1 month ago. Citizens say they want proof that their longtime leader is well. Biya is in excellent health, according to a statement issued Tuesday by Samuel Mvondo Ayolo, director of the Civil Cabinet. Ayolo said Biya is in Geneva, Switzerland, where he has been granting audiences and working for the development of Cameroon. The statement comes after social media reports on Tuesday said Biya was dead but gave no details as to where and when the long-serving leader had died. Biya was last seen in Beijing over a month ago during a China-Africa leaders forum. In the meantime, some citizens said they do not believe Biya is alive. One of those is Gloria Wirkom, a businessperson in Cameroon's capital, Yaounde. 'He is our president, and if there is something wrong with him, we have the right to know,' she said. 'So we are pleading with the government of Cameroon to let us know the health state [state of health] of our president.' Wirkom said she does not trust government officials' declarations that Biya is in good health. Wirkom said she will believe Biya is alive only when she sees him. On Cameroon State TV, government spokesperson Rene Emmanuel Sadi said he unequivocally affirms that the rumors of Biya’s death are pure imagination. Sadi said the day after the China-Africa summit, Biya stayed briefly in Europe, and that wherever he might be, Biya is attentive to the well-being of Cameroonians. Akongnwi Neba, a merchant, said it is wrong for the government to wait until a rumor spreads before explaining where Biya is. 'We are asking the government to prove to us where he [Biya] is,' said Neba. 'We need to know his whereabouts, whether he is alive or dead. It is our right as citizens of the country to know where our president is.' Cameroon officials have not said whether Biya will appear in public in Geneva. VOA could not independently confirm whether Biya was in the Swiss city. Biya is the oldest leader in the world. He has ruled Cameroon for more than four decades, and his supporters have been holding public rallies asking him to be a candidate in elections expected in October 2025. Biya has not said whether he will run for president again.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-citizens-want-proof-their-91-year-old-president-is-alive-/7815653.html	2024-10-08T20:06:27-07:00	
China stock market stalls for lack of further stimulus measures	TAIPEI, Taiwan — China's stock rally resumed Tuesday after the weeklong National Day holiday but lost some steam on mainland markets after a press conference by the country’s economic planning agency disappointed hopes for more fiscal stimulus measures. In Hong Kong, the day ended with chunky losses of nearly 10%. Early in the day, the Shanghai Composite Index rose more than 10%, the Shenzhen Component Index was up more than 12%, and the ChiNext Index rose 18%, continuing a rise that began late last month with the announcement of stimulus measures, ranging from rate cuts to looser curbs on house buying. The rally stalled, however, as the National Development and Reform Commission, at a press conference intended to further boost market confidence, failed to announce any specific stimulus measures. By day’s end, the Shanghai Composite Index rose 4.59%, the Shenzhen Component Index was up 9.17%, and the ChiNext Index rose 17.25% to mark its largest-ever, single-day increase. But in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index traded low throughout the day, returning the gains registered before the National Day holiday and closing down 9.41%. Investors hoped the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s state economic planning body, would roll out more detailed stimulus measures at the Tuesday briefing. Chairman Zheng Shanjie told reporters that he had 'full confidence' the economy would reach its official full-year growth target of about 5%. He said China will introduce policies to specifically strengthen or stabilize five aspects in the early stage, including the economic downturn, insufficient domestic demand, the difficulties of some enterprises, the continued weakness of the property market and the capital markets. Chin-Yoong Wong, a professor of economics at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman in Malaysia, said the NDRC's target issues are 'very to the point but insufficient in implementation,' because the NDRC has not proposed precise and feasible countermeasures, and the scale of implementation is unclear. Wong said much of what has been promised by the NDRC includes spending plans that were already in place 'rather than additional fiscal stimulus for China's economic downturn.' He said the NDRC has talked a lot about boosting consumer confidence but has not issued any specific practical policies to achieve that, leaving shareholders to question whether the talk will be backed with action. Liu Meng-Chuh, director of the First Research Division at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research in Taipei, said external factors are contributing to the volatility of China's stock markets. He told VOA, 'On the one hand, China's [favorable policies] are not so strong; [on the other hand], the U.S. economy is not so bad, so maybe much international hot money has begun to flow back [to the U.S.].' However, Liu believes that there is still room for development in green industries and infrastructure for an aging society. He said that China's urban population is about 60% to 70% of its entire population, which is lower than the average of about 80% in mature economies, meaning that the dividends of China's 'urbanization' have not yet been exhausted. But he stressed that the feasibility has to be well-assessed to avoid repeating mistakes made in the past. Tsai Ming-Fang, a professor of industrial economics at Tamkang University, said China's foreign relations are not improving, causing foreign trade issues that are difficult to solve, such as the new tariffs imposed by Canada and the European Union on Chinese electric vehicles. Tsai said the stimulus measures in the past two weeks are not designed to revive the economy but to beautify the data to achieve the economic growth target of 5% this year, which may allow some shareholders and even foreign investors to liquidate their positions and take profits. 'China's only goal now is to reach the economic growth rate of 5%,' Tsai said. 'Many problems arise from the drastic changes in Chinese laws [in recent years], which have led to a lack of confidence of manufacturers in China.' Adrianna Zhang contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-stock-market-stalls-for-lack-of-further-stimulus-measures/7815706.html	2024-10-08T19:52:42-07:00

FBI arrests Afghan man officials say plotted Election Day attack in US	washington — The FBI has arrested an Afghan man who officials say was inspired by the Islamic State militant organization and was plotting an Election Day attack targeting large crowds in the United States, the Justice Department said Tuesday. Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, told investigators after his arrest Monday that he had planned his attack to coincide with Election Day next month and that he and a juvenile co-conspirator expected to die as martyrs, according to charging documents. Tawhedi, who entered the U.S. in 2021 on a special immigrant visa, had taken steps in recent weeks to advance his attack plans, including by ordering AK-47 rifles, liquidating his family's assets, and buying one-way tickets for his wife and child to travel home to Afghanistan. 'Terrorism is still the FBI's number one priority, and we will use every resource to protect the American people,' FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. After he was arrested, the Justice Department said, Tawhedi told investigators he had planned an attack for Election Day that would target large gatherings of people. Tawhedi was charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State group, which is designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization. It was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-arrests-afghan-man-officials-say-plotted-election-day-attack-in-us-/7815360.html	2024-10-08T16:49:00-07:00

Religious education surges under Taliban as secular schooling languishes	Washington — The number of madrassas, or religious schools, has increased fourfold under the Taliban in Afghanistan as experts worry that the rise could fuel extremism in the country and limit opportunities for younger Afghans, particularly girls. 'In the past year, at least 1 million children have been enrolled in madrassas for religious education,' said Karamatullah Akhundzada, the deputy minister of education, in a September news conference. The year’s new enrollments brought the total to 3.6 million students at more than about 21,000 madrassas registered in the country, This shift marks a change in the educational landscape in Afghanistan, where madrassas now outnumber the more than 18,000 public and private schools. Jennifer Brick Murtazashvili, founding director of the Center for Governance and Markets at the University of Pittsburgh, told VOA that the increase in the number of madrassas is part of the Taliban's effort to establish control. 'It's important to look at madrassas together with local governance. Under the republic [former Afghan government], there was no formal village governance, but the Taliban have replaced that with religious leaders who now hold local power,' Murtazashvili said. Before the Taliban seized power in 2021, there were about 5,000 madrassas registered across Afghanistan. After returning to power, the Taliban aimed to transform the education system. Officials at the Taliban Ministry of Education said they have taken steps to 'revise and reform' textbooks and curricula in the schools in the past three years. Before the Taliban, more than 9 million students were enrolled in all types of schools, with 39% of them girls. Following the Taliban's return to power, the group imposed a ban on girls' secondary education, making Afghanistan the only country in the world to restrict girls from attending secondary school. The Taliban ban on secondary education deprived about 1.5 million girls of going to school. Murtazashvili sees the ban on girls attending school beyond the sixth grade as a clear sign of extremism. 'By robbing girls of education, they are robbing the country of its future,' Murtazashvili said, adding that 'you're not going to have a future of women nurses and doctors. You're going to see mortality increase.' One young woman who spoke to VOA but did not want her name used was in 11th grade when the Taliban took power in 2021 and banned secondary education for girls. She said she enrolled in a madrassa in Herat City, hoping to continue her education, but was 'disappointed.' 'At first, I thought I could learn and reconnect with friends, but it felt more like brainwashing,' she said, adding that 'they kept telling us education wasn't for us. We should become good housewives and give birth to future Islamic leaders.' After three months, 'disheartened with the restrictive environment,' she quit the madrassa. Mohammad Moheq, former Afghan ambassador to Egypt and author of many books on Islam and Afghanistan, told VOA the Taliban push their strict interpretation of Islam through these madrassas. 'Their goal is to stop people from thinking for themselves and push their strict version of Islam that fits their political agenda,' Moheq said. Madrassas played an important role in the Taliban's rise to power in the late 1990s as many of the Taliban were graduates of madrassas in neighboring Pakistan. In April 2022, the Taliban announced their plan to open three to 10 new madrassas in every district in Afghanistan. 'Religious sciences should be further taught throughout Afghan society,' said Noorullah Mounir, the then-minister of education, as he urged Afghan teachers to instill an 'Islamic belief' in their students. Saba Hanif, a professor at the University of Education in Lahore, Pakistan, told VOA that there is a need for the international community to talk to the Taliban to find 'a middle ground' and blend religious and 'worldly' education. 'They should agree on certain terms and show the Taliban how purely religious education could harm the country's future, particularly in terms of job opportunities and economic growth,' Hanif said. She added that if children are exposed to 'only one way of thinking and one way of living life,' it will perpetuate extremism. 'This will be quite obvious. And it could be very dangerous for the region because, you know, of their past practices. They try to force it on others, and they also don't hesitate in using power to control others,' Hanif said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/religious-education-surges-under-taliban-as-secular-schooling-languishes/7815283.html	2024-10-08T15:49:05-07:00

Burkina Faso suspends VOA broadcasts	washington — Authorities in Burkina Faso on Monday suspended Voice of America for three months over comments made by one of the network's journalists. The junta also temporarily banned local news outlets from using any international media reports, the reports said. Burkina Faso's superior council for communication, also known as CSC, accused VOA of demoralizing troops in Burkina Faso and nearby Mali in a broadcast on September 19, according to media reports. The interview was later aired by a privately owned local radio station, according to Reuters. In the communique that banned local news outlets from using any international media reports, the CSC said it noted the 'dissemination of information of a malicious and biased nature' by national outlets using international media reports. In the communique, which did not specifically mention VOA, the CSC said such reports tend to 'insidiously apologize for terrorism.' The phone number listed online for the CSC was not working. VOA attempted to request comment via an online form on the CSC website, but it returned an error message. VOA and its parent organization, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Burkina Faso's Foreign Ministry did not reply to VOA's email requesting comment for this story. Earlier suspension This would not be the first time VOA has been suspended in Burkina Faso. Authorities suspended VOA and the BBC in April following the broadcast of news stories about a Human Rights Watch report accusing the Burkinabe army of abuses against civilian populations. 'VOA stands by its reporting about Burkina Faso and intends to continue to fully and fairly cover events in that country,' VOA's then-acting director John Lippman said in a statement about the April suspension. Military leaders in Burkina Faso seized power in a coup in September 2022. Since then, media watchdogs have documented a decline in media freedoms, with media outlets suspended and foreign correspondents expelled. In 2021, Burkina Faso ranked 37 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media environment. This year, Burkina Faso ranked 86.	https://www.voanews.com/a/burkina-faso-suspends-voa-broadcasts-/7815277.html	2024-10-08T14:58:42-07:00	
US stresses desire for peaceful resolution of Taiwan disputes	WASHINGTON — A top U.S. official said the United States expects differences across the Taiwan Strait to be resolved peacefully and opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo as Taiwan prepares to celebrate the founding of the Republic of China on Thursday. The People's Republic of China, or PRC, celebrates its national day on October 1, marking the founding of the country in 1949. Taiwan chooses October 10, known as Double Ten Day, to celebrate the founding of the ROC in 1912, just months after an uprising that began on October 10, 1911. The PRC typically closely monitors speeches from Taiwan’s leaders during Double Ten Day celebrations. Since Taiwan’s democratically elected President Lai Ching-te took office in May, Beijing has increased military pressure on Taiwan, deeming Lai a 'separatist.' On Tuesday, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink said that the U.S.'s 'fundamental interest is in the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,' reiterating that Washington’s longstanding One China policy remains unchanged, 'guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques and the Six Assurances.' 'We oppose unilateral changes to the status quo by either side. We do not support Taiwan independence, and we expect cross-strait differences to be resolved peacefully,' Kritenbrink told VOA during a briefing. Speaking at an event Saturday, Lai noted that the PRC celebrated its 75th anniversary on October 1, and in a few days, it would be the ROC’s 113th birthday. 'In terms of age, it is absolutely impossible for the People’s Republic of China to be considered the motherland of the people of the Republic of China. On the contrary, the ROC may be the motherland of the people of the PRC who are over 75 years old,' Lai told an audience in Taipei. PRC officials have remained largely muted on Lai’s remarks, but some analysts say that could be because Beijing is preparing to launch another round of military exercises after Lai delivers his Double Ten Day speech. U.S. officials have referred inquiries to 'President Lai’s office for any commentary on his specific comments.' European visit Meanwhile, former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen will visit the Czech Republic this month, a visit seen as sensitive since Beijing has repeatedly denounced the democratic leader as a 'separatist.' In Beijing on Tuesday, a spokesperson from the PRC’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs was asked to comment on Tsai’s planned visit to Prague. 'We firmly oppose anyone who seeks 'Taiwan independence' visiting countries with diplomatic ties with China under any pretext. We urge the Czech Republic and relevant countries to earnestly abide by the One China principle and respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters Tuesday. Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong's communists took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang nationalists in a civil war, prompting the nationalists' relocation to the island. The U.S. does not maintain an official relationship with Taiwan but provides defense equipment to the self-ruled democracy under the Taiwan Relations Act. Treaty of Aigun In a TV interview in September, Lai remarked that if China's claims over Taiwan are genuinely rooted in concerns about territorial integrity, it should also seek to reclaim the land it ceded to Russia in the 19th century. He referenced the 1858 Treaty of Aigun, through which China, under the Qing dynasty, gave up a vast area of land — now part of Russia’s Far East — to the Russian Empire, establishing much of the modern border along the Amur River. The Treaty of Aigun, along with the 1860 Convention of Peking, saw China relinquish 600,000 square kilometers — an area almost the size of Ukraine — to the Russian Empire, enabling Russia to establish a naval base at Vladivostok. Many Chinese people still brood over this period of history, harboring lingering resentment over the fact that the land once belonged to China before being annexed by Russia. In 2023, China’s Ministry of Natural Resources mandated that new maps use Chinese names for Vladivostok — Haishenwai — as well as several other cities in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-stresses-desire-for-peaceful-resolution-of-taiwan-disputes/7815248.html	2024-10-08T14:26:30-07:00	
UN Rights Council says human rights in DR Congo on a downward spiral	GENEVA — Human rights experts warn the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, already troubled for decades, is on a downward spiral again as armed clashes, attacks on schools and hospitals, sexual violence and other forms of abuse escalate. Kicking off a discussion of the DRC at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk urged the international community to pay more attention to the plight of Congolese civilians victimized by a 'volatile mix of escalating violence, regional and international interests, exploitative businesses and weak rule of law.' He said the number of victims of human rights violations is growing, with armed groups fighting in the eastern provinces responsible for most of these violations, including 'deadly attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including schools and hospitals.' He said sexual violence is spreading despite efforts to prevent and investigate cases. 'The armed groups take people prisoners, subject women and girls to sexual slavery. Many of them have been killed after being raped. These cases, of course, have not all been reported. This is atrocious,' he said. 'Human rights violations committed by the defense and security forces during their military operations against armed groups, also remain of concern,' he said noting that hate speech and other incitement to discrimination and violence 'are fueling the conflict and increasing political tensions across the country.' Türk appealed to countries of influence to use their power to ensure the fighting stops, stating that 'any role played by Rwanda in supporting the M23 in North Kivu, and by any other country supporting armed groups active in the DRC, must end.' Responding to Türk's comments, DRC Minister of Human Rights Chantal Shambu Mwavita said her government has made great progress in protecting human rights, in spite of challenges posed by the war in the east. Alluding to Rwanda, she pointed her finger at so-called 'negative forces' supporting the armed groups from the outside. She 'called on the international community to condemn these actions strongly and to impose targeted sanctions on Rwanda for its destabilizing role.' Mwavita said the war in the eastern provinces is closely linked to the seizure and illegal exploitation of her country's natural resources by Rwanda and other countries. She also demanded the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Rwandan troops from DRC territory. North Kivu and surrounding provinces of the eastern DRC have been wracked by violence for decades, as armed groups battle for control of the region's rich natural resources. Rwanda has denied supporting the M23 rebels, with Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe renewing that denial on Saturday. The minister, who was attending a two-day 'Francophonie' summit in Paris, accused his Congolese counterpart of refusing to sign 'an agreed deal' to resolve the M23 rebel conflict in the DRC. On Tuesday, Rwanda's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, James Ngango, also expressed concern about the escalation of abuse and human rights violations in the eastern DRC, 'particularly sexual violation and violation against children in the region affected by armed conflict and inter community conflicts,' he said. He said Rwanda remains committed to dialogue and the regional peace processes. He said, 'No military solution can address the root causes of the conflict in eastern DRC.' It is unclear whether the DRC's demand for the withdrawal of Rwandan forces will be met, nor is it clear if and when MONUSCO, the U.N.'s peacekeeping force, will withdraw from the country as demanded by the government of Felix Tshisekedi. The U.N. says the peacekeepers, who were supposed to leave by the end of the year, apparently have been given a reprieve. Several thousand soldiers remain in North and South Kivu and Ituri provinces. Bintou Keita, special representative of the secretary-general in the DRC and head of MONUSCO, made little reference to the potential consequences for the stability of the DRC once U.N. peacekeepers leave the country. However, she painted a worrying picture of human rights in the DRC due to 'the deteriorating security situation' in the eastern provinces from attacks on civilians, 'causing loss of human lives and mass displacements of peoples towards Kinshasa and Kisangani.' 'The M23, in the quest for territorial gains, extended its hold on territories towards Lubero Kanyabayonga, which was captured in late June after intense fighting. Hospitals and IDP sites were deliberately targeted by M23. Several civilians fled their homes, further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis,' she said. She affirmed that MONUSCO 'will continue to provide its support to the DRC … in strict conformity with the U.N. human rights due diligence policy, including support for the establishment of the human rights compliance framework.' Keita added, 'The return of peace to the DRC will come about through pooled military and non-military efforts to find lasting solutions, both national and regional.' Conflict in the DRC has come at a high price. The United Nations said the country is struggling with twin humanitarian crises — an internal displacement crisis and a food crisis. It reports that 7.2 million people currently are internally displaced, and nearly 26 million face acute hunger.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-rights-council-says-human-rights-in-dr-congo-on-a-downward-spiral/7815258.html	2024-10-08T14:20:39-07:00	
US looks to resurrect more nuclear reactors, White House adviser says	NEW YORK — The Biden administration is working on plans to bring additional decommissioned nuclear power reactors back online to help meet soaring demand for emissions-free electricity, White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said Monday. Two such projects are already under way, including the planned recommissioning of Holtec's Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan and the potential restart of a unit at Constellation Energy's Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, near the site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. Asked if additional shuttered plants could be restarted, Zaidi said, 'We're working on it in a very concrete way. There are two that I can think of.' He declined to identify the power plants or provide further details about the effort. Speaking at the Reuters IMPACT conference in New York, Zaidi said repowering existing dormant nuclear plants was part of a three-pronged strategy of President Joe Biden's administration to bring more nuclear power online to fight climate change and boost production. The other two prongs include development of small modular reactors (SMRs) for certain applications, and continuing development of next generation, advanced nuclear reactors. Biden has called for a tripling of U.S. nuclear power capacity to fuel energy demand that is accelerating in part due to expansion of power-hungry technologies like artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Last week, the Biden administration said it closed a $1.52 billion loan to resurrect the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan, which would take two years to reopen. Constellation and Microsoft, meanwhile, signed a power deal last month to help resurrect a unit of the Pennsylvania plant, which Constellation hopes will also receive government support. Zaidi told the conference that the U.S. Navy on Monday had requested information to build SMRs on a six bases. 'SMR is a technology that is not a decades-away play. It's one that companies in the United States are looking to deploy in this decade,' he said. Zaidi also addressed the woes that have beset a separate Biden clean energy goal, to bring 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity online by the end of the decade. The administration shelved offshore wind lease sales this year in both Oregon and the Gulf of Mexico due to low demand from companies, as high costs, equipment issues and supply chain challenges hit other projects. Zaidi said at least half of the 30GW goal is already under construction and that some of the early snags provide helpful learning for future projects. 'I am pretty optimistic about the next wave of projects where we will have a domestic supply chain and hopefully better cost to capital relative to what projects are facing right now,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-looks-to-resurrect-more-nuclear-reactors-white-house-adviser-says-/7815232.html	2024-10-08T13:54:32-07:00

Kenya's parliament overwhelmingly votes to impeach deputy president	NAIROBI, Kenya — Kenya's lawmakers approved a motion Tuesday to impeach the country's deputy president, following daylong discussions and after Rigathi Gachagua appeared in parliament to defend himself against several charges, including allegations that he supported anti-government protests in June. The motion was approved by a 281-44 vote in favor of impeachment, well above the 117 votes constitutionally required. The motion now goes to the parliament's upper house, which will debate the matter and also hold a vote. For impeachment to be final, it will need the additional backing of two-thirds of senators in the upper house. It's not clear when that vote will take place. Under Kenya's constitution, the removal from office is automatic if approved by both chambers, though Gachagua can challenge the action in court — something he has said he would do. The deputy president is also accused of being involved in corruption and other irregularities. He denies all the charges against him. The debate surrounding his fate has extended beyond parliament — supporters and opponents of the motion clashed last week in public forums after the ruling alliance brought the motion before parliament. In his speech, Gachagua declared that he was 'undergoing a political process' and asked legislators to make their decision 'without intimidation and coercion.' On Monday, the deputy president had said he believed the motion had the president's blessings. President William Ruto has yet to publicly comment about the impeachment but is on record in the earlier days of his presidency saying he would not publicly humiliate his deputy, alluding to the troubled relationship he had with his predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta, during their second term in office. On Sunday during a prayer meeting at his residence, Gachagua implored Ruto, legislators and Kenyans to forgive him for any wrongdoing during his tenure. He clarified that statement on Monday, saying it was not an admission of guilt and dismissed rumors that he would resign. Gachagua told lawmakers Tuesday that some of the properties listed in the impeachment motion as his belonged to his late brother. He also defended renovation expenditures for his official residence, saying it was in a state of disrepair and needed to be 'dignified.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-s-parliament-overwhelmingly-votes-to-impeach-deputy-president-/7815216.html	2024-10-08T13:49:23-07:00	
Officials: Voting to go ahead in Mozambique's volatile Cabo Delgado	Maputo. Mozambique — Election officials in Mozambique say voting will take place Wednesday in volatile Cabo Delgado province, despite threats from Islamic State militants who are active in the region. Regina Matsinhe, the spokesperson for Mozambique’s Technical Secretariat for Electoral Administration, or STAE, told VOA that plans have been made to ensure voting goes well in Cabo Delgado. She said authorities are working with Cabo Delgado officials to ensure the safety of election workers, who are using several transportation options to make sure voting materials reach their intended destinations. Matsinhe said aerial means, sea boats, cattle-drawn carts, motorbikes and people will be used to carry materials from one point to another. Cabo Delgado province has 1.4 million registered voters, nearly one-tenth of Mozambique’s 17 million voters. Those voters head to the polls Wednesday to elect the next president, parliament and provincial assemblies. Last Friday, President Phillip Nyusi said tensions in Cabo Delgado province have eased in recent weeks after security forces carried out operations against insurgents, which included destroying camps and capturing propaganda equipment. There were security concerns after the 16-member Southern African Development Community Mission in Mozambique (SAMIM) withdrew its 3,000-person force from Cabo Delgado in July, marking the end of its peacekeeping mission in the country. However, Tanzanian troops remained and are fighting alongside Rwandan soldiers and Mozambican defense and security forces to contain the violence in Cabo Delgado. This will be Mozambique’s seventh general election since a multiparty democracy was introduced in 1994, two years after the ruling Frelimo party signed a peace deal with Renamo rebels in Rome to end a 16-year civil war that killed approximately one million people. Renamo has not won a national election since then, and Frelimo has ruled Mozambique since 1975, when the country won independence from Portugal. The chairman of Mozambique’s National Election Commission, Carlos Matsinhe, told VOA in an exclusive interview that he is optimistic the election will proceed as planned throughout Cabo Delgado. There are no signs that violence will prevent elections in any areas, Matsinhe said, 'so we are just praying that the election takes place complete in Cabo Delgado, [and] the conditions are very promising.' The election will be observed by several international organizations such as the European Union — which has sent a team of 150 — and a 52-member team from the Southern African Development Community that arrived in Maputo last Friday. Counting will begin immediately after polling stations close Wednesday evening.	https://www.voanews.com/a/officials-voting-to-proceed-in-mozambique-s-volatile-cabo-delgado/7815191.html	2024-10-08T13:28:47-07:00	
Cholera cases, deaths surge more than 200% in Nigeria	Abuja, Nigeria — Cholera is surging in Nigeria, health officials said this week, with the number of cases and deaths increasing by more than 200% this year. The Nigerian Center for Disease Control said in this week's epidemiological report that the country has recorded nearly 11,000 cases of cholera this year — a 220% increase compared with the same point in 2023. The report said fatalities over the same periods have increased from 106 to 359 — a rise of 239%. The state of Lagos accounted for 43% of the nation's cases, while Kano, Katsina, Jigawa and Borno also recorded significant numbers. Last month, the worst flooding in 30 years ravaged conflict-ridden Borno state, worsening an already dire humanitarian situation there. Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced and moved to overcrowded camps. 'We're now facing a significant public health challenge that demands urgent attention and action,' Borno Health Commissioner Baba Mallam Gana said. 'This outbreak is concerning, especially in the aftermath of a flooding incident. 'The floods have created ideal conditions for the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera by contaminating water sources and disrupting sanitation systems,' he said. Cholera is a bacterial disease, usually spread by contaminated food or water. It causes severe diarrhea and dehydration. The Nigerian CDC launched a national emergency response along with state authorities to bring numbers down, but the number of cases is surging, Gana said. 'We must now act swiftly to prevent further spread of this disease,' he said. As part of the flood intervention responses, Gana said, the Borno public health emergency center was converted into a control center to coordinate surveillance, risk communication and community engagement, as well as essential health services, infection prevention, water sanitation and hygiene. Nigeria's Health Ministry is sending hundreds of thousands of doses of cholera vaccine to the affected areas. Borno alone received 300,000 doses, and state authorities say the vaccine has been distributed to camps for those displaced by the floods.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cholera-cases-deaths-surge-more-than-200-in-nigeria/7815158.html	2024-10-08T13:28:31-07:00	
Jailed Chinese businessman’s daughter asks Xi Jinping to release her father	Washington — The daughter of imprisoned Chinese real estate tycoon Ren Zhiqiang has issued a public appeal to China’s leader, Xi Jinping, asking him to allow her father to seek medical care he needs after his health reportedly deteriorated during his time in jail. Ren, 73, is a former member of the Chinese Communist Party and chairman of the state-owned Huayuan real estate group. He was jailed after publishing an essay online in March 2020 that criticized the government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an open letter posted on the social media platform WeChat on October 2, Ren Xinyi appealed to the president’s 'humanitarian principles,' requesting that Xi release her father so that he may access treatment for his failing health and spend the last part of his life with his family. Ren Xinyi described her father as a dangerously ill, old man at risk of dying in jail. She wrote that he had long been suffering from a prostate ailment and was prescribed surgical treatment before his imprisonment. Despite previous requests that her father be allowed to undergo surgery, Ren has not yet been permitted the care his family seeks. 'I am willing to promise that my father will never make any public remarks or content after he goes abroad for treatment. He is over 70 years old and seriously ill. He has no ability to cause trouble to you and the country,' Ren Xinyi told Xi in the letter. Before his incarceration and in his prime, the former businessman was nicknamed 'Cannon Ren,' a name he gained for how frequently, and publicly, he called party policy into question. But for his release, Ren’s daughter writes that her father won’t go back to his old ways. In a translated version of the essay that prompted his arrest, Ren wrote: 'The reality shown by this epidemic is that the party defends its own interests, the government officials defend their own interests, and the monarch only defends the status and interests of the core.' The businessman also called for freedom of speech so that citizens could better protect themselves through open discourse. In a secretive trial, Ren was sentenced to 18 years in jail on counts of corruption, bribery and embezzlement of public funds. He was also fined about $600,000. His daughter’s letter was initially published to a WeChat group that included friends of Ren. One of the group’s members, political commentator and U.S. resident Cai Shenkun, confirmed to VOA that pictures released of the letter were genuine. 'In the past few years, some friends and people from all walks of life have tried to help Ren, because after all, Ren was a bold and outspoken person in the past,' said Cai. Anna Wang, founder of Photon Media and a former business owner in China, also confirmed the authenticity of the letter with several friends in Beijing familiar with Ren Zhiqiang. 'This letter is very powerful, and it’s also a call to action,' Wang said. 'I think this daughter is also very brave.' 'In China, if you want to live a life of despicable behavior, you can live well,' she continued. 'But if you want to engage in any activities that promote national progress and democracy, it will come at a painful and huge price.' In a final plea for Xi’s kindness, the letter concluded, 'President Xi Jinping, we have previously raised the above request several times through normal channels but have never received a good response. We have no choice but to use this method to reflect our desperate request to you.' The Chinese government has not publicly commented on the open petition from Ren's daughter. When asked by VOA to comment on the letter, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington D.C. said: 'the Chinese government protects the lawful rights of every citizen in accordance with the law.' (Katherine Michaelson contributed to this story.)	https://www.voanews.com/a/jailed-chinese-businessman-s-daughter-asks-xi-jinping-to-release-her-father/7815141.html	2024-10-08T12:42:10-07:00

France's minority government survives no-confidence vote, 2 weeks after taking office	PARIS — France's minority government survived a no-confidence vote on Tuesday, two weeks after taking office, getting over the first hurdle placed by left-wing lawmakers to bring down new conservative Prime Minister Michel Barnier. The vote was a key test for Barnier, whose Cabinet is forced to rely on the far right's good will to be able to stay in power. The no-confidence motion was brought by a left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front. It received 197 votes, far from the 289 votes needed to pass. The far-right National Rally group, which counts 125 lawmakers, abstained from voting. Following June-July parliamentary elections, the National Assembly, France's powerful lower house of parliament, is divided into three major blocs: the New Popular Front, French President Emmanuel Macron's centrist allies and the far-right National Rally party. None of them won an outright majority. The no-confidence motion was brought by 192 lawmakers of the New Popular Front, composed of the hard-left France Unbowed, Socialists, Greens and Communists. Barnier's cabinet is mostly composed of members of his Republicans party and centrists from Macron's alliance who altogether count just over 200 lawmakers. Left-wing lawmakers denounced the choice of Barnier as prime minister as they were not given a chance to form a minority government, despite securing the most seats at the National Assembly. This government 'is a denial of the result of the most recent legislative elections,' the motion read.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-minority-government-survives-no-confidence-vote-2-weeks-after-taking-office-/7815033.html	2024-10-08T11:19:03-07:00	
New book says Trump secretly sent COVID tests to Putin	Washington — Then-president Donald Trump secretly sent COVID test kits to Vladimir Putin despite a U.S. shortage during the pandemic, and spoke multiple times with the Russian leader after leaving office, says an explosive new book by Bob Woodward. The upcoming opus, War, also chronicles some of President Joe Biden's own acknowledged missteps and his struggle to prevent escalation of conflict in the Middle East, including exasperation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over futile efforts to get Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire. In excerpts published Tuesday by The Washington Post, where he is an associate editor, Woodward lays out damning details and actions by Trump, who the writer says has retained a personal relationship with Putin even as Trump campaigns for another presidential term and the Russian president conducts a war against Ukraine, a U.S. ally. With the coronavirus ravaging the world in 2020, Trump sent a batch of test kits to his counterpart in Moscow. Putin accepted the supplies but sought to avoid political fallout for Trump, urging that he not reveal the dispatch of medical equipment, this book says. According to Woodward, Putin told Trump: 'I don't want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me.' Woodward also cites an unnamed Trump aide in the book who indicated the Republican flag bearer may have spoken to Putin up to seven times since leaving the White House in 2021. The Post, reporting Woodward's account, said that at one point in early 2024, Trump ordered an aide out of his office in his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida so he could hold a private call with Putin. War is set for publication on Oct. 15, just three weeks before a critical U.S. election in which Trump is locked in a tight race against Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. While Harris does make appearances in the book, she is seen in a supporting role to Biden 'and hardly determining foreign policy herself,' the Post reported. Woodward has chronicled American presidencies for 50 years, and this is his fourth book since Trump's upset victory in 2016. He began his presidential reportages with Richard Nixon, who was undone by the 1970s Watergate scandal exposed by Woodward and Post colleague Carl Bernstein. Woodward concluded that Trump's interactions, detailed in the book, with an authoritarian president at war with a U.S. ally make him more unfit to be president than Nixon. 'Trump was the most reckless and impulsive president in American history and is demonstrating the very same character as a presidential candidate in 2024,' Woodward wrote. The Trump campaign blasted the book as 'trash' and 'made up stories.' They are 'the work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,' campaign communications director Steven Cheung told AFP. According to CNN, which obtained a pre-release book copy, Woodward repeatedly quotes Biden dropping F bombs as he discusses his personal and political challenges. Biden called Putin 'the epitome of evil,' blasted Netanyahu as a 'liar' and said he 'should never have picked' Merrick Garland as U.S. attorney general. According to the book, during an April phone call Biden turned testy with Netanyahu. 'What's your strategy, man?' Biden asked the Israeli leader, according to Woodward. 'We have to go into Rafah,' Netanyahu said, referring to a city in southern Gaza. 'Bibi, you've got no strategy,' Biden responded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-book-says-trump-secretly-sent-covid-tests-to-putin/7814888.html	2024-10-08T09:53:10-07:00	
Hungary’s Sovereignty Protection law a threat to independent media, analysts say	The European Commission has filed a lawsuit over Hungary’s Sovereignty Protection legislation, saying it violates EU law.

US states sue TikTok, saying it harms young users	NEW YORK/WASHINGTON — TikTok faces new lawsuits filed by 13 U.S. states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday, accusing the popular social media platform of harming and failing to protect young people. The lawsuits, filed separately in New York, California, the District of Columbia and 11 other states, expand Chinese-owned TikTok's legal fight with U.S. regulators and seek new financial penalties against the company. Washington is located in the District of Columbia. The states accuse TikTok of using intentionally addictive software designed to keep children watching as long and often as possible and misrepresenting its content moderation effectiveness. 'TikTok cultivates social media addiction to boost corporate profits,' California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. 'TikTok intentionally targets children because they know kids do not yet have the defenses or capacity to create healthy boundaries around addictive content.' TikTok seeks to maximize the amount of time users spend on the app in order to target them with ads, the states said. 'Young people are struggling with their mental health because of addictive social media platforms like TikTok,' said New York Attorney General Letitia James. TikTok said on Tuesday that it strongly disagreed with the claims, 'many of which we believe to be inaccurate and misleading,' and that it was disappointed the states chose to sue 'rather than work with us on constructive solutions to industrywide challenges.' TikTok provides safety features that include default screentime limits and privacy defaults for minors under 16, the company said. Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb alleged that TikTok operates an unlicensed money transmission business through its livestreaming and virtual currency features. 'TikTok's platform is dangerous by design. It's an intentionally addictive product that is designed to get young people addicted to their screens,' Schwalb said in an interview. Washington's lawsuit accused TikTok of facilitating sexual exploitation of underage users, saying TikTok's livestreaming and virtual currency 'operate like a virtual strip club with no age restrictions.' Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont and Washington state also sued on Tuesday. In March 2022, eight states, including California and Massachusetts, said they launched a nationwide probe of TikTok impacts on young people. The U.S. Justice Department sued TikTok in August for allegedly failing to protect children's privacy on the app. Other states, including Utah and Texas, previously sued TikTok for failing to protect children from harm. TikTok on Monday rejected the allegations in a court filing. TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, is battling a U.S. law that could ban the app in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-states-sue-tiktok-saying-it-harms-young-users/7814857.html	2024-10-08T09:29:16-07:00	
US slaps sanctions on Sudan paramilitary leader	Washington — The United States on Tuesday announced sanctions against a senior leader in war-torn Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for his role in obtaining weapons for the paramilitary organization. Tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been displaced since war broke out in April 2023 between Sudan's army and the RSF after their head generals refused a plan to integrate. Algoney Hamdan Daglo Musa was sanctioned 'for his involvement in RSF efforts to procure weapons and other military materiel that have enabled the RSF's ongoing operations in Sudan,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. His actions have fueled war in Sudan 'and brutal RSF atrocities against civilians, which have included war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing,' Miller said. The U.S. Treasury said that as a result of such sanctions 'all property and interests in property of the designated persons... that are in the United States or in the possession or control of US persons are blocked and must be reported.' The United States has led diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting in Sudan but has seen limited success and leverage, with RSF commanders unlikely to hold major assets in the West that would be affected by sanctions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-slaps-sanctions-on-sudan-paramilitary-leader/7814825.html	2024-10-08T09:13:10-07:00	
Biden postpones trip to Germany and Angola because of Hurricane Milton	Washington — President Joe Biden is postponing a planned trip to Germany and Angola to remain at the White House to monitor Hurricane Milton, which is bearing down on Florida's Gulf Coast, the White House announced on Tuesday. Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the change was necessary 'given the projected trajectory and strength' of the storm. It was not clear when the trip might be rescheduled. Biden had promised to go to Africa during his term in office, which ends in January. Hurricane Milton weakened slightly Tuesday but remained a ferocious storm that could land a once-in-a-century direct hit on the populous Tampa Bay region with towering storm surges and turn debris from Helene's devastation 12 days ago into projectiles. Most of Florida's west coast was under a hurricane or tropical storm warning as the storm and its 145 mph (230 kph) winds spun just off Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, creeping toward the state. With the storm expected to remain fairly strong as it crosses Florida, parts of the eastern coast were put under hurricane warnings early Tuesday. Milton's center could come ashore Wednesday night in the Tampa Bay area, which has a population of more than 3.3 million people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-postpones-trip-to-germany-and-angola-because-of-hurricane-milton-/7814785.html	2024-10-08T09:07:54-07:00

Eswatini groups call for 'hit list' of game rangers accused of shooting poaching suspects with impunity	Mbabane, Eswatini — The main opposition party in Eswatini is compiling a 'hit list' of game rangers in response to what it says are state-sanctioned murders of suspected poachers. Communities have been urged to assist in identifying rangers involved in the killings. As tensions mount over poaching-related deaths in Eswatini, the fear of violence looms large. Although there is no definitive count of suspected poachers killed in Eswatini's game parks, the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs estimates that dozens are slain each year. However, Eswatini's opposition parties allege hundreds of families have been impacted by these deaths and have called for a compilation of a game ranger 'hit list.' Velephi Mamba, treasurer general of main opposition party PUDEMO, one of the groups calling for possible violence against the rangers, said the news of the list of game rangers that was announced a week ago still stands. In fact, he said, it’s an ongoing issue. Mamba said his party request that all Swazis compile a list of the names of game rangers that are killing our people. Amid the growing controversy, legislators and human rights activists in Eswatini recently demanded an urgent review of the Game Act of 1991. They say the law allows game rangers in the southern African kingdom to shoot suspected poachers in national parks with little or no consequence. Human rights lawyer Sibusiso Nhlabatsi is among those calling for revision of the law. He said game rangers need to make greater efforts to arrest suspected poachers and bring them to court, rather than killing or torturing them. 'The game rangers themselves should understand that they should prioritize the use of non-lethal methods for the apprehension when dealing with suspected poachers,' Nhlabatsi said. 'The use of excessive force, in my view, does not only violate human rights but also undermines the credibility of the conservation efforts.' Mandla Motsa, a game ranger in Eswatini, defended his colleagues’ actions, saying there is an urgent need to protect endangered species in the parks from extinction, and that rangers face a formidable threat from well-armed poachers. There have been multiple reported incidents of rangers and poachers exchanging gunfire. 'We are getting a lot of pressure from poachers who are always armed and attacking the rangers on duty, while we have got organizations who feel like the poachers should be allowed to do whatever they are doing, which is against the work the rangers are doing,' Motsa said. Meanwhile, Eswatini government spokesperson Alpheous Nxumalo condemned the calls for a 'hit list' and urged citizens to shun requests to provide names. He emphasized the importance of following due process and the rule of law for achieving justice. 'Nobody should heed to such calls because they are going to lead into an escalation of violence in our communities around the country, and we know that that is the kind of atmosphere they want to create around the kingdom of Eswatini,' Nxumalo said. Legislators have begun discussing reforms to the Game Act of 1991 but so far there have been no amendments proposed, and no votes scheduled as of yet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eswatini-groups-call-for-hit-list-of-game-rangers-accused-of-shooting-poaching-suspects-with-impunity/7814647.html	2024-10-08T07:47:19-07:00	
Biggest Kashmir party opposed to India's stripping of region's autonomy wins most seats in election	SRINAGAR, India — Kashmir's biggest political party opposed to India's stripping of the region's semi-autonomy won the most seats in a local election, official data showed Tuesday, in a vote seen as a referendum against the move by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. National Conference, or NC, won 42 seats, mainly from the Kashmir Valley, the heartland of the anti-India rebellion, according to the data. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party secured 29 seats, all from the Hindu-dominated areas of Jammu. India's main opposition Congress party, which fought the election in alliance with the NC, succeeded in six constituencies. 'People have supported us more than our expectations. Now our efforts will be to prove that we are worth these votes,' Omar Abdullah, the NC leader and the region's former chief minister, told reporters in the main city of Srinagar. His father and president of the party, Farooq Abdullah, said that the mandate was to run the region without 'police raj [rule]' and try freeing people from jails. 'Media will be free,' he said. 'People have given their mandate, they have proven that they don't accept the decision that was taken on August 5,' he added referring to India's move in August 2019. The vote will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a regional legislature, called an assembly, rather than being directly under New Delhi's rule. However, there will be a limited transition of power from New Delhi to the assembly as Kashmir will remain a 'union territory' — directly controlled by the federal government — with India's Parliament as its main legislator. Kashmir's statehood must be restored for the new government to have powers similar to other states of India. Hundreds of the NC workers gathered outside counting centers and at the homes of the winning candidates to celebrate the party's victory. It was the first such vote in a decade and the first since Modi's Hindu nationalist government scrapped the Muslim-majority region's long-held semi-autonomy in 2019. The unprecedented move downgraded and divided the former state into two centrally governed union territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir. Both are ruled directly by New Delhi through its appointed administrators along with unelected bureaucrats and security setup. The move — which largely resonated in India and among Modi supporters — was mostly opposed in Kashmir as an assault on its identity and autonomy amid fears that it would pave the way for demographic changes in the region. The region has since been on edge with civil liberties curbed and media gagged. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Authorities tallied votes as thousands of additional police and paramilitary soldiers patrolled roads and guarded 28 counting centers. Nearly 8.9 million people were eligible to vote in the election, which began on Sept. 18 and concluded on Oct. 1. The overall turnout was 64% across the three phases, according to official data. In the region's legislature, five seats are appointed and 90 elected, so a party or coalition would need at least 48 of the 95 total seats to form a government. The alliance of the National Conference and the Congress have 48 seats combined. Authorities have said the election will bring democracy to the region after decades of strife, but many locals viewed the vote as an opportunity not only to elect their own representatives but also to register their protest against the 2019 changes. Except for the BJP, most parties who contested the election campaigned on promises to reverse the 2019 changes and address key issues like rising unemployment and inflation. The Congress party favored restoring the region's statehood. The BJP has also stated that it will restore statehood, but has not told when it would do. The BJP has vowed to block any move aimed at undoing most of the 2019 changes but promised to help in the region's economic development. Meanwhile, Modi's BJP appears to be heading for a victory in the northern state of Haryana, bordering New Delhi, which it has ruled for 10 years, leading in 50 constituencies and the Congress in 35 out of 90. The BJP has so far won 18 seats and is leading in 32 constituencies while the Congress has won 15 seats and is leading in 20, according to the Election Commission of India. A victory would give the BJP a record third five-year term in the state. The voting trend in Haryana state is a surprise since most exit polls had predicted an easy victory for the Congress party. Kashmir's last assembly election was held in 2014, after which the BJP for the first time ruled in a coalition with the local Peoples Democratic Party. But the government collapsed in 2018 after the BJP withdrew from the coalition. Polls in the past have been marked with violence, boycotts and vote-rigging, even though India called them a victory over separatism. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi's rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels' goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biggest-kashmir-party-opposed-to-india-s-stripping-of-region-s-autonomy-wins-most-seats-in-election-/7814622.html	2024-10-08T07:24:11-07:00	
Blinken heads to Laos for ASEAN and East Asia Summit	State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to visit Vientiane, Laos, later this week for meetings with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, where he is expected to engage directly with newly elected leaders from the Indo-Pacific. Blinken will represent President Joe Biden at this year’s ASEAN-U.S. Summit and participate in the East Asia Summit, where leaders and senior officials from India, Japan, South Korea, and the People’s Republic of China are also expected to attend. This week's ASEAN summits will feature the debut of Paetongtarn Shinawatra, 38, who became Thailand’s prime minister in mid-August. She will make her first bilateral visit to Laos on Tuesday and will be the youngest Southeast Asian leader at the summit. Singapore has also seen a generational shift with Lawrence Wong succeeding longtime Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in May. Japan's new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba took office on October 1. He has pledged to strengthen his country’s alliance with the U.S. during a call with President Biden last Wednesday. 'I am grateful for the prime minister’s commitment to the U.S.-Japan Alliance and look forward to working with his government to reinforce the enduring partnership between our two nations,' Blinken said in a statement last week. Ishiba is also in discussions with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol about holding a meeting on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit. Regional security, development and trade — including the creation of resilient semiconductor supply chains — are expected to be top priorities on the U.S. agenda. In 2023, total two-way merchandise trade between the United States and ASEAN reached $395.9 billion, making the U.S. the second-largest trading partner after China. Additionally, the U.S. is ASEAN’s largest source of foreign direct investment, which amounted to $74.3 billion last year. Susannah Patton, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Sydney-based think tank Lowy Institute, said that this year’s East Asia Summit must address contentious global issues such as the conflict in the Middle East and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The East Asia Summit comprises ASEAN’s 10 member countries and eight major dialogue partners, including the United States, China typically represented by Premier Li Qiang, and Russia represented by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In a recent analysis published by the Lowy Institute, Patton noted that it is likely that the 'ASEAN show will come to Laos and then roll on again,' adding that 'concrete progress on pressing issues will be sorely lacking.' 'While the EAS is still likely to issue at least one jointly negotiated statement in 2024,' Patton wrote, 'it is a reflection of global political polarization that ASEAN’s dialogue partners are no longer able to propose their own dueling statements to advance their preferred language on international issues.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-heads-to-laos-for-asean-and-east-asia-summit/7814614.html	2024-10-08T07:04:40-07:00	
Pioneers in artificial intelligence win the Nobel Prize in physics	STOCKHOLM — Two pioneers of artificial intelligence — John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton — won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for helping create the building blocks of machine learning that is revolutionizing the way we work and live but also creates new threats to humanity, one of the winners said. Hinton, who is known as the 'godfather of artificial intelligence,' is a citizen of Canada and Britain who works at the University of Toronto. Hopfield is an American working at Princeton. 'This year's two Nobel Laureates in physics have used tools from physics to develop methods that are the foundation of today's powerful machine learning,' the Nobel committee said in a press release. Ellen Moons, a member of the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the two laureates 'used fundamental concepts from statistical physics to design artificial neural networks that function as associative memories and find patterns in large data sets.' She said that such networks have been used to advance research in physics and 'have also become part of our daily lives, for instance in facial recognition and language translation.' Hinton predicted that AI will end up having a 'huge influence' on civilization, bringing improvements in productivity and health care. 'It would be comparable with the Industrial Revolution,' he said in the open call with reporters and the officials from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. 'Instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it's going to exceed people in intellectual ability. We have no experience of what it's like to have things smarter than us. And it's going to be wonderful in many respects,' Hinton said. 'But we also have to worry about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control.' The Nobel committee that honored the science behind machine learning and AI also mentioned fears about its possible flipside. Moon said that while it has 'enormous benefits, its rapid development has also raised concerns about our future. Collectively, humans carry the responsibility for using this new technology in a safe and ethical way for the greatest benefit of humankind.' Hinton shares those concerns. He quit a role at Google so he could more freely speak about the dangers of the technology he helped create. On Tuesday, he said he was shocked at the honor. 'I'm flabbergasted. I had, no idea this would happen,' he said when reached by the Nobel committee on the phone. There was no immediate reaction from Hopfield. Hinton, now 76, in the 1980s helped develop a technique known as backpropagation that has been instrumental in training machines how to 'learn.' His team at the University of Toronto later wowed peers by using a neural network to win the prestigious ImageNet computer vision competition in 2012. That win spawned a flurry of copycats, giving birth to the rise of modern AI. Hopfield, 91, created an associative memory that can store and reconstruct images and other types of patterns in data, the Nobel committee said. Hinton used Hopfield's network as the foundation for a new network that uses a different method, known as the Boltzmann machine, that the committee said can learn to recognize characteristic elements in a given type of data. Six days of Nobel announcements opened Monday with Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize for their discovery of tiny bits of genetic material that serve as on and off switches inside cells that help control what the cells do and when they do it. If scientists can better understand how they work and how to manipulate them, it could one day lead to powerful treatments for diseases like cancer. The physics prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the award's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. Nobel announcements continue with the chemistry physics prize on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pioneers-in-artificial-intelligence-win-the-nobel-prize-in-physics-/7814611.html	2024-10-08T06:45:07-07:00	
China targets brandy in EU trade tit-for-tat after EV tariff move	Beijing/Paris — China imposed temporary anti-dumping measures on imports of brandy from the EU on Tuesday, hitting French brands including Hennessy and Remy Martin, days after the 27-state bloc voted for tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, or EVs. China's commerce ministry said preliminary findings of an investigation had determined that dumping of brandy from the European Union threatens 'substantial damage' to its own sector. France's trade ministry said the temporary Chinese measures were 'incomprehensible' and violated free trade, and that it would work with the European Commission to challenge the move at the World Trade Organization. In a sign of the rising trade tensions, China's ministry added in another statement on Tuesday that an ongoing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into EU pork products would make 'objective and fair' decisions when it concludes. It also said that it was considering a hike in tariffs on imports of large-engine vehicles, which would hit German producers hardest. German exports of vehicles with engines of 2.5 liters or larger to China reached $1.2 billion last year. France was seen as the target of Beijing's brandy probe due to its support of tariffs on China-made EVs. French brandy shipments to China reached $1.7 billion last year and accounted for 99% of the country's imports of the spirit. As of Oct. 11, importers of brandy originating in the EU will have to put down security deposits mostly ranging from 34.8% to 39.0% of the import value, the ministry said. 'This announcement clearly shows that China is determined to tax us in response to European decisions on Chinese electric vehicles,' French cognac producers group BNIC said in an email. French President Emmanuel Macron said last week that China's brandy probe was 'pure retaliation,' while EV tariffs were needed to preserve a level playing field. Shares tumble LVMH-owned Hennessy and Remy Martin were among the brands hardest hit by the measures, with importers having to pay security deposits of 39.0% and 38.1%, respectively. The deposits would make it more costly upfront to import brandy from the EU. However they could be returned if a deal is eventually reached before definitive tariffs are imposed. Both the investigation and negotiations remain ongoing, said an executive at a leading cognac company, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. Chinese investigators visited producers in France last month and were due to make further site visits, the executive said, while Chinese and EU officials held negotiations on Monday. The outcome was unclear, however, and doubts around the EU's willingness to make a deal were emerging, they added. Shares in Pernod Ricard were down 4.2% at 0839 GMT, while Remy Cointreau's dropped 8.7% and shares in LVMH fell 4.9%. Companies that cooperated with China's investigation were hit with security deposit rates of 34.8%, with that imposed on Martell the lowest at 30.6%. Pernod Ricard, Remy Cointreau and LVMH did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The measures could mean a 20% price rise for consumers in China, said Jefferies analysts, reducing sales volumes by 20%. Remy, with the greatest exposure to the Chinese market, could see its sales decline by 6%, with Pernod group sales seeing a 1.6% impact, they said. China is the second largest export market for cognac after the United States but is the industry's most profitable territory. Difficult economic conditions in both markets have already prompted a sharp decline in cognac sales. James Sym, fund manager at Remy investor River Global, said despite this, there was no sign that demand for cognac had fundamentally changed, pointing to an uptick in cognac sales in Japan driven by Chinese tourists when the yen was weak. 'That's obviously a sign that cognac is not out of fashion,' he said, adding volumes – and the companies' share prices – should recover long-term, although the tariffs would likely hit volumes and margins while in place. Talks continue Luxury goods shares fell by as much as 7% on Tuesday, with one trader attributing this to fears that the sector, which is heavily reliant on China, could be next to see trade measures. The brandy measures follow a vote by the EU to adopt tariffs on China-made EVs by the end of October. Before the vote in late August, China had suspended its planned anti-dumping measures on EU brandy, in an apparent goodwill gesture, despite determining it had been sold in China at below-market prices. At the time, the commerce ministry said its probe would end before Jan. 5, 2025, but that it could be extended. China's commerce ministry previously said it had found that European distillers had been selling brandy in its 1.4 billion-strong consumer market at a dumping margin in the range of 30.6% to 39% and that its domestic industry had been damaged. In the EU's decision to impose tariffs on China-made EVs, the bloc set tariff rates on top of the 10% car import duty ranging from 7.8% for Tesla to 35.3% for SAIC and other producers deemed not to have cooperated with its investigation. The European Commission has said it is willing to continue negotiating an alternative, even after tariffs are imposed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-targets-brandy-in-eu-trade-tit-for-tat-after-ev-tariff-move/7814547.html	2024-10-08T06:05:25-07:00

China is oversupplying lithium to eliminate rivals, US official says	LISBON — Chinese lithium producers are flooding the global market with the critical metal and causing a 'predatory' price drop as they seek to eliminate competing projects, a senior U.S. official said on a visit to Portugal that has ample lithium reserves. Jose Fernandez, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment at the U.S. Department of State, told a briefing late on Monday that China was producing much more lithium 'than the world needs today, by far.' 'That is an intentional response by the People's Republic of China to what we are trying to do' with the Inflation Reduction Act - the largest climate and energy investment package in U.S. history valued at over $400 billion, Fernandez said. 'They engage in predatory pricing... [they] lower the price until competition disappears,’’ Fernandez said. ‘’That is what is happening.' China accounts for about two-thirds of the world's lithium chemical output, which is mainly used in battery technologies including for electric cars. Prices of lithium have fallen more than 80% in the past year largely due to overproduction from China and a drop in demand for electric vehicles. However, the price collapse is also affecting China as it has forced Chinese companies like battery giant CATL to suspend production at certain mines. Job cuts Europe aims to reduce its dependence on imports from China and other countries of lithium and other materials essential to the green transition. Fernandez said the low price 'constrains our ability to diversify our supply chains on a broad, global scale' and also hurts countries such as Portugal that need investment to develop these industries. Falling prices have forced many global lithium producers to scale back production and cut jobs. Portugal, with some 60,000 tons of known reserves, is already Europe's biggest producer of lithium, traditionally mined for ceramics. Along with neighboring Spain, the country wants to take advantage of local lithium deposits, aiming to cover the entire value chain from mining and refining to cell and battery manufacturing to battery recycling. Several mining companies in Portugal have been looking for financing, customers and suppliers to crank up projects. 'We want to help them, and we think we can... lithium mining companies, everywhere, have to survive this difficult phase that was created by predatory pricing,' Fernandez said. China's Premier Li Qiang in June used his address at a World Economic Forum meeting in Dalian to hit back at accusations from the United States and E.U. that Chinese firms benefit from unfair subsidies and are poised to flood their markets with cheap green technologies. Trade tensions intensified last Friday when the European Union said it would press ahead with hefty tariffs on China-made electric vehicles to counter what it sees as unfair Chinese subsidies, after a year-long anti-subsidy investigation. China on Tuesday imposed temporary anti-dumping measures on imports of brandy from the E.U.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-is-oversupplying-lithium-to-eliminate-rivals-us-official-says-/7814452.html	2024-10-08T04:28:34-07:00

Skechers opens store in Xinjiang amid scrutiny over Uyghur forced labor sanctions	Washington — Despite ongoing U.S. sanctions targeting Chinese companies linked to Uyghur forced labor in Xinjiang, United States-based footwear and apparel company Skechers opened a new outlet in Urumqi, the region's capital. The store opened on September 28, days before Chinese national holiday week, one of the country's busiest shopping periods. Its opening has drawn criticism from human rights advocates who question Skechers' decision to expand its presence in a region under international scrutiny and subject to U.S. import bans on goods tied to forced labor. Jewher Ilham, forced labor project coordinator at the Worker Rights Consortium, expressed concern over Skechers' decision. 'By opening a store in the Uyghur region, Skechers is making a shocking statement that it does not care about human rights,' she said. Skechers did not respond to multiple requests for comment from VOA. Xinjiang, in northwest China, has been at the center of international controversy over allegations of human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim minorities, including forced labor, mass incarceration and repression — claims Chinese authorities have consistently denied. Xinjiang produces one-fifth of the world’s cotton. In response, the United States passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in 2022, which bars goods from Xinjiang unless proven to be free of forced labor. Skechers promoted its Urumqi store opening heavily on Chinese social media, with actor and brand ambassador Donnie Yen encouraging his nearly 130 million followers on Weibo to visit the outlet and explore its 'comfortable treasures.' Yen did not respond to multiple media inquiries from VOA regarding his visit to Xinjiang or his views on the treatment of Uyghurs by Chinese authorities. Timothy Grose, an associate professor of China studies at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, pointed out that 'from a profit-seeking perspective, of course, Donnie Yen makes sense, especially since nearly 75% of Urumqi’s population is Han Chinese.' 'Unfortunately, few Han are either fully aware or are concerned about state violence against the Uyghurs, so I doubt they will be judging Donnie Yen’s appearance with their moral compasses,' he told VOA. Corporate responsibility This isn’t the first time Skechers has faced scrutiny over alleged ties to forced labor in Xinjiang. In response to a 2020 report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute alleging its supplier employed Uyghur workers under coercive conditions, Skechers denied the allegations. The company said audits of its supplier, Dong Guan Lu Zhou Shoes, found no evidence of forced labor, and that Uyghur workers were employed under the same terms as other employees. Skechers’ recent move comes as the U.S. continues to intensify its efforts to eliminate forced labor from global supply chains. On October 2, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security added two more Chinese companies to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act Entity List, bringing the total number of restricted entities to 75. 'Today’s actions reaffirm our commitment to eliminating forced labor from U.S. supply chains and upholding our values of human rights for all,' DHS undersecretary for policy Robert Silvers said in a statement on the DHS website. 'No sector is off-limits. We will continue to identify entities across industries and hold accountable those who seek to profit from exploitation and abuse.' Chinese pushback In China, Western companies that publicly declared a break from sourcing products from Xinjiang have long faced backlash from Chinese consumers. In September, PVH, parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, became the first Western firm investigated by Chinese authorities, who accused the company of violating Chinese law by allegedly halting the purchase of cotton and garments from Xinjiang. Corporate responsibility in Xinjiang has become a contentious issue. Grose pointed out that companies like Skechers may view doing business in Xinjiang and China as a safe financial bet, despite human rights concerns. The company’s actions are a stark reminder that companies should be held accountable not just by governments but by consumers, as well, said Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow and director in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. '[B]rands are simply out for profit, with no regard to human rights,' he said. 'Western consumers are not showing much outrage over this. There is little backlash, so they will do it,' Zenz said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/skechers-opens-store-in-xinjiang-amid-scrutiny-over-uyghur-forced-labor-sanctions-/7814393.html	2024-10-08T03:44:09-07:00

Mozambique election winner faces tough financial squeeze	JOHANNESBURG — Whoever wins Mozambique's presidential election on Wednesday will face an economy battered by worsening cyclones, insecurity, delays to planned gas projects and high levels of debt. Ruling party candidate Daniel Chapo is the frontrunner, though there are three other candidates vying to replace Felipe Nyusi as president of the southeast African nation. Rising borrowing costs are putting pressure on Mozambique to embrace fiscal discipline, particularly as delayed gas revenues mean it is running out of options to refinance its debt - which is nearly as big as its annual GDP. 'Debt in the country is rocketing,' Gabriel Muthisse, a former transport and communications minister, told Reuters. 'Debt servicing is (diverting)...resources that could be used to finance the real economy.' The yield on Mozambique's international bond due 2031 stands at close to 13%. The country of 34 million people is still trying to shake off a decade-old 'tuna bonds' scandal involving Credit Suisse, in which loans for a fishing fleet went missing, leading Mozambique to default on its debt and the International Monetary Fund to suspend lending. Last year, the Swiss bank settled out of court. 'Financing options for the deficit are limited,' said Kevin Daly, portfolio manager at Abrdn, which holds Mozambique's 2031 international bond. Mozambique struck a $456 million deal with the IMF in May 2022, but its program expires next year and will have to be renegotiated. 'The future of the economy is really based on the development of these oil and gas...(fields),' said Thys Louw, portfolio manager at global asset manager, Ninety One. Yet Islamist violence has delayed TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil's development of some of Africa's biggest gas fields. Total says it is still committed to them, but investor enthusiasm is waning. 'There was a time where everyone was excited and waiting to go into Mozambique,' said Tshepo Ncube, head of International Coverage at Absa Corporate and Investment Bank. 'Now it is all about: 'let's see how it plays out'.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-election-winner-faces-tough-financial-squeeze/7814320.html	2024-10-08T00:14:34-07:00

China state planner is 'fully confident' of achieving 2024 economic goals	BEIJING — China is 'fully confident' of achieving its full-year economic and social development targets, with some funds from 2025's budget being brought forward to support projects, chairman of the country's economic planner Zheng Shanjie said on Tuesday. China stocks blasted to two-year highs after a slew of stimulus steps announced in recent weeks supported sentiment in early trade, but later retreated. Hong Kong shares also slid as investors walked back some of the stimulus excitement. Zheng, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a press conference China's economy remains largely stable but is facing more complex internal and external environments. 'The international market is volatile, global trade protectionism has intensified, and uncertain and unstable factors have increased. These will have an adverse impact on my country through trade, investment, finance and other channels,' Zheng said. Downward pressure on the domestic economy has increased, he added. To support local governments, China will issue $14.12 billion from next year's central government budget and another $14.12 billion for key investment projects by the end of this year, Zheng said. The country will also quicken fiscal spending and 'all sides should keep making efforts more forcefully' to strengthen macroeconomic policies, he added. Investors and economists expect more policy support on the fiscal side to sustain the market's optimism. They said it will take time to restore consumer and business confidence and get the economy back on more solid footing. A housing market recovery, in particular, could be a long slog. 'We anticipate that the government will arrange 1-3 trillion yuan of additional fiscal support this year and next to boost the real economy, recapitalise banks, and stabilize the property market,' said Yue Su, principal China economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. 'This, along with investments from special long-term bonds planned for next year, is expected to primarily impact 2025's economic growth.' The government set a growth target of around 5% this year, but economic indicators showed growth momentum waned since the second quarter, weighing on households spending and business sentiment amid a severe property downturn. A private report by recruiting platform Zhaopin showed on Tuesday that average pay offered by recruiters in China's 38 major cities fell 2.5% in the third quarter from the second, and down 0.6% from a year earlier. In an effort to reverse the economic downturn, China unveiled in late September its most aggressive monetary stimulus package since the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with extensive property market support. Zheng said that to address insufficient domestic demand, policymakers will focus on enhancing people's livelihood to stimulate consumption and investment, such as supporting disadvantaged people, consumer goods trade-ins, elderly care and births. No further details were announced. Vice Chairman of the NDRC, Liu Sushe, stated that most of the 6 trillion yuan in government investment this year was allocated to specific projects, with 90% of local government special bonds used for project construction issued by September. At the same press conference, another vice chairman of the NDRC, Zhao Chenxin, said that China's economic growth remained 'generally stable' over the first three quarters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-state-planner-is-fully-confident-of-achieving-2024-economic-goals/7814307.html	2024-10-07T23:20:25-07:00	
Milton could strike Florida Wednesday	FORT MYERS BEACH, Fla. — Florida's Gulf Coast braced Tuesday for the impact of Hurricane Milton's near-record winds and expected massive storm surge, which could bring destruction to areas already reeling from Helene's devastation 12 days ago and still recovering from Ian's wrath two years ago. Almost the entirety of Florida's west coast was under a hurricane warning early Tuesday as the Category 5 storm and its 265 kph winds crept toward the state at 14 kph, sucking energy from the Gulf of Mexico's warm water. The strongest Atlantic hurricane on record is 1980's Allen, which reached wind speeds of 306 kph as it moved through the Caribbean and Gulf before striking Texas and Mexico. Milton's center could come ashore Wednesday in the Tampa Bay region, which has not endured a direct hit by a major hurricane in more than a century. Scientists expect the system to weaken slightly before landfall, though it could retain hurricane strength as it churns across central Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. That would largely spare other states ravaged by Helene, which killed at least 230 people on its path from Florida to the Appalachian Mountains. Tampa Bay has not been hit directly by a major hurricane since 1921, and authorities fear luck is about to run out for the region and its 3.3 million residents. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for Florida, and U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor said 7,000 federal workers were mobilized to help in one of the largest mobilizations of federal personnel in history. 'This is the real deal here with Milton,' Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told a Monday news conference. 'If you want to take on Mother Nature, she wins 100% of the time.' The Tampa Bay area is still rebounding from Helene and its powerful surge — a wall of water up to 2.4 meters it created even though its eye was 160 kilometers offshore. Twelve people died there, with the worst damage along a string of barrier islands from St. Petersburg to Clearwater. Forecasters warned that Milton could bring a possible 2.4- to 3.6-meter storm surge, leading to evacuation orders being issued for beach communities all along the Gulf coast. In Florida, that means anyone who stays is on their own and first responders are not expected to risk their lives to rescue them at the height of the storm. Stragglers were a problem during Helene and 2022's Ian. Many residents failed to heed ample warnings, saying they evacuated during previous storms only to have major surges not materialize. But there was evidence Monday that people were getting out before Milton arrives. A steady stream of vehicles headed north toward the Florida Panhandle on Interstate 75, the main highway on the west side of the peninsula, as residents heeded evacuation orders. Traffic clogged the southbound lanes of the highway for miles as other residents headed for the relative safety of Fort Lauderdale and Miami on the other side of the state. About 240 kilometers south of Tampa, Fort Myers Beach was nearly a ghost town by Monday afternoon as an evacuation order took effect. Ian devastated the 5,000-resident community two years ago, its 4.5-meter storm surge destroying or severely damaging 400 homes and businesses. Fourteen people died there as they tried to ride out the storm, and dozens had to be rescued. On Monday, the few residents who could be found were racing against the clock to safeguard their buildings and belongings. None said they were staying. The signs of Ian's devastation remain visible everywhere. Rebuilt homes stand next to others in various states of construction. There are numerous vacant lots, which were once rare. 'This whole street used to be filled out with houses,' said Mike Sandell, owner of Pool-Rific Services. His workers were removing and storing pumps and heaters Monday from his clients' pools so they wouldn't get destroyed. Home construction supplies like bricks, piping and even workers' outhouses lined the streets, potential projectiles that could do further damage if a surge hits. At the beach Monday afternoon, workers busily emptied the triple-wide trailer that houses The Goodz, a combined hardware, convenience, fishing supply, ice cream and beach goods store. Owner Graham Belger said he moved his 'Your Island Everything Store' into the trailer after Ian destroyed his permanent building across the street. 'We’ll rebuild, but it is going to be bad,' he said. Nearby, Don Girard and his son Dominic worked to batten down the family’s three-story combination rental and vacation home that’s about 30.5 meters from the water. It’s first-floor garage and entranceway were flooded by Helene last month, Hurricane Debby in August, and a tide brought by a recent supermoon. Ian was by far the worst. Its waves crashed into the 14-year-old home’s second floor, destroying the flooring. Girard repaired the damage, and his aqua-blue and white home stands in contrast to the older, single-story house across the street. It was submerged by Ian, never repaired and remains vacant. Its once-off-white walls are now tinged with brown. Plywood covers the holes that once contained windows and doors. Girard, who owns a banner and flag company in Texas, said that while his feelings about owning his home are mostly positive, they are becoming mixed. He said every December, his extended family gathers there for the holidays. At that time of year, temperatures in southwest Florida are usually in the low 20s Celsius with little rain or humidity. The area and its beaches fill with tourists. 'At Christmas, there is no better place in the world,' Girard said. But flooding from Ian, the other storms and now Milton is leaving him frustrated. 'It’s been difficult, I’m not going to lie to you,' Girard said. 'The last couple years have been pretty bad.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-braces-for-hurricane-milton-/7814306.html	2024-10-07T22:58:23-07:00	
Sentence for Belarusian-American extended as Belarus cracks down on dissent	TALLINN, Estonia — A Belarusian-American has had his prison term extended to a total of 13 1/2 years in the latest move in a relentless crackdown on dissent by Belarus' repressive government, rights activists said Monday. Yuras Zyankovich, a lawyer who has dual Belarusian and U.S. citizenship, has been held behind bars since 2021. He was convicted on accusations of plotting to assassinate Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko and seize power and given an 11-year sentence in September 2022. He then had six months added to his sentence later that year. In August, a court in Belarus handed Zyankovich, 46, an additional two-year sentence on charges of 'malicious disobedience to the prison administration,' according to the Viasna human rights group, a ruling that became known only now. The authorities have denied Zyankovich access to a lawyer since March. Zyankovich repeatedly went on hunger strike and his health has seriously deteriorated in custody, according to Viasna, which said that he faced harassment and intimidation by prison authorities. Last month, Zyankovich featured in a propaganda film aired by state television that described the purported plot he was convicted of. The U.S. Embassy in Belarus condemned airing the documentary and rejected the 'baseless claims' it contained in a statement in September. It emphasized that it will 'continue to advocate for the improved welfare of this detained American.' In 2020, Belarus was rocked by its largest-ever protests following an election that gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office but was condemned by the opposition and the West as fraudulent. According to Viasna, 65,000 people have been arrested since the protests began and hundreds of thousands have fled Belarus. Belarus has more than 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, according to Viasna, including the group’s founder and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sentence-for-belarusian-american-extended-as-belarus-cracks-down-on-dissent/7814275.html	2024-10-07T20:37:37-07:00	
Tunisia's Kais Saied wins landslide reelection	TUNIS, Tunisia — President Kais Saied won a landslide victory in Tunisia's election Monday, keeping his grip on power after a first term in which opponents were imprisoned and the country's institutions overhauled to give him more authority. The North African country's Independent High Authority for Elections said Saied received 90.7% of the vote, a day after exit polls showed him with an insurmountable lead in the country known as the birthplace of the Arab Spring more than a decade ago. 'We're going to cleanse the country of all the corrupt and schemers,' the 66-year-old populist said in a speech at campaign headquarters. He pledged to defend Tunisia against threats foreign and domestic. That raised alarm among the president's critics including University of Tunis law professor Sghayer Zakraoui, who said Tunisian politics were once again about 'the absolute power of a single man who places himself above everyone else and believes himself to be invested with a messianic message.' Zakraoui said the election results were reminiscent of Tunisia under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who ruled for more than 20 years before becoming the first dictator toppled in the Arab Spring uprisings. Saied received a larger vote share than Ben Ali did in 2009, two years before fleeing the country amid protests. The closest challenger, businessman Ayachi Zammel, won 7.4% of the vote after sitting in prison for the majority of the campaign while facing multiple sentences for election-related crimes. Yet Saied's win was marred by low voter turnout. Election officials reported 28.8% of voters participated on Oct. 6 — a significantly smaller showing than in the first round of the country's two other post-Arab Spring elections and an indication of apathy plaguing the country's 9.7 million eligible voters. Saied's most prominent challengers — imprisoned since last year — were prevented from running, and lesser-known candidates were jailed or kept off the ballot. Opposition parties boycotted the contest, calling it a sham amid Tunisia's deteriorating political climate and authoritarian drift. Over the weekend, there was little sign of an election underway in Tunisia apart from an anti-Saied protest on Friday and celebrations in the capital on Sunday evening. 'He will re-enter office undermined rather than empowered by these elections,' Tarek Megerisi, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote on X. Saied's critics pledged to keep opposing his rule. 'It's possible that after 20 years our kids will protest on Avenue Habib Bourguiba to tell him to get out,' said Amri Sofien, a freelance filmmaker, referring to the capital's main thoroughfare. 'There is no hope in this country.' Such despair is a far cry from the Tunisia of 2011, when protesters took to the streets demanding 'bread, freedom and dignity,' ousted the president and paved the way for the country's transition into a multiparty democracy. Tunisia in the following years enshrined a new constitution, created a Truth and Dignity Commission to bring justice to citizens tortured under the former regime and saw its leading civil society groups win the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering political compromise. But its new leaders were unable to buoy the country's flailing economy and quickly became unpopular amid constant political infighting and episodes of terrorism and political violence. Against that backdrop, Saied — then a political outsider — won his first term in 2019 promising to combat corruption. To the satisfaction of his supporters, in 2021 he declared a state of emergency, suspended parliament and rewrote the constitution to consolidate the power of the presidency — a series of actions his critics likened to a coup. Tunisians in a referendum approved the president's proposed constitution a year later, although voter turnout plummeted. Authorities subsequently began to unleash a wave of repression on the once-vibrant civil society. In 2023, some of Saied's most prominent opponents from across the political spectrum were thrown in prison, including right-wing leader Abir Moussi and Islamist Rached Ghannouchi, the co-founder of the party Ennahda and former speaker of Tunisia's parliament. Dozens of others were imprisoned on charges including inciting disorder, undermining state security and violating a controversial anti-fake news law critics say has been used to stifle dissent. The pace of the arrests picked up earlier this year, when authorities began targeting additional lawyers, journalists, activists, migrants from sub-Saharan Africa and the former head of the post-Arab Spring Truth and Dignity Commission. 'The authorities seemed to see subversion everywhere,' said Michael Ayari, senior analyst for Algeria & Tunisia at the International Crisis Group. Dozens of candidates had expressed interest in challenging the president, and 17 submitted preliminary paperwork to run in Sunday's race. However, members of the election commission approved only three. The role of the commission and its members, all of them appointed by the president under his new constitution, came under scrutiny. They defied court rulings ordering them to reinstate three candidates they had rejected. The parliament subsequently passed a law stripping power from the administrative courts. Such moves sparked international concern, including from Europe, which relies on partnership with Tunisia to police the central Mediterranean, where migrants attempt to cross in from North Africa to Europe. European Commission Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said Monday the EU 'takes note of the position expressed by many Tunisian social and political actors regarding the integrity of the electoral process.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tunisia-s-kais-saied-wins-landslide-reelection/7814272.html	2024-10-07T20:22:26-07:00

US warns voters of disinformation deluge	WASHINGTON — American voters are likely about to be swamped by a flood of misinformation and influence campaigns engineered by U.S. adversaries aiming, according to senior U.S. intelligence officials, to sway the results of the upcoming presidential election and cast doubt on the process itself. The latest assessment from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, issued Monday, comes just 29 days before the November 5 election that will see U.S. voters choose the country's next president and cast ballots in hundreds of other state and local races. 'We've continued to see actors ramp up their activities as we get closer to Election Day,' said a senior U.S. intelligence official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity. 'They recognize that individuals are already voting, and operations can have a greater impact as we get closer to Election Day,' the official said, noting that the election itself may just be a starting point. 'The intelligence community expects foreign influence actors to continue their campaigns by calling into question the validity of the election results after the polls close,' the official added. A second U.S. intelligence official warned the pace of such influence efforts, especially those targeting specific races or political campaigns, has also picked up. 'We have had more than a threefold increase,' the official said, explaining that the number of private briefings to candidates and campaigns has likewise jumped. Intelligence agencies also cautioned that U.S. adversaries will likely seize upon the damage done by Hurricane Helene and potential damage from Hurricane Milton as it strengthens off the U.S. coastline to further amplify and manufacture narratives meant to undermine confidence in the election results. 'It does take time for those types of narratives to be formed and put out into the wild, so to speak,' the first intelligence official said. 'But we certainly expect foreign countries to take advantage of such situations and promote further divisive rhetoric.' Monday's assessment follows a series of earlier public warnings about foreign efforts to meddle in the U.S. election. U.S. officials said Monday that Russia, Iran and China continue to be responsible for most of the influence efforts targeting U.S. voters. And, they said, there have been no indications that any of those countries have changed their goals. Russia, they said, continues to run influence campaigns aimed at boosting the chances of former U.S. President and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, while seeking to hurt the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. Iran's efforts remain focused on helping Harris by hurting Trump, they said, pointing to the ongoing hack-and-leak operation against the Trump campaign, which has been traced to three operatives working for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Targeting state, local races U.S. intelligence agencies assess that China has yet to wade into the U.S. presidential campaign, focusing instead on persuading American voters to reject state and local candidates perceived as detrimental to Beijing's interests, especially those voicing support for Taiwan. But the latest public assessment pointed to some changes. U.S. intelligence officials on Monday warned that Russia and Cuba have joined China, in targeting congressional, state and local races. 'Moscow is leveraging a wide range of influence actors in an effort to influence congressional races, particularly to encourage the U.S. public to oppose pro-Ukraine policies and politicians,' the intelligence official said. 'Havana almost certainly has considered influence efforts targeting some candidates,' the official added. 'This is consistent with what they've done in past cycles.' Russia, China and Iran have all rejected previous U.S. accusations of election meddling. Russia, Iran and Cuba have yet to respond to requests from VOA for comment on the latest U.S. findings. China late Monday again dismissed the U.S. concerns. 'China is not interested in the U.S. congressional election, and we have no intention and will not interfere in it,' Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in an email. 'Some U.S. congressmen stick to their wrong positions on the Taiwan question,' Liu added. 'China firmly defends its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, but this does not lead to the conclusion that China has interfered in the congressional elections.' But the U.S. intelligence assessments align with concerns voiced by some lawmakers and private technology companies. 'The 48 hours after the polls close, especially if we have as close an election as we anticipate, could be equally if not more significant in terms of spreading false information, disinformation and literally undermining the tenets of our democracy,' Mark Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said during a hearing last month. 'Vigorous activity' Microsoft President Brad Smith, who has warned that the most perilous moments could come in the 48 hours before the U.S. election, separately said the increase in malign cyber efforts by Russia and Iran, especially, is undeniable. 'We're seeing vigorous activity,' Smith told a cyber conference last month. 'We're seeing the Iranians really target the Republican Party in the Trump campaign,' he said. 'We're seeing the Russians target the Democratic Party and now the Harris campaign.' And it is unclear what impact the U.S. has made with its attempts to counter the growing number of foreign influence efforts. Last month, the U.S. Justice Department seized 32 internet domains used by companies linked to Moscow to spread disinformation. At the same time, the department indicted employees of the state-controlled media outlet RT in connection with a plot to launder Russian propaganda through a U.S.-based media company. U.S. intelligence officials on Monday, however, said such tactics are no longer unique to the Kremlin. 'Foreign influence actors are getting better at hiding their hand and using Americans to do it,' said one of the U.S. intelligence officials. 'Foreign countries calculate that Americans are more likely to believe other Americans compared to content with clear signs of foreign propaganda.' Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly told CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday that social media is rife with fake personas generated by U.S. adversaries. 'If you're looking at stuff on Twitter, on TikTok, on Facebook, on Instagram, and it's political in nature … there is a very reasonable chance — I would put it in the 20 to 30% range — that the content you are seeing, the comments you are seeing, are coming from one of those three countries: Russia, Iran, China,' he said. 'It's not going to stop on November 5.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-warns-voters-of-disinformation-deluge/7814263.html	2024-10-07T19:50:11-07:00

Mexico's Sheinbaum sends secondary legislation on judicial reform implementation	MEXICO CITY — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum sent two proposals to Congress to reform electoral laws and implement a sweeping reform of the judiciary, her government said in a statement on Monday. Congress passed the constitutional reform, which stipulates that all judges be elected by popular vote over the next three years, in September. The ruling Morena party and its allies have championed the reform as an improvement on the current judicial system, arguing it is needed to root out corruption in the judiciary. 'The judicial reform has already been approved, it is constitutional, and in a few days, after the approval of these two laws, the electoral process will begin,' Sheinbaum said during her morning press conference. The government's statement said that the two reforms proposed on Monday aim to ensure certainty around the process for electing judges, justices and magistrates. An election to replace all Supreme Court judges, while reducing their number from 11 to nine, as well as to vote in members of an electoral tribunal and half the country's magistrates and district judges, is scheduled for June 1. Mexico's Supreme Court last week voted to consider a constitutional challenge to the judicial overhaul and is expected to rule on whether the reform affects the independence of the courts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-s-sheinbaum-sends-secondary-legislation-on-judicial-reform-implementation/7814236.html	2024-10-07T18:38:14-07:00	
On October 7 terrorist attack anniversary, Israel-Hamas war still rages	Monday marked the first anniversary of the October 7 terrorist attack that Hamas perpetrated on Israel. While reaffirming its staunch support for Israel, the United States lamented the civilian deaths caused by the ensuing war.

Haiti's divided transition council picks new president	port-au-prince, haiti — Haiti's transitional presidential council transferred the rotating presidency on Monday to architect Leslie Voltaire despite opposition from outgoing president Edgard Leblanc Fils, who refused to sign a decree ratifying the move. Leblanc Fils had opposed the move citing unresolved corruption accusations against three other councilors who remain voting members and signed off on the transition. 'Under my presidency the transitional presidential council will consolidate its gains and structures to work with more efficiency and transparency,' said Voltaire, who represents the party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 'Haitian people have enough of violence, of lies and of corruption,' he said. 'We must forget our personal interests and prioritize those of the nation.' The rift at the council creates fresh uncertainty in a country still reeling from the gang massacre of at least 70 people last week, with Prime Minister Garry Conille seeking security assistance abroad. Haiti named the transition council in April after arduous negotiations between various sectors of the Caribbean nation's political and civil alliances. It was empowered with choosing a prime minister and wielding certain presidential powers until conditions are considered secure enough for a new election. But this month, Haiti's anti-corruption unit recommended legal action against three council members it said had accepted credit cards and asked for nearly $770,000 from the chairman of a state-run bank. The three remain on the council, though they are excluded from the current presidential succession plan, which sees economist Fritz Alphonse Jean taking over in March and businessman Laurent Saint-Cyr in August. 'I cannot participate in any process that will further weaken and devalue the country's justice system,' Leblanc Fils said in a video message late on Sunday, saying the decision of the council's majority would aggravate the instability. The January 30 Collective of political parties, which nominated Leblanc Fils to the council, called for the three members accused of bribery to be put aside pending a judicial ruling. The accused are diplomat Smith Augustin, politician Louis Gerald Gilles and former judge Emmanuel Vertilaire. All three have rejected the charges. Augustin was initially slated to succeed Leblanc Fils as the council's president. The council was formed to replace the government of Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who was forced to step down amid a gang conflict that has killed thousands and forced over 700,000 people from their homes. The new administration has said it hopes the country's first elections since 2016 can be held next year providing sufficient security is restored. However, gangs have in recent months expanded their territories, pushing hundreds of thousands more people from their homes and worsening a hunger crisis while long-delayed international support continues to lag.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-s-divided-transition-council-picks-new-president-/7813913.html	2024-10-07T17:41:04-07:00

Trump, Harris mark somber anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are marking the anniversary of the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust as the presidential candidates approach the final weeks of the campaign during a widening conflict in the Middle East. Political leaders across the spectrum were marking the killing of about 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, by Hamas-led militants in the October 7 attack last year, and the taking of about 250 hostages. A year later, about 100 people, including several Americans, remain in captivity, as U.S.-led efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage release deal have sputtered out. Trump visited the New York City gravesite of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who led the Chabad-Lubavitch movement of Orthodox Judaism from 1951 until his death in 1994. Schneerson was the movement's seventh leader, known as Lubavitcher Rebbe. Trump then will speak before Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in the Miami suburb of Doral. Harris and her husband planted a pomegranate tree on the grounds of the vice president's residence in honor of the those killed a year ago. Earlier Monday, Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, recited a prayer for peace at an event to commemorate the anniversary hosted by the American Jewish Committee in Washington. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden also hosted a somber memorial ceremony at the White House Monday to mark the anniversary of the attack. The Bidens looked on as Rabbi Aaron Alexander of Washington's Adas Israel Congregation recited the Jewish remembrance prayer for the more than 1,200 people, including dozens of Americans, killed that day, listing the towns, villages and festival site that were the scenes of the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. The president then lit a lone memorial candle placed on a small table at the center of the Blue Room, before they observed a moment of silence. Earlier in the day, Biden spoke with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, the White House said. The attack sparked a deadly war in Gaza, as Israel moved to root out Hamas' control over the territory and try to return those taken captive. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, including many women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians. Another Iran-backed group, Hezbollah, has fired thousands of rockets at Israeli territory in the same period from Lebanon, and Israel last month expanded a campaign of sabotage and assassination and launched a ground incursion into Lebanon to combat the threat from the group. In 1997, the U.S. State Department designated both Hezbollah and Hamas as foreign terrorist organizations. Many other countries also label them as terrorist groups, although some apply the designation only to their military wings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-harris-mark-somber-anniversary-of-hamas-oct-7-attack-on-israel/7814206.html	2024-10-07T17:24:18-07:00	
Putin to meet Iran president Friday in Turkmenistan	moscow — Russian President Vladimir Putin is to meet Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian for talks Friday at a forum in the Central Asian country of Turkmenistan, a senior aide said Monday. Yury Ushakov, Putin's aide on foreign policy, told journalists the leaders would meet in Ashgabat while attending an event celebrating a Turkmen poet. 'This meeting has great significance both for discussing bilateral issues as well as, of course, discussing the sharply escalated situation in the Middle East,' Ushakov said. Leaders of Central Asian countries are meeting to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the birth of 18th-century poet Magtymguly Pyragy. Putin's attendance had not been previously announced. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin visited Iran last week for talks with Pezeshkian and First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref. The talks come as Israel intensively bombs Lebanon, targeting Iran-backed Hezbollah, and Russia has evacuated some citizens. Russia has close relations with Iran, and Western governments have accused Tehran of supplying Moscow with drones and missiles, which it has repeatedly denied. Pezeshkian will also hold talks with Putin during a visit to Russia this month to participate in a BRICS summit of emerging economies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-to-meet-iran-president-friday-in-turkmenistan-/7814199.html	2024-10-07T17:19:21-07:00	
Clashes erupt at Albania anti-government protest	Tirana, Albania — Clashes broke out late Monday in Tirana between police and opposition protesters seeking that longtime leftist Prime Minister Edi Rama resign, leaving 10 officers injured police said. A few thousand people gathered in the Albanian capital at demonstrations organized by the country's right-wing opposition. Scuffles first broke out in front of the government building when demonstrators tried to break through a police cordon and some of them threw Molotov cocktails. The crowd moved toward the headquarters of Rama's Socialist Party where more Molotov cocktails were thrown, setting on fire the entrance door and a banner with the prime minister's image, an AFP journalist reported. The protesters, who want Rama to step down and a caretaker government to take over until next year's parliamentary elections, also targeted the interior ministry headquarters and the city hall with Molotov cocktails. A bus station and several garbage containers were set on fire. Police, deployed in large numbers, used teargas in a bid to disperse the crowd moving towards the parliament. 'So far 10 police officers have been injured in the attacks with Molotov cocktails, pyrotechnics and solid objects,' a police statement said. Police urged the demonstrators to stop attacking them and state institutions, warning that measures were being taken to identify those involved in the attacks. 'This is the first step towards civil disobedience,' Flamur Noka, an official of the main opposition Democratic Party, told reporters in front of the party's headquarters. 'We will continue our battle of civil disobedience until Rama resigns and a caretaker government is formed,' he said. The protest was held a week after opposition lawmakers threw their chairs out of parliament and set them on fire in protest at a prison sentence handed to one of their peers. Ervin Salianji, an official of the Democratic Party, in September was found guilty of 'giving false testimony' in a drug trafficking case that targeted the brother of a lawmaker of the ruling Socialist Party. The opposition described the MP's arrest and conviction as a 'blind act of revenge and political terror against the Democratic Party,',= accusing Rama of being behind it. Democratic Party leader and former prime minister Sali Berisha said earlier that Monday's protests would be the 'battle of our lives'. Berisha has been under house arrest since December last year on charges of 'passive corruption.' He has rejected the accusations against him as politically motivated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-erupt-at-albania-anti-government-protest/7814197.html	2024-10-07T17:15:06-07:00

Iran's Quds Force Commander is 'in good health', deputy commander says	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The top commander of Iran's Quds Force, Esmail Qaani, is in 'good health,' the force's deputy commander Iraj Masjedi said Monday, after two Iranian security sources told Reuters he had been out of contact since strikes on Beirut last week. 'He is in good health and is carrying out his activities. Some ask us to issue a statement... there is no need for this,' Masjedi was quoted as saying by Iranian state media in reference to Qaani. The Iranian Students' News Agency reported that a message from Qaani was conveyed to a conference in solidarity with Palestinian children held Monday in Tehran, adding that the commander could not attend 'due to his being in another important meeting.' One of the security officials told Reuters that Qaani was in Beirut's southern suburbs, known as the Dahiyeh, during a strike last week that was reported to have targeted senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine. The official said he was not meeting with Safieddine. Israel has been hitting multiple targets in Dahiyeh as it pursues a campaign against Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. Tehran named Qaani the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps' overseas military-intelligence service after the United States assassinated his powerful predecessor Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad in 2020. The Quds Force heavily influences its allied armed groups across the Middle East.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-quds-force-commander-is-in-good-health-deputy-commander-says/7813955.html	2024-10-07T17:00:02-07:00	
North Korea's Kim says he will speed up steps to become a nuclear superpower	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country will speed up steps toward becoming a military superpower with nuclear weapons and would not rule out using them if enemies attacked it, state media KCNA said on Tuesday. Kim made the comments in a speech on Monday at a university, which was printed in full by KCNA. He said he has no intention of attacking South Korea, but 'if the enemy attempts to use force against our country' North Korea's military will use all aggression without hesitation, which 'does not preclude the use of nuclear weapons.'.= Kim also called for extensive strengthening of North Korea's defenses, according to KCNA. He also sent a birthday message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, KCNA said. Kim called Putin his 'closest Comrade', saying 'strategic and cooperative relations' between the two countries will be raised to a new level to work on 'defending regional and global peace and international justice.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-says-he-will-speed-up-steps-to-become-a-nuclear-superpower/7813918.html	2024-10-07T16:54:37-07:00	
Philippines launches naval drills with allies as regional tensions simmer	SUBIC, Philippines — The armed forces of the Philippines, the United States and four other countries began joint naval exercises off the coast of the Philippines' northern Luzon island facing Taiwan in a display of naval strength amid rising tensions with China. Called 'Sama Sama,' which means togetherness, this year's drills, which involve almost 1,000 sailors and personnel from Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the United States and the Philippines, are high-intensity exercises focusing on anti-submarine, anti-surface and anti-air warfare. U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Todd Cimicata told reporters in the port of Subic, to the west of Manila, that building partnerships with key allies created a 'deterrent effect,' though he added that the exercises were not targeted at any country. 'The intent of these exercises is not to ruffle feathers. It's tailored for interoperability,' Cimicata said. 'Across the gamut, there are people that don't follow those rules so we have to agree so that we can set those standards.' The nine-day exercises will bring together the U.S. Navy's Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Howard, Canada's Halifax-class frigate HMCS Vancouver and a CH-148 Cyclone helicopter, while Japan's Force ShinMaywa US-2 amphibious aircraft and Kawasaki P-1 maritime patrol aircraft are also participating, along with warships from the Philippines. The drills come more than a week after the Chinese military said its air and naval forces conducted maneuvers in a disputed area of the South China Sea, fanning tensions in a waterway that remains a volatile flashpoint in the region. Cimicata said the exercises were planned months in advance. China claims nearly all the South China Sea, but those claims overlap with those of Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, angering its neighbors and the United States, which has stepped up its security engagements in the region. Last month, the United States carried out joint maritime exercises with Australia, Japan, Philippines and for the first time New Zealand in Manila's exclusive economic zone to improve the militaries' interoperability. Washington's Marine Rotational Forces - Southeast Asia (MRF-SEA) will participate in at least eight exercises this year and next in their third deployment in the region, including assignments in Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia. 'This is the most robust formation that we've had. And it is also conducting the most exercises since the inception of MRF-SEA,' its commander Col. Stuart Glenn told reporters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-launches-naval-drills-with-allies-as-regional-tensions-simmer/7813871.html	2024-10-07T15:36:03-07:00	
Philippines, South Korea agree to deepen maritime cooperation	Manila, Philippines — The Philippines and South Korea committed Monday to deepening maritime cooperation, their presidents said, in the face of China's assertion of its claims over the South China Sea. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and his Philippine counterpart Ferdinand Marcos met in Manila and agreed to closer ties between their coast guards. Yoon said they will strengthen 'tackling transnational crime, information sharing and conducting search and rescue missions.' 'We shared a common understanding about the importance of peace, stability and safety in the South China Sea,' Yoon told reporters after the bilateral meeting. 'Our two countries will continue to work together in order to establish a rules-based maritime order and for the freedom of navigation and overflight pursuant to the principles of international law in the South China Sea,' he added. South Korea has repeatedly commented on tensions in the disputed waters. In March, Seoul expressed its 'grave concern' over China's 'repeated use of water cannons against the Philippine vessels' in the area. China has for years sought to expand its presence in contested areas of the South China Sea, brushing aside an international ruling that its claim to most of the waterway has no legal basis. It has built artificial islands armed with missile systems and runways for fighter jets, and deployed vessels that the Philippines says harass its ships and block fishing. Cooperation agreements signed in the bilateral meeting Monday cover areas such as critical raw material supply chains, as well as a feasibility study on reviving the Philippines' mothballed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant. 'As the geopolitical environment is only becoming more complex, we must work together to achieve prosperity for our peoples and to promote a rules-based order,' the Philippines' leader Marcos said ahead of the meeting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-south-korea-agree-to-deepen-maritime-cooperation-/7813867.html	2024-10-07T15:33:32-07:00	
China to flesh out economic stimulus plans after bumper rally	beijing — Top Chinese economic policymakers are expected to flesh out a raft of growth-boosting policies Tuesday, after the announcement of long-awaited stimulus measures last month sparked a blistering stock market rally. Beijing has struggled to kick-start the economy as officials hope to achieve about 5% growth this year — a goal analysts say is optimistic given the numerous headwinds, from a prolonged housing crisis to sluggish consumption. After months of piecemeal tinkering that did little to reverse the malaise, officials have unveiled a raft of measures, from rate cuts to looser curbs on house buying, aimed at getting money flowing again. Hopes of that long-awaited 'bazooka stimulus' have lit up stock markets, sending foreign-language markets in mainland China and Hong Kong surging more than 20%. And with all eyes on the reopening of mainland markets following the Golden Week public holiday, officials from the National Development and Reform Commission will hold a news briefing at 10 a.m. (0200 GMT) Tuesday. Chairman Zheng Shanjie and others will discuss the rollout of 'a package of incremental policies to solidly promote economic growth,' Beijing has said. Analysts said they hoped officials would unveil further fiscal support measures such as trillions of yuan in bond issuances and policies to boost consumption. But they cautioned that deep reforms to the economic system to relieve the debt crisis in the property sector and boost domestic demand are needed if Beijing is serious about resolving the fundamental obstacles to growth. 'Unless China introduces structural reforms to really jump-start consumption — from unemployment benefits to real pensions — I just don't think that we will see a major change,' said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for the Asia-Pacific region at investment manager Natixis. The market rally risked becoming a 'mirage,' she warned, as policymakers propped up stocks without properly tackling the underlying issues in the real economy. 'If the measures are not proven to be effective ... it will be even worse, because it means that not even the stimulus works,' she said. Rate cuts, cash, credit Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index closed up 1.6% Monday, while mainland markets reopen Tuesday after a surge led by technology and property firms was interrupted by the public holiday. Many of the measures unveiled so far have been aimed at the flagging housing market, long a key driver of growth but now mired in a prolonged debt crisis exemplified by the fates of developers like Evergrande. To that end, Beijing's central bank has slashed interest for one-year loans to financial institutions, cut the amount of cash lenders must keep on hand, and pushed to lower rates on existing mortgages. Several cities — including the financial crucibles of Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen — have also further eased restrictions on buying homes. Gene Ma, the head of China research at the Institute of International Finance, said the market reaction to stimulus was 'totally normal.' But, he warned, 'sustained economic recovery and reflation require more forceful demand-side fiscal stimuli.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-flesh-out-economic-stimulus-plans-after-bumper-rally-/7813852.html	2024-10-07T15:08:20-07:00

Europe braces for Chinese retaliation over EV import tariffs	The European Union is braced for retaliation from China after the bloc voted Friday to impose tariffs on the import of Chinese electric vehicles, which Brussels says receive unfair state subsidies. As Henry Ridgwell reports, there’s speculation that Beijing could target individual European countries that voted for the measures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-braces-for-chinese-retaliation-over-ev-import-tariffs/7813827.html	2024-10-07T14:46:24-07:00	
Europe braces for Chinese retaliation over EV import tariffs	London — The European Union is bracing for retaliation from China after the bloc voted last week to impose tariffs on the import of Chinese electric vehicles, or EVs, amid speculation that Beijing could seek to target individual European countries that voted for the measures. The EU is divided on the issue, with 10 member states in favor in Friday’s vote, five countries voting against the measures and 12 abstaining. After the vote, China's Commerce Ministry said it opposed the planned tariffs, calling them 'unfair, non-compliant and unreasonable.' Cognac France is among the countries that pushed for the EU to adopt the tariffs. Makers of French cognac, a type of brandy, fear that Beijing will now seek to target their product, after China launched an anti-dumping probe earlier this year. That investigation concluded in August that dumping had occurred on the Chinese market, but Beijing chose not to impose any tariffs at that stage, a decision widely seen as an attempt to defuse tensions with Europe. The EU’s decision to impose EV tariffs could provoke China into reversing its decision, according to Anthony Brun, president of General Union of Cognac Producers. 'We are of course quite worried, because today, China is our second-biggest market. It represents more than one-third of our volumes that are exported for more than 250 years now. Knowing that we will potentially be imposed with a tax of around 40% tomorrow — that would potentially mean the disappearance of this market, because our competitors will not be targeted with the same tax,' Brun told the Reuters news agency, adding that the French government had seemingly chosen to sacrifice his industry. 'Because France is leading the way on this policy, they will seek to target a product that concerns France exclusively,' he said. German cars Germany, the EU’s biggest economy, voted against the tariffs. German carmakers also fear Beijing’s retaliation. 'The European automotive industry — and especially Germany’s — lives from exports. Seventy percent of our jobs depend on it. The current decision could lead to new trade conflicts, to a spiral of protectionism, with tariffs being responded to with further tariffs. And that is a disadvantage for us,' said Hildegard Mueller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, in an interview with Reuters. China has already opened investigations into the import of European pork and dairy products, which could disproportionately hit some EU member states that voted in favor of the electric vehicle tariffs. 'No right to retaliate’ Beijing’s intentions aren’t yet clear, according to Sander Tordoir, a senior economist at the Centre for European Reform. 'The European Commission followed the World Trade Organization’s rules in designing the countervailing duties on Chinese electric vehicles,' Tordoir wrote in an email to VOA. 'As a result, China in principle has no right to retaliate, but that does not mean Beijing won’t anyway. Berlin’s very visible opposition to the tariffs means Beijing may target its retaliation on exports of, say, French brandy or Spanish pork, not German cars. But one cannot exclude that China will anyway discriminate against EU or German-built cars.' In a statement issued after Friday’s EU vote, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce pledged to 'take all measures' to safeguard Chinese companies — but added that negotiations would continue. Negotiations Both Brussels and Beijing are keen to find a compromise — and both want to avoid a trade war, according to Julia Poliscanova of the Transport and Environment policy research group in Brussels, which advocates for greener transport. 'We shouldn’t underestimate how important the European market is also for China. Ultimately, the EU market provides the opportunity for the bulk of Chinese EV exports,' Poliscanova said. 'So, China needs the EU as much as we need China. And that's why I think there will be some sort of ‘friendlier’ retaliation or friendlier actions as such. 'Given the huge oversupply or overcapacity in China and the desire and the need for a lot of Chinese companies — battery makers, EV makers — to go global, I believe the European market will still be very attractive to them,' she said. Economist Tordoir is less optimistic. 'It is hard to judge how likely negotiations will succeed. By pressing ahead with the EV tariffs in the interim, the EU has shown that it is serious,' he said. 'Reportedly under discussion is an idea to set voluntary minimum prices — a kind of surcharge — to offset the market-distorting Chinese subsidies on electric vehicles. But it is not clear how these would be monitored, enforced or how the scheme would be made WTO-compliant, which the EU clearly cares about.' WTO rules The EU argues that the EV tariffs will protect the European car industry, which it says employs 14 million people across the bloc. 'The purpose has been to establish, or rather re-establish, a level playing field so that the goals pertaining to electric vehicles and overall green goals, let's say for the EU, can be achieved in a fair way,' European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told reporters Friday. 'We do not and we never have wanted to impose tariffs in this case for the sake of imposing tariffs. What we want is to remove the injurious subsidization.' Brussels believes the EV tariffs don’t breach World Trade Organization or WTO rules. 'The tariffs are very differentiated [according] to the company and based on the individual levels of subsidization,' auto industry analyst Poliscanova said. 'I think that is what makes those tariffs actually quite compatible from what I understand with WTO rules.' US tariffs The United States in August quadrupled its tariff on Chinese electric vehicle imports to 100%. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said such measures are sometimes necessary. 'The goals that we're trying to accomplish: One is to level the playing field for our industries and our workers. The second one is to ensure that the United States economy, for our workers and our producers, can stay vibrant, that especially when it comes to critical industries that we know are strategic for our collective future, that the United States can continue to be a producer, a player, and that the jobs in these industries will be good jobs,' Tai told Agence France-Presse on October 3. Canada also imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs from the beginning of October, alongside 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminum. Beijing has filed an ongoing appeal against the Canadian measures at the World Trade Organization.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-braces-for-chinese-retaliation-over-ev-import-tariffs-/7813804.html	2024-10-07T14:17:26-07:00	
Senior member of Myanmar's former ruling party dies	Bangkok — Zaw Myint Maung, a senior member of Myanmar’s former ruling party arrested during the 2021 military takeover, died Monday while serving a prison sentence that was considered politically motivated. He was 72. He was a close colleague of ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi and spokesperson of her National League for Democracy party. He had been a second vice president and chief minister of the central Mandalay region before the army seized control of the government in 2021, arresting him, Suu Kyi and many top members of her NLD party and government. Zaw Myint Maung had been jailed at least twice under previous governments for his political activities. He had had leukemia since 2019. His death was confirmed by Tun Kyi, a party colleague from Mandalay, and another friend, who insisted on anonymity for fear of being punished by the authorities. In a statement expressing condolences, the National Unity Government, the main shadow opposition group organizing against army rule, lauded Zaw Myint Maung for being 'unwaveringly committed to the democratic cause, fighting alongside the people and other democratic forces to dismantle military dictatorship.' The NLD won a landslide victory in Myanmar's 2020 election, but the army seized power Feb. 1, 2021, the day it was supposed to begin a second five-year term in office. The country now is enmeshed in civil war between the military and pro-democracy forces allied with armed ethnic minority groups. Zaw Myint Maung was serving a prison sentence of 29 years after being convicted in closed court in 2021 and 2022 on charges of violating coronavirus restrictions, corruption, sedition and election fraud. The charges are similar to those against other NLD members, including Suu Kyi, and are widely regarded as having been fabricated to sideline the party and legitimize the military's takeover. Zaw Myint Maung often was transferred to Mandalay General Hospital from Obo prison to be treated for his condition. The friends who confirmed his death said prison officials came to the hospital Sunday to read Zaw Myint Maung an official letter saying the military had granted him amnesty. A copy of the purported letter posted on social media said the amnesty was granted as an act of leniency and compassion. He was not the first senior NLD member to die after being imprisoned by the military government. Nyan Win, who had been a member of the NLD central executive committee as well as a confidante of Suu Kyi, died in July 2021 after getting COVID-19 in Insein prison in Yangon. The NLD was dissolved along with 39 other political parties in 2023 for failing to reapply under a new party registration law. The military has said there will be an election next year but has not set a date.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senior-member-of-myanmar-s-former-ruling-party-dies/7813802.html	2024-10-07T14:14:44-07:00	
Watchdogs: Sentencing of jihadi linked to Charlie Hebdo attack 'important verdict'	washington — Media groups have welcomed the life sentence handed to a French jihadi linked to the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack. A French court last week found Peter Cherif guilty of 'belonging to a criminal organization' in connection to his work with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, according to AFP. Cherif, 42, is suspected of training Chérif Kouachi, one of the people who carried out a deadly attack on staff at the French satirical magazine on Jan. 7, 2015. 'This is a very important verdict on the global level,' Pavol Szalai, of media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, told VOA. 'It shows that not only the justice for assassination of media professionals can be served, but that it can also go beyond the sentencing of the direct perpetrators.' Szalai told VOA that Cherif was in the 'middle of the chain of command' in planning the attacks. In the trial, prosecutors called Cherif a 'jihadist through and through' and a 'cornerstone of planning' for the attacks. Cherif was not charged with complicity in the Charlie Hebdo attack. Instead, prosecutors used a broader terrorism claim, according to AFP. 'I feel like I've taken part in a rigged match,' Nabil El Ouchikli, Cherif's defense lawyer, was cited as saying. The decision to sentence Cherif to life in prison was made 'in view of the seriousness of the acts,' the president of the court said at the sentencing. Eight members of Charlie Hebdo’s editorial staff, along with a former journalist visiting their office, a maintenance worker, a police officer and a police bodyguard died in the attack. Kouachi and his brother stormed an editorial meeting and opened fire on the media outlet’s Paris office. It was the largest massacre of media professionals in France since World War II, according to Szalai. The assailants were killed during a gunfight with police on January 9. The 2015 attack stemmed from 'religious intolerance' of journalists and Charlie Hebdo’s work, Szalai said. Attila Mong, from the Committee to Protect Journalists, said that all perpetrators, no matter their level of involvement, should be brought to justice. 'This latest verdict sends an important message to violent extremists that they will not have the last word and their attempts to silence free speech will not prevail,' Mong told VOA in an email. More than 1,600 journalists have been killed since 1993, according to the UNESCO observatory of killed journalists. However, only one in 10 of such cases result in a conviction. Although Szalai called France’s verdict 'good news for press freedom,' he said in most cases of slain journalists they have yet to secure justice. Many times, an intermediary is punished but those higher up in the chain of command are not, he told VOA. He cited the case of Daphne Caruana Galizia, an anti-corruption reporter murdered seven years ago in Malta. In that case, several people have been charged but there has yet to be a trial for the alleged mastermind. Similarly, after the 2018 Slovakia murder of an investigative journalist and his fiancée, those who carried out the attack are in prison but the suspected mastermind has been acquitted twice. The second acquittal is still awaiting a Supreme Court appeal. 'In none of those cases has complete justice been served,' Szalai said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/watchdogs-sentencing-of-jihadi-linked-to-charlie-hebdo-attack-important-verdict-/7813732.html	2024-10-07T13:14:32-07:00	
UN warns of growing tech threat from Southeast Asia’s cyber scam gangs	Bangkok — An ever-expanding array of underground services and the deft uptake of new technologies including artificial intelligence are fueling the continued growth of Southeast Asia’s cyber scam gangs and helping them stay a step ahead of law enforcement, the United Nations said in a new report released Monday. The report said most of the estimated $18 billion to $37 billion lost to cyber scam syndicates last year across East and Southeast Asia were stolen by groups based in the countries of the lower Mekong River. The U.N. calls these countries 'a key testing ground' for cyberfraud groups with a growing global reach in the victims they scam out of their money and the workers they lure into prison-like compounds as forced labor to run their cons. Last year, the U.N. estimated that more than 200,000 people were forced to work in 'scam centers' in Myanmar and Cambodia alone. 'This is ground zero for the scamming industry in terms of innovation, in terms of the way that things develop,' Benedikt Hofmann, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime’s deputy representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, told VOA ahead of the report’s release. The report details the ways in which the syndicates adopt cryptocurrencies and other new technologies to run their scams and integrate them with the region’s casinos to move their criminal profits around. 'All of this is coming together in basically what is a criminal service economy that’s grown around these scam centers and casinos in the Mekong region. And that’s really been at the core of the growth in this industry that we’ve been seeing,' Hofmann said. Erin West, a deputy district attorney for Santa Clara County, California, agreed. 'Southeast Asia is absolutely the heart of the massive international threat that is coming from scamming worldwide right now,' she said. As part of a task force of local law enforcement agencies focused on advanced tech crime, West has become a leading figure in the fight against cyber scammers. The Mekong countries, she told VOA, are 'where the organized crime syndicates have deliberately placed their compounds and their casino towers because … there are places where they know they can conduct this dirty business without much interference from government.' Besides merely using cryptocurrencies to hide their money moves, the UNODC says the syndicates have a growing and increasingly sophisticated choice of 'high-risk virtual asset service providers' — essentially cryptocurrency exchanges operating with little to no rules on reviewing, recording or reporting who is using them. Perhaps the largest of the syndicates, the UNODC adds, is Huione Guarantee, an online marketplace run by the Huione Group, a sprawling Cambodian conglomerate with ties to the country’s ruling Hun family. Huione Pay, a subsidiary of the group providing a host of currency services, lists Hun To, a cousin of Prime Minister Hun Manet, as a director. Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm, recently estimated that Huione Guarantee has processed more than $49 billion in cryptocurrency transactions since 2021. While much of it may be legal, Chainalysis and others have linked millions of dollars worth of transfers to known criminal syndicates including the Lazarus Group, a hacking collective the U.S. says is helping fund North Korea’s weapons program. These analytics firms say many of the merchants using Huione Guarantee make thinly veiled offers of services ripe for criminal exploitation, from mule accounts to digital face altering programs and electric shackles for binding 'runaway dogs,' a reference to scam center workers who try to escape. Huione Group did not immediately reply to VOA’s request for comment on the allegations. Another emerging threat is the scammers’ uptake of artificial intelligence to help write malware programs or generate increasingly convincing deepfakes for video calls. 'It makes things much more complicated for both the law enforcement side but especially the consumer side,' Hofmann said. 'If you receive a video call from someone who you think might be either some official or family member or someone, that’s so many more times more convincing than if you just receive it like a WhatsApp message or some other messenger message out of the blue,' he added. West says she also has seen Southeast Asia’s scammers using more AI to help them do 'exponentially' more with less. 'We’ve seen them using technology to be able to conduct multiple conversations at a time using AI, which limits the need for as many people,' she said. 'It’s scary to realize the access that they have to that kind of technology,' she added. 'They’re consistently way ahead of us in a lot of their craft. They’re just very good at it, and things that we used to be able to exploit, we’re no longer able to exploit because they’ve adapted and gotten better, smarter, faster.' In Southeast Asia, the UNODC report also describes what it calls a 'breakdown' in cooperation among law enforcement agencies across some borders, another weak spot it says the cyberfraud syndicates are exploiting. Despite some successful cases of cross-border cooperation, Hofmann said it remains piecemeal. Colonel Jessada Burinsuchat, superintendent of the Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau of the Royal Thai Police, echoed that view at a forum on cyberfraud in Bangkok last week, organized by the UNODC. 'We have cooperation with all the neighboring countries, but it’s very little when comparing with Thai police [and] USA, China, Japan or Russia. I can say that around Thailand, maybe we have the very least cooperation. It’s not systematic; it’s very individual, and it’s very … inconsistent,' he said. At the same event, Hofmann called out a particularly 'weak link' in Myanmar, where non-state armed groups have for decades controlled autonomous and often crime-riddled enclaves along the country’s porous border with Thailand. Many of those groups have only grown stronger since Myanmar’s military seized control from the country’s elected government in 2021, setting off a civil war that shows no sign of letting up. Given the trends, analysts and experts say the region’s cyberfraud epidemic is likely to worsen before it gets better. 'It’s very clear that an ecosystem has been created that fosters innovation,' said Hofmann, making it ever easier for the scammers to work and harder for law enforcement to fight. 'Based on that,' he added, 'you can just see the scale of this continuing to expand going forward.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-warns-of-growing-tech-threat-from-southeast-asia-s-cyber-scam-gangs/7813703.html	2024-10-07T12:48:17-07:00	
Understanding the Mideast conflict: A historical primer	Washington — The Middle East is on the brink. Just days after a massive missile attack on Israel, Iran is threatening more strikes. Israel, already battling Iranian-backed militias on two fronts, is vowing retaliation. The U.S. has deployed thousands of troops to the region. While no one is expecting all-out war, fears of a broader conflict are rising, keeping the region and the world on edge. How did we get here and what happens next? To understand the current crisis, some historical perspective is in order. The roots of the conflict The current confrontation may be between Iran and Israel, but it is part of a much older conflict in the region, with its roots going back to the establishment of the Jewish state in 1948. While historians trace the conflict’s origins even further back, the creation of Israel catalyzed a conflict that still reverberates across the region. Israel emerged from a 1947 U.N. plan to partition then British-controlled Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem under U.N. administration. The Jewish minority, promised 56% of the land, accepted the plan, but the Arab majority opposed it. And when Israel declared independence the following year, Arab armies from Egypt to Jordan attacked. But Arab hopes of stopping Israel were dashed. Months of fighting led to Israeli victory, enabling it to further expand its control of Palestine. In an historically resonant episode known as 'nakbah,' or catastrophe, some 750,000 Palestinians were displaced, fleeing to Gaza, the West Bank and several Arab countries. An armistice restored peace but the larger conflict remained unresolved. In the decades that followed, the Arabs and Israelis engaged in period clashes and fought three major wars — in 1956, 1967 and 1973. The 1967 Six-Day War changed the region’s map. Israel occupied the remaining Arab territories, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, deepening the conflict and leading to decades of fraught negotiations over their status. The 1973 Yom Kippur War began with Egypt and Syria launching a surprise attack on Israel to recover lost territories, drawing in the United States and the Soviet Union. Despite early Arab advances, Israel scored another victory, but the conflict’s dynamics were left unaltered. Changing character of the conflict The Yom Kippur War marked the last battlefield confrontation between Israeli and Arab armies. In 1979, Egypt became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel, followed by Jordan in the 1990s and other Arab states followed in recent years through the Abraham Accords negotiated by the former Trump administration. Meanwhile, the nature of the conflict changed. As historian Eugene Rogan has noted, what was once primarily an Israeli-Arab conflict has evolved into more of an Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Palestinian groups based in Lebanon, primarily the Palestinian Liberation Organization, staged frequent attacks on Israel, prompting Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. The PLO was expelled from the country, but tensions flared up in the West Bank and Gaza, sparking the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising, in 1987. Hamas, an Islamist militant group, emerged out of the uprising. The first intifada culminated in the 1993 Oslo Accords between PLO and Israel. A second intifada broke out in 2000 following the collapse of Camp David peace talks, lasting until 2005 when Israel withdrew from Gaza. Since 2006, Hamas has ruled Gaza, while the Palestinian Authority has governed the West Bank, its influence shrinking in the face of frequent Israeli raids and settler violence. Iran’s regional ambitions Meanwhile, Iran, led by Islamist clerics since 1979, emerged as Israel’s biggest foe, supporting Hamas, Hezbollah and other proxies as part of a so-called 'axis of resistance' designed to counter U.S. and Israeli influence in the region. Except for Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, members of the network — armed, trained and funded by the foreign arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps — are all Shiite. While sharing Iran’s ideological goals, each pursues its own interests and maintains a degree of autonomy. Hezbollah, which emerged in response to the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and operates as something of a 'state within a state,' is considered the 'crown jewel' of the proxy network. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have been deeply in politics, with Hezbollah boasting 13 members in Lebanon’s parliament. Nevertheless, in 1997, the U.S. State Department designated both Hezbollah and Hamas as foreign terrorist organizations. Many other countries also label them as terrorist groups, although some apply the designation only to their military wings. Houthi insurgents, another Iranian proxy locked in a decade-long civil war in Yemen, have engaged in missile and drone attacks against U.S. ships and Israel. Washington relisted the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Group in January of this year. Other proxy groups were recruited from outside the region. In Syria, Iran’s Quds Force — a branch of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — operates the Fatemiyoun, a group made up of Afghan refugees, and the Zainebiyoun brigade, made up of Pakistani refugees. James Jeffrey, chair of the Middle East program at the Wilson Center in Washington, holds that a turning point in Iran’s drive for regional influence came after al-Qaida’s Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. With the U.S. diplomatic and military position in the region weakened, an increasingly bold Iran expanded its influence into four Arab states — Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon — plus Gaza. October 7 All that changed last October 7 when Hamas launched a surprise terrorist attack on Israel, killing more than 1,200 Israelis and foreign residents and taking hostage more than 200 others. It was the deadliest attack in Israel’s 75-year history. Hamas had crossed a red line. In response, Israel launched a devastating military campaign in Gaza that has so far left more than 40,000 Palestinians dead and nearly 100,000 injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, leading to charges of genocide that Israel denies. But Israel didn’t stop there. Under incessant fire from Hezbollah and Houthi rebels as well as some militias in Iraq, Israel began taking the fight to its enemies, targeting Iranian proxies across the region. In April, it bombed an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, killing a top Quds Force commander who served as a liaison between Iran and Hezbollah. In July, Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas political bureau, was killed in a suspected Israeli bombing in Tehran. Then last month Israel ratcheted up its campaign against Hezbollah. First, thousands of hand-held pagers and hundreds of walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon and Syria in two separate attacks, killing dozens and injuring thousands. Then, a massive bombing of a Hezbollah hub south of Beirut that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other top leaders. With Hamas and Hezbollah reeling and Iran seen reluctant to take on Israel, the tide seemed to have turned in Israel’s favor. What’s next? Then came Iran’s missile attack on Tuesday, just hours after Israel’s invasion of southern Lebanon. Iran fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel and warned of 'crushing' attacks if Israel responded. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had made 'a big mistake' and would pay a price. What comes next is anyone’s guess. How Israel responds to the latest Iranian attack and how Iran in turn responds to that will offer clues. A narrowly targeted Israeli attack, like the one in April, could end the exchange. On the other hand, a larger response could trigger a tit for tat, potentially leading to a shooting war. Israel’s stated goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from the border region so that displaced Israelis can return to their homes. But experts say Israel seems to have a larger goal of neutralizing Hezbollah and other proxies in the region. If Israel succeeds in that, it could enhance its security. But as long as the conflict at the heart of the current crisis — the Palestinian quest for statehood — remains unresolved, peace will be elusive, some experts say. 'This is a mowing the lawn operation, which is Israel’s tactic and it has worked so far except that it doesn’t bring peace,' said Joshua Landis, professor of Middle Eastern studies at the University of Oklahoma.	https://www.voanews.com/a/understanding-the-mideast-conflict-a-historical-primer-/7813577.html	2024-10-07T11:05:08-07:00	
Georgia Supreme Court halts ruling striking down state's near-ban on abortions	savannah, georgia — The Georgia Supreme Court on Monday halted a ruling striking down the state's near-ban on abortions while it considers the state's appeal. The high court's order came a week after a judge found that Georgia unconstitutionally prohibits abortions beyond about six weeks of pregnancy, often before women realize they're pregnant. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled Sept. 30 that privacy rights under Georgia's state constitution include the right to make personal health care decisions. It was one of a wave of restrictive abortion laws passed in Republican-controlled states after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a national right to abortion. It prohibited most abortions once a 'detectable human heartbeat' was present. At around six weeks into a pregnancy, cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in an embryo's cells that will eventually become the heart. Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed it in 2019, but it didn't take effect until Roe v. Wade fell. McBurney wrote in his ruling that 'liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.' 'When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then — and only then — may society intervene,' McBurney wrote. The judge's decision rolled back abortion limits in Georgia to a prior law allowing abortions until viability, roughly 22 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy. 'Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives has been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge,' Kemp said in a statement in response to McBurney's decision. 'Protecting the lives of the most vulnerable among us is one of our most sacred responsibilities, and Georgia will continue to be a place where we fight for the lives of the unborn.' Abortion providers and advocates in Georgia had applauded McBurney's ruling but expressed concern that it would soon be overturned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-supreme-court-halts-ruling-striking-down-state-s-near-ban-on-abortions-as-the-state-appeals-/7813565.html	2024-10-07T11:03:33-07:00	
Albanian opposition rallies, seeking technocratic Cabinet before election	Tirana, Albania — Opposition forces in Albania on Monday were holding a nationwide protest in the country's capital demanding that the government be replaced by a technocratic caretaker Cabinet before next year’s parliamentary election. The conservative opposition accuses the leftist government of manipulating earlier voting and of usurping powers, including that of the judiciary. The Democratic Party of former Prime Minister Sali Berisha has been holding protests at the parliament in the last week after one of their colleagues was convicted of slander and imprisoned, which they considered as being politically motivated. Ervin Salianji in 2018 demanded the resignation of the then interior minister over allegations of his brother’s illegal activity that later proved to be fabricated. Salianji, who began serving a one-year sentence more than a week ago, has appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court. The Democrats are asking for a Cabinet made up of technocrats and blaming Prime Minister Edi Rama of the governing leftist Socialist Party of manipulating earlier voting. They have long accused Rama’s Socialists of usurping power, including the judiciary, and have staged violent protests against the government since 2013. The Democrats also call for Berisha’s release from house arrest which he was put under during an investigation of alleged corruption. The opposition has called for civil disobedience, starting the protest with a gathering in front of the main government building, where there will be no speeches, and then extending it by blocking traffic at Tirana’s main intersections. A vehicle tire was burned in front of the presidential office, not far from the main government offices. Hundreds of police officers, equipped with anti-gas masks, have taken up positions to protect the government's main institutions. Police have said that traffic is blocked on many streets in downtown Tirana. The U.S. Embassy in Tirana has warned its citizens to stay away from the protest. Albania holds a parliamentary election next year. The European Union and the United States have urged the opposition to resume dialogue with the government, saying violence won't help the country integrate into the 27-nation bloc. In 2020, the EU decided to launch full membership negotiations with Albania, and later this month Tirana will start discussions with the bloc on how it aligns with the rule of law, functioning of democratic institutions and the fight against corruption.	https://www.voanews.com/a/albanian-opposition-rallies-seeking-technocratic-cabinet-before-election/7813550.html	2024-10-07T11:02:25-07:00	
UN food program helps fight rising cases of malnutrition in Malawi	Chikwawa, Malawi — In Malawi, the U.N.’s World Food Program (WFP) is working to address a rising number of malnourished children amid an ongoing drought, the worst to hit southern Africa in decades. The WFP’s efforts include providing supplementary feeding for children in health facilities and distributing emergency food items to affected households. Malawi has faced food insecurity for the past three years because of natural disasters that also affected other parts of southern Africa. These include Tropical Storm Ana in 2022, Tropical Cyclone Freddy in 2023 and the El Nino weather phenomenon this year, which has led to severe drought in the region. Climate change is also believed to play a part. The WFP says in Malawi, the drought has damaged 44% of crops leaving 5.7 million people without food. This is over a quarter of Malawi’s population. Gertrude Chasafali is among those affected. She said she grows various types of crops including some vegetables but now struggles to find something to eat. Sometimes she eats one meal a day, or none at all. Health experts say the food shortage situation has increased malnutrition cases among vulnerable groups such as pregnant and lactating women, and children under 5 years of age. Feston Katundu is a nutrition officer in the Chikwawa district of southern Malawi, one of the hardest hit areas. 'The prevalence of underweight children is 18%, which is high compared to Malawi as a nation because Malawi is at 13%,' Katundu said. 'For wasting we are also at 5%, while Malawi is [usually] at 3%, meaning that we are not doing well.' Katundu also said 34% of children under the age of 5 in Chikwawa are suffering stunted growth. The situation has forced the WFP to provide supplementary feeding to malnourished children. Paul Turnbull, WFP country director in Malawi, said in recent years the country could manage the situation but now needs help. 'In the last few years, the level of moderate acute malnutrition were possible by the Ministry of Health to manage by itself,' Turnbull said. 'But with [the] increase in number[s] now, we want to be able to ensure that the capacity is there in the Ministry of Health. So, we are supplying additional products and doing training so that children who have got acute moderate malnutrition won’t deteriorate further.' Charles Kalemba, commissioner for the Department of Disaster Management Affairs in Malawi, said another reason the country faces food shortages is because of its dependence on rain-fed agriculture. 'If we can put our act together by moving away from rain-fed agriculture to irrigated agriculture we may solve this problem once and for all,' Kalemba said. In the meantime, the WFP and Malawi’s government are delivering emergency food assistance to millions of Malawians impacted by the drought.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-food-program-helps-fight-rising-cases-of-malnutrition-in-malawi-/7813508.html	2024-10-07T10:38:57-07:00	
World water resources decreasing as global rivers dry up	GENEVA — Billions of people are facing a future of water scarcity as global rivers dry up, glaciers melt, and intense heat and other extreme weather events caused by climate change create critical changes in water availability around the world, according to the State of Global Water Resources report issued Monday by the World Meteorological Organization. 'Water is the canary in the coal mine of climate change,' said Celeste Saulo, WMO secretary-general. 'Water is the basis of life on this planet, but it can also be a force of destruction.' She told journalists at a briefing in Geneva that 'water is becoming increasingly unpredictable, what we call an erratic hydrological cycle, leading to extreme rainfall, sudden floods, and severe droughts.' 'Climate change is one of the causes of these extreme behaviors,' she said, noting that these extreme events 'wreak a heavy toll on lives, ecosystems and economies.' 'Melting ice and glaciers threaten long-term water security for many millions of people. And yet we are not taking the necessary urgent action,' she warned. 'To mitigate the impact of such potential catastrophes, we must gather reliable data. After all, we cannot appropriately manage what we do not measure,' she said, adding that scientific data gathered by WMO 'indicates the situation will worsen over the coming years.' The report finds 2023 was the driest year for global rivers in 33 years, marking the last of five consecutive years of widespread below-normal conditions for river flows, thereby reducing 'the amount of water available for communities, agriculture and ecosystems, further stressing global water supplies.' It notes that 2023 was also the second consecutive year in which all regions in the world with glaciers reported ice loss, the year in which 'glaciers suffered the largest mass loss ever registered in 50 years.' 'The glaciers are retreating rapidly,' said Stefan Uhlenbrook, WMO director of hydrology, water and cryosphere. 'The latest data for this year actually shows that in the Swiss Alps, at least, it has been continuing and more glaciers have been reduced. 'If a glacier is melting more and more, that means more water becomes available downstream,' he said. 'However, if the glacier is gone in a few more decades, it will be very dramatic because then the summer high flows from the melting glaciers will disappear because there is no storage anymore. 'If the glacier disappears, that changes completely the hydrological regime. It changes completely the conditions for ecosystems. It changes completely the availability of water for farmers. So, it has really severe consequences,' he said. One manifestation of this was seen last week when Switzerland and Italy redrew part of their shared border in the Alps because melting glaciers due to climate change had moved their long-defined national border. The report says 3.6 billion people currently face inadequate access to water at least one month a year, and this is expected to increase to more than 5 billion by 2050. While no region is spared from disastrous hydrological extreme events, it says floods and droughts affected Africa most in terms of human casualties. The report says major flooding in Libya due to two collapsed dams, triggered by Storm Daniel, killed more than 11,000 people. Floods also impacted the Greater Horn of Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Mozambique and Malawi. 'Jordan is one of the most water scarce countries because of the high population density and the very arid conditions,' Uhlenbrook observed, adding that many parts of Asia, North and South America, and Russia among other regions are 'very vulnerable to the changes we see from climate change.' 'We see the increasing variability of the hydrological cycle causing tension and stress and providing the source of conflict in many parts of the world,' he said. The WMO report is calling for urgent action and international cooperation to address the scarce water issues. It says cooperation through data sharing and building of trust between nations is critical for managing shared water resources. 'We must fill the gaps in our understanding. We need to expand our hydrological monitoring, especially in regions where data is scarce. We cannot afford blind spots when it comes to our water resources,' WMO chief Saulo said. 'I urge nations to invest in hydrological monitoring and commit to sharing this critical data, because without it, we are navigating without a map.' She underscored the importance of early warning systems in addressing climate-induced disasters such as floods and extreme weather events. 'These global challenges transcend borders and conflicts because water is once again the basis of life on Earth, so we must work together to address the water issues,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-water-resources-decreasing-as-global-rivers-dry-up/7813494.html	2024-10-07T10:29:07-07:00	
Laos ASEAN summit to focus on Myanmar crisis	Vientiane, Laos — The failure of Myanmar’s junta to end the country’s violence, allow humanitarian assistance and implement other elements of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ 'Five-Point Consensus' will be the focus of ASEAN’s summit this week in Laos. For the first time since the junta seized power three years ago, Myanmar will send a Foreign Ministry official to the summit. But that move has drawn criticism from some human rights groups, NGOs and opponents of the junta inside the country, who have said allowing Myanmar to participate legitimizes the regime. ASEAN’s highest profile 2024 gathering is set for Oct. 8-11 in Vientiane, the capital of Laos. Neither Myanmar’s junta nor Laos’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs would name the junta’s representative to the summit. Myanmar’s shadow government, the National Unity Government (NUG), has called for the junta's exclusion from ASEAN meetings and praised the creation of a group of three countries, consisting of Indonesia, which chaired the bloc last year, Laos and Malaysia, to address the crisis. 'The military council does not represent Myanmar, and no one appointed by them should be invited,' NUG spokesperson, Kyaw Zaw told VOA on Sunday from an undisclosed location due to security concerns. 'If anyone represents Myanmar, it must be the people’s true voice. Over 200 civil organizations have demanded an end to the conflict, and while we’ve supported the Five-Point Consensus, lack of cooperation has blocked progress.' Kyaw Zaw also emphasized the need for urgent international action, including from ASEAN, to hold the junta accountable. 'Myanmar is in a humanitarian crisis with 4 million war refugees and over a million flood victims. ASEAN and the global community must step in effectively,' he said. The Five-Point Consensus is an ASEAN peace plan from 2021 aimed at resolving Myanmar’s crisis, calling for an end to violence, dialogue, and humanitarian aid. However, the junta’s non-compliance has stalled progress, limiting ASEAN’s ability to influence the situation. Civil society demands junta exclusion In an open letter, 237 organizations, consisting of human rights and public-interest and civil society groups across the region, urged ASEAN to exclude Myanmar’s military junta from future meetings, noting the junta’s attendance at over 500 ASEAN meetings since 2021, with little progress toward peace. These groups, led by Defend Myanmar Democracy, a Myanmar human rights international advocacy group, argued that allowing the junta to participate damages ASEAN’s credibility and helps legitimize the regime. Defend Myanmar Democracy spokesperson Naw Aung condemned the decision to allow Myanmar to host a series of ASEAN meetings this month. 'Rewarding the junta disregards the suffering of Myanmar’s people, who are being murdered, raped, and tortured by the regime,' the group said in a statement released on October 3. 'ASEAN is not relevant in this picture because it has yet to establish a clear position,' said Debbie Stothard, founder of the Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma, Altsean, by phone to VOA. Stothard, a human rights advocate in Burma and the ASEAN region for over three decades, has been at the forefront of promoting democracy and accountability in the region. 'We are now witnessing what could be called a second wave of genocide against the Rohingya,' Stothard said. 'Myanmar’s military airstrikes have surged to over 100 per month, yet ASEAN continues to shield an illegal regime.' 'The Five-Point Consensus is no longer relevant,' Stothard added, calling for a focus on the banking system and long-term planning for post-coup in Myanmar. 'We already know from [U.N. special Rapporteur] Tom Andrews’ reports that Thai and Singaporean banks have been involved in transactions which fund war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in Myanmar,' says Stothard. 'If ASEAN banks are found to have done nothing to prevent these activities, they will be in serious trouble.' 'Additionally,' Stothard continued, 'The organization must plan how it will participate in the post-junta transition: how will ASEAN support the resistance to restore the rule of law and help rebuild the economic and social institutions that the junta has destroyed in just under four years?' ASEAN has planned 19 official meetings in Myanmar this month, covering topics from women’s rights to tourism, hosted by junta-controlled ministries in Naypyitaw, the junta’s administrative headquarters. As of now, ASEAN has not provided a specific public explanation for why they are holding 19 meetings in Myanmar. The meetings were announced on ASEAN’s official website as part of the standard procedure for member countries. Broader summit discussions Beyond Myanmar, the summit will include wider, global issues, including the Ukraine-Russia war and the Israel-Hamas conflict. These global tensions are directly affecting ASEAN member states, some of which report citizens caught in the conflicts. On Oct. 11, Laos will pass the ASEAN chairmanship to Malaysia. The new leadership will play a key role in shaping the region’s future, especially with long-term goals such as the ASEAN Community Vision 2045, which prioritizes digital transformation and sustainability.	https://www.voanews.com/a/laos-asean-summit-to-focus-on-myanmar-crisis/7813461.html	2024-10-07T10:15:30-07:00	
Former Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen heads to Europe this week	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan’s former president Tsai Ing-wen kicks off an eight-day trip to the Czech Republic and two other European countries on October 12 – her first international tour since leaving office in May. While China is likely to voice its opposition to the trip, analysts say it highlights the close ties that Taipei has forged with European countries in recent years. China says democratically ruled Taiwan is part of its territory and opposes any formal contacts between Taiwan officials and other nations. In a statement released Monday, Taiwan’s presidential office said current President Lai Ching-te has delegated the National Security Council and Foreign Ministry to carefully plan Tsai’s trip to Europe. Lai also said he hopes her trip will continue to deepen Taiwan’s friendship with Europe and make bilateral relations closer and more solid. In the Czech Republic, Tsai is expected to attend the Forum 2000 and deliver a 10- to 15-minute speech. In addition to Prague, Reuters news agency reported that the former Taiwanese president will also visit France and Belgium, citing anonymous diplomatic sources. The trip will mark a former Taiwanese leader’s first trip to Europe. In response to media reports of her trip, Tsai’s office said her team would publicize her itinerary once it is finalized. The Chinese Foreign Ministry and China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, which handles relations with Taiwan, did not respond to requests for comment on the trip from VOA. Analysts say Tsai’s trip highlights how Europe remains a key focus of Taiwan’s diplomatic efforts. 'Tsai Ing-wen has pursued a strategy of diversification of Taiwan's foreign relations during her eight years of presidency and some of the most tangible results of the strategy are visible in the relations between Taiwan and Europe,' said Marcin Jerzewski, the head of Taiwan Office at the European Values Center for Security Policy. In his view, Tsai’s trip sends a strong signal to European countries that 'Taiwan wants to be seen as a consistent partner for Europe as a whole as well as for individual European countries.' Tsai’s trip follows Taiwanese Vice President Hsiao Bi-Khim’s trip to Europe in March, during which she met with lawmakers from the Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania, and the European Parliament. It also comes on the heels of renewed trade tensions between the European Union and China, after EU member states backed a proposal to impose tariffs of up to 45% on electric vehicles imported from China. During Tsai’s second term in office, between 2020 and 2024, Taiwan opened an office in Lithuania that used the name 'Taiwanese Representative Office' instead of 'Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office' that the democratically ruled island uses in other places. Taiwan deepened trade and investment exchanges with several Central and Eastern European countries, and sent a former foreign minister, Joseph Wu, to the region on several high-profile trips. The Czech Republic is one of the European countries that has significantly deepened its engagement with Taiwan during Tsai’s time in office. Czech President Petre Pavel had a phone call with Tsai after winning the presidential election in January 2023, and Prague has increased the frequency of its parliamentary diplomatic engagement with Taiwan since 2020. Taiwan and the Czech Republic have also collaborated in the efforts to rebuild basic infrastructure in Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022, rebuilding schools and basic health care systems across Ukraine. Experts say the fact that Tsai’s stop in Prague has been made public reflects the Czech Republic’s willingness to make its engagement with Taiwan more visible. 'The Czech Republic is the country that’s been the most willing to be loud about their relationship with Taiwan in ways that other European countries probably are not, but that doesn’t mean other countries aren’t willing to maintain good relations with Taiwan,' Lev Nachman, a political scientist at National Taiwan University, told VOA by phone. Some Taiwanese analysts say Tsai’s decision not to disclose the full itinerary of her trip reflects the precaution that current and former Taiwanese officials often have to exercise when planning overseas trips. 'Since China will use different ways to obstruct most Taiwanese politicians’ overseas trips, I think Tsai’s decision not to publicize certain parts of her trip may be a way to reduce the chance of Beijing complicating her trip to Europe,' said Chen Fang-yu, a political scientist at Soochow University in Taiwan. In his view, keeping her itinerary low-key may allow Tsai to have more constructive meetings with European politicians and officials in private. 'Judging from Taiwan’s situation, keeping overseas trips low profile may allow current or former Taiwanese officials to achieve more concrete goals while reducing the chances of the host countries experiencing Chinese retaliation,' Chen told VOA by phone. Despite Tsai’s cautionary approach to planning the trip, Chen still expects Beijing to retaliate against countries that host the former Taiwanese leader. 'Since Beijing often imposes economic sanctions against countries that have friendly interactions with Taiwan or introduce Taiwan-friendly policies, I expect them to respond to Tsai’s Europe trip in similar ways,' he added. Following Taiwanese Vice President Hsiao’s trip to the Czech Republic in March, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it opposes any official exchanges between Taiwan and its diplomatic allies and urged Prague to 'take effective measures to eliminate the negative impact' of Hsiao’s trip. Since Tsai is no longer in office, Nachman said Tsai’s trip to Europe carries more symbolic importance and won’t deliver too many substantive results. 'Her trip is about reassuring Central and Eastern European countries that Taiwan wants to continue these strong, unofficial relations with them,' he told VOA. While Tsai’s trip is mainly about signaling Taiwan’s desire to prioritize engagement with European countries, Jerzewski said he expects the current Taiwanese government under Tsai’s successor Lai Ching-te to focus on deepening trade and economic relations with Central and Eastern European countries. 'Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry has already begun to recalibrate Taipei’s approach to Europe and since some of the first special industrial zones that the ministry has announced will be in the Czech Republic, this reflects the current Taiwanese government’s approach to prioritize substance in developing relations with European countries,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-taiwan-president-tsai-ing-wen-heads-to-europe-this-week/7813427.html	2024-10-07T10:15:06-07:00	
Cameroon says homeless flood victims escaped to Chad as fresh floods ravage camps	Yaounde — Officials in Cameroon say fresh flooding has forced at least 70,000 people out of temporary camps that were set up for flood victims along the country’s northern border with Chad and Nigeria. Some of the displaced flood victims have now moved to neighboring Chad, where at least two million people have been rendered homeless by this year's ceaseless floods according to Chad's government. Kamsouloum Abba Kabir urged flood victims in Kousseri, a town on Cameroon's northern border with Chad, to rush to safety in surrounding schools, mosques and churches. Kamsouloum is a lawmaker representing Kousseri civilians in Cameroon's lower house of parliament. He told civilians in several villages that waters from the Lake Chad basin are overflowing and causing havoc to civilians, animals and the environment. In a video, broadcast on Cameroon state TV on Monday, Kamsouloum, accompanied by Cameroon government officials, said the lives of over 70,000 civilians rendered homeless by recent floods are again threatened by fresh floods sweeping through more villages and camps. Thirty-nine-year old farmer Nogoue Shivom is among the flood victims chased by fresh floods from a camp constructed by the government to temporarily host flood victims. Shivom said floods woke her from her bed in the Kousseri camp for flood victims at about 10 pm on Sunday. She said she was able to save the lives of her three children, but books, food and clothes she was given by a charity organization after the first floods swept through her village were carried away by last night's floods. In September, Cameroon reported that floods had affected over 2 million civilians on its northern border with Chad and rendered over two hundred thousand homeless. The central African state said farm plantations were devastated and cattle, goats, fouls and sheep either killed or swept away by the floods. Cameroon warned of a looming famine and began transferring civilians rendered homeless by floods to several camps including Kousseri. Rebeka, who goes by only one name, is the highest government official in Kousseri. He said by Sunday night, several thousand flood victims fled from their camp and surrounding villages and are seeking refuge in safer places. He said a greater portion of the victims who left the camp have crossed over to Chad's capital N'djamena where they hope to find safety. The Cameroon government reports that about 70,000 flood victims have either crossed into Chad or are seeking refuge in border villages. The government says scores of people have died in the floods but gives no further details. The report comes when Chad's government says it is pleading for international support after floods caused by severe rainfall since July of this year have killed at least 500 people and displaced about 2 million civilians. Chad has not commented on the influx of Cameroon flood victims. It is not the first time Cameroonians have sought refuge in Chad. In 2021, Cameroon reported that at least a hundred thousand civilians fled its northern border to Chad after conflicts over water between cattle ranchers and fishermen killed 40 people and wounded 70. Last month Doctors Without Borders reported that a coordinated and rapid international response is needed to save the lives of thousands of people who have fled floodwaters and are seeking refuge with desperate shortages of food, shelter, drinking water and health care. Cameroon and Chad said last August that the lives of more than 5 million people in the two countries were threatened by a severe humanitarian crisis triggered by climate shocks. The two countries also said the floods will lead to famine and conflicts over food and drinkable water.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-says-homeless-flood-victims-escape-to-chad-as-fresh-floods-ravage-camps/7813420.html	2024-10-07T09:34:51-07:00	
US targets Hamas with sanctions on anniversary of Gaza war	WASHINGTON — The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on an international Hamas fundraising network, accusing it of playing a critical role in external fundraising for the Palestinian militant group, in action marking the first anniversary of the Gaza war. The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it imposed sanctions on three people and what it called a 'sham charity' that it accused of being prominent international financial supporters of Hamas, as well as on the Al-Intaj Bank in Gaza that it said was controlled by the group. Also targeted was a longstanding Hamas supporter, a Yemeni national living in Turkey, and nine of his businesses, Treasury said. 'As we mark one year since Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack, Treasury will continue relentlessly degrading the ability of Hamas and other destabilizing Iranian proxies to finance their operations and carry out additional violent acts,' Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in the statement. 'The Treasury Department will use all available tools at our disposal to hold Hamas and its enablers accountable, including those who seek to exploit the situation to secure additional sources of revenue.' In their rampage through Israeli towns and kibbutz villages near the Gaza border a year ago, Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli figures. The huge Israeli security lapse led to the single deadliest day for Jews since the Nazi Holocaust, shattered many citizens' sense of security and sent their faith in its leaders to new lows. The Hamas assault unleashed an Israeli offensive on Gaza that has largely flattened the densely populated enclave and killed almost 42,000 people, Palestinian health authorities say. The Treasury on Monday said: 'Hamas has exploited the suffering in Gaza to solicit funds through sham and front charities that falsely claim to help civilians in Gaza,' adding that as of early this year, the group may have received as much as $10 million a month through such donations. The Treasury said Hamas considers Europe to be a key source of fundraising. Monday's action targeted an Italy-based Hamas member the Treasury said established the sham Charity Association of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, which it accused of helping bankroll Hamas' military wing. Also targeted was a senior Hamas representative in Germany and a Hamas representative in charge of the group's activity in Austria. Hamas is a U.S. designated terrorist group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-targets-hamas-with-sanctions-on-anniversary-of-gaza-war-/7813383.html	2024-10-07T09:04:40-07:00	
Spacecraft headed to harmless asteroid slammed by NASA in previous save-the-Earth test	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A spacecraft blasted off Monday to investigate the scene of a cosmic crash. The European Space Agency's Hera spacecraft rocketed away on a two-year journey to the small, harmless asteroid rammed by NASA two years ago in a dress rehearsal for the day a killer space rock threatens Earth. Launched by SpaceX from Cape Canaveral, it's the second part of a planetary defense test that could one day help save the planet. The 2022 crash by NASA's Dart spacecraft shortened Dimorphos' orbit around its bigger companion, demonstrating that if a dangerous rock was headed our way, there's a chance it could be knocked off course with enough advance notice. Scientists are eager to examine the impact's aftermath up close to know exactly how effective Dart was and what changes might be needed to safeguard Earth in the future. 'The more detail we can glean the better as it may be important for planning a future deflection mission should one be needed,' University of Maryland astronomer Derek Richardson said before launch. Researchers want to know whether Dart — short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test — left a crater or perhaps reshaped the 150-meter (500-foot) asteroid more dramatically. It looked something like a flying saucer before Dart's blow and may now resemble a kidney bean, said Richardson, who took part in the Dart mission and is helping with Hera. Dart's wallop sent rubble and even boulders flying off Dimorphos, providing an extra kick to the impact's momentum. The debris trail extended more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) into space for months. Some boulders and other debris could still be hanging around the asteroid, posing a potential threat to Hera, said flight director Ignacio Tanco. 'We don't really know very well the environment in which we are going to operate,' said Tanco. 'But that's the whole point of the mission is to go there and find out.' European officials describe the $400 million (363 million euro) mission as a 'crash scene investigation.' Hera 'is going back to the crime site and getting all the scientific and technical information,' said project manager Ian Carnelli. Carrying a dozen science instruments, the small car-sized Hera will need to swing past Mars in 2025 for a gravity boost, before arriving at Dimorphos by the end of 2026. It's a moonlet of Didymos, Greek for twin, a fast-spinning asteroid that's five times bigger. At that time, the asteroids will be 195 million kilometers (120 million miles) from Earth. Controlled by a flight team in Darmstadt, Germany, Hera will attempt to go into orbit around the rocky pair, with the flyby distances gradually dropping from 30 kilometers (18 miles) all the way down to 1 kilometer (a half-mile). The spacecraft will survey the moonlet for at least six months to ascertain its mass, shape and composition, as well as its orbit around Didymos. Before the impact, Dimorphos circled its larger companion from 1,189 meters out. Scientists believe the orbit is now tighter and oval-shaped, and that the moonlet may even be tumbling. Two shoebox-sized Cubesats will pop off Hera for even closer drone-like inspections, with one of them using radar to peer beneath the moonlet's boulder-strewn surface. Scientists suspect Dimorphos was formed from material shed from Didymos. The radar observations should help confirm whether Didymos is indeed the little moon's parent. The Cubesats will attempt to land on the moonlet once their survey is complete. If the moonlet is tumbling, that will complicate the endeavor. Hera may also end its mission with a precarious touchdown, but on the larger Didymos. Neither asteroid poses any threat to Earth — before or after Dart showed up. That's why NASA picked the pair for humanity's first asteroid-deflecting demo. Leftovers from the solar system's formation 4.6 billion years ago, asteroids primarily orbit the sun between Mars and Jupiter in what's known as the main asteroid belt, where millions of them reside. They become near-Earth objects when they're knocked out of the belt and into our neck of the woods. NASA's near-Earth object count currently tops 36,000, almost all asteroids but also some comets. More than 2,400 of them are considered potentially hazardous to Earth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spacecraft-headed-to-harmless-asteroid-slammed-by-nasa-in-previous-save-the-earth-test/7813346.html	2024-10-07T08:47:52-07:00	
Kosovo lifts ban on entry of products from Serbia at border	PRISTINA, Kosovo — Kosovo's government said Monday it would lift a ban on the entry of products from Serbia at one border crossing, 16 months after it halted imports to prevent what it said could be hidden shipments of weapons for Serb separatists. The reopening is in line with efforts by Western partners to promote reconciliation and cooperation between the two neighboring Balkan nations. Tensions between them flared in May 2023 when Kosovo police seized municipal buildings in Serb-majority communities in northern Kosovo where residents rejected the ethnic Albanian mayors elected in a vote boycotted by Serbs. Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti said the Merdare border crossing would reopen with stepped-up, hands-on monitoring of goods by customs agents at a location just 300 meters from the border. The other five border crossings would open once they can be equipped with new scanners, he said. Kosovo has cited the seizure of four large caches of weapons that Kurti says could have been brought through the border disguised as trade, as well as the movements of troops by Serbia near the border, as reasons for its move in June 2023 to curb cross-border trade. 'These were steps of security, never commercial ones,' Kurti told journalists Monday. Local media in Kosovo have reported that Germany warned Kosovo that unless it reestablished trade it could be excluded from the Central European Free Trade Agreement and the Berlin Process, aimed at boosting cooperation among six western Balkan nations and the European Union. Kosovo was a Serbian province until NATO's 78-day bombing campaign in 1999 ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, which left about 13,000 dead, mainly ethnic Albanians, and pushed Serbian forces out. Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008, which Serbia doesn't recognize. The European Union and the United States are pressing both sides to implement agreements that Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kurti reached in February and March last year. They include a commitment by Kosovo to establish an Association of the Serb-Majority Municipalities. Serbia is also expected to deliver on the de-facto recognition of Kosovo, which Belgrade still considers its province. The NATO-led international peacekeepers known as KFOR have increased their presence in Kosovo after last year's tense moments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kosovo-lifts-ban-on-entry-of-products-from-serbia-at-border-/7813341.html	2024-10-07T08:40:48-07:00	
For US adversaries, Election Day won't mean end to efforts to influence Americans	Washington — Soon, the ballots will be cast, the polls will close and a campaign marked by assassination attempts, animosity and anxiety will come to an end. But for U.S. adversaries, the work to meddle with American democracy may be entering its most critical phase. Despite all the attention on efforts to spread disinformation in the months before the Nov. 5 election, the hours and days immediately after voting ends could offer foreign adversaries like Russia, Iran and China or domestic extremist groups the best chance to mess with America's decision. That's when Americans will go online to see the latest results or share their opinions as the votes are tabulated. And that's when a fuzzy photo or AI-generated video of supposed vote tampering could do its most damage, potentially transforming online outrage into real-world action before authorities have time to investigate the facts. It's a threat taken seriously by intelligence analysts, elected officials and tech executives, who say that while there's already been a steady buildup of disinformation and influence operations, the worst may be yet to come. 'It's not like at the end of election night, particularly assuming how close this election will be, that this will be over,' said Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee. 'One of my greatest concerns is the level of misinformation, disinformation that may come from our adversaries after the polls close could actually be as significant as anything that happens up to the closing of the polls.' Analysts are blunter, warning that a particularly effective piece of disinformation could be devastating to public confidence in the election if spread in the hours after the polls close, and if the group behind the campaign knows to target a particularly important swing state or voting bloc. Possible scenarios include out-of-context footage of election workers repurposed to show supposed fraud, a deepfake video of a presidential candidate admitting to cheating or a robocall directed at non-English speakers warning them not to vote. When a false or misleading claim circulates weeks before the election, there's time for local election officials, law enforcement or news organizations to gather the facts, correct any falsehoods and get the word out. But if someone spreads a deceptive video or photo designed to make a big chunk of the electorate distrust the results the day after the election, it can be hard or even impossible for the truth to catch up. It happened four years ago, when a drumbeat of lies about the 2020 results spurred the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Often, those arrested on accusations of trying to interfere with the transfer of power have cited debunked election fraud narratives that circulated shortly after Election Day. An especially close election decided in a handful of swing states could heighten that risk even further, making it more likely that a rumor about suitcases of illegal ballots in Georgia, to cite an example from 2020, could have a big impact on perceptions. President Joe Biden's victory over Donald Trump in 2020 wasn't especially close, and no irregularities big enough to affect the result were found — and yet false claims about vote-rigging were still widely believed by many supporters of the Republican, who's running for president again. The relatively long run-up to Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 gives those looking to sow doubt about the results ample time to do so, whether they are propaganda agencies in Moscow or extremist groups in the U.S. like the Proud Boys. Ryan LaSalle, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Nisos, said he won't feel relief until a new president is sworn in without any serious problems. 'The time to stay most focused is right now through the peaceful transfer of power,' LaSalle said. 'That's when real-life activities could happen, and that's when they would have the greatest chance of having an impact on that peaceful transfer.' Another risk, according to officials and tech companies, is that Russia or another adversary would try to hack into a local or state election system — not necessarily to change votes, but as a way of making voters question the security of the system. 'The most perilous time I think will come 48 hours before the election,' Microsoft President Brad Smith told lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee last month. The hearing focused on American tech companies' efforts to safeguard the election from foreign disinformation and cyberattacks. Election disinformation first emerged as a potent threat in 2016, when Russia hacked into the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton and created networks of fake social media accounts to pump out disinformation. The threat has only grown as social media has become a leading source of information and news for many voters. Content designed to divide Americans and make them mistrust their own institutions is no longer tied only to election seasons. Intelligence officials say Russia, China and other countries will only expand their use of online disinformation and propaganda going forward, a long-range strategy that looks beyond any one election or candidate. Despite the challenges, election security officials are quick to reassure Americans that the U.S. election system is impervious to any attack that could alter the outcome of the vote. While influence operations may seek to spread distrust about the results, improvements to the system make it stronger than ever when it comes to efforts to change votes. 'Malicious actors, even if they tried, could not have an impact at scale such that there would be a material effect on the outcome of the election,' Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/for-us-adversaries-election-day-won-t-mean-end-to-efforts-to-influence-americans-/7813334.html	2024-10-07T08:40:28-07:00	
US Supreme Court rebuffs Biden administration on emergency abortions in Texas	Washington — The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear a bid by President Joe Biden's administration to enforce in Texas federal guidance requiring hospitals to perform abortions if needed to stabilize a patient's emergency medical condition. The justices turned away the Justice Department's appeal of a lower court's decision that halted enforcement of the guidance in Texas, where a Republican-backed near-total ban on abortion is in effect, and against members of two anti-abortion medical associations. The Biden administration issued the guidance in July 2022 to protect access to abortion after the Supreme Court's conservative majority the previous month overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that had legalized abortion nationwide. The guidance reminded healthcare providers across the country of their obligations under a 1986 federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) to ensure Medicare-participating hospitals offer emergency care stabilizing patients regardless of their ability to pay. Medicare is the government healthcare program for the elderly. Hospitals that violate EMTALA risk losing Medicare funding. The guidance made clear that under that law physicians must provide a woman an abortion if needed to resolve a medical emergency and stabilize the patient even in states where the procedure is banned, and that the measure preempts state bans that offer no exceptions for medical emergencies or with exceptions that are too narrow. Texas law prohibits abortions unless the pregnancy places the woman at risk of death or 'substantial impairment of a major bodily function.' Republican-governed Texas and two anti-abortion medical associations - the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists and the Christian Medical & Dental Associations, sued the administration, arguing that the guidance unlawfully purports to compel healthcare providers to perform abortions. U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix in 2022 blocked enforcement of the guidance, finding that it is an unlawful interpretation of the EMTALA statute, and would allow abortions beyond what is permitted by Texas law. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Jan. 2 upheld Hendrix's decision, ruling that 'EMTALA does not mandate any specific type of medical treatment, let alone abortion.' The 5th Circuit's decision came a month after the top court in Texas ruled against a woman who was seeking an emergency abortion of her non-viable pregnancy. Abortion rights advocates have challenged the scope of abortion ban exceptions in several states due to uncertainty, including among physicians, about what medical emergencies during pregnancy would permit health providers to perform the procedure. In a similar case in June, the Supreme Court permitted, for the time being, abortions to be performed in Idaho when pregnant women are facing medical emergencies. The Supreme Court's 6-3 ruling in the Idaho case revived a federal judge's decision that EMTALA takes precedence over Idaho's Republican-backed near-total abortion ban when the two conflict. While the justices lifted a block they had placed on the judge's ruling in the case, they did not resolve the dispute on its merits, opting instead to dismiss it as 'improvidently granted.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supreme-court-rebuffs-biden-administration-on-emergency-abortions-in-texas/7813261.html	2024-10-07T08:23:22-07:00	
A journey of death': How journalists have spent year covering Israel-Hamas war	Washington/New York — One year has passed since Hamas launched a violent attack on southern Israel, triggering a deadly conflict and an unprecedented number of journalist deaths. Twelve months on, journalists are continuing to navigate how to cover the conflict. When Tareq Hajjaj, a Gaza correspondent for the news website Mondoweiss, ventured into the field to report, he said he sometimes saw Israeli warplanes and drones circling above and worried that he would be killed. 'Every time I was going to do a story to report something, I was feeling that death is so close, like in any second I can be killed,' Hajjaj told VOA from Cairo. The journalist was permitted to leave Gaza for Egypt in April, but he still reports on the war from afar. Founded as a progressive news site, Mondoweiss has faced criticism for what some say are anti-Israel views and an activist approach. 'That was really dangerous to go in the field to report. It was a journey of death every day,' he added. Figures from the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, reflect that danger. As of October 4, at least 128 journalists and media workers have been killed since the war began on October 7 last year,making the war the deadliest conflict on record for journalists. Journalists in Gaza have borne the brunt of the violence. Of the journalists killed, 123 of them — or about 96% — were Palestinian, according to CPJ. 'They bear the full weight of responsibility of reporting on the impact of the war on Gaza,' CPJ CEO Jodie Ginsberg told VOA in New York. The high rate of killed journalists has raised concerns that the Israeli military is deliberately targeting the media, according to Ginsberg. 'That is particularly worrying because journalists are civilians and must never be targeted in war, and that would constitute a war crime,' she said. Two Israeli journalists and three Lebanese journalists have also been killed since the war began, according to CPJ. The two Israeli journalists were among about 1,200 people killed by Hamas militants in the initial October 7 attack. Hamas also captured about 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza, meanwhile, has killed more than 41,600 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. More than 95,000 others have been injured in Israel's bombardments, which have all but reduced the small enclave of Gaza to rubble. In response to a request for comment, Israel's Foreign Ministry referred VOA to the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF. The IDF did not reply to VOA's email requesting comment. Threats to journalist safety — particularly in Gaza — are among the most pressing issues facing reporters as they cover the war, according to media experts. While those in Gaza have found themselves preoccupied with survival, journalists are also tasked with the additional duty of covering and explaining what is happening to local and international audiences. In the past, Hamas has harassed and arrested journalists in Gaza over their reporting, but CPJ has not received any reports of the U.S.-designated terrorist group targeting journalists since the war began. Last year, the Israeli military said it could not guarantee the safety of journalists in Gaza. The military has also said it does not target journalists. But press freedom groups and other analysts aren't convinced. 'It used to be that if you wore an insignia saying you were with the press or you're with television that that would protect you. I think we understand now that wearing that kind of insignia makes you a target,' John Daniszewski, standards editor at The Associated Press, told VOA from New York. Daniszewski added that the war is the most polarizing issue he has covered in his career. 'One side or the other is very concerned that their victimhood is not being centered,' he said. Another issue that makes covering the war more difficult is lack of access, since Israel tightly restricts media access to Gaza. The only way for journalists to enter Gaza is by embedding with the IDF, but those infrequent trips are highly controlled, with journalists seeing only what the Israeli military permits them to see. In early September, the Foreign Press Association, or FPA, in Israel reiterated its calls for the Israeli government to allow increased independent access for journalists in Gaza. 'This is a highly excessive measure that is unprecedented in scale and scope and duration and runs counter to the tenets of democracy and freedom of the press,' former FPA chairperson Dan Perry told VOA about the tight restrictions. Now a Tel Aviv-based columnist, Perry previously worked as the Jerusalem bureau chief for The Associated Press. Restricted media access to Gaza risks hampering international audiences' understanding of what's happening in the territory, according to Ginsberg, and increases the space for misinformation and disinformation to flourish. 'It means that we are not able to necessarily get a full picture of what's happening in Gaza,' she said. A throughline over the past year has also been the Israeli government's targeting of the Qatari news outlet Al Jazeera. In May, the Israeli government shut down the outlet over alleged national security concerns in a move that press freedom groups condemned. Al Jazeera reporters still cannot report from inside Israel. Then in late September, the Israeli military raided Al Jazeera's bureau in the city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank and forced the bureau to cease operations for at least 45 days. The closure order accuses Al Jazeera of incitement and supporting 'terrorism.' 'The raid on the office and seizure of our equipment is not only an attack on Al Jazeera, but an affront to press freedom and the very principles of journalism,' Al Jazeera said in a statement. During the raid, Israeli soldiers tore down a poster of U.S.-Palestinian Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, who was shot in the head and killed in 2022 while covering an Israeli army operation in the occupied West Bank. The Israeli military has said the journalist was likely, but unintentionally, shot by an Israeli soldier. No one has been held accountable for her killing. 'The shutdown of Al Jazeera is part and parcel of a much broader attempt by Israel to censor the media,' Ginsberg said. Back in Gaza, one of the biggest challenges that journalists face is the abundance of stories there are to tell, according to Hajjaj. 'There always are more stories that need to be done,' he said. Although about half a year has passed since Hajjaj managed to leave Gaza for Egypt, he says his home never feels that far away. 'Even if my body left Gaza, all my senses are still there,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-journey-of-death-how-journalists-have-spent-year-covering-israel-hamas-war/7813161.html	2024-10-07T07:02:39-07:00

Russian court sentences 72-year-old American to nearly 7 years in prison for fighting in Ukraine	MOSCOW — A Russian court on Monday sentenced a 72-year-old American in a closed trial to nearly seven years in prison for allegedly fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine. Prosecutors said Stephen Hubbard signed a contract with the Ukrainian military after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022 and he fought alongside them until being captured two months later. He was sentenced to six years and 10 months in a general-security prison. Prosecutors had called for a sentence of seven years in a maximum-security prison. Hubbard, from the state of Michigan, is the first American known to have been convicted on charges of fighting as a mercenary in the Ukrainian conflict. The charges carried a potential sentence of 15 years, but prosecutors asked that his age be taken into account along with his admission of guilt, Russian news reports said. Arrests of Americans have become increasingly common in Russia in recent years. Concern has risen that Russia could be targeting U.S. nationals for arrest to use later as bargaining chips in talks to bring back Russians convicted of crimes in the U.S. and Europe. Also on Monday, a court in the city of Voronezh sentenced American Robert Gilman to seven years and 1 month for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers while serving a sentence for another assault. According to Russian news reports, Gilman was arrested in 2022 for causing a disturbance while intoxicated on a passenger train and then assaulted a police officer while in custody. He is serving a 3 1/2-year sentence on that charge. Last year, he assaulted a prison inspector during a cell check, then hit an official of the Investigative Committee, resulting in the new sentence, state news agency RIA-Novosti said. The U.S. and Russia in August completed their largest prisoner swap in post-Soviet history, a deal involving 24 people, many months of negotiations and concessions from other European countries, which released Russians in their custody as part of the exchange. Several U.S. citizens remain behind bars in Russia following the swap.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-court-sentences-a-72-year-old-american-to-nearly-7-years-in-prison-for-fighting-in-ukraine-/7813005.html	2024-10-07T04:31:51-07:00	
US Supreme Court taking the bench with ghost guns, a capital case and transgender rights on the docket	Washington — The U.S Supreme Court is taking the bench again on Monday, ready to hear cases on ghost guns, a death sentence and transgender rights. The docket doesn't have quite as many blockbuster cases as it did last term, when its rulings included an opinion granting broad immunity to former President Donald Trump. Still, it's possible that the conservative-majority court could yet be asked to intervene in election disputes after the ballots are cast in November. The justices also stayed relatively busy during their summer break. The orders they issued on emergency appeals included a refusal to restore President Joe Biden's student loan plan and a partial approval of an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship to vote. The new term also opens against the backdrop of low public trust in the Supreme Court, and continued debate about whether their newly adopted code of ethics should have an enforcement mechanism. Here's a look at some of the cases coming up: Ghost gun regulations The justices will hear a case Tuesday on regulations for ghost guns, privately made weapons that are hard for police to track because they don't have a serial number. The number of the firearms found at crime scenes has soared in recent years, from fewer than 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 recovered by law enforcement in 2021, according to Justice Department data. The numbers have been declining in multiple cities since the Biden administration began requiring background checks and age verification for ghost gun kits that can be bought online. But manufacturers and gun rights groups argue that the administration overstepped and the rule should be overturned. Doubts about a death sentence In the decades since Richard Glossip was sentenced to die over a 1997 murder-for-hire scheme, the case has become a rare one where prosecutors are conceding mistakes. Oklahoma's Republican attorney general has joined with Glossip in seeking to overturn his murder conviction and death sentence. Despite those doubts, an Oklahoma appeals court has upheld Glossip's conviction, and the state's pardon and parole board deadlocked in a vote to grant him clemency. The court will hear arguments in his case on Wednesday. Transgender rights Perhaps the court's most closely watched case so far this year is a fight over transgender rights. The case over state bans on gender-affirming care comes as Republican-led states enact a variety of restrictions, including school sports participation, bathroom usage and drag shows. The administration and Democratic-led states have extended protections for transgender people, though Supreme Court has separately prohibited the administration from enforcing a new federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students. The justices will weigh a Tennessee law that restrict puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors. The case does not yet have a hearing date, but will likely be argued in December.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supreme-court-taking-the-bench-with-ghost-guns-a-capital-case-and-transgender-rights-on-the-docket-/7813001.html	2024-10-07T04:21:55-07:00	
Nobel Prize in medicine honors American duo for their discovery of microRNA	STOCKHOLM — The Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine was awarded Monday to Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for their discovery of microRNA, tiny pieces of genetic material that alter how genes work at the cellular level and could lead to new ways of treating cancer. The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute, which awarded the prize, said the duo's discovery is 'proving to be fundamentally important' in understanding how organisms develop and function. MicroRNA have opened up scientists' approaches to treating diseases like cancer by helping to regulate how genes work at the cellular level, according to Dr. Claire Fletcher, a lecturer in molecular oncology at Imperial College London. Fletcher said microRNA provide genetic instructions to tell cells to make new proteins and that there were two main areas where microRNA could be helpful: in developing drugs to treat diseases and in serving as biomarkers. 'MicroRNA alters how genes in the cell work,' said Fletcher, who is an outside expert not associated with the Nobel prize. 'If we take the example of cancer, we'll have a particular gene working overtime, it might be mutated and working in overdrive,' she said. 'We can take a microRNA that we know alters the activity of that gene and we can deliver that particular microRNA to cancer cells to stop that mutated gene from having its effect.' Ambros performed the research that led to his prize at Harvard University. He is currently a professor of natural science at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Ruvkun's research was performed at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard Medical School, where he's a professor of genetics, said Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee. Perlmann said he spoke to Ruvkun by phone shortly before the announcement. 'It took a long time before he came to the phone and sounded very tired, but he quite rapidly was quite excited and happy, when he understood what it was all about,' Perlmann said. Last year, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to Hungarian-American Katalin Karikó and American Drew Weissman for discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 that were critical in slowing the pandemic. The prize carries a cash award of ($1 million from a bequest left by the prize's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The announcement launched this year's Nobel prizes award season. Nobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences on Oct. 14. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. Fletcher said there are clinical trials ongoing to see how microRNA approaches might help treat skin cancer, but that there aren't yet any drug treatments approved by drug regulators. She expected that might happen in the next five to 10 years. She said microRNA represent another way of being able to control the behavior of genes to treat and track various diseases. 'The majority of therapies we have at the moment are targeting proteins in cells,' she said. 'If we can intervene at the microRNA level, it opens up a whole new way of us developing medicines and us controlling the activity of genes whose levels might be altered in diseases.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nobel-prize-in-medicine-honors-american-duo-for-their-discovery-of-microrna-/7812998.html	2024-10-07T04:13:11-07:00

Indonesia's Prabowo wants gradual increase in debt-to-GDP, adviser says	Jakarta, Indonesia — Indonesia's President-elect Prabowo Subianto will increase the country's debt-to-GDP ratio level gradually, alongside efforts to boost tax revenues, his top adviser and brother Hashim Djojohadikusumo told a seminar on Monday. The increase may be within a range of 1 to 2 percentage points per year, he said, describing Indonesia's current debt-to-GDP level of under 40% as 'underleveraged.' Investors and rating agencies are closely monitoring Prabowo's fiscal plans after his earlier comments suggesting an appetite for higher debt levels to fund his costly campaign promises triggered concern about potential fiscal slippage. In June, capital outflows hit the rupiah after Bloomberg News reported Prabowo planned to boost the debt-to-GDP ratio to 50% within his five-year term. His advisers subsequently denied this and repeatedly promised Prabowo will comply with Indonesia's fiscal laws limiting the annual budget deficit to a maximum 3% of GDP and debt-to-GDP at 60%. 'Prabowo will not add to national public debt abruptly, [and] not drastically,' Hashim said. 'We will remain prudent, but we will be daring, more aggressive, so we can fulfill our (campaign) promises,' he added. Prabowo's key campaign pledge is to provide free meals to more than 80 million children and pregnant mothers across Indonesia, which is estimated to cost $28.73 billion to implement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-prabowo-wants-gradual-increase-in-debt-to-gdp-adviser-says/7812882.html	2024-10-06T23:30:58-07:00	
Mexican mayor assassinated days after taking office	MEXICO CITY — The mayor of the capital of Mexico's violence-plagued state of Guerrero was killed on Sunday less than a week after he took office, the state's governor confirmed. Alejandro Arcos was killed just six days after he took office as mayor of the city of Chilpancingo, a city of around 280,000 people in southwestern Mexico. 'His loss mourns the entire Guerrero society and fills us with indignation,' Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado said in a statement shared on social media. Guerrero's state attorney general's office said it was investigating his murder. The official confirmation came after photos circulated on the messaging app WhatsApp depicting a severed head on top of a pick-up truck, appearing to be that of Arcos. Reuters could not independently verify the photos' authenticity. Arcos' death comes just three days after the new city government's secretary, Francisco Tapia, was shot to death. 'They were young and honest officials who sought progress for their community,' Senator Alejandro Moreno wrote on social media. Moreno, who is the head of Mexico's PRI political party, called on the federal attorney general's office to lead the investigation into Arcos and Tapia's murders, given 'the situation of ungovernability in Guerrero.' Guerrero has become one of the deadliest states for aspiring and elected public officials, as well as for journalists. At least six candidates for public office were killed in the state in the run-up to Mexico's June 2 elections. Arcos' social media posts show the mayor in recent days had been supervising disaster relief efforts following the impact of Hurricane John last month, which caused severe flooding in the beach resort of Acapulco and surrounding towns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexican-mayor-assassinated-days-after-taking-office/7812871.html	2024-10-06T22:50:43-07:00	
Philippines, South Korea upgrade ties to strategic partnership	Manila, Philippines — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos said on Monday his country and South Korea have upgraded bilateral ties to a strategic partnership, as he met visiting counterpart Yoon Suk Yeol for talks. The two leaders discussed various issues including the South China Sea and situation on the Korean peninsula, as well as signing memorandum of understanding agreements on coast guard cooperation and nuclear energy. Yoon said the two countries would strengthen their partnership on the security front, with South Korea taking part in the modernization program of the Philippine military. The two leaders agreed to uphold an international rules-based order, including on safety of navigation in the South China Sea, Yoon said, adding they agreed that the international community would never condone North Korea's nuclear program or what he called 'reckless provocations.' Yoon will visit Singapore on Oct. 8-9 before heading to Laos the following day, where he will attend the regional summit of leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and several other Asian countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-south-korea-upgrade-ties-to-strategic-partnership/7812868.html	2024-10-06T22:34:05-07:00	
Sao Paulo mayoral vote goes to runoff between center-right incumbent, leftist challenger	SAO PAULO — The race for mayor of Sao Paulo, Latin America's biggest city, will be decided in an Oct. 27 runoff between the center-right incumbent and a leftist lawmaker after they won the top two spots in closely divided voting on Sunday. Despite polls that suggested he lost momentum late in the campaign, Mayor Ricardo Nunes led the first round with 29.5% of the votes in the city of 11.5 million people. In the runoff, he will face federal legislator Guilherme Boulos, who got 29%, official results showed. To avoid a runoff, a candidate would have needed to win more than 50% of the vote. Brazilians on Sunday voted for mayors and city councilors in more than 5,500 municipal elections, shaping the country's political landscape ahead of a 2026 presidential race. The Sao Paulo mayoral race dominated the spotlight after polls showed three candidates virtually tied on the eve of the election. Far-right political novice Pablo Marçal rose from obscurity and got 28.1% of votes. While not enough to make the runoff, the anti-establishment digital influencer surged in the polls with vitriolic attacks on adversaries and divided the conservative vote despite a campaign with little funding and no TV ads. He headlined the news for weeks after a furious fifth-placed candidate hit him with a chair during a debate. 'Watching the debates, there were often things that I didn't expect to happen, like the chair-throwing or the name-calling. I found it a little disrespectful to the public,' voter Joao Victor Caputo said after casting his vote in Sao Paulo. Nunes had the support of former hard-right President Jair Bolsonaro, while Boulos was backed by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. But both national figures were largely absent from the campaign. Candidates close to Lula faced trouble overall as the president's popularity has slipped, but got strong results in the country's two largest cities, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Conservatives performed strongly in several major towns. 'As long as democracy exists, the people's right to choose will exist, for better or for worse,' Lula said after casting his vote. 'What we cannot allow to happen is that people vote uninformed.' Lula largely avoided taking to the campaign trail for mayoral candidates, although their success would boost his chances in 2026, when he is expected to run for re-election. Overall, center-right parties fared best along with Bolsonaro's Liberal Party, which attracted support even though the former president was banned from seeking office until 2030 for unfounded attacks on Brazil's voting system. 'The anti-establishment views of the right have become the trend,' said political risk expert Creomar de Souza, noting that Lula likely kept his campaigning to a minimum to avoid being associated with losing candidates. While Bolsonaro endorsed Nunes, the Sao Paulo race posed complicated dynamics for him. The former president appeared to distance himself from Nunes as Marçal grew in the polls. Bolsonaro voted in Rio de Janeiro, where he began his political career. But his favored mayoral candidate Alexandre Ramagem, who led Brazil's spy agency under Bolsonaro, suffered a major defeat. Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes, a Lula ally, won re-election in a landslide, securing 60% of the votes against Ramagem's 31%. 'We had support from people from right to left, progressives and conservatives. This is an example for Brazil,' said centrist Paes, who will take office for his fourth non-consecutive term in January. To win outright in the first round, candidates for mayor of cities of 200,000 voters or more had to gain more than 50% of valid votes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sao-paulo-mayoral-vote-goes-to-runoff-between-center-right-incumbent-leftist-challenger/7812853.html	2024-10-06T21:12:01-07:00

Massive blast outside Karachi Airport in Pakistan kills 2, injures at least 8	Karachi, Pakistan — A massive blast outside Karachi Airport in Pakistan on Sunday killed two people and injured at least eight, officials said. Police and the provincial government said a tanker exploded outside the airport, which is Pakistan's biggest. But the provincial home minister, Zia Ul Hassan, told local TV station Geo that it was an attack targeting foreigners. A Home Ministry official told The Associated Press that it was an attack on Chinese nationals, one of whom was injured. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. Thousands of Chinese workers are in Pakistan, most of them involved in Beijing's multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative that connects south and central Asia with the Chinese capital. Videos showed flames engulfing cars and a thick column of smoke rising from the scene. There was a heavy military deployment at the site, which was cordoned off. Deputy Inspector General East Azfar Mahesar told media that it seemed like it was an oil tanker explosion. 'We are determining the nature and reasons for the blast. It takes time.' Police officers were among the injured, he added. The home minister and inspector general also visited the blast site, but they did not talk to the press. Rahat Hussain, who works in the civil aviation department, said the blast was so big that it shook the airport's buildings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/massive-blast-outside-karachi-airport-in-pakistan/7812504.html	2024-10-06T15:52:36-07:00

US aviation authority OKs SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle for Monday flight	Washington — SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket can return to flight for a mission planned for Monday to launch the European Space Agency's Hera spacecraft from Florida, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said Sunday. Elon Musk's company, which has engaged in a public quarrel with the FAA in recent weeks, said Sunday it is planning the liftoff for 10:52 a.m. ET (1452 GMT) from Cape Canaveral. 'The SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle is authorized to return to flight only for the planned Hera mission scheduled to launch on Oct. 7 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida,' the FAA said Sunday. The agency said it has 'determined that the absence of a second stage reentry for this mission adequately mitigates the primary risk to the public in the event of a recurrence of the mishap experienced with the Crew-9 mission.' The FAA on Sept. 30 said SpaceX must investigate why the second stage of its Falcon 9 malfunctioned after a NASA astronaut mission, grounding the launch vehicle for the third time in three months. The malfunction caused the booster to fall into a region of the Pacific Ocean outside of the designated safety zone that the FAA approved for the mission. Hera is set to study the effects of the 2022 impact that NASA's DART spacecraft had with the asteroid Dimorphos in a test of a planetary defense system — the first time a spacecraft managed to alter the motion of any celestial body. Dimorphos is a moonlet of Didymos, which is defined as a near-Earth asteroid. The Hera mission is expected to provide data for future asteroid deflection missions with an eye toward redirecting objects that could pose a future collision threat for Earth. Falcon 9 launched DART in 2021. The FAA on Sept. 17 proposed fining SpaceX $633,000 for violating agency rules ahead of two 2023 Falcon 9 launches. 'They've been around 20 years, and I think they need to operate at the highest level of safety,' FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said on Sept. 24. SpaceX took issue with Whitaker's comments, saying the company is the 'safest, most reliable launch provider in the world, and is absolutely committed to safety in all operations.' Whitaker defended the FAA's decision to delay a planned September Starship 5 launch, noting that SpaceX failed to complete a timely sonic boom analysis as required. The FAA has said it does not expect a license determination before late November for that launch. Musk has criticized FAA leaders over the agency's proposed fine and called for Whitaker's resignation. In February 2023, the FAA proposed a $175,000 penalty against SpaceX for failing to submit some safety data to the agency prior to an August 2022 launch of Starlink satellites. The company paid that penalty.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-aviation-authority-oks-spacex-falcon-9-vehicle-for-monday-flight/7812489.html	2024-10-06T14:43:00-07:00	
Minnesota man arrested after allegedly threatening to 'shoot up' synagogue	Minneapolis, Minnesota — A Minnesota man was arrested after allegedly threatening to 'shoot up' a Minneapolis synagogue, officials announced Saturday. Staff at Temple Israel reported to the Minneapolis Police Department on Sept. 11 that they had received several phone calls from a person threatening to 'shoot up' the synagogue. Then Thursday, a special police detail assigned to provide extra patrols around Temple Israel ahead of the Jewish new year and the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel were notified of a man outside with a firearm. He fled the area, but officers arrested a 21-year-old man the next day. 'Everyone in Minneapolis has the right to feel safe in their communities, and we will ensure our Jewish neighbors are protected as they celebrate the holy days,' Minneapolis Police Chief Brian Chief O’Hara said at a news conference. 'We take all threats made against our religious institutions seriously and will continue to hold the individuals accountable who threaten any of our city’s houses of worship.' O'Hara said officers learned the man had used a phone app to mask his voice as he made repeated threats against the synagogue. Officers did not recover a gun. The man was arrested for making 'terroristic threats' and charges will be referred to the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office. O’Hara said officers had not found evidence the threat was motivated by antisemitism, but he said the timing of the threats was concerning. 'Since the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, the worst terrorist attack on our Jewish community since the Holocaust, our police officers have been present where a whole lot of hateful rhetoric has been said against our residents, against members of our community, simply because they are Jewish,' O’Hara said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/minnesota-man-arrested-after-allegedly-threatening-to-shoot-up-synagogue/7812484.html	2024-10-06T14:24:08-07:00

Philadelphia Chinatown activists rally to stop development of 76ers arena	Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — Vivian Chang works on a narrow Philadelphia street that would have been consumed by a Phillies stadium had Chinatown activists not rallied to defeat the plan in the early 2000s. Instead of 40,000 cheering fans, the squeals of young children now fill the playground at Folk Arts-Cultural Treasures Charter School, which opened in 2007. 'We’re standing right where the baseball stadium would have been,' Chang said in late September. 'And now it’s 480 students — a lot of immigrants, a lot of students of color from across the city.' Chang, 33, leads Asian Americans United, which flexed its political muscle during the stadium fight and is now experiencing déjà vu as it tries to stop a planned $1.3 billion basketball arena for the Philadelphia 76ers at the other edge of Chinatown. Mayor Cherelle Parker hopes a glitzy, 18,500-seat arena can be the catalyst to revive a distressed retail corridor called Market East, which runs for eight blocks, from City Hall to the Liberty Bell. The plan now moves to city council for debate this fall. Team owners say they need the council’s approval for 76 Place by year’s end so they can move into their new home by 2031. 'I wholeheartedly believe this is the right deal for the people of Philadelphia,' Parker said in announcing her support in September, while pledging to protect what she called 'the best Chinatown in the United States.' Few would deny that Market East needs a savior. But some are less sure it should be the Sixers. Critics fear gridlock on game days and a dark arena at other times, along with gentrification, homogenization and rising rents. Chinatown sits just above Market East and the LGBTQ+ friendly 'Gayborhood' a few blocks below it. 'The arena is a uniquely bad use for that land,' said local activist Jackson Morgan, who fears the Gayborhood could lose its identity. 'It would make Center City virtually unlivable for hours at a time.' Victor Matheson, an economics professor at the College of the Holy Cross who studies stadium issues, said arenas can bring an economic bounce to downtown business districts, but only a limited one. 'They don’t have much of an effect once you get beyond a couple of blocks,' he said. Market East, a once-bustling stretch of historic Market Street, has withered over the last half-century amid a series of cultural shifts: the growth of suburban shopping malls in the 1960s and '70s, the financial crises that crippled U.S. cities in the 1980s, and, more recently, the twin blows of online shopping and the pandemic. And while much of Philadelphia is thriving as more young people settle downtown, Market East has resisted renewal efforts. All but one of its fabled department stores are long gone. Enter the 76ers, owned by Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, who want to shed their Wells Fargo Center lease with Comcast Spectacor and move from the city’s South Philadelphia sports complex to their own facility. The partners, who also own the NHL's New Jersey Devils and have a controlling interest in the NFL’s Washington Commanders, say the project will be privately financed and bring thousands of jobs and more than $2 billion in economic growth to downtown. They also hope to build an adjacent $250 million apartment tower. 'I think the arena is a good thing,' said Dante Sisofo, 28, who lives nearby. 'I could see a lot of families gathering and getting a nice bowl of Vietnamese pho — my favorite dish — and then heading to the game.' Parker shares his optimism and has tried to address concerns by noting the $50 million in local benefits the team has promised, a sum that includes a $3 million loan fund for Chinatown businesses. But others wonder if sports fans would really patronize mom and pop stores. Arenas, they say, are designed to keep fans inside, spending their money on increasingly upscale dining and entertainment. 'The Sixers' owners, they don’t make money by people going to the quaint little sports bar across the street. They make money by having people buy those $14 beers inside the stadium,' Matheson said. The owners have pledged not to ask the city for any construction funding, although they are free to seek state and federal funds. Instead of property taxes, they would pay about $6 million in annual Payments in Lieu of Taxes. Over the 30-year agreement, the potential savings to the team — and loss to the city and its cash-strapped schools — could be tens of millions of dollars or more, by some economists' measure. 'Historically, city officials have been extremely poor poker players when it comes to staring down and bluffing billionaire sports owners,' Matheson said. 'And of course, that’s the exact reason why you have them playing footsie with Camden,' he said, referring to a last-minute flirtation from New Jersey to have the Sixers move across the Delaware River, where the team already has a practice facility, for $400 million in tax breaks. Still, Parker called the deal the best ever struck with a city sports team, given that the three venues in South Philadelphia — the Wells Fargo Center, Citizens Bank Park and Lincoln Financial Field — were all built with huge public subsidies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinatown-activists-rally-to-stop-development-of-philadelphia-76ers-arena/7812473.html	2024-10-06T14:00:24-07:00	
Rescue, recovery continue after Hurricane Helene rips southeastern US	Rescue and recovery efforts continue in the southeastern United States following the recent landfall of Hurricane Helene.

973 migrants cross Channel into UK on same day 4 die	London — A record 973 migrants crossed the Channel on small boats on the same day in which four died while attempting the journey from France to England, U.K. Home Office figures showed Sunday. The figure for Saturday is the highest single-day number of migrants making the cross-Channel journey this year, surpassing the previous high of 882 set on June 18. On the same day, a two-year-old boy and three adults died after overloaded boats got into trouble during the dangerous crossing attempted by several thousand every year. The tragedies bring the number of migrants who have died attempting Channel crossings this year to 51, according to Jacques Billant, France's prefect for the Pas-de-Calais region. Over 26,600 migrants have crossed the Channel on small boats in 2024 according to U.K. Home Office figures. Saturday’s deaths were likely caused due to the victims being crushed in overloaded dinghies, according to authorities and prosecutors. U.K. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said Saturday that it was 'appalling that more lives have been lost in the Channel.' 'Criminal smuggler gangs continue to organize these dangerous boat crossings,' she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. 'The gangs do not care if people live or die — this is a terrible trade in lives.' Keir Starmer's new Labour government has been at pains to reduce cross-Channel arrivals in small boats, a key issue in this year's general election in July. The government has repeatedly pledged to 'smash the gangs' of people smugglers who organize the perilous journeys.	https://www.voanews.com/a/record-number-of-migrants-cross-channel-into-uk-on-same-day-4-die/7812399.html	2024-10-06T11:30:24-07:00	
Dutch defense minister pledges $440M for drone action plan with Ukraine	Kyiv, Ukraine — Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said on a surprise visit to Kyiv on Sunday that his country will invest 400 million euros ($440 million) in advanced drone development with Ukraine and deliver more F-16s in the coming months. More than 2-1/2 years since the start of the Russian full-scale invasion, Ukraine is fighting to thwart Russia's troops as they inch forward in the east and attack critical infrastructure ahead of the winter months. 'The war, of course, is intensifying every day, and Ukraine is setting up more brigades who all need support, who all need military equipment. We need to have this continuous flow of support,' Brekelmans told Reuters in Kyiv. The drone action plan will combine Ukraine's innovation and Dutch knowledge to improve technology used on the battlefield, he said. 'We will focus on different types of drones, so both surveillance drones, more defensive drones, but also the attack drones, because we see that Ukraine needs those more offensive drones also to target military facilities,' Brekelmans said. Around half of the investment will be spent in the Netherlands, while the rest will be split between Ukraine and other countries, he added. If the developed drones are successful, more funding will be available to scale up production, according to the defense minister. The Netherlands has pledged 10 billion euros ($11 billion) in military support for Ukraine since the beginning of the Russian invasion and spent around 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) so far. Air defense After visiting the city of Kharkiv, pummeled by Russian glide bombs Saturday, Brekelmans said attacking military targets in Russia was the only way to defend the city. Ukraine has asked its partners to give it permission to use their weapons to strike targets deep in Russia and provide it with more air defenses. The Netherlands has contributed to its air defense support by driving international partners to supply Ukraine with F-16 jets and pledging 24 of them. The first batch of planes from the Netherlands is already operating in Ukrainian airspace, according to the minister, while the others will be delivered 'in the upcoming months and maybe beginning of next year.' The country is also delivering reserve parts, ammunition and fuel for jets as it seeks to expand pilot training opportunities through meeting with partner countries and private sector players like Lockheed Martin to keep jets operational, he said. The Netherlands has also announced a plan to assemble a Patriot air-defense system for Ukraine relying on parts from different countries, but Brekelmans said it had struggled to source some parts. He said Ukraine was already using one Dutch-supplied Patriot radar and 'three launchers are going to be delivered very soon.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dutch-defense-minister-pledges-440m-for-drone-action-plan-with-ukraine/7812394.html	2024-10-06T11:09:39-07:00	
Flights at some Iran airports suspended until Monday	Tehran — Iran 's aviation body announced Sunday the cancelation of flights at some of the country's airports, citing 'operational restrictions,' state media reported as Israel vows to retaliate for an Iranian missile strike. Because of those restrictions, 'the flights at some airports of the country will be canceled from 21:00 tonight (1730 GMT), Sunday, October 6, until 6:00 a.m. tomorrow, October 7,' according to IRNA state news agency citing Iran 's Civil Aviation Organization spokesperson, Jafar Yazarloo. Iran on Tuesday launched around 200 missiles in its second direct attack on Israel, in what it said was retaliation for the killing of Tehran-aligned militant leaders in the region, along with a general in Iran 's Revolutionary Guards. Ever since, Israel has said that it will respond to Iran's attack. On Tuesday night, Iran closed its airspace for less than two days until Thursday morning. The aviation body announced then that both domestic and international flights were grounded for security reasons until the reopening. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency has advised European airlines to avoid Iranian airspace until October 31, with the situation under ongoing review.	https://www.voanews.com/a/flights-at-some-iran-airports-suspended-until-monday-/7812374.html	2024-10-06T10:52:49-07:00	
Source: Myanmar junta frees ally of Suu Kyi on health grounds	Yangon — A close ally of detained Myanmar democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was granted amnesty by junta authorities as he battles cancer, a party source told AFP on Sunday. Zaw Myint Maung, 72, is a stalwart of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party that has been a thorn in the side of the military during its decades of rule. He was arrested following the military's latest coup in 2021 and later jailed for corruption. 'He was pardoned because of his health situation today,' a senior NLD source told AFP, requesting anonymity for security reasons. Zaw Myint Maung was in an intensive care unit in Mandalay, where he was battling cancer, the source said. 'His condition is 50-50. We are trying to get more information,' they said. Zaw Myint Maung was a former chief minister of the Mandalay region and was detained shortly after the coup that upended a 10-year experiment with democracy in the Southeast Asian nation. The junta's subsequent crackdown on dissent has decimated the senior ranks of the NLD. Months after the coup Nyan Win, a former NLD spokesperson and Suu Kyi confidante died of COVID-19 while being held in military custody for sedition. In 2022 another former lawmaker was executed by the junta in Myanmar's first use of capital punishment in decades. In March last year the junta dissolved the NLD for failing to re-register under a tough new military-drafted electoral law, removing it from polls it has indicated it may hold in 2025. Suu Kyi, 79, is serving a 27-year prison sentence on charges ranging from corruption to not respecting COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Rights groups say her closed-door trial was a sham designed to remove her from the political scene. Last month Italian media reported that Pope Francis has offered refuge on Vatican territory to Suu Kyi, who led the government ousted by the military in 2021.	https://www.voanews.com/a/source-myanmar-junta-frees-ally-of-suu-kyi-on-health-grounds/7812324.html	2024-10-06T09:15:23-07:00	
Chinese hackers breached US court wiretap systems, WSJ reports	Reuters — Chinese hackers accessed the networks of U.S. broadband providers and obtained information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorized wiretapping, The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday. Verizon Communications, AT&T and Lumen Technologies are among the telecoms companies whose networks were breached by the recently discovered intrusion, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter. The hackers might have held access for months to network infrastructure used by the companies to cooperate with court-authorized U.S. requests for communications data, the Journal said. It added that the hackers had also accessed other tranches of internet traffic. China's foreign ministry responded Sunday that it was not aware of the attack described in the report but said the United States had 'concocted a false narrative' to 'frame' China in the past. 'At a time when cybersecurity has become a common challenge for all countries around the world, this erroneous approach will only hinder the efforts of the international community to jointly address the challenge through dialog and cooperation,' the ministry said in a statement to Reuters. Beijing has previously denied claims by the U.S. government and others that it has used hackers to break into foreign computer systems. Lumen Technologies declined to comment, while Verizon and AT&T did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Journal said the attack was carried out by a Chinese hacking group with the aim of collecting intelligence. U.S. investigators have dubbed it 'Salt Typhoon.' Earlier this year, U.S. law enforcement disrupted a major Chinese hacking group nicknamed 'Flax Typhoon,' months after confronting Beijing about sweeping cyber espionage under a campaign named 'Volt Typhoon.' China’s foreign ministry said in its statement that Beijing’s cybersecurity agencies had found and published evidence to show Volt Typhoon was staged by 'an international ransomware organization.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-hackers-breached-us-court-wiretap-systems-wsj-reports-/7812295.html	2024-10-06T08:41:07-07:00	
Brazilians vote in tense local elections	RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazilians began voting in the first round of local elections Sunday for mayors, deputy mayors and councilors in the country’s 5,569 municipalities. In Sao Paulo, three mayoral candidates are running neck-and-neck, including incumbent Ricardo Nunes, left-wing lawmaker Guilherme Boulos and self-help guru turned far-right politician Pablo Marçal. A runoff is scheduled for Oct. 27. Much of the attention leading up to Sunday’s vote has been on Brazil’s biggest city, where the race has been marred by episodes of violence involving Marçal. Last month, José Luiz Datena, a former TV presenter turned candidate, slammed Marçal with a metal chair during a televised debate following references to allegations of sexual misconduct. In a later debate, an aide to Marçal thumped an adversary’s counterpart, resulting in a bloody face. Marçal sparked more controversy Friday, when he published on social media a falsified medical report indicating cocaine use by Boulos. The document was widely debunked by local media that pointed to inconsistencies including the fact that it was signed by a doctor who had passed away. Boulos, a longtime campaigner for housing rights who is backed by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva vehemently denied the veracity of the document. On Saturday, a judge sitting on Sao Paulo’s electoral court ordered the suspension of Marçal’s Instagram account for 48 hours and deemed that there are 'indications of various offenses under the Electoral Code.' Some of former President Jair Bolsonaro ’s political base has been drawn to Marçal, enthralled by his fiery rhetoric, although the far-right leader is supporting Nunes. In Rio de Janeiro, incumbent Eduardo Paes is hoping to avoid a second-round runoff. Polls indicated until recently that was possible. But his principal challenger Alexandre Ramagem has steadily climbed in the polls in recent weeks, rendering the outcome of Sunday’s vote uncertain. Ramagem, the former chief of Brazil’s intelligence agency under Bolsonaro, is being investigated as part of a wider probe into alleged spying on political opponents. He has denied the accusations. Bolsonaro is backing Ramagem, and his ascent in the polls is widely attributed to the former president's campaigning on his behalf. More than 155 million Brazilians are eligible to vote. Forty-three percent of the electorate is in the southeastern region, where Rio and Sao Paulo are located. Women make up around 52% of voters. Nearly 1,000 transgender politicians are running Sunday in every one of Brazil’s 26 states, according to the nation’s electoral court, which is tracking them for the first time. The number of candidacies has tripled since the last local elections four years ago, when trans rights group Antra mapped them. Polls opened at 8 a.m. Brasilia time and close at 5 p.m. (2000 GMT). A second round will be held in municipalities with more than 200,000 registered voters if none of the candidates for mayor obtains an absolute majority.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7812298.html	2024-10-06T08:37:22-07:00	
Pro-Palestinian, pro-Israeli crowds rally globally on eve of Oct. 7 anniversary	Paris — Crowds were participating in pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protests and memorial events across the world Sunday on the eve of the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel. Sunday’s events follow massive rallies that took place Saturday in several European cities, including London, Berlin, Paris and Rome. Other events are scheduled through the week, with an expected peak Monday, the date of the anniversary. In Australia, thousands of people protested Sunday in support of Palestinians and Lebanon in various cities, while a pro-Israeli rally also took place in Melbourne. Samantha Gazal, who came to the rally in Sydney, said she was there 'because I can’t believe our government is giving impunity to a violent extremist nation and has done nothing. ... We’re watching the violence play out on livestream, and they’re doing nothing.' In Melbourne, supporters of Israel held up posters showing Israeli hostages who are still missing. 'We feel like we didn’t do anything to deserve this,' said Jeremy Wenstein, one of the participants. 'We’re just supporting our brothers and sisters who are fighting a war that they didn’t invite.' At a rally in Berlin, near the Brandenburg Gate, hundreds of pro-Israeli demonstrators set off up the famed Unter den Linden behind a banner that read 'Against all antisemitism,' accompanied by a police escort. With many Israel flags waving overhead, some Jewish leaders led a song about 'shalom' — peace — while marchers chanted 'Free Gaza from Hamas!' and 'Bring them home,' referring to hostages still held in the Gaza strip. Some in the crowd held up photos of hostages still held by Hamas. Photos of several women featured the word 'Kidnapped' in German. Memorial events organized by the Jewish community for those killed in the Oct. 7 attack and prayers for those still in captivity were also to be held in Paris and London on Sunday afternoon. Security forces in several countries warned of heightened levels of alert in major cities, amid concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could inspire new terror attacks in Europe or that some of the protests could turn violent. On Sunday, Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her 'full solidarity' with police, the day after security forces used tear gas and water cannons to disperse violent demonstrators in Rome. Meloni firmly condemned clashes between a few pro-Palestinian demonstrators and law enforcement officers, saying it was 'intolerable that dozens of officers are injured during a demonstration.' Thirty police officers and four protesters were hurt in clashes at the pro-Palestinian march in Rome Saturday, local media said. In Rome’s central Piazzale Ostiense, hooded protesters threw stones, bottles and even a street sign at the police, who responded using water cannons and tear gas. Pope Francis, celebrating his Sunday Angelus prayer from the Vatican, issued a new appeal for peace 'on every front.' Francis also urged his audience not to forget the many hostages still held in Gaza, asking for 'their immediate liberation.' The pope called for a day of prayer and fasting for Monday, the first anniversary of the attack. On Oct. 7 last year, Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis, taking 250 people hostage and setting off a war with Israel that has shattered much of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since then in Gaza, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. It says more than half were women and children. Nearly 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks — missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings — as the region braces for further escalation. In late September, Israel shifted some of its focus to Hezbollah, which holds much of the power in parts of southern Lebanon and some other areas of the country, attacking the militants with exploding pagers, airstrikes and, eventually, incursions into Lebanon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pro-palestinian-pro-israeli-crowds-rally-globally-on-eve-of-oct-7-anniversary-/7812257.html	2024-10-06T08:04:02-07:00	
Rwanda begins Marburg vaccinations to curb deadly outbreak	KIGALI — Rwanda said Sunday it had begun administering vaccine doses against the Marburg virus to try to combat an outbreak of the Ebola-like disease in the east African country, where it has so far killed 12 people. 'The vaccination is starting today immediately,' Health Minister Sabin Nsanzimana said at a news conference in the capital Kigali. He said the vaccinations would focus on those 'most at risk, most exposed health care workers working in treatment centers, in the hospitals, in ICU, in emergency, but also [in] the close contacts of the confirmed cases.' The country has already received shipments of the vaccines including from the Sabin Vaccine Institute. Rwanda's first outbreak of the viral hemorrhagic fever was detected in late September, with 46 cases and 12 deaths reported since then. Marburg has a fatality rate as high as 88%. Marburg symptoms include high fever, severe headaches and malaise within seven days of infection and later severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. It is transmitted to humans by fruit bats and then spreads through contact with the bodily fluids of those infected. Neighboring Uganda has suffered several outbreaks in the past. 'We believe that with vaccines, we have a powerful tool to stop the spread of this virus,' the minister said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-begins-marburg-vaccinations-to-curb-deadly-outbreak/7812263.html	2024-10-06T07:59:07-07:00	
Coco Gauff wins China Open final in straightsets, Sinner rallies to advance in Shanghai	Beijing — Coco Gauff won her second title this season with a lopsided 6-1, 6-3 victory over Karolina Muchova in the final of the China Open on Sunday. Aged 20, the sixth-ranked U.S. player became the youngest China Open champion in 14 years. She is also the second American champion in Beijing, following Serena Williams’ title runs in 2004 and 2013. It was Gauff's eighth career title. She improved her record in tour finals to 8-1 and has a 7-0 record in hard-court finals. Gauff wasted no time and took the opening set in just 31 minutes. She dropped just five points on her first serve and broke Muchova five times. Shanghai Masters Top-ranked Jannik Sinner overcame a one set deficit to rally to a 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-2 win against Tomas Martin Etcheverry at the Shanghai Masters. A night after winning his 250th career match with a straight-sets victory, the 23-year-old Italian faced a much sterner third-round examination against the No. 37-ranked Argentine under the roof inside Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena that hosted play due to rain. Sinner will next play either No. 16-ranked Ben Shelton, who beat the Italian here last year, or Roberto Carballes Baena of Spain. Etcheverry produced the shot of the night with a stunning drop volley to bring up set point in the first set tiebreak, which he converted to take the lead. Sinner began to better find his range in the second and after trading breaks midway through the set, the Italian found another opportunity to level the match. The momentum was all with Sinner in the third as he broke Etcheverry twice more to advance in 2 hours, 39 minutes. Fifth-ranked Daniil Medvedev also came from behind for a 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 victory against Matteo Arnaldi to book his fourth-round berth against either 12th-ranked Stefanos Tsitsipas or Alexandre Muller. The 28-year-old Medvedev was forced to dig deep to level the match after the Italian took a tight first set. In the deciding set, Medvedev's experience and composure came to the fore as he clinched a vital break in the ninth game and held firm to close out the match in 2 hours, 44 minutes. Second-ranked Carlos Alcaraz, who won the China Open on Wednesday for his fourth title of the year, plays his third round match against Chinese player, Wu Yibing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/coco-gauff-wins-china-open-final-in-straightsets-sinner-rallies-to-advance-in-shanghai/7812247.html	2024-10-06T07:31:54-07:00	
Kazakhstan faces legacy of Soviet weapons testing in nuclear power referendum	Moscow — Polls are open in Kazakhstan Sunday for a landmark referendum on building the country’s first nuclear power plant, confronting the country's painful legacy as a testing ground for Soviet nuclear weapons. The proposal is backed by the government and the country’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who hopes to boost the country’s energy security. The plant, which is slated to be built close to Lake Balkhash in Kazakhstan’s southeast, would take pressure off the coal-powered power stations on which the country heavily relies. Although the use of renewable energy is growing, supporters believe Kazakhstan’s position as one of the world’s largest uranium producers makes nuclear energy a logical choice. However, the use of nuclear materials remains a controversial and often sensitive topic in Kazakhstan, which was used as a testing ground for the Soviet Union’s nuclear program. The weapon tests made large swaths of land in the country’s northeastern Semei region uninhabitable, devastating the local environment and affecting the health of nearby residents. In total, 456 tests were carried out between 1949 and 1989 at the Semipalatinsk test site. It was officially closed in August 1991. Critics have also drawn attention to the project’s high costs: The Kazakh government estimates that the nuclear power plant could cost up to $12 billion. Some Kazakhs have sought to protest but have been impeded by authorities. Several anti-nuclear protesters were arrested across Kazakhstan Sunday, while other activists said that permission to hold anti-nuclear rallies on the day of the vote had also been denied by officials in six Kazakh cities. Questions on Russian involvement There are also concerns that Russia’s state atomic agency, Rosatom, could be invited to take part in the plant’s construction at a time when an increasing number of Kazakhs wish to distance themselves from Moscow's influence. Rosatom had previously been named by the government as one of four companies whose reactors could be used for the plant, as well as companies from China, South Korea and France. Tokayev, who has maintained a delicate balancing act between Moscow and the West amid sanctions against Russia, has tried to allay such fears by suggesting that the plant could be built by a multinational team. 'The government must analyze and negotiate,' he told reporters after casting his referendum vote Sunday. 'But my personal vision is that an international consortium of companies with the most advanced technology possible should work together in Kazakhstan.' The result of the referendum is due to be announced Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kazakhstan-faces-legacy-of-soviet-weapons-testing-in-nuclear-power-referendum/7812230.html	2024-10-06T07:01:14-07:00	
Iran's Khamenei decorates commander for Israel attack	Tehran — Iran's supreme leader has decorated the Revolutionary Guards aerospace commander for the Islamic Republic's missile attacks on arch-foe Israel, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's website said Sunday. 'Ayatollah Khamenei presented the Order of Fath ('Conquest' in Farsi) to General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Guards Aerospace Force,' it said. The decoration was bestowed because of what was described as 'the brilliant 'Honest Promise' operation,' according to the website. Hajizadeh, 62, has headed the Guards aerospace unit since its creation in 2009. On Tuesday, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) fired some 200 missiles at Israel in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and IRGC top general Abbas Nilforushan in Beirut. It was Iran's second direct attack on Israel in six months, after a missile and drone assault in April in retaliation for a deadly strike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, which Tehran blamed on Israel. Israel has vowed to respond after Tuesday's Iranian missile attack. The exact nature of that response is still to be determined or seen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-khamenei-decorates-commander-for-israel-attack/7812209.html	2024-10-06T06:20:04-07:00	
International rescue teams arrive in Bosnia after devastating floods and landslides	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina — Rescue teams from Bosnia's neighbors and European Union countries on Sunday were joining efforts to clear the rubble and find people still missing from floods and landslides that devastated parts of the Balkan country. Bosnia sought EU help after a heavy rainstorm overnight on Friday left entire areas under water and debris destroyed roads and bridges, killing at least 18 people and wounding dozens. Officials said that at least 10 people are still unaccounted for, many of them in the village of Donja Jablanica, in southern Bosnia, which was almost completely buried in rocks and rubble from a quarry on a hill above. Residents there have said they heard a thundering rumble and saw houses disappear before their eyes. Luigi Soreca, who heads the EU mission in Bosnia, said on X that the EU stands with Bosnia and that teams are arriving to help. Bosnia is a candidate country for membership in the 27-nation bloc. Authorities said Croatian rescuers have already arrived while a team from Serbia is expected to be deployed in the afternoon, followed by a Slovenian team with dogs. Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Czechia and Turkey have also offered help, a government statement said. Sunday is the date of a local election in Bosnia. Election authorities have postponed voting in the flood-hit regions, but the flooding has overshadowed the vote across the country. Ismeta Bucalovic, a resident of Sarajevo, Bosnia's capital, said, 'We are all overwhelmed by these flooding events. We all think only about that.' Impoverished and ethnically divided, Bosnia has struggled to recover after the brutal war in 1992-95. The country is plagued by political bickering and corruption, stalling its EU bid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/international-rescue-teams-arrive-in-bosnia-after-devastating-floods-and-landslides-/7812189.html	2024-10-06T05:52:16-07:00	
Iran's oil minister visits oil export terminal as Israeli strike feared	DUBAI — Iran's oil minister landed on Kharg Island, home to the country's main export terminal, and held talks with a naval commander Sunday, the oil ministry's news website Shana reported, amid concern Israel could attack energy facilities. An Israeli military spokesperson said Saturday that Israel would retaliate in response to last week's missile attack by Tehran 'when the time is right.' U.S. news website Axios cited Israeli officials as saying Iran's oil facilities could be hit, while U.S. President Joe Biden said Friday that he did not think Israel had yet concluded how to respond. Iran is a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) with production of around 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd), or 3% of global output. Iranian oil exports have climbed this year to near multi-year highs of 1.7 million bpd despite U.S. sanctions. Most of its oil and gas wealth is in the south of the country, where the Kharg Island terminal is situated and from which around 90% of Iranian oil exports are shipped. Oil Minister Mohsen Paknejad arrived Sunday 'to visit the oil facilities and meet operational staff located on Kharg Island,' Shana reported, adding that the oil terminal there has the capacity to store 23 million barrels of crude. State media reported Paknejad met with Mohammad Hossein Bargahi, a Revolutionary Guards Navy commander, to check the security of Iran's South Pars gas platforms and assess the effective actions of the Guards' 4th Naval Region. 'The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy plays an important role in the security of oil and gas facilities,' Paknejad was quoted as saying. China, which does not recognize U.S. sanctions, is Tehran's biggest oil customer and, according to analysts, imported 1.2 to 1.4 million barrels per day from Iran in the first half of 2024.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-oil-minister-visits-oil-export-terminal-as-israeli-strike-feared-/7812184.html	2024-10-06T05:45:12-07:00	
Central Thailand braces for inundation as rain stops in flooded Chiang Mai	CHIANG MAI, Thailand — Several provinces in central Thailand braced for floods Sunday after the Irrigation Department announced it was releasing water from a major dam after weeks of frequent heavy rain. The rain stopped in the northern city of Chiang Mai, but many people, especially the elderly, remained cut off by floodwaters that in some areas were waist-high or more. Volunteer rescue teams, often traveling by boat, worked to supply them with food or evacuate them. Further complicating the situation, electricity was cut off in some neighborhoods for safety reasons. Areas popular with tourists, such as the city’s Night Bazaar and Tha Pae Gate, were under as much as a meter of water. Central provinces, including the capital Bangkok, have been warned of possible flooding as the Irrigation Department plans to release water from the Chao Phraya Dam to keep it under capacity. The latest flooding in Chiang Mai began when the Ping River, which runs along the eastern edge of the city, began overrunning its banks on Friday. Flooding is an annual problem in many parts of Thailand during the monsoon season. Concern remained for animals that had been kept in parks and sanctuaries on the outskirts of Chiang Mai. Most of the 125 elephants held at the city's Elephant Nature Park have been led to safety, although some escaped on their own to seek higher ground. Photos in Thai media showed elephants in water so deep that they could barely keep their heads above it. Thai media reported that at least two elephants have been found dead and several more were unaccounted for.	https://www.voanews.com/a/central-thailand-braces-for-inundation-as-rain-stops-in-flooded-chiang-mai-/7812176.html	2024-10-06T05:28:35-07:00	
As affordable housing disappears, states scramble to shore up the losses	Los Angeles — For more than two decades, the low rent on Marina Maalouf’s apartment in a blocky affordable housing development in Los Angeles’ Chinatown was a saving grace for her family, including a granddaughter who has autism. But that grace had an expiration date. For Maalouf and her family it arrived in 2020. The landlord, no longer legally obligated to keep the building affordable, hiked rent from $1,100 to $2,660 in 2021 — out of reach for Maalouf and her family. Maalouf's nights are haunted by fears her yearslong eviction battle will end in sleeping bags on a friend's floor or worse. While Americans continue to struggle under unrelentingly high rents, as many as 223,0000 affordable housing units like Maalouf's across the U.S. could be yanked out from under them in the next five years alone. It leaves low-income tenants caught facing protracted eviction battles, scrambling to pay a two-fold rent increase or more, or shunted back into a housing market where costs can easily eat half a paycheck. Those affordable housing units were built with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC, a federal program established in 1986 that provides tax credits to developers in exchange for keeping rents low. It has pumped out 3.6 million units since then and boasts over half of all federally supported low-income housing nationwide. 'It’s the lifeblood of affordable housing development,' said Brian Rossbert, who runs Housing Colorado, an organization advocating for affordable homes. That lifeblood isn’t strictly red or blue. By combining social benefits with tax breaks and private ownership, LIHTC has enjoyed bipartisan support. Its expansion is now central to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris’ housing plan to build 3 million new homes. The catch? The buildings typically only need to be kept affordable for a minimum of 30 years. For the wave of LIHTC construction in the 1990s, those deadlines are arriving now, threatening to hemorrhage affordable housing supply when Americans need it most. 'If we are losing the homes that are currently affordable and available to households, then we’re losing ground on the crisis,' said Sarah Saadian, vice president of public policy at the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 'It’s sort of like having a boat with a hole at the bottom,' she said. Not all units that expire out of LIHTC become market rate. Some are kept affordable by other government subsidies, by merciful landlords or by states, including California, Colorado and New York, that have worked to keep them low-cost by relying on several levers. Local governments and nonprofits can purchase expiring apartments, new tax credits can be applied that extend the affordability, or, as in Maalouf’s case, tenants can organize to try to force action from landlords and city officials. Those options face challenges. While new tax credits can reup a lapsing LIHTC property, they are limited, doled out to states by the Internal Revenue Service based on population. It's also a tall order for local governments and nonprofits to shell out enough money to purchase and keep expiring developments affordable. And there is little aggregated data on exactly when LIHTC units will lose their affordability, making it difficult for policymakers and activists to fully prepare. There also is less of a political incentive to preserve the units. 'Politically, you’re rewarded for an announcement, a groundbreaking, a ribbon-cutting,' said Vicki Been, a New York University professor who previously was New York City’s deputy mayor for housing and economic development. 'You’re not rewarded for being a good manager of your assets and keeping track of everything and making sure that you’re not losing a single affordable housing unit,' she said. Maalouf stood in her apartment courtyard on a recent warm day, chit-chatting and waving to neighbors, a bracelet with a photo of Che Guevarra dangling from her arm. 'Friendly,' is how Maalouf described her previous self, but not assertive. That is until the rent hikes pushed her in front of the Los Angeles City Council for the first time, sweat beading as she fought for her home. Now an organizer with the LA Tenants' Union, Maalouf isn’t afraid to speak up, but the angst over her home still keeps her up at night. Mornings she repeats a mantra: 'We still here. We still here.' But fighting day after day to make it true is exhausting. Maalouf's apartment was built before California made LIHTC contracts last 55 years instead of 30 in 1996. About 5,700 LIHTC units built around the time of Maalouf's are expiring in the next decade. In Texas, it’s 21,000 units. When California Treasurer Fiona Ma assumed office in 2019, she steered the program toward developers committed to affordable housing and not what she called 'churn and burn,' buying up LIHTC properties and flipping them onto the market as soon as possible. In California, landlords must notify state and local governments and tenants before their building expires. Housing organizations, nonprofits, and state or local governments then have first shot at buying the property to keep it affordable. Expiring developments also are prioritized for new tax credits, and the state essentially requires that all LIHTC applicants have experience owning and managing affordable housing. 'It kind of weeded out people who weren’t interested in affordable housing long term,' said Marina Wiant, executive director of California’s tax credit allocation committee. But unlike California, some states haven't extended LIHTC agreements beyond 30 years, let alone taken other measures to keep expiring housing affordable. Colorado, which has some 80,000 LIHTC units, passed a law this year giving local governments the right of first refusal in hopes of preserving 4,400 units set to lose affordability protections in the next six years. The law also requires landlords to give local and state governments a two-year heads-up before expiration. Still, local governments or nonprofits scraping together the funds to buy sizeable apartment buildings is far from a guarantee. Stories like Maalouf's will keep playing out as LIHTC units turn over, threatening to send families with meager means back into the housing market. The median income of Americans living in these units was just $18,600 in 2021, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 'This is like a math problem,' said Rossbert of Housing Colorado. 'As soon as one of these units expires and converts to market rate and a household is displaced, they become a part of the need that’s driving the need for new construction.' 'It’s hard to get out of that cycle,' he said. Colorado's housing agency works with groups across the state on preservation and has a fund to help. Still, it's unclear how many LIHTC units can be saved, in Colorado or across the country. It's even hard to know how many units nationwide are expiring. An accurate accounting would require sorting through the constellation of municipal, state and federal subsidies, each with their own affordability requirements and end dates. That can throw a wrench into policymakers' and advocates' ability to fully understand where and when many units will lose affordability, and then funnel resources to the right places, said Kelly McElwain, who manages and oversees the National Housing Preservation Database. It's the most comprehensive aggregation of LIHTC data nationally, but with all the gaps, it remains a rough estimate. There also are fears that if states publicize their expiring LIHTC units, for-profit buyers without an interest in keeping them affordable would pounce. 'It's sort of this Catch-22 of trying to both understand the problem and not put out a big for-sale sign in front of a property right before its expiration,' Rossbert said. Meanwhile, Maalouf's tenant activism has helped move the needle in Los Angeles. The city has offered the landlord $15 million to keep her building affordable through 2034, but that deal wouldn't get rid of over 30 eviction cases still proceeding, including Maalouf's, or the $25,000 in back rent she owes. In her courtyard, Maalouf's granddaughter, Rubie Caceres, shuffled up with a glass of water. She is 5 years old, but with special needs, her speech is more disconnected words than sentences. 'That’s why I’ve been hoping everything becomes normal again, and she can be safe,' said Maalouf, her voice shaking with emotion. She has urged her son to start saving money for the worst. 'We'll keep fighting,' she said, 'but day by day it's hard.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-affordable-housing-disappears-states-scramble-to-shore-up-the-losses-/7812167.html	2024-10-06T05:17:27-07:00	
Pope Francis to appoint 21 new cardinals on Dec. 8	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Sunday announced he will appoint 21 new cardinals of the global Catholic Church, in an unexpected push to influence the powerful group of churchmen that will one day choose his successor. The ceremony to install the new appointees, known as a consistory, will be held on December 8, the 87-year-old pope announced during his weekly noon-time prayer with pilgrims and tourists in St. Peter's Square. It will be the tenth consistory called by the pope since his election 11 years ago as the first pontiff from Latin America. Although popes may choose to appoint cardinals at any time, Francis's decision to make new appointments now comes as something of a surprise. As of the pope's announcement there were 122 cardinals under 80 and able to vote in a future conclave. Church law technically limits the number of such cardinals to 120, but recent popes have frequently gone above that number. Two of the cardinals currently able to vote in a conclave will age out by the end of the year. A further 13 will cross the threshold through the end of 2025. All cardinals, regardless of their age, are allowed to take part in pre-conclave meetings, known as General Congregations, giving them a say in the type of person they think the younger cardinals should choose. Cardinals rank second only to the pope in the Church hierarchy and serve as his closest advisers. Due to their historical power and influence, they are still called the princes of the Church, although Francis has told them not to live like royalty and to be close to the poor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-to-appoint-21-new-cardinals-on-dec-8/7812134.html	2024-10-06T03:55:28-07:00

Macron criticizes Israel on Gaza, Lebanon operations	paris — French President Emmanuel Macron called Saturday for a halt on arms deliveries to Israel for use in Gaza, provoking a sharp response from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He also criticized Netanyahu's decision to send troops into ground operations in Lebanon. 'I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,' Macron told French broadcaster France Inter. 'France is not delivering any,' he added during the interview, which was recorded Tuesday. Macron reiterated his concern over the conflict in Gaza that is continuing despite repeated calls for a cease-fire. 'I think we are not being heard,' he said. 'I think it is a mistake, including for the security of Israel,' he said, adding that the conflict was leading to 'hatred.' His comments brought a swift response from Netanyahu. 'As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilized countries should be standing firmly by Israel's side,' Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office. 'Yet, President Macron and other Western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them.' Israel was fighting a war on several fronts against groups backed by arch-foe Iran, the statement added. 'Is Iran imposing an arms embargo on Hezbollah, on the Houthis, on Hamas and on its other proxies? Of course not,' Netanyahu said. All three groups are backed by Tehran and form part of its 'axis of resistance' against Israel. 'This axis of terror stands together. But countries who supposedly oppose this terror axis call for an arms embargo on Israel. What a disgrace!' Netanyahu said Israel would win even without their support. 'But their shame will continue long after the war is won,' he said. 'Rest assured, Israel will fight until the battle is won — for our sake and for the sake of peace and security in the world.' Cease-fire call French President Macron said avoiding an escalation in Lebanon was a 'priority.' 'Lebanon cannot become a new Gaza,' he added. And he returned to the subject Saturday in a speech to a conference of French-speaking nations in Paris. While both Paris and Washington had called for a cease-fire, said Macron, 'I regret that Prime Minister Netanyahu has made another choice, has taken this responsibility, in particular, for ground operations on Lebanese soil.' The 88 members of the International Organization of La Francophonie (OIF), including France and Canada, have called for an 'immediate and lasting' cease-fire in Lebanon, he added. But Macron reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defense and said that Monday he would be meeting relatives of Franco-Israelis held hostage in Gaza. On Monday, Israel marks the first anniversary of the devastating October 7 Hamas attack that sparked the Gaza war and has now engulfed neighboring Lebanon, creating a perilous regional crisis. The attack resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Israel's retaliatory offensive on Gaza has so far killed at least 41,825 people, most of them civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory. The U.N. has said those figures are reliable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/macron-criticizes-israel-on-gaza-lebanon-operations-/7812116.html	2024-10-06T01:59:50-07:00

Prospects of peaceful resolution to Congo-Rwanda crisis dim	paris — They did not exchange a glance. Congolese Félix Tshisekedi and Rwandan Paul Kagame were nevertheless a few meters from each other, for the 'family photo' which opened the Francophonie summit, Friday in Villers-Cotterêts north of Paris. The heavy diplomatic and military dispute between their two countries in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), ravaged by decades of violence, remains alive, despite Paris' hopes of seeing them come closer. The DRC, as well as the U.N. group of experts, accuse Rwanda of having deployed troops in support of the M23 ('March 23 Movement'), a predominantly Tutsi rebellion that has seized large swathes of territory in this mineral-rich region since 2021. The idea of a Kagame-Tshisekedi meeting fizzled out. French President Emmanuel Macron, the summit's host, finally spoke separately with his two counterparts to 'encourage' them to conclude a peace agreement 'as soon as possible,' while Angola, the mediator appointed by the African Union, has been trying for months to make progress on this sensitive issue. And the summit almost ended in a clash. At the closing Saturday, Macron called for the 'withdrawal of the M23 and Rwandan troops' from Congolese soil, as Kinshasa is demanding. Tshisekedi had slammed the door of the plenary the day before, angry at the silence of the French president on the situation in the DRC, according to a Congolese government source to AFP. Harmonized plan On the Angolan mediation side, discussions are running into new blockages despite the 'important' compromises obtained recently with a view to a possible peace agreement, starting with the cease-fire agreement signed at the end of July, according to Rwandan and Congolese sources contacted by AFP. Alongside ongoing political discussions, intelligence officials from both countries met in secret several times in August to establish a 'harmonized plan' for ending the crisis, the sources said. This plan, which was spread over four months, consisted for the Congolese to launch operations to 'neutralize' the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), to respond to the concerns of Kigali. This rebel group formed by former senior Hutu leaders of the genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994, and who have since taken refuge in the DRC, constitutes a permanent threat in the eyes of Kigali. In return, Rwanda gave the green light to 'a disengagement of forces' deployed in the east of the DRC and hostile to Kinshasa. Alas. The progress of the negotiations finally came to a halt on September 14, at the end of yet another meeting between the Rwandan and Congolese foreign ministers Olivier Nduhungirehe and Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner. Go further The first, questioned by AFP, accuses the DRC of having 'blocked everything' over a matter of timing, 'because the harmonized plan planned to launch operations to neutralize the FDLR on D+25', while the withdrawal of rebel and Rwandan 'forces' was to begin five days later, on D+30. 'The plan proposed was reasonable, it was a good plan,' Nduhungirehe assures. 'The principle that should have been enacted is that of the simultaneity of operations, because it is much more effective,' the Congolese government source told AFP. 'In any case, it is not the military and intelligence experts who ultimately decide, but the political leaders.' At the U.N. on September 25, President Tshisekedi unsurprisingly called on the international community to impose 'targeted sanctions' against Rwanda, insisting that its military presence on Congolese soil is an 'aggression (which) constitutes a major violation of our national sovereignty.' 'Approving this plan would have been politically risky for Tshisekedi, reelected a year ago on a belligerent program towards Kagame and it could have been interpreted by public opinion as a 180-degree turnaround,' explains Onesphore Sematumba, expert for the International Crisis Group (ICG). According to him, 'there will be no purely military solution to the current crisis which has caused a humanitarian catastrophe [with nearly 7 million internally displaced people], it is an illusion.' 'We will have to go much further than the 'harmonized plan,'' he said, and address the issue of mineral resources, the subject of fierce competition, but also political dialogue with the myriad of armed groups present on the ground. In the meantime, the Angolan mediator has proposed a new inter-ministerial meeting on October 12. Both parties assure AFP that they will go.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prospects-of-peaceful-resolution-to-congo-rwanda-crisis-dim/7812109.html	2024-10-06T01:35:52-07:00	
Impossible' for People's Republic of China to be our motherland, Taiwan president says	TAIPEI, Taiwan — It is 'impossible' for the People's Republic of China to become Taiwan's motherland because Taiwan has older political roots, the island's President Lai Ching-te said Saturday. Lai, who took office in May, is condemned by Beijing as a 'separatist.' He rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying that the island is a country called the Republic of China, which traces its origins back to the 1911 revolution that overthrew the last imperial dynasty. The republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists who set up the People's Republic of China, which continues to claim the island as its 'sacred' territory. Speaking at a concert ahead of Taiwan's national day celebrations on October 10, Lai noted that the People's Republic had celebrated its 75th anniversary on October 1, and in a few days it would be the Republic of China's 113th birthday. 'Therefore, in terms of age, it is absolutely impossible for the People's Republic of China to become the 'motherland' of the Republic of China's people. On the contrary, the Republic of China may be the motherland of the people of the People's Republic of China who are over 75 years old,' Lai added, to applause. 'One of the most important meanings of these celebrations is that we must remember that we are a sovereign and independent country,' he said. China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not answer calls seeking comment outside of office hours. Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a speech on the eve of his country's national day, reiterated his government's view that Taiwan was its territory. Lai, who will give his own keynote national day address on October 10, has needled Beijing before with historical references. Last month, Lai said that if China's claims on Taiwan were about territorial integrity, then it should also take back land from Russia signed over by the last Chinese dynasty in the 19th century.	https://www.voanews.com/a/impossible-for-china-to-be-our-motherland-taiwan-president-says/7812107.html	2024-10-06T01:26:48-07:00	
Tunisia votes with Saied set for reelection	Tunis, Tunisia — Voting began in Tunisia's presidential election on Sunday with no real opposition to incumbent Kais Saied, who is widely tipped to win as his most prominent critics are behind bars. Three years after Said staged a sweeping power grab, the election is seen as a closing chapter in Tunisia's experiment with democracy. The North African country had prided itself for more than a decade for being the birthplace of the Arab Spring uprisings against dictatorship. Polling opened at 8 a.m. and is set to end at 6 p.m. Electoral board ISIE has said preliminary results should come no later than Wednesday but may be known earlier. At one polling station in central Tunis, AFP reporters saw a group of mostly older men lining up to vote. Ahead of polling day, there were no campaign rallies or public debates, and nearly all of the campaign posters in city streets have been of Saied. With little hope for change in a country mired in economic crisis, the mood among much of the electorate has been one of resignation. 'We have nothing to do with politics,' Mohamed, a 22-year-old who gave only his first name for fear of retribution, told AFP in the capital. Neither he nor his friends planned to vote, he said, because they believed it was 'useless.' After rising to power in a landslide in 2019, Saied, now 66, led a sweeping power grab that saw him rewrite the constitution. A burgeoning crackdown on dissent ensued, and a number of Saied's critics across the political spectrum were jailed, sparking criticism both at home and abroad. New York-based Human Rights Watch has said that more than '170 people are detained in Tunisia on political grounds or for exercising their fundamental rights.' Jailed opposition figures include Rached Ghannouchi, head of the Islamist-inspired opposition party Ennahdha, which dominated political life after the revolution. Also detained is Abir Moussi, head of the Free Destourian Party, which critics accuse of wanting to bring back the regime that was ousted in 2011. Little enthusiasm ISIE said about 9.7 million people are expected to turn out, but the near certainty of a Saied win and the country's mounting hardships have inspired little to no eagerness to vote. The International Crisis Group think tank said on Friday that 'the president's nationalist discourse and economic hardship' have 'corroded any enthusiasm ordinary citizens might have felt about the election.' 'Many fear that a new mandate for Saied will only deepen the country's socio-economic woes, as well as hasten the regime's authoritarian drift,' it said. Voters are being presented with almost no alternative after ISIE barred 14 hopefuls from running in the race, citing insufficient endorsements among other technicalities. Hundreds of people protested in the capital on Friday, marching along a heavily policed Habib Bourguiba Avenue as some demonstrators bore signs denouncing Saied as a 'Pharaoh manipulating the law.' Running against him Sunday are former lawmaker Zouhair Maghzaoui, who backed Saied's power grab in 2021, and Ayachi Zammel, a little-known businessman who has been in jail since his bid was approved by ISIE last month. Zammel currently faces more than 14 years in prison on accusations of having forged endorsement signatures to enable him to run in the election. In a speech on Thursday, Saied called for a 'massive turnout to vote' and usher in what he called an era of 'reconstruction.' He cited 'a long war against conspiratorial forces linked to foreign circles,' accusing them of 'infiltrating many public services and disrupting hundreds of projects' under his tenure. The International Crisis Group said that while Saied 'enjoys significant support among the working classes, he has been criticized for failing to resolve the country's deep economic crisis.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tunisia-votes-with-saied-set-for-reelection/7812102.html	2024-10-06T01:14:22-07:00

Congo starts mpox vaccinations in effort to slow outbreaks	GOMA, Congo — Congolese authorities on Saturday began vaccinations against mpox, nearly two months after the disease outbreak that spread from Congo to several African countries and beyond was declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization. The 265,000 doses donated to Congo by the European Union and the United States were rolled out in the eastern city of Goma in North Kivu province, where hospitals and health workers have been overstretched, struggling to contain the new and possibly more infectious strain of mpox. Congo, with about 30,000 suspected mpox cases and 859 deaths, accounts for more than 80% of all the cases and 99% of all the deaths reported in Africa this year. All the Central African nation's 26 provinces have recorded mpox cases. Although most mpox infections and deaths recorded in Congo are in children under age 15, the doses being administered are only meant for adults and will be given to at-risk populations and frontline workers, Health Minister Roger Kamba said this week. 'Strategies have been put in place by the services in order to vaccinate all targeted personnel,' Muboyayi ChikayaI, the minister's chief of staff, said as he kicked off the vaccination. At least 3 million doses of the vaccine approved for use in children are expected from Japan in the coming days, Kamba said. Mostly undetected for years Mpox, also known as monkeypox, had been spreading mostly undetected for years in Africa before the disease prompted the 2022 global outbreak that saw wealthy countries quickly respond with vaccines from their stockpiles while Africa received only a few doses despite pleas from its governments. However, unlike the global outbreak in 2022 that was overwhelmingly focused in gay and bisexual men, mpox in Africa is now being spread via sexual transmission as well as through close contact among children, pregnant women and other vulnerable groups, Dr. Dimie Ogoina, the chair of WHO's mpox emergency committee, recently told reporters. More than 34,000 suspected cases and 866 deaths from the virus have been recorded across 16 countries in Africa this year. That is a 200% increase compared to the same period last year, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. But access to vaccines remains a challenge. The continent of 1.4 billion people has only secured commitment for 5.9 million doses of mpox vaccines, expected to be available from October through December, Dr. Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa CDC, told reporters last week. Congo remains a priority, he said. Province at risk of outbreak At the vaccination drive in Goma, Dr. Jean Bruno Kibunda, the WHO representative, warned that North Kivu province is at a risk of a major outbreak due to the 'promiscuity observed in the camps' for displaced people, as one of the world's biggest humanitarian crises caused by armed violence unfolds there. The news of the vaccination program brought relief among many in Congo, especially in hospitals that had been struggling to manage the outbreak. 'If everyone could be vaccinated, it would be even better to stop the spread of the disease,' said Dr. Musole Mulambamunva Robert, the medical director of Kavumu Hospital, one of the mpox treatment centers in eastern Congo. Eastern Congo has been beset by conflict for years, with more than 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich area near the border with Rwanda. Some have been accused of carrying out mass killings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-starts-mpox-vaccinations-in-effort-to-slow-outbreaks/7812086.html	2024-10-06T00:11:34-07:00	
Italy targets climate activists in 'anti-Gandhi' demonstration clampdown	rome — Blocking a road to protest inaction against climate change could soon be punishable with prison in Italy as Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's hard-right government cracks down on demonstrations, even peaceful ones. A new security law passed by MPs and facing final scrutiny in the Senate has been dubbed the 'anti-Gandhi' law — after pacifist Indian independence hero Mahatma Gandhi — by critics for taking aim at demonstrations by people ranging from prisoners to climate activists. It is specifically aimed at protests of two major infrastructure projects — a high-speed, cross-border Turin-Lyon railway to France and a mooted bridge over the Strait of Messina to Sicily — both championed by Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini. Salvini, who also has responsibility for transport and infrastructure, is a defender of the combustion engine and crusades against 'climate terrorism,' particularly the young members of the Last Generation, a climate group known for headline-grabbing protests. Under the new law, blocking a road outside the authorized route of a demonstration could be punishable by up to two years in prison, up from the current penalty of a fine between 1,000 and 4,000 euros ($1,100 to $4,393). Critics see it as a deliberate attempt to silence dissent by Italy's most right-wing government since the end of World War II. But Salvini, head of the far-right League party, rejected accusations of a 'police state,' insisting: 'Good people have nothing to fear.' Ideological madness Meloni's post-fascist Brothers of Italy party took office in October 2022 after an election victory fueled by anti-immigration, nationalist and populist rhetoric, forming a coalition with the League and the right-wing Forza Italia party. The government has since passed numerous laws and measures designed to please their right-wing base, from legislation limiting the activities of charities that rescue migrants at sea to reinforcing an existing ban on surrogacy and clamping down on juvenile crime. With the security law, 'the government wants to charm the part of society that continues to vote mainly for far-right parties,' many of them older people 'who are much less sensitive to issues of civil rights, the labor crisis and climate change,' said Anna Bonalume, a journalist who closely follows Salvini. Opposition parties are up in arms. 'We have never faced such an attack on democratic civilization such as that brought by the Meloni government,' Giuseppe De Marzo, national coordinator of the Even Numbers Network of civil society groups, told AFP at a recent protest of the bill outside parliament. The opposition Five Star Movement condemned it as a 'deeply oppressive measure that has the explicit intention of intimidating... political and social dissent.' The bill also plans to lift a ban on jailing pregnant women or those with a child under one year old, and to penalize prisoners who protest their conditions. Italy is ranked the sixth-worst European country for prison overcrowding, with 109 inmates for every 100 places, according to the Council of Europe. But the law would make it an offense to demonstrate in a prison, even through 'passive resistance,' such as disobeying an order. On the flip side, the legislation proposes the filming of police interrogations. 'The security bill is a real attack on democracy and the rule of law,' said the Green and Left Alliance. The secretary-general of the center-left More Europe, MP Riccardo Magi, called it 'ideological madness.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-targets-climate-activists-in-anti-gandhi-demonstration-clampdown/7812081.html	2024-10-05T23:54:12-07:00	
Peru celebrates 2 decades of a fast-growing breed of guinea pigs eaten as a delicacy	LIMA, Peru — Peru on Thursday celebrated two decades since the creation of a genetically modified breed of guinea pig, a rodent whose meat has formed a part of the diet of people in the Andean nation for thousands of years. The genetically modified breed of guinea pig — known as cuy locally — is called 'Peru.' It was created in 2004 at the National Institute of Agrarian Innovation, Juan Solórzano, a research zootechnician, said in the middle of one of the institute's farms where thousands of guinea pigs are raised for study. What characterizes the Peru breed is that grows faster, reaching a weight of 1 kilogram in 56 days, rather than the 160 days that was needed before, Solórzano said. 'It is a precocious breed,' said Solórzano. Guinea pigs are native to the Andes Mountains and are raised in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and Colombia, areas where the Inca Empire spread almost 500 years ago. There are more than 25 million guinea pigs in Peru, according to official figures. The rodent is so popular in the South American country that authorities have decreed the second Friday of October as National Guinea Pig Day to encourage its consumption. Internal migration from Peru's Andes in the 20th century brought the custom of eating guinea pigs to the country's Pacific coast. 'It is eaten at sporting events or religious festivals. Guinea pig is a festive dish,' Solórzano said. It is also used in ritual healing practices by being rubbed over the body of a sick person. Marina Isabel Briceño, an employee at an air conditioning supply company, said she has eaten guinea pigs since she was a child, calling them a delicacy served at 'special events.' Born in the Cajamarca region, Briceño said that at baptisms the parents often give the godfather and godmother a tray with more than a dozen guinea pigs that have been fried and are 'crispy and ready to eat.' 'I know it is a rodent, a distant relative of rats, but those animals eat garbage, whereas guinea pigs eat something else, tender corn leaves which is why they are tasty,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/peru-celebrates-2-decades-of-a-fast-growing-breed-of-guinea-pigs-eaten-as-a-delicacy/7811313.html	2024-10-05T23:20:28-07:00	
German church is tallest in the world -- until Spain's La Sagrada Familia is done	ULM, Germany — The Ulmer Münster in southern Germany is the world's tallest church. For now, anyway. The Gothic-style Lutheran church's reign — begun in May 31, 1890 — could end in 2025, when La Sagrada Familia Basilica's 'Tower of Jesus Christ' in Spain is set to be completed. At an eventual 172.5 meters high, the Catholic basilica in Barcelona should inch out the Ulmer Münster by a mere 11 meters. But La Sagrada Familia 's construction has taken 142 years and counting. The ultimate completion could come in 2026, 100 years since the death of the original Catalan architect, Antoni Gaudí. Ironically, when the basilica reaches its final height, it will be thanks to a 17-meter cross that was made by a German company. Still, the Ulmer Münster's lead pastor isn't upset. 'I don't find it all that fascinating that it is the highest church tower in the world,' Dean Torsten Krannich told The Associated Press. 'The church also lifts my heart up to God. This is simply a wonderful church that invites you to pray and be thankful.' After all, Ulm will always have Albert Einstein. The physicist was born there in 1879 and lived in Ulm for the first 15 months of his life. His extended family remained, and he returned and climbed the church's tower in 1923. In addition to a stained glass window inside the Ulmer Münster that features Einstein and other famous scientists, the head of communications for Ulm's tourism board is quick to point out that the rest of the city has 'a very high density of art and culture.' 'We can inspire the guests who come here even when we no longer have the highest church in the world, but only have the second-highest,' Dirk Homburg said. The Ulmer Münster's history dates to 1377, when Ulm's citizens decided to demolish their old parish church. Located outside the city gates, it could be a perilous trek for congregants during the frequent wars of the Middle Ages. The residents chose to finance the building of a new one in the city's center themselves, and planned for it to have the highest spire in the world. Construction paused in 1543 when, in the wake of the Protestant Reformation, the city's leaders decided to stop the work amid political and economic turbulence. Building resumed in 1844 and by May 31, 1890, the church was complete. Reaching a record 161.5 meters high, the Ulmer Münster was built deliberately to be taller than the Cologne Cathedral in northwest Germany — which topped out at 157.2 meters in 1880. Although Ulm was destroyed by a World War II bombing raid in 1944, the church itself remained upright. But the Ulmer Münster's age, as well as weather impacts and some 1 million annual visitors, mean that construction and restoration occur constantly amid tourism and religious services. For example, visitors can currently climb 560 stairs to the viewing platform at 102 meters. The platform at 143 meters — 768 stairs — is closed due to stairwell repairs. Krannich said it remains special regardless. 'Whether the tower is now 5 meters higher or 5 meters lower, it doesn't matter to the quality of this church,' he said. Ursula Heckler, a two-time visitor to the church, said she initially journeyed to Ulm in 2019 because she, like many others who trek there, knew it was the world's tallest. She doesn't plan to visit La Sagrada Familia when it takes over. Christos Kalokerinos, a native Ulmer, is unruffled by the looming loss of status. 'There are so many other nice things about the Münster that it's not really relevant,' he said. 'I think most people think that way, too. But of course it was also great to brag a bit about the fact that we have the highest church tower — because many, many people don't necessarily know Ulm that way.' Indeed, there are few indications of the record in the city. The gift shop inside the church just has a fake fireplace labeled 'the world's tallest church,' and the only reference in a tourism store across the street appeared to be a postcard stacking the church's height up against the Great Pyramid of Giza, Big Ben and the Statue of Liberty. All are shorter than the Ulmer Münster. Apparently the region's residents, known as Swabians, 'prefer understatement.' 'They don't want to tell everyone that they're the greatest,' Krannich said. 'Not everyone needs to know. It's enough if we know it.' But next year? 'We're going to involve Albert Einstein a bit more in our marketing,' Homburg said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-church-is-tallest-in-the-world----until-spain-s-la-sagrada-familia-is-done/7810099.html	2024-10-05T23:19:53-07:00	
Grammys' revamped voting body is more diverse, with 66% new members	NEW YORK — For years, the Grammy Awards have been criticized over a lack of diversity — artists of color and women left out of top prizes; rap and contemporary R&B stars ignored — a reflection of the Recording Academy's electorate. An evolving voting body, 66% of whom have joined in the last five years, is working to remedy that. At last year's awards, women dominated the major categories; every televised competitive Grammy went to at least one woman. It stems from a commitment the Recording Academy made five years ago: In 2019, the Academy announced it would add 2,500 women to its voting body by 2025. Under the Grammys' new membership model, the Recording Academy has surpassed that figure ahead of the deadline: More than 3,000 female voting members have been added, it announced Thursday. 'It's definitely something that we're all very proud of,' Harvey Mason jr., academy president and CEO, told The Associated Press. 'It tells me that we were severely underrepresented in that area.' Reform at the Record Academy dates back to the creation of a task force focused on inclusion and diversity after a previous CEO, Neil Portnow, made comments belittling women at the height of the #MeToo movement. Since 2019, approximately 8,700 new members have been added to the voting body. In total, there are now more than 16,000 members and more than 13,000 of them are voting members, up from about 14,000 in 2023 (11,000 of which were voting members). In that time, the academy has increased its number of members who identify as people of color by 63%. 'It's not an all-new voting body,' Mason assures. 'We're very specific and intentional in who we asked to be a part of our academy by listening and learning from different genres and different groups that felt like they were being overlooked, or they weren't being heard.' Mason says that in the last five years, the Recording Academy has 'requalified 100% of our members, which is a huge step.' There are voters who have let their membership lapse — and those who no longer qualify to be a voting member have been removed. There have been renewal review processes in the past, but under the current model, becoming a voting member requires proof of a primary career in music, two recommendations from industry peers and 12 credits in a single creative profession, at least five of which must be from the last five years. Comparisons might be made to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which announced in 2016 that it would restrict Oscars voting privileges to active members — ineligible parties included those who haven't worked in three decades since joining the Academy, unless they themselves are nominated — as a response to #OscarsSoWhite criticisms of its lack of diversity. As a result, some members protested that the new measures unjustly scapegoated older academy members. The film academy has also grown its membership, adding more women and people from underrepresented racial and ethnic communities. The Recording Academy sought to increase its voting body by reaching out to different, underrepresented communities, says Mason. 'Let's take the time to understand why those people aren't engaging with us, figure out how we can fix that,' he said. 'And once we fixed it, then let's invite them or ask them if they would like to be a part of our organization. So, it was a multi-step process.' Since 2019, the Recording Academy has also seen growth in voters across different racial backgrounds: 100% growth in AAPI voters, 90% growth in Black voters and 43% growth in Latino voters. Still, Mason sees room to grow. Of the current voting membership, 66% are men, 49% are white and 66% are over the age of 40. 'Going forward, we're going to continue the work. We're going to continue to grow,' he says. That might not look like a public commitment to a specific figure, but Mason promises 'that our goals will be to be the most relevant, the most reflective, the most accurately representative of the music community that is humanly possible.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/grammys-revamped-voting-body-is-more-diverse-with-66-new-members/7811335.html	2024-10-05T23:19:17-07:00	
With daily phone calls, pope offers Gazans encouragement	Rome — Pope Francis is calling for prayer and fasting on October 7, the first anniversary of the start of the ongoing conflict in Gaza. As the death and destruction continue, so too do the daily phone calls from the pope to the Catholic Holy Family Church parish in Gaza City, offering spiritual sustenance to the priests, nuns and parishioners seeking shelter there. At the start of a special synod on October 2 of Catholic clergy, nuns, and laity in Rome, Francis issued a call to prayer and fasting on the anniversary of the Gaza war as the conflict widens in the Middle East. Pope Francis said that the Church is always at the service of humanity 'especially in this dramatic hour of our history, as the winds of war and the fires of violence continue to ravage entire peoples and nations.' The pontiff asked everyone to take part in a day of prayer and fasting for peace in the world on October 7. The Rev. Gabriel Romanelli, the parish priest at the church in Gaza City, told Vatican Radio the pope calls every day to give the people there 'words of comfort and his blessing.' The priest said the pope 'asks us to protect the children and always encourages us to keep going.' Longtime Vatican watcher Francis X. Rocca has covered the Vatican since 2007, most recently for The Wall Street Journal. He told VOA Pope Francis’ daily phone calls to the Gaza parish are unique. 'It is an extraordinary thing to do, especially if you do it every day,' he said. 'For the start of his pontificate, we know that he was making these personal phone calls to various people, sometimes spontaneously, sort of by surprise. But to be doing this regularly, every day, certainly shows a great degree of concern. During the war in Ukraine, he’s also made comments and sent messages and so forth. But I’m not aware that he’s ever done anything like this.' The Holy Family Church is so named because it is believed that Mary, Joseph, and the infant Jesus passed through the coastal territory into Egypt to flee King Herod’s sword in the first century A.D. The church has not escaped the violence of this war between Israel and Hamas. Two Christian women, Nahida Khalil Anton and her daughter, Samar Kamal Anton, were killed last December as they walked to the convent on the parish’s complex. Seven more people were shot and wounded by Israeli gunfire as they 'tried to protect others inside the church compound,' the Latin Patriarchate in Jerusalem reported. Israel Defense Forces officials said they were investigating. Several hundred Palestinians, mainly Christians but also some Muslims, now shelter in the church compound. The Rev. Rifat Bader, director of the Catholic Center for Studies and Media in Jordan, said there are currently three priests and several nuns from both the late Mother Teresa’s order, The Missionaries of Charity, and Sisters of the Incarnate Word ministering in Gaza. He explained to VOA the importance of the pope’s personal calls. 'We cannot forget these personal, human initiatives every day that the pope is keeping— calling the priests and the nuns there to give a daily encouragement,' he said. 'When a priest receives a call from the pope, it is a big thing inside the Catholic Church. You are talking with the successor of Peter. But when this thing is becoming a daily initiative of the pope, really this is a very human touch that the pope is putting inside the minds, the memories, the spirits of these people: priests and community. This is a sign of encouragement, a sign of paternal care of the pope, besides all the diplomatic relations, initiatives.' Bader said that while the Vatican has sought diplomatic efforts for a cease-fire and an end to the conflict, Pope Francis' personal phone calls 'put this human touch in the hearts' of people who have experienced great suffering and are desperate for an end to the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-daily-phone-calls-pope-offers-gazans-encouragement/7810163.html	2024-10-05T23:18:38-07:00

Trump points to new numbers on migrants with criminal pasts. Here's what they show	WASHINGTON — Republicans are pointing to newly released immigration enforcement data to bolster their argument that the Biden administration is letting migrants who have committed serious crimes go free in the U.S. But the numbers have been misconstrued without key context. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released data to Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales in response to a request he made for information about people under ICE supervision either convicted of crimes or facing criminal charges. Gonzales' Texas district includes an 800-mile stretch bordering Mexico. Gonzales posted the numbers online and they immediately became a flashpoint in the presidential campaign between former President Donald Trump, who has vowed to carry out mass deportations, and Vice President Kamala Harris. Immigration — and the Biden administration's record on border security — has become a key issue in the election. Here's a look at the data and what it does or doesn't show: What are the numbers? As of July 21, ICE said 662,556 people under its supervision were either convicted of crimes or face criminal charges. Nearly 15,000 were in its custody, but the vast majority — 647,572 — were not. Included in the figures of people not detained by ICE were people found guilty of very serious crimes: 13,099 for homicide, 15,811 for sexual assault, 13,423 for weapons offenses and 2,663 for stolen vehicles. The single biggest category was for traffic-related offenses at 77,074, followed by assault at 62,231 and dangerous drugs at 56,533. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, later clarified that the numbers span decades — including the Trump administration and other presidencies — and that those not in its custody may be detained by a state or local agency. It's a distinction ICE didn't make in its report to Gonzales. 'When we speak of somebody who is not detained, we mean not detained in ICE custody. The individual could be in Folsom State Prison, for example,' Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Monday. Millions of people are on ICE's 'non-detained docket,' or people under the agency's supervision who aren't in its custody. Many are awaiting outcomes of their cases in immigration court, including some wearing monitoring devices. Others have been released after completing their prison sentences because their countries won't take them back. What do both sides say about the numbers? Republicans pointed to the data as proof that the Biden administration is letting immigrants with criminal records into the country and isn't doing enough to kick out those who commit crimes while they're here. 'The truth is clear — illegal immigrants with a criminal record are coming into our country. The data released by ICE is beyond disturbing, and it should be a wake-up call for the Biden-Harris administration and cities across the country that hide behind sanctuary policies,' Gonzales said in a news release, referring to pledges by local officials to limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Trump, who has repeatedly portrayed immigrants as bringing lawlessness and crime to America, tweeted multiple screenshots of the data with the words: '13,000 CROSSED THE BORDER WITH MURDER CONVICTIONS.' He also asserted that the numbers correspond to Biden and Harris' time in office. The data was being misinterpreted, Homeland Security said in a statement Sunday. 'The data goes back decades; it includes individuals who entered the country over the past 40 years or more, the vast majority of whose custody determination was made long before this Administration,' the agency said. 'It also includes many who are under the jurisdiction or currently incarcerated by federal, state or local law enforcement partners.' Mayorkas said it was 'unfortunate' the information didn't come with proper explanation, saying that 'lends itself to misinterpretation, either deliberate or otherwise.' The department also stressed what it has done to deport those without the right to stay in America, saying it had removed or returned more than 700,000 people in the past year, which it said was the highest number since 2010. Homeland Security said it had removed 180,000 people with criminal convictions since President Joe Biden took office. What's behind the figures? The data isn't only listing people who entered the country during the Biden administration but includes people going back decades who came during previous administrations, said Doris Meissner, former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which was the predecessor to ICE. They're accused or convicted of committing crimes in America as opposed to committing crimes in other countries and then entering the U.S., said Meissner, who is now director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute. 'This is not something that is a function of what the Biden administration did,' she said. 'Certainly, this includes the Biden years, but this is an accumulation of many years, and certainly going back to at least 2010, 2011, 2012.' A 2017 report by Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General says that as of August 2016, ICE had about 368,574 people on its non-detained docket who were convicted criminals. By June 2021, shortly after Trump left office, that number was up to 405,786. Can't ICE just deport criminals? ICE has limited resources. The number of people it supervises has skyrocketed, while its staffing has not. As the agency noted in a 2023 end-of-year report, it often has to send staff to help at the border, taking them away from their normal duties. The number of people ICE supervises but who aren't in its custody has grown from 3.3 million a little before Biden took office to a little over 7 million last spring. 'The simple answer is that as a system, we haven't devoted enough resources to the parts of the government that deal with monitoring and ultimately removing people who are deportable,' Meissner said. ICE also has logistical and legal limits on who they can hold. Its budget allows the agency to hold 41,500 people at a time. John Sandweg, who was acting ICE director from 2013 to 2014 under then-President Barack Obama, said holding people accused or convicted of the most serious crimes is always the top priority. But once someone has a final order of removal — meaning a court has found that they don't have the right to stay in the country — they cannot be held in detention forever while ICE works out how to get them home. A 2001 Supreme Court ruling essentially prevented ICE from holding those people for more than six months if there is no reasonable chance to expect they can be sent back. Not every country is willing to take back their citizens, Sandweg said. He said he suspects that a large number of those convicted of homicide but not held by ICE are people who were ordered deported but the agency can't remove them because their home country won't take them back. 'It's a very common scenario. Even amongst the countries that take people back, they can be very selective about who they take back,' he said. The U.S. also could run into problems deporting people to countries with which it has tepid relations. Homeland Security did not respond to questions about how many countries won't take back their citizens. The 2017 watchdog report put the number at 23 countries, plus an additional 62 that were cooperative but where there were delays getting things like passports or travel documents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-points-to-new-numbers-on-migrants-with-criminal-pasts-here-s-what-they-show-/7810034.html	2024-10-05T23:17:24-07:00	
In South Korea, deepfake porn wrecks women's lives, deepens gender conflict	SEOUL, South Korea — Three years after the 30-year-old South Korean woman received a barrage of online fake images that depicted her nude, she is still being treated for trauma. She struggles to talk with men. Using a mobile phone brings back the nightmare. 'It completely trampled me, even though it wasn't a direct physical attack on my body,' she said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. She didn't want her name revealed because of privacy concerns. Many other South Korean women recently have come forward to share similar stories as South Korea grapples with a deluge of non-consensual, explicit deepfake videos and images that have become much more accessible and easier to create. It was not until last week that parliament revised a law to make watching or possessing deepfake porn content illegal. Most suspected perpetrators in South Korea are teenage boys. Observers say the boys target female friends, relatives and acquaintances — also mostly minors — as a prank, out of curiosity or misogyny. The attacks raise serious questions about school programs but also threaten to worsen an already troubled divide between men and women. Deepfake porn in South Korea gained attention after unconfirmed lists of schools that had victims spread online in August. Many girls and women have hastily removed photos and videos from their Instagram, Facebook and other social media accounts. Thousands of young women have staged protests demanding stronger steps against deepfake porn. Politicians, academics and activists have held forums. 'Teenage (girls) must be feeling uneasy about whether their male classmates are okay. Their mutual trust has been completely shattered,' said Shin Kyung-ah, a sociology professor at South Korea's Hallym University. The school lists have not been formally verified, but officials including President Yoon Suk Yeol have confirmed a surge of explicit deepfake content on social media. Police have launched a seven-month crackdown. Recent attention to the problem has coincided with France's arrest in August of Pavel Durov, the founder of the messaging app Telegram, over allegations that his platform was used for illicit activities including the distribution of child sexual abuse. South Korea's telecommunications and broadcast watchdog said Monday that Telegram has pledged to enforce a zero-tolerance policy on illegal deepfake content. Police say they've detained 387 people over alleged deepfake crimes this year, more than 80% of them teenagers. Separately, the Education Ministry says about 800 students have informed authorities about intimate deepfake content involving them this year. Experts say the true scale of deepfake porn in the country is far bigger. The U.S. cybersecurity firm Security Hero called South Korea 'the country most targeted by deepfake pornography' last year. In a report, it said South Korean singers and actresses constitute more than half of the people featured in deepfake pornography worldwide. The prevalence of deepfake porn in South Korea reflects various factors including heavy use of smart phones; an absence of comprehensive sex and human rights education in schools and inadequate social media regulations for minors as well as a 'misogynic culture' and social norms that 'sexually objectify women,' according to Hong Nam-hee, a research professor at the Institute for Urban Humanities at the University of Seoul. Victims speak of intense suffering. In parliament, lawmaker Kim Nam Hee read a letter by an unidentified victim who she said tried to kill herself because she didn't want to suffer any longer from the explicit deepfake videos someone had made of her. Addressing a forum, former opposition party leader Park Ji-hyun read a letter from another victim who said she fainted and was taken to an emergency room after receiving sexually abusive deepfake images and being told by her perpetrators that they were stalking her. The 30-year-old woman interviewed by The AP said that her doctoral studies in the United States were disrupted for a year. She is receiving treatment after being diagnosed with panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder in 2022. Police said they've detained five men for allegedly producing and spreading fake explicit contents of about 20 women, including her. The victims are all graduates from Seoul National University, the country's top school. Two of the men, including one who allegedly sent her fake nude images in 2021, attended the same university, but she said has no meaningful memory of them. The woman said the images she received on Telegram used photos she had posted on the local messaging app Kakao Talk, combined with nude photos of strangers. There were also videos showing men masturbating and messages describing her as a promiscuous woman or prostitute. One photo shows a screen shot of a Telegram chatroom with 42 people where her fake images were posted. The fake images were very crudely made but the woman felt deeply humiliated and shocked because dozens of people — some of whom she likely knows — were sexually harassing her with those photos. Building trust with men is stressful, she said, because she worries that 'normal-looking people could do such things behind my back.' Using a smart phone sometimes revives memories of the fake images. 'These days, people spend more time on their mobile phones than talking face to face with others. So we can't really easily escape the traumatic experience of digital crimes if those happen on our phones,' she said. 'I was very sociable and really liked to meet new people, but my personality has totally changed since that incident. That made my life really difficult and I'm sad.' Critics say authorities haven't done enough to counter deepfake porn despite an epidemic of online sex crimes in recent years, such as spy cam videos of women in public toilets and other places. In 2020, members of a criminal ring were arrested and convicted of blackmailing dozens of women into filming sexually explicit videos for them to sell. 'The number of male juveniles consuming deepfake porn for fun has increased because authorities have overlooked the voices of women' demanding stronger punishment for digital sex crimes, the monitoring group ReSET said in comments sent to AP. South Korea has no official records on the extent of deepfake online porn. But ReSET said a recent random search of an online chatroom found more than 4,000 sexually exploitive images, videos and other items. Reviews of district court rulings showed less than a third of the 87 people indicted by prosecutors for deepfake crimes since 2021 were sent to prison. Nearly 60% avoided jail by receiving suspended terms, fines or not-guilty verdicts, according to lawmaker Kim's office. Judges tended to lighten sentences when those convicted repented for their crimes or were first time offenders. The deepfake problem has gained urgency given South Korea's serious rifts over gender roles, workplace discrimination facing women, mandatory military service for men and social burdens on men and women. Kim Chae-won, a 25-year-old office worker, said some of her male friends shunned her after she asked them what they thought about digital sex violence targeting women. 'I feel scared of living as a woman in South Korea,' said Kim Haeun, a 17-year-old high school student who recently removed all her photos on Instagram. She said she feels awkward when talking with male friends and tries to distance herself from boys she doesn't know well. 'Most sex crimes target women. And when they happen, I think we are often helpless,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-south-korea-deepfake-porn-wrecks-women-s-lives-deepens-gender-conflict/7810018.html	2024-10-05T23:16:36-07:00	
North Korea and China mark their 75th anniversary of ties	SEOUL, South Korea — The leaders of North Korea and China marked the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic relations on Sunday by exchanging messages that expressed hopes for stronger ties, as outsiders raised questions about their relationship. The message exchange came as North Korea and Russia have been sharply expanding their cooperation while China apparently keeps its distance. Experts say that the level of exchanges and commemorative programs between North Korea and China in the coming months will provide a clue to the exact status of their ties. In a message sent to Chinese President Xi Jinping, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his government will 'steadily strive to consolidate and develop the friendly and cooperative relations' between the two countries, according to North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency. Xi, in his message to Kim, said that China is ready to jointly promote 'the stable and further advance of the socialist cause in the two countries,' KCNA said. Since North Korea and China established diplomatic ties on October 6, 1949, their relationship has often been described as being 'as close as lips and teeth.' China, North Korea's biggest trading partner and main aid provider, has been suspected of avoiding fully implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to help its impoverished neighbor stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against U.S. influence on the Korean Peninsula. But many observers say China is reluctant to form a three-way, anti-West alliance with North Korea and Russia as it prefers a stable regional security environment to tackle numerous economic challenges and maintain relationships with Europe and its Asian neighbors. North Korea and Russia have moved significantly closer to each other amid widespread outside suspicions that North Korea has supplied conventional weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine in return for military and economic assistance. During a meeting in Pyongyang in June, Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked, in what was considered the two countries' biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. North Korea is locked in confrontations with the U.S., South Korea and their partners over its advancing nuclear program. Kim has said he was forced to expand both nuclear and conventional capabilities to cope with U.S.-led security threats. On Sunday, KCNA reported that Kim oversaw a live artillery firing drill by cadets of a military academy. After watching the drill, Kim said training programs at the military academy must focus on 'the guerrilla war tactics to wipe out the enemies through rapid mobile and surprise operations,' according to KCNA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-and-china-mark-their-75th-anniversary-of-ties/7812074.html	2024-10-05T23:13:50-07:00	
Trump returns to site of first assassination attempt for campaign rally	BUTLER, Pennsylvania — Donald Trump returned on Saturday to the Pennsylvania fairgrounds where he was nearly assassinated in July, holding a sprawling rally before a massive crowd in a critical swing state Trump hopes to return to his column in November's election. The former president and Republican nominee picked up where he left off in July when a gunman tried to assassinate him and struck his ear. He began his speech with, 'As I was saying,' and gestured toward an immigration chart he was looking at when the gunfire began. The Trump campaign worked to maximize the event's headline-grabbing potential with just 30 days to go and voting already underway in some states in his race against his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Musician Lee Greenwood appeared on stage and serenaded him with God Bless the USA, frequently played at his rallies, and billionaire Elon Musk spoke for the first time at a Trump rally. 'We fought together. We have endured together. We have pushed onward together,' Trump said. 'And right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled together. We've bled.' 'This is a must-win' Trump needs to drive up voter turnout in conservative strongholds like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, rural-suburban community, if he wants to win Pennsylvania in November. Harris, too, has targeted her campaign efforts at Pennsylvania, rallying there repeatedly as part of her aggressive outreach in critical swing states. At the beginning of the rally, Trump asked for a moment of silence to honor firefighter Corey Comperatore, who died as he shielded family members from gunfire. Opera singer Christopher Macchio sang Ave Maria after a bell rung at the same time that gunfire began on July 13. Standing behind protective glass that now encases the stage at his outdoor rallies, Trump called the would-be assassin 'a vicious monster' and said he did not succeed 'by the hand of providence and the grace of God.' There was a very visible heightened security presence, with armed law enforcers in camouflage uniforms on roofs. One of the most anticipated guests of the evening was Musk, who climbed onto the stage on Saturday jumping and pumping his fists in the air after Trump introduced him as a 'great gentleman' and said he 'saved free speech.' 'President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America,' said Musk, who endorsed Trump after the assassination attempt. 'This is a must-win situation.' Musk, who bought Twitter and rebranded it as X and has embraced conservative politics, met with Trump and Vance backstage, donning a black 'Make America Great Again' hat. A billboard on the way into the rally said, 'IN MUSK WE TRUST,' and showed his photo. Earlier on Saturday, Trump's running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, got on stage and reflected on the events that day while criticizing Democrats for calling Trump 'a threat to democracy,' saying that kind of language is 'inflammatory.' 'You heard the shots. You saw the blood. We all feared the worst. But you knew everything would be OK when President Trump raised his fist high in the air and shouted, 'Fight, fight!'' said Vance. 'Now I believe it as sure as I'm standing here today that what happened was a true miracle.' Crowds pack stands Crowds were lined up as the sun rose Saturday. The crowd packed bleachers, folding chairs and the field stretching to the venue's edges. Area hotels, motels and inns were said to be full and some rallygoers arrived Friday. Much of the crowd waited several hours for Trump. About half an hour into his speech, Trump paused his speech for more than five minutes after an attendee had a medical issue and needed a medic. Trump used the event to remember Comperatore, the volunteer firefighter struck and killed at the July 13 rally, and to recognize the two other rallygoers injured, David Dutch and James Copenhaver. They and Trump were struck when 20-year-old shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, opened fire from an unsecured rooftop nearby before he was fatally shot by sharpshooters. The building from which Crooks fired was completely obscured by tractor-trailers, a large grassy perimeter and a fence. Most bleachers were now at the sides, rather than behind Trump. How Crooks managed to outmaneuver law enforcement that day and scramble on top of a building within easy shooting distance of the ex-president is among many questions that remain unanswered about the worst Secret Service security failure in decades. Another is his motive. Butler County District Attorney Rich Goldinger told WPXI-TV this week that 'everyone is doubling down on their efforts to make sure this is done safely and correctly.' Mike Slupe, the county sheriff, told the station he estimates the Secret Service, was deploying 'quadruple the assets' it did in July. The agency has undergone a painful reckoning over its handling of two attempts on Trump's life. ‘I believe God's got Trump’ Butler County, on the western edge of a coveted presidential swing state, is a Trump stronghold. He won the county with about 66% of the vote in both 2016 and 2020. About 57% of the county's 139,000 registered voters are Republicans, compared with about 29% who are Democrats and 14% something else. Chris Harpster, 30, of Tyrone, Pennsylvania, was accompanied by his girlfriend on Saturday as he returned to the scene. Of July 13, he said, 'I was afraid' — as were his parents, watching at home, who texted him immediately after the shots rang out. Heightened security measures were making him feel better now, as well as the presence of his girlfriend, a first-time rallygoer. Harpster said he will be a third-time Trump voter in November, based on the Republican nominee's stances on immigration, guns, abortion and energy. Harpster said he hopes Pennsylvania will go Republican, particularly out of concern over gas and oil industry jobs. Other townspeople were divided over the value of Trump's return. Heidi Priest, a Butler resident who started a Facebook group supporting Harris, said Trump's last visit fanned political tensions in the city. 'Whenever you see people supporting him and getting excited about him being here, it scares the people who don't want to see him reelected,' she said. Terri Palmquist came from Bakersfield, California, and said her 18-year-old daughter tried to dissuade her. 'I just figure we need to not let fear control us. That's what the other side wants is fear. If fear controls us, we lose,' she said. She said she was not worried about her own safety. 'Honesty, I believe God's got Trump, for some reason. I do. So we're rooting for him.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-returns-to-site-of-first-assassination-attempt-for-campaign-rally/7812072.html	2024-10-05T23:00:44-07:00	
Thousands join pro-Palestinian rallies around the globe as Oct. 7 anniversary nears	rome — Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse violent demonstrators in Rome as tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets in major European cities and around the globe Saturday to call for a cease-fire as the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel approached. Huge rallies were held in several European cities, with gatherings expected to continue over the weekend and peak on Monday, the date of the anniversary. In Rome, several thousand demonstrated peacefully Saturday afternoon until a smaller group tried to push the rally toward the center of the city, in spite of a ban by local authorities who refused to authorize protests, citing security concerns. Some protesters, dressed in black and with their faces covered threw stones, bottles and paper bombs at the police, who responded with tear gas and water cannons, eventually dispersing the crowd. At least 30 law enforcement officers and three demonstrators were injured in the clashes, local media reported. The rally in Rome had been calm earlier, with people chanting 'Free Palestine, Free Lebanon,' waving Palestinian flags and holding banners calling for an immediate stop to the conflict. In London, thousands marched through the capital to Downing Street amid a heavy police presence. The atmosphere was tense as pro-Palestinian protesters and counterdemonstrators, some holding Israeli flags, passed one another. Scuffles broke out as police officers pushed back activists trying to get past a cordon. At least 17 people were arrested on suspicion of public order offenses, supporting a proscribed organization and assault, London's Metropolitan Police said. In the northern German city of Hamburg, about 950 people staged a peaceful demonstration with many waving Palestinian and Lebanese flags or chanting 'Stop the Genocide,' the DPA news agency reported, citing a count by police. Two smaller pro-Israeli counterdemonstrations took place without incident, it said. Several thousand protesters gathered peacefully at Paris' Republique Plaza in a show of solidarity with the Palestinian and Lebanese people. Many were waving Palestinian flags while holding posters reading 'stop the genocide,' 'free Palestine,' and 'hands off Lebanon.' Pro-Palestinian demonstrators also gathered at New York's Times Square to call for a cease-fire, chanting 'Gaza!' to a drumbeat. Some wore keffiyeh scarfs, waved Palestinian and Lebanese flags and held a large cardboard image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with red paint symbolizing blood across his face. Rallies were also planned in several other cities in the United States as well as in other parts of the world, including Denmark, Switzerland, South Africa and India. In the Philippines, dozens of left-wing activists protested near the U.S. Embassy in Manila, where police prevented them from getting closer to the seaside compound. In Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched to the heavily guarded U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Authorities blocked roads leading to the embassy with razor wire and concrete barriers as more than 1,000 police were deployed around the compound. Pro-Israeli demonstrations are expected to be held Sunday because Jews across the world are still observing Rosh Hashana, or the Jewish new year. This year, emotions will be high for many given that the midpoint of the 10 days spanning Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur is October 7 — the one-year anniversary of the Hamas attack that killed 1,200 Israelis and triggered the ongoing war in Gaza. High security alerts Security forces in several countries warned of heightened levels of alert in major cities, amid concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could inspire new terror attacks in Europe or that the protests could turn violent. Pro-Palestinian protests calling for an immediate cease-fire have repeatedly taken place across Europe and around the globe in the past year and have often turned violent, with confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement officers. Italian authorities believed that the timing of Saturday's rally in Rome risked the October 7 attack being 'glorified,' local media reported. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi also stressed that, ahead of the key anniversary, Europe is on high alert for potential terror attacks. 'This is not a normal situation. … We are already in a condition of maximum prevention,' he said. Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign in Britain, said he and others will keep organizing marches until action against Israel is taken. 'We need to be out on the streets in even bigger numbers to stop this carnage and stop Britain being drawn into it,' Jamal said. In Berlin, a march is scheduled from the Brandenburg Gate to Bebelplatz on Sunday. Local media reported that security forces have warned of potential overload because of the scale of protests. German authorities pointed to increasing antisemitic and violent incidents in recent days. Earlier this week in France, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau warned the country's regional prefects, expressing concern about possible tensions and saying that the terrorist threat was high. Thousands rally in Washington About 3,000 people demonstrated within sight of the White House. Amid a heavy police presence, the protesters gathered at Lafayette Park, the same site as 2020 protests against police brutality and the killing of George Floyd. 'Resistance is justified when people are occupied!' they chanted. One speaker on stage called October 7, 2023, 'the day that Gazans finally broke out of their prison.' The crowds then marched through downtown, with police closing streets ahead of them. Protesters carried signs criticizing the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the issue. One read: 'Abandon Harris '24.' Law student Annette Tunstall said she considered voting Democratic after Biden stepped down and Harris became the candidate. But she lost faith after pro-Palestinian voices were muzzled at the Democratic National Convention, she said. 'I really wanted to feel like I could vote for her in good conscience,' Tunstall said. 'I don't think it would have taken a lot for thousands of pro-Palestinian people to hold their nose and vote for Harris.' A tense and bloody year On October 7 last year, Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis, taking 250 people hostage and setting off a war with Israel that has shattered much of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since then in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. Nearly 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks — missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings — as the region braces for further escalation. In late September, Israel shifted some of its focus to Hezbollah, which it seeks to push back from its border in parts of south Lebanon where the group is entrenched.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-join-pro-palestinian-rallies-around-the-globe-as-oct-7-anniversary-nears/7812069.html	2024-10-05T22:50:55-07:00	
Apparent Israeli airstrike on Gaza mosque kills at least 18	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An apparent Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed at least 18 people in central Gaza, Palestinian medical officials said. The strike hit a mosque sheltering displaced people near the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah, the hospital said in a statement. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead were all men. Another two men were critically wounded, the hospital said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment about the strike on the mosque. The latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is nearing 42,000, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but many of the dead were women and children. The attack early Sunday came after Israel bombarded Lebanon on Saturday as it targeted both Hezbollah and Hamas fighters. Thousands of people in Lebanon, including Palestinian refugees, continued to flee the widening conflict in the region, while rallies were held around the world marking the approaching anniversary of the start of the war in Gaza. The strong explosions Saturday began near midnight and continued into Sunday after Israel's military urged residents to evacuate areas in Dahiyeh, the predominantly Shiite collection of suburbs on Beirut's southern edge. AP video showed the blasts illuminating the densely populated suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. They followed a day of sporadic strikes and the nearly continuous buzz of reconnaissance drones. Israel's military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted. The strikes reportedly targeted a building near a road leading to Lebanon's only international airport, and another building formerly used by the Hezbollah-run broadcaster Al-Manar. Social media reports claimed that one of the strikes hit an oxygen tank storage facility, but this was later denied by the owner of the company. Shortly thereafter, Hezbollah claimed in a statement that it successfully targeted a group of Israeli soldiers near the Manara settlement in northern Israel 'with a large rocket salvo, hitting them accurately.' On Saturday, Israel's attack on the northern Beddawi camp killed an official with Hamas' military wing along with his wife and two young daughters, the Palestinian militant group said. Hamas later said another military wing member was killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley. The aftermath showed smashed buildings, scattered bricks and stairways to nowhere. Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began , in addition to most of the top leadership of the Lebanon-based Hezbollah as fighting has sharply escalated. At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes in less than two weeks. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group away from shared borders so displaced Israelis can return to their homes. Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' October 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel's military have traded fire almost daily. Last week, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a brief war in 2006. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground clashes that Israel says have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters in Damascus that 'we are trying to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and in Lebanon.' The minister said the unnamed countries putting forward initiatives include regional states and some outside the Middle East. Araghchi spoke a day after the supreme leader of Iran praised its recent missile strikes on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary. On Saturday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said 'Israel has the duty and the right to defend itself and respond to these attacks, and it will do so.' On Lebanon, he said 'we are not done yet.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/apparent-israeli-airstrike-on-gaza-mosque-kills-at-least-18-/7812066.html	2024-10-05T22:40:54-07:00	
Tropical Storm Milton forms in Gulf of Mexico, could become hurricane	miami — A storm system that was brewing in the Gulf of Mexico earlier Saturday has strengthened into Tropical Storm Milton, with forecasters warning it could intensify into a hurricane headed to Florida next week. Tropical Storm Milton is about 355 kilometers north-northeast of Veracruz, Mexico, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said in a 1:25 p.m. EDT advisory. Though no coastal watches or warnings were in effect, the hurricane center said the Florida Peninsula, the Florida Keys, Mexico's Yucatan peninsula and the northwestern Bahamas should monitor the system’s progress. The storm is forecast to strengthen and bring the risk of life-threatening impacts to portions of Florida's West Coast next week, with hurricane and storm-surge watches likely being in effect Sunday. Parts of Florida are expected to have heavy rainfall beginning Sunday. The rainfall will bring the risk of flash, urban, and areal flooding, along with some river flooding. 'There is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge and wind impacts for portions of the west coast of the Florida Peninsula beginning late Tuesday or Wednesday. Residents in these areas should ensure they have their hurricane plan in place, follow any advice given by local officials, and check back for updates to the forecast,' the center said. Looking farther east, Leslie has strengthened into a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean but isn’t threatening land, forecasters said. The storm was located Saturday about 1,170 kilometers west-southwest of the southernmost Cabo Verde Islands and had maximum sustained winds of 120 kph. There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect. Meanwhile, Hurricane Kirk remained a Category 4 major hurricane, and waves from the system were affecting the Leeward Islands, Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles, forecasters said. The storm's swells were expected to spread to the East Coast of the United States, the Atlantic Coast of Canada and the Bahamas on Saturday night and Sunday. Forecasters warned the waves could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Kirk was expected to weaken starting Saturday, the center said. Though there were no coastal warnings or watches in effect for Kirk, the center said those in the Azores, where swells could hit Monday, should monitor the storm's progress. Kirk was about 1,570 kilometers east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands with maximum sustained winds of 209 kph. The storms churned as rescuers in the U.S. Southeast searched for people unaccounted for after Hurricane Helene struck last week, leaving behind a trail of death and catastrophic damage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-milton-forms-in-gulf-of-mexico-could-become-hurricane-/7812058.html	2024-10-05T21:54:16-07:00	
Hungarians protest state media 'propaganda factory,' demand unbiased press	budapest, hungary — Thousands of protesters gathered outside the headquarters of Hungary's public media corporation Saturday to demonstrate against what they say is an entrenched propaganda network operated by the nationalist government at taxpayer expense. The protest was organized by Hungary's most prominent opposition figure, Peter Magyar, and his upstart TISZA party, which has emerged in recent months as the most serious political challenge for Prime Minister Viktor Orban since he took power nearly 15 years ago. Magyar, whose party received nearly 30% of the vote in European Union elections this summer and is polling within a few points of the governing Fidesz party, has been outspoken about what he sees as the damage Orban's 'propaganda factory' has done to Hungary's democracy. 'What is happening here in Hungary in 2024, and calling itself 'public service' media, is a global scandal,' Magyar told the crowd in Budapest on Saturday. 'Enough of the nastiness, enough of the lies, enough of the propaganda. Our patience has run out. The time for confrontation has come.' Observers say press freedom under threat Both Hungarian and international observers have long warned that press freedom in the Central European country was under threat, and that Orban's party has used media buyouts by government-connected business tycoons to build a pro-government media empire. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders estimates that such buyouts have given Orban's party control of some 80% of Hungary's media market resources. In 2021, the group put Orban on its list of media 'predators,' the first EU leader to earn the distinction. On Saturday, Balazs Tompe, a protester who traveled several hours to attend the demonstration, called the state media headquarters a 'factory of lies.' 'The propaganda goes out at such a level and is so unbalanced that it's blood boiling, and I think we need to raise our voices,' he said. 'It's nonsense that only government propaganda comes out in the media that is financed by the taxpayers.' 'Public only hears from one side' A retired teacher from southern Hungary, Agnes Gera, said dissenting voices were censored from the public media, limiting Hungarians' access to information about political alternatives. 'It's very burdensome and unfortunate that the system works this way where the public only hears from one side and don't even know about the other side,' she said. Magyar demanded the resignation of the public media director, and echoed complaints from many opposition politicians that they are not provided the opportunity to appear on public television to communicate with voters. He called his supporters to another demonstration on October 23, a national holiday commemorating Hungary's failed revolution against Soviet domination in 1956.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hungarians-protest-state-media-propaganda-factory-demand-unbiased-press-/7811812.html	2024-10-05T16:09:21-07:00

China says it evacuated 215 nationals from Lebanon	Beijing — China said Saturday that it has evacuated 215 of its nationals from Lebanon, where Israel has been carrying out intense bombardments since last month, resulting in more than 1,100 deaths. This week, Israel said its troops launched 'ground raids' into parts of southern Lebanon, a stronghold of Iran-backed Hezbollah, following days of heavy strikes on areas across the country where the group holds sway. Israel has recently shifted its focus to securing its northern border with Lebanon, where there have been near-daily clashes since Hezbollah launched strikes in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas, after that group's October 7 attack. Several countries have launched operations to remove their nationals from Lebanon in the wake of the ground raids, including Russia, France, Spain, Germany and the U.K. 'So far, 215 Chinese citizens have been safely evacuated from Lebanon in two batches under the organization and arrangement of the Chinese government,' Beijing's foreign ministry said in a statement given to Agence France-Presse. 'The Chinese Embassy in Lebanon continues to carry out its mission in Lebanon and will continue to assist the Chinese citizens there in taking security measures,' it added. The ministry did not say where the evacuated Chinese nationals had been taken. According to Lebanese authorities, more than 1,110 people have been killed in the country since the escalation in Israeli bombardment on September 23, while more than 1 million people have been forced to flee their homes. On Wednesday, China urged world powers to prevent the conflict from 'further deteriorating' after Iran fired a barrage of missiles at Israel, which warned it would make Tehran 'pay' for the attack.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-evacuated-215-nationals-from-lebanon/7811787.html	2024-10-05T13:50:31-07:00

Floods inundate Thailand's tourist city of Chiang Mai, strand elephants	bangkok — Chiang Mai, Thailand's northern city popular with tourists, was inundated by widespread flooding Saturday as its main river overflowed its banks following heavy seasonal rainfall. Authorities ordered some evacuations and said they were working to pump water out of residential areas and clear obstructions from waterways and drains to help water recede faster. Dozens of shelters were set up across the city to accommodate residents whose homes were flooded. The Chiang Mai city government said the water level of the Ping River, which runs along the eastern edge of the city, was at critically high levels and was rising since Friday. However, the provincial irrigation office Saturday forecast that the water level was likely to remain stable and recede to normal in about five days. Elephants aid one another Thai media reported that efforts to evacuate elephants and other animals from several sanctuaries and parks on the outskirts of the city were continuing Saturday. About 125 elephants along with other animals were taken to safety from the Elephant Nature Park, from where some escaped on their own to seek higher ground. About 10 animal shelters in the area have been flooded. Video posted online by the park vividly illustrate that care and compassion are not solely human traits. The video shows several of the park’s resident elephants fleeing through rising, muddy water to ground less inundated. Three of them dash through the deluge with some ease but, according to the park, a fourth one is blind and was falling behind. It showed greater difficulty passing through wrecked fencing. Its fellows appear to call out to it, to guide it to their sides. High water hampers evacuation efforts Efforts to evacuate more animals were hampered by the high water, while more rain is forecast. Chiang Mai Governor Nirat Pongsitthavorn said that the latest flooding, the second in six weeks, exceeded expectations. Thailand's state railway suspended service to Chiang Mai, with trains on the northern line from Bangkok terminating at Lampang, about 1 1/2 hours ride to the south. Chiang Mai International Airport said Saturday it was operating as usual. Flooding was reported in 20 Thai provinces Saturday, mostly in the north. At least 49 people have died and 28 were injured in floods since August, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation said. In the Thai capital Bangkok, the government said Saturday it will let more water flow out of the Chao Phraya Dam in the central province of Chai Nat over the next seven days, as it risks exceeding it capacity. The release of the water may affect residents downstream who live near waterways in Thailand’s central region, including Bangkok and the surrounding areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/floods-inundate-thailand-s-northern-tourist-city-of-chiang-mai-/7811772.html	2024-10-05T13:02:50-07:00	
Several die trying to cross English Channel, says French minister	paris — Several people, including a child, died while trying to cross the English Channel from France to England, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said Saturday. Attempts to cross the channel in small, overloaded boats are frequent despite strong currents in what is one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. 'Smugglers have the blood of these people on their hands and our government will step up the fight against these mafias that organize these deadly crossings,' Retailleau said on social media platform X. Fourteen people were on the boat. One was flown by helicopter to a hospital after a search and rescue operation was conducted Saturday morning, local maritime authorities said. The incident was the latest in a series this year, including one last month in which 12 migrants died when their boat capsized in the channel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/several-dead-in-channel-crossing-attempt-french-minister-says-/7811764.html	2024-10-05T12:31:09-07:00	
Hacks against US campaign latest examples of Iran targeting adversaries	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran has emerged as a twofold concern for the United States as it nears the end of the presidential campaign. Prosecutors allege Tehran tried to hack figures associated with the election, stealing information from former President Donald Trump's campaign. And U.S. officials have accused it of plotting to kill Trump and other ex-officials. For Iran, assassination plots and hacking aren't new strategies. Iran saw the value and the danger of hacking in the early 2000s, when the Stuxnet virus, believed to have been deployed by Israel and the U.S., tried to damage Iran's nuclear program. Since then, hackers attributed to state-linked operations have targeted the Trump campaign, Iranian expatriates and government officials at home. Its history of assassinations goes back further. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran killed or abducted perceived enemies living abroad. A history of hacks For many, Iran's behavior can be traced to the emergence of the Stuxnet computer virus. Released in the 2000s, Stuxnet wormed its way into control units for uranium-enriching centrifuges at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, causing them to speed up, ultimately destroying themselves. Iranian scientists initially believed mechanical errors caused the damage. Ultimately though, Iran removed the affected equipment and sought its own way of striking enemies online. 'Iran had an excellent teacher in the emerging art of cyberwarfare,' noted a 2020 report from the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Saudi Arabia. That was acknowledged by the National Security Agency in a document leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2015 to The Intercept, which examined a cyberattack that destroyed hard drives at Saudi Arabia's state oil company. Iran has been suspected of carrying out that attack, called Shamoon, in 2012 and again in 2017. There also were domestic considerations. In 2009, the disputed reelection of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the Green Movement protests. Twitter, one source of news from the demonstrations, found its website defaced by the self-described 'Iranian Cyber Army.' There's been suspicion that the Revolutionary Guard, a major power base within Iran's theocracy, oversaw the 'Cyber Army' and other hackers. Meanwhile, Iran itself has been hacked repeatedly. They include the mass shutdown of gas stations across Iran, as well as surveillance cameras at Tehran's notorious Evin Prison and even state television broadcasts. Low costs, high rewards Iranian hacking attacks, given their low cost and high reward, likely will continue as Iran faces a tense international environment surrounding Israel's conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah, Iran's enrichment of uranium to near weapons-grade levels, and the prospect of Trump becoming president again. The growth of 3G and 4G mobile internet services in Iran also made it easier for the public — and potential hackers — to access the internet. Iran has more than 50 major universities with computer science or information technology programs. At least three of Iran's top schools are thought to be affiliated with Iran's Defense Ministry and the Guard, providing potential hackers for security forces. Iranian hacking attempts on U.S. targets have included banks and even a small dam near New York City — attacks American prosecutors linked to the Guard. Hacking attempts rely on phishing While Russia is seen as the biggest foreign threat to U.S. elections, officials have been concerned about Iran. Its hacking attempts in the presidential campaign have relied on phishing — sending many misleading emails in hopes that some recipients will inadvertently provide access to sensitive information. Amin Sabeti, a digital security expert who focuses on Iran, said the tactic works. 'It's scalable, it's cheap and you don't need a skill set because you just put, I don't know, five crazy people who are hard line in an office in Tehran, then send tens of thousands of emails. If they get 10 of them, it's enough,' he said. For Iran, hacks targeting the U.S. offer the prospect of causing chaos, undermining Trump's campaign and obtaining secret information. 'I've lost count of how many attempts have been made on my emails and social media since it's been going on for over a decade,' said Holly Dagres, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who once had her email briefly hacked by Iran. 'The Iranians aren't targeting me because I have useful information swimming in my inbox or direct messages. Rather, they hope to use my name and think tank affiliation to target others and eventually make it up the chain to high-ranking U.S. government officials who would have useful information and intelligence related to Iran.' Iran's killings, abductions abroad Iran has vowed to exact revenge against Trump and others in his former administration over the 2020 drone strike that killed the prominent Revolutionary Guard General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad. In July, authorities said they learned of an Iranian threat against Trump and boosted security. Iran has not been linked to the assassination attempts against Trump in Florida and Pennsylvania. A Pakistani man who spent time in Iran was recently charged by federal prosecutors for allegedly plotting to carry out assassinations in the U.S., including potentially of Trump. Officials take Iran's threat seriously given its history of targeting adversaries. Even before creating a network of allied militias in the Mideast, Iran is suspected of targeting opponents abroad, beginning with members of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's former government. The attention shifted to perceived opponents of the theocracy, both in the country with the mass executions of 1988 and abroad. Outside of Iran, the so-called 'chain murders' targeted activists, journalists and other critics. One prominent incident linked to Iran was a shooting at a restaurant in Germany that killed three Iranian-Kurdish figures and a translator. In 1997, a German court implicated Iran's top leaders in the shooting, sparking most European Union nations to withdraw their ambassadors. Iran's targeted killings slowed after that, but didn't stop. U.S. prosecutors link Iran's Revolutionary Guard to a 2011 plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hacks-against-us-campaign-latest-examples-of-iran-targeting-adversaries-/7811750.html	2024-10-05T12:16:51-07:00	
Magnitude 5.7 earthquake strikes near capital of New Zealand	wellington, new zealand — A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck near New Zealand's capital city of Wellington, government seismic monitor GeoNet said on Sunday, but initial reports indicated there were no injuries or significant damage. The quake hit at 5:08 a.m. on Sunday (1608 GMT on Saturday) striking 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) west of Wellington at a focal depth of 30 km (19 miles). GeoNet said more than 37,000 people had reported feeling the shake, some as far north as Auckland in the North Island. GeoNet said there was no tsunami warning as a result of the quake. A spokesperson for Fire and Emergency New Zealand said the service had not received any calls for assistance. Government-owned Radio New Zealand said there were no reports of significant damage or reports of injury.	https://www.voanews.com/a/magnitude-5-7-earthquake-strikes-near-capital-of-new-zealand/7811739.html	2024-10-05T11:36:01-07:00	
Iran's foreign minister renews call for Gaza, Lebanon cease-fires on Syria visit	damascus, syria — Iran 's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi renewed his call for cease-fires in both Gaza and Lebanon on Saturday as he held talks with his country's Syrian allies. 'The most important issue today is the cease-fire, especially in Lebanon and in Gaza,' he told reporters. 'There are initiatives in this regard, there have been consultations that we hope will be successful.' Araghchi's visit to Damascus, his first since he took office in August, comes almost a year after the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel, triggering war in Gaza. The conflict has also drawn in Iran's Lebanese ally, Hezbollah and on September 23 Israel sharply intensified its campaign against the militant group. 'The purpose of my trip to Damascus is to continue consultations regarding the developments in the region,' Araghchi said. His meetings in the Syrian capital followed a visit to Beirut Friday during which he voiced support for a truce in Lebanon acceptable to Hezbollah 'simultaneously with a cease-fire in Gaza.' Araghchi traveled to Damascus by air after Lebanon said an Israeli airstrike Friday severed the main international highway linking the two countries. Israel said its strike was aimed at preventing the flow of weapons to Hezbollah from neighboring Syria. Iran has been a staunch ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad throughout the civil war that erupted in 2011 following the suppression of antigovernment protests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-foreign-minister-renews-call-for-gaza-lebanon-cease-fires-on-syria-visit-/7811721.html	2024-10-05T10:51:40-07:00	
Lebanon displacement crisis deepens amid surging airstrikes	geneva — The United Nations warns Lebanon’s displacement crisis is deepening as aid agencies scramble to protect and assist tens of thousands of people fleeing for safety. The warning was made amid a surge in airstrikes as Israel’s 'limited, localized and targeted' operation against Hezbollah militants intensifies in scale and scope. 'As the humanitarian situation deteriorates, UNHCR is reinforcing supplies of core relief items to meet increasing needs and prepare for further escalation, said Rula Amin, the U.N. refugee agency’s senior communications advisor for the Middle East and North Africa. Speaking from the Jordanian capital, Amman, she told journalists in Geneva Friday that 'the volatile security situation and ongoing Israeli airstrikes are delaying relief supplies,' noting that an airlift carrying life-saving medical trauma kits and a shipment of over 20,000 thermal blankets was delayed. The Lebanese government estimates a million people have become displaced inside the country since Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, and war broke out in Gaza. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 400,000 people have become displaced in the last two weeks. Of those, more than 165,000 are living in 800 collective shelters across the country. 'These are schools that the government has urgently opened,' Mathieu Luciano, the IOM’s head of office in Lebanon said. Speaking on a video link from Beirut, he said, 'The situation is really deteriorating rapidly. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes in the past two weeks. The roads are jammed with traffic. People are sleeping in public parks, on the street and the beach.' He said the numbers of displaced 'continue to rise as heavy shelling continues in the South, in the Beqaa, in Beirut and other regions in the country. In addition to internal displacement, tens of thousands of Lebanese, but also Syrians, are leaving the country,' both through legal and irregular means.' The Syrian Arab Red Crescent says more than 185,000 people have fled to Syria. That number has markedly decreased since an Israeli airstrike Friday cut off vehicle access at the key Masnaa border crossing. 'A huge crater was created in the no man’s land between the Syrian and the Lebanese side, so it is very hard for vehicles, for people to go through this crossing,' the UNHCRs Amin said, adding that some people, 'determined to flee crossed on foot.' Israel said it targeted the border crossing with Syria to stop Hezbollah 'from smuggling weapons into Lebanon.' Despite the complexities, Amin said that Syrian authorities are keeping the border open as people continue to flee from Lebanon to Syria through Masnaa and three other border points. She observed that Syrian refugees are faced with the difficult decision of returning to the country they fled throughout the past 13 years or staying in Lebanon. 'Due to the bombings, lack of adequate shelters, lack of access to services,' she said, the Syrian refugees have to choose whether 'to stay in Lebanon with the growing risk on their life, or to go back and cross the border to Syria with all the other risks in mind.' 'It seems from the numbers of people we have been seeing is that at this point they felt that the risks from the bombings is high' and they are going back, said Amin. 'Some 60% of new arrivals are children and adolescents. Some of the children have arrived on their own, without family members,' she said. 'As they flee the bombings, families arrive with profound emotional fatigue, some requiring urgent medical care. The majority of new arrivals head to their towns and villages of origin to join relatives.' In its daily update on the humanitarian crisis in Lebanon, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, says over the past two weeks, 'conflict related deaths have increased by more than 200% to 1,699, with more than 9,781 injuries. At the same time, UNICEF says that more than 690 children have been injured in Lebanon 'as the conflict has dramatically escalated in recent weeks.' Aid agencies are scaling up their humanitarian operations to provide shelter for the homeless, food for the hungry and medical care for the sick and injured. The UNHCR and SARC are supporting authorities in transporting thousands of the most vulnerable from the borders to their final destinations. 'But the suffering of those who cross does not end at the border,' Amin stressed. 'After 13 years of crisis, many are going back to destroyed homes, damaged infrastructure and crippled basic services. They have arrived with no resources for their basic needs. 'Inside Syria, there are still more than 7.2 million people displaced internally and the country is going through a deep economic crisis.' IOM official Luciano said his agency has scaled up immediate lifesaving assistance, providing essential relief items as well as protection services and health support to the IDPs. He highlighted the plight of Lebanon’s 180,000 immigrant workers, many of whom are female domestic workers, coming from Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Sudan, Bangladesh and the Philippines. 'They have been deeply affected by violence in the country,' he said. 'We are receiving increasing reports of migrant domestic workers being abandoned by their Lebanese employer, either left on the streets or in the homes,' he said. 'We have received increased requests from migrants seeking assistance to return home, and from several member states to help evacuate their citizens from Lebanon.' 'This will require significant funding, which we currently do not have,' he said, noting that the IOM is appealing for $32.46 million to assist 400,000 people affected by the crisis over the next three months. That is apart from the U.N.’s inter-agency flash appeal for nearly $426 million to deliver lifesaving assistance to more than 1 million people directly affected and/or displaced by the crisis in Lebanon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-displacement-crisis-deepens-amid-surging-airstrikes-/7811696.html	2024-10-05T10:22:10-07:00	
Ukraine shoots down Russian bomber in Donetsk	kyiv, ukraine — Ukrainian forces said they shot down a Russian fighter plane Saturday while Russia claimed it made gains in Ukraine’s east. The Russian bomber was shot down near the city of Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk province, head of the Kostiantynivka Military Administration Serhiy Horbunov was quoted as saying by Ukraine’s public broadcaster, Suspilne. Photos showed charred remains of an aircraft after it landed on a house that caught fire. Also in the partially occupied Donetsk province, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed Saturday that it had taken control of the village of Zhelanne Druhe. If confirmed, the capture would come three days after Ukrainian forces said they were withdrawing from the front-line town of Vuhledar, some 33 kilometers (21 miles) from Zhelanne Druhe, following a hard-fought two-year defense. Although unlikely to change the course of the war, the loss of Vuhledar is indicative of Kyiv’s worsening position, in part the result of Washington's refusal to grant Ukraine permission to strike targets deep inside Russian territory and preventing Kyiv from degrading Moscow’s capabilities. Zelenskyy to present victory plan to allies Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that he will present his 'victory plan' at the Oct. 12 meeting of the Ramstein group of nations that supplies arms to Ukraine. 'We will present the victory plan — clear, concrete steps towards a just end to the war. The determination of our partners and the strengthening of Ukraine are what can stop Russian aggression,' he wrote on X, adding that the 25th Ramstein meeting would be the first to take place at the leaders’ level. Zelenskyy presented his plan to U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington last week. Its contents have not been made public but it is known that the plan includes Ukraine’s membership in NATO and the provision of long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Russia shells southern Ukraine Meanwhile, two people died in Russian shelling in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region, regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Ukraine’s air force said Russia had launched three guided missiles and 13 attack drones at Ukraine overnight into Saturday. It said the missiles were intercepted, three drones were shot down over the Odesa region and 10 others were lost. Nine people were wounded when a Ukrainian drone struck a passenger bus in the city of Horlivka in the partially occupied Donetsk region, the city’s Russian-installed Mayor Ivan Prikhodko said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that air defenses shot down 10 Ukrainian drones overnight in three border regions, including seven over the Belgorod region, two over the Kursk region, and one over the Voronezh region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-shoots-down-russian-bomber-in-donetsk/7811679.html	2024-10-05T09:49:25-07:00	
Huge crowd at South Korea fireworks amid safety concern after deadly 2022 crush	seoul, south korea — A large fireworks festival in South Korea drew a massive crowd Saturday, snarling traffic through its busy capital, prompting police to deploy 2,400 officers and sending hotel room rates above $7,400. The popular annual event has taken on a serious public safety dimension as memory is still fresh of a Halloween night disaster two years ago that killed 159 mostly young people in a crush of crowd packed in a dense entertainment district. Many of the more than 1 million spectators who were expected to watch the 90-minute show were camping out since midnight to secure a spot with a view of the event scheduled to start at 7:20 p.m. (1020 GMT) over the Han River that runs through Seoul. Oh Soo-taek, 64, who said he has been coming to the festival with his wife for three years, found the place already crowded when they got there at 2 p.m. but said it was exciting to be part of an event bringing so many families and friends together. 'We had that big accident two years ago so it's so good to see the organizers and the police and everyone helping each other and keeping order.' Many restaurants, bars and hotel rooms on Yeouido island on the river and on its banks with a view of the fireworks by teams from Japan, South Korea and the United States had been booked days ahead. High-floor suites at one luxury hotel on Yeouido were sold out Saturday at nearly double the normal rate, despite the less than perfect view of the fireworks they offered, a reservation official said. The event is hosted by the Hanwha conglomerate, which has grown from a dynamite maker to a global defense contractor. Its team participates in a fireworks performance as part of the festival. Authorities took no chances on security, as spectators poured into an area the size of several city blocks on and near Yeouido, the country's main financial center and a dense commercial and residential district. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo directed police, emergency services and the safety and health ministries to be on full alert with a focus on crowd control and also asked for spectator cooperation to ensure order. The precaution comes as the country still grapples with the 2022 Halloween disaster in Seoul's Itaewon nightlife district blamed on failed crowd control. On Monday, the police chief of that district was convicted of negligence and sentenced to three years in prison in the first such verdict against a senior public official over the disaster.	https://www.voanews.com/a/huge-crowd-at-south-korea-fireworks-amid-safety-concern-after-deadly-2022-crush-/7811593.html	2024-10-05T07:55:24-07:00	
Supreme Court opens new term with election disputes looming	washington — Transgender rights, the regulation of 'ghost guns' and the death penalty highlight the Supreme Court's election-season term that begins Monday, with the prospect of the court's intervention in voting disputes lurking in the background. The justices are returning to the bench at a time of waning public confidence in the court and calls to limit their terms to 18 years that have wide support, including the backing of Democratic President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the party's White House nominee. Whether by design or happenstance, the justices are hearing fewer high-profile cases than they did in recent terms that included far-reaching decisions by the 6-3 conservative majority on presidential immunity, abortion, guns and affirmative action. The lighter schedule would allow them to easily add election cases, if those make their way to the high court in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election between Republican Donald Trump and Harris, or its immediate aftermath. 'I think there are legal issues that arise out of the political process. And so, the Supreme Court has to be prepared to respond if that should be necessary,' Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson told CBS News last month in an interview to her promote new memoir Lovely One. The court's involvement in election disputes might depend on the closeness of the outcome and whether the justices' intervention would tip the outcome, David Cole, the outgoing legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said at a recent Washington event. 'I don’t think the court wants to get involved, but it may have to,' Cole said. The court turned away multiple challenges from Trump and his allies to the results of the 2020 election that he lost to Biden. It's been nearly a quarter-century since the Supreme Court effectively decided the 2000 presidential election, in which Republican George W. Bush edged Democrat Al Gore. When the justices gather Monday morning on a date set by federal law, they will shake hands with each other as they always do. Just after 10 o'clock, they will emerge from behind freshly cleaned heavy red drapery and take their seats on the curved mahogany bench, Chief Justice John Roberts in the center chair and his eight colleagues seated in order of seniority. There are likely to be smiles and shared private jokes. But the friendliness of that moment will not sweep away tensions that have barely been concealed. During the summer, two justices, Elena Kagan and Jackson, voiced support for toughening the new ethics code that so far lacks a means of enforcement. The leak to The New York Times of the contents of a memo Roberts wrote last winter that outlined his approach to the court's presidential immunity decision 'was nothing short of shocking,' Supreme Court lawyer Lisa Blatt said last week at a Washington preview of the coming term. Two years ago, Politico obtained the draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion case. 'Something does feel broken,' Blatt said. Describing her experience arguing before the court, she said, some justices 'just seem visibly frustrated.' Important cases dot the court's calendar, beginning Tuesday. The court will take up a challenge to a Biden administration attempt to regulate hard-to-trace 'ghost guns' that had been turning up at crime scenes in increasing numbers. The Supreme Court jumped into the case after the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated the regulation. Last term, conservatives voted 6-3 to strike down a gun regulation that had banned bump stocks, an accessory that allows some weapons to fire at a rate comparable to machine guns. Bump stocks were used in the nation’s deadliest modern mass shooting in Las Vegas. A day after the guns case, the justices will take up the latest twist in Oklahoma death row inmate Richard Glossip's long quest for freedom. His case is the rare instance in which prosecutors are conceding mistakes in the trial that led to Glossip’s conviction and death sentence. The highest-profile case on the agenda so far is a fight over transgender rights that is focused on state bans on gender-affirming care. It probably will be argued in December. Republican-led states have enacted a variety of restrictions on health care for transgender people, school sports participation, bathroom usage and drag shows. The administration and Democratic-led states have extended protections for transgender people. The Supreme Court has separately prohibited the administration from enforcing a new federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students. The case before the high court involves a law in Tennessee that restricts puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors. About half the states have enacted similar restrictions. Also on tap for the late fall is an appeal from the adult entertainment industry to overturn a Texas law that requires pornographic websites to verify the age of their users. Only about half the court’s calendar for the term has been filled, and several big cases could be added. Among those is a push by Republican-led states and conservative legal outlets to further restrict federal agencies. The immediate target is the method the Federal Communications Commission has used to fund telephone service for rural and low-income people and broadband services for schools and libraries. The case, which the administration has appealed to the Supreme Court, could give the justices the opportunity to revive a legal doctrine known as nondelegation that has not been used to strike down legislation in nearly 90 years. Several conservative justices have expressed support for the idea of limiting the authority Congress can delegate to federal agencies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supreme-court-opens-new-term-with-election-disputes-looming-/7811578.html	2024-10-05T07:29:05-07:00	
Christmas season starts in Venezuela, weeks before Halloween	caracas, venezuela — It doesn't feel like Christmas in Venezuela. At least not yet. Even if the president wants it to be. Residents of the capital Caracas woke up Tuesday to a towering Christmas tree standing in a popular public square, weeks after President Nicolas Maduro declared the jolly season would start earlier this year in the South American country. Workers rushed to set up decorations in neighborhoods, but the mood was far from festive. 'I think it's terrible because it's October,' said Desire Aguiar, 32, before setting up her jewelry and accessories booth in a local market. 'Halloween hasn't even passed, and it's already Christmas? Are we celebrating them together?' Venezuelans, particularly those who remember life at the turn of the century, have long associated Christmas with careless shopping and bulging wallets thanks to profit-sharing and holiday bonuses employers paid at the end of the year. Employees often received three times their monthly salary all at once. The smell of fresh paint even signaled the arrival of Christmas because so many put a new coat on their walls. These days, however, meager wages and bonuses resulting from the country's economic collapse have turned the season into a time of have and have-nots. And this year, the season arrived amid a collective pessimism that followed the July 28 election. 'If they start paying ... the Christmas bonus in advance, we won't have anything left in December,' Aguiar lamented. 'I think it's a really bad idea.' Few dare speak out It remains unclear whether public and private employers will make changes to bonus payments this year. Maduro, whom electoral authorities handed a third six-year term, surprised the country on September 2 when he declared on state television that the Christmas season would start earlier than ever. Mockery followed Maduro's decree across social media, but on the streets, few dared to say anything about the decision — another sign of the chilling effect resulting from the repression campaign unleashed by the government after the highly anticipated election. Thousands of people, including minors, took to the streets across Venezuela hours after ruling party-loyal electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner without showing any vote tallies. The protests were largely peaceful, but demonstrators also toppled statues of Maduro's predecessor, the late leader Hugo Chavez, threw rocks at law enforcement officers and buildings, and burned police motorcycles and government propaganda. Maduro and his ruling party allies, who control all aspects of government, responded to the demonstrations with full force. Security forces detained more than 2,000 people, including minors, and more than 20 protesters were killed. Maduro also called on Venezuelans to denounce election doubters via a government-run app originally created to report power outages and complaints about state-provided services. This prompted people to delete photos, videos, memes, messages and apps from their phones to avoid prosecution. 'Christmas is in December' On Tuesday, while some rejected Maduro's decree for economic or political reasons, others rejected it for puritanical reasons. 'Christmas is in December. We must be clear about that, we celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ,' Wilfredo Gutierrez, 61, said while observing a group of workers setting up decorative lights along a main avenue in Caracas. 'The one good thing is that they picked up the trash. Normally, this place is dirty.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/christmas-season-starts-in-venezuela-weeks-before-halloween/7811334.html	2024-10-05T05:04:50-07:00

China: EU plan to press ahead with Chinese EV tariffs bad for ties	beijing — The European Commission's decision to press ahead with tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles threatens to undermine decades of cooperation between China and the EU, and endangers climate-change goals, Xinhua news agency said on Saturday. On Friday, the EU said it would push forward with hefty tariffs on China-made EVs, even after the bloc's largest economy Germany rejected them. The dispute is its biggest trade row with Beijing in a decade. State-run Xinhua said the move revealed a 'deep-seated protectionist impulse.' 'Instead of fostering co-operation, these tariffs risk sparking a trade conflict that could harm not only China-EU relations but also Europe's own ambition for a green transition,' it said. 'The path forward is clear: Protectionist tariffs must be abandoned in favor of continued negotiations.' European imports of Chinese-made EVs have soared in recent years, raising concerns among some domestic EV producers that they could suffer significant losses from a wave of cheap Chinese electric vehicles. The proposed duties on EVs built in China of up to 45% would cost carmakers billions of extra dollars to bring cars into the bloc and are set to be imposed from next month for five years. The Commission, which oversees the bloc's trade policy, has said the tariffs would counter what it sees as unfair Chinese subsidies after a yearlong anti-subsidy investigation. It said on Friday, however, that it would continue talks with Beijing. A possible compromise could be to set minimum sales prices. China's Commerce Ministry has expressed strong opposition to the planned tariffs, calling them 'unfair, non-compliant and unreasonable.' It has launched a challenge to them at the World Trade Organization. In what has been seen as retaliatory moves, Beijing this year launched probes into imports of EU brandy, dairy and pork products. The U.S. imposes a 100% duty on imported Chinese EVs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-eu-plan-to-press-ahead-with-chinese-ev-tariffs-bad-for-ties/7811444.html	2024-10-05T02:49:52-07:00

Militant ambush kills 6 Pakistan soldiers near Afghan border	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan said Saturday that insurgents ambushed a military convoy overnight in a volatile district bordering Afghanistan, resulting in the deaths of at least six soldiers, including an officer. The ambush occurred in North Waziristan, a former stronghold of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, a globally designated terrorist organization. A brief military statement said that six assailants were killed in the ensuing exchange of fire. It identified the slain militants as 'Khwarij,' an official reference to TTP. Multiple area security sources confirmed to VOA that the gunfire had also injured at least 22 Pakistani soldiers. The Waziristan district is in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which has experienced a dramatic surge in TTP bombings and gun raids since the Taliban regained power in Kabul three years ago. Separately, the military reported that an intelligence-driven security operation in the province’s Swat district late on Saturday killed two TTP militant commanders and captured another. Pakistan says TTP, also referred to as the Pakistani Taliban, is based in Afghanistan and stages cross-border attacks with the help of that country’s Taliban government. Islamabad alleges that insurgents active in its southwestern Balochistan border province are increasingly using Afghan sanctuaries to orchestrate deadly attacks against the country. A report this week by the Center for Research and Security Studies documented nearly 1,000 deaths of Pakistani civilians and security forces in the first nine months of this year. The Islamabad-based think tank reported that attacks by TTP and Baloch insurgents caused most of casualties in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. The Taliban government, which is officially not recognized by any country, denies Pakistani allegations and insists that neither TTP nor other foreign militant groups are on Afghan soil. However, recent United Nations Security Council assessments have disputed the Taliban’s assertions and described TTP as 'the largest terrorist group' in Afghanistan. Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi again questioned U.N. security assessments Friday, claiming their government restored 'security and stability nationwide.' He emphasized, while addressing a Russian-hosted regional conference, that they are in control of the entire Afghan territory and that no one can use it to threaten regional security. 'Occasionally, representatives of some countries in the U.N. Security Council and the media express their concern about the existence of threats on Afghan soil,' Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said. 'We believe that the information gap about Afghanistan or disinformation by antagonist circles has found its way to international organizations,' he said, without elaborating.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militant-ambush-kills-6-pakistan-soldiers-near-afghan-border/7811433.html	2024-10-05T02:27:12-07:00	
Israeli strike hits north Lebanon as raids pummel Beirut suburbs	BEIRUT/JERUSALEM — An Israeli strike hit Lebanon's northern city of Tripoli for the first time early on Saturday, a Lebanese security source said, after more bombardment hit Beirut's suburbs and Israeli troops sought to make new ground incursions into southern Lebanon. The source told Reuters a Hamas official, his wife and two children were killed in the strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Tripoli. Hamas-affiliated media said the strike killed a leader of the group's armed wing. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike on Tripoli, a Sunni-majority port city. Israel has sharply expanded its strikes on Lebanon in recent weeks after nearly a year of exchanging fire with Lebanon's Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. Fighting had been mostly limited to the Israel-Lebanon border area, taking place in parallel to Israel's year-old war in Gaza against Hamas. Israel has been carrying out nightly bombardment of Beirut's once densely populated southern suburbs, a stronghold of Hezbollah. Overnight, a military spokesman issued three alerts for residents there to evacuate, and Reuters witnesses then heard at least one blast. On Friday, Israel said it had targeted Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in the southern suburbs and was assessing the damage after a series of strikes on senior figures in the group. Israel has eliminated much of Hezbollah's senior military leadership, including Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in an air attack on September 27. Lebanon's government says more than 2,000 people have been killed there in the past year, most in the past two weeks. Strikes on medical teams and facilities, including the Lebanese Red Cross, Lebanese public hospitals and rescue workers affiliated to Hezbollah, have also increased. Lebanon's government says more than 1.2 million Lebanese have been forced from their homes, and the United Nations says most displacement shelters in the country are full. Many had gone north to Tripoli or to neighboring Syria, but an Israeli strike on Friday closed the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric called the toll on Lebanese civilians 'totally unacceptable.' Iran defiant, Israel weighs options Israel has been weighing options in its response to Iran's ballistic missile attack on Tuesday. Oil prices have risen on the possibility of an attack on Iran's oil facilities as Israel pursues its goals of pushing back Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and eliminating their Hamas allies, also backed by Tehran, in Gaza. U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday urged Israel to consider alternatives to striking Iranian oil fields, adding that he thinks Israel has not yet concluded how to respond to Iran. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a rare appearance leading Friday prayers, told a huge crowd in Tehran that Iran and its regional allies would not back down. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi landed in Syria on Saturday for talks after a visit to Lebanon, in which he reiterated support for Lebanon and Hezbollah. In Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut's southern suburbs, many buildings have been reduced to rubble. 'We're alive but don't know for how long,' said Nouhad Chaib, a 40-year-old man already displaced from the south. On Friday, Hezbollah fired more than 200 rockets into Israel, according to the Israeli military, and air raid sirens continued to sound in its north on Saturday. The latest bloodletting in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered by the Palestinian Hamas group's attack on October 7, 2023, that killed 1,200 and in which about 250 were taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry, and displaced nearly all of Gaza's population. Ground operations The Lebanese government has accused Israel of targeting civilians, pointing to dozens of women and children killed. It has not broken its total death toll down between civilians and Hezbollah fighters. Israel says it targets military capabilities and takes steps to mitigate the risk of harm to civilians. It accuses Hezbollah and Hamas of hiding among civilians, which they deny. Israel, which began ground operations targeting southern Lebanon this week, says they are focused on villages near the border and has said Beirut 'was not on the table,' but has not specified how long the ground incursion would last. It says the operations aim to allow tens of thousands of its citizens to return home after Hezbollah bombardments, which began on October 8, 2023, forced them to evacuate from its north. Iran's missile salvo was partly in retaliation for Israel's killing of Nasrallah, a dominant figure who had turned the group into a powerful armed and political force with reach across the Middle East. Axios cited three Israeli officials as saying that Hashem Safieddine, rumored to be Nasrallah's successor, had been targeted in an underground bunker in Beirut on Thursday night, but his fate was not clear. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz posted a photo of Safieddine and Nasrallah on X on Saturday and urged Khamenei to 'take your proxies and leave Lebanon.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strike-hits-north-lebanon-as-raids-pummel-beirut-suburbs/7811405.html	2024-10-05T00:43:42-07:00

Are we celebrating them together?' Venezuelans, particularly those who remember life at the turn of the century, have long associated Christmas with careless shopping and bulging wallets thanks to profit-sharing and holiday bonuses employers paid at the end of the year. Employees often received three times their monthly salary all at once. The smell of fresh paint even signaled the arrival of Christmas because so many put a new coat on their walls. These days, however, meager wages and bonuses resulting from the country's economic collapse have turned the season into a time of have and have-nots. And this year, the season arrived amid a collective pessimism that followed the July 28 election. 'If they start paying ... the Christmas bonus in advance, we won't have anything left in December,' Aguiar lamented. 'I think it's a really bad idea.' Few dare speak out It remains unclear whether public and private employers will make changes to bonus payments this year. Maduro, whom electoral authorities handed a third six-year term, surprised the country on September 2 when he declared on state television that the Christmas season would start earlier than ever. Mockery followed Maduro's decree across social media, but on the streets, few dared to say anything about the decision — another sign of the chilling effect resulting from the repression campaign unleashed by the government after the highly anticipated election. Thousands of people, including minors, took to the streets across Venezuela hours after ruling party-loyal electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner without showing any vote tallies. The protests were largely peaceful, but demonstrators also toppled statues of Maduro's predecessor, the late leader Hugo Chavez, threw rocks at law enforcement officers and buildings, and burned police motorcycles and government propaganda. Maduro and his ruling party allies, who control all aspects of government, responded to the demonstrations with full force. Security forces detained more than 2,000 people, including minors, and more than 20 protesters were killed. Maduro also called on Venezuelans to denounce election doubters via a government-run app originally created to report power outages and complaints about state-provided services. This prompted people to delete photos, videos, memes, messages and apps from their phones to avoid prosecution. 'Christmas is in December' On Tuesday, while some rejected Maduro's decree for economic or political reasons, others rejected it for puritanical reasons. 'Christmas is in December. We must be clear about that, we celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ,' Wilfredo Gutierrez, 61, said while observing a group of workers setting up decorative lights along a main avenue in Caracas. 'The one good thing is that they picked up the trash. Normally, this place is dirty.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd---christmas-season-starts-in-venezuela-weeks-before-halloween/7811334.html	2024-10-04T23:53:31-07:00	
Sex workers find themselves at center of Congo's mpox outbreak	KAMITUGA, Congo — It's been four months since Sifa Kunguja recovered from mpox, but as a sex worker, she said, she's still struggling to regain clients, with fear and stigma driving away people who've heard she had the virus. 'It's risky work,' Kunguja, 40, said from her small home in eastern Congo. 'But if I don't work, I won't have money for my children.' Sex workers are among those hardest-hit by the mpox outbreak in Kamituga, where some 40,000 of them are estimated to reside — many single mothers driven by poverty to this mineral-rich commercial hub where gold miners comprise the majority of the clientele. Doctors estimate 80% of cases here have been contracted sexually, though the virus also spreads through other kinds of skin-to-skin contact. Sex workers say the situation threatens their health and livelihoods. Health officials warn that more must be done to stem the spread — with a focus on sex workers — or mpox will creep deeper through eastern Congo and the region. Mpox causes mostly mild symptoms such as fever and body aches, but serious cases can mean prominent, painful blisters on the face, hands, chest and genitals. Kunguja and other sex workers insist that despite risks of reinfection or spreading the virus, they have no choice but to keep working. Sex work isn't illegal in Congo, though related activities such as solicitation are. Rights groups say possible legal consequences and fear of retribution — sex workers are subject to high rates of violence including rape and abuse — prevent women from seeking medical care. That can be especially detrimental during a public health emergency, according to experts. Health officials in Kamituga are advocating for the government to shutter nightclubs and mines and compensate sex workers for lost business. Not everyone agrees. Local officials say they don't have resources to do more than care for those who are sick, and insist it's sex workers' responsibility to protect themselves. Kamituga Mayor Alexandre Bundya M'pila told The Associated Press that the government is creating awareness campaigns but lacks money to reach everyone. He also said sex workers should look for other jobs, without providing examples of what might be available. Sex work a big part of economy Miners stream into Kamituga by the tens of thousands. The economy is centered on the mines: Buyers line streets, traders travel to sell gold, small businesses and individuals provide food and lodging, and the sex industry flourishes. Nearly a dozen sex workers spoke to AP. They said well over half their clients are miners. The industry is well organized, according to the Kenyan-based African Sex Workers Alliance, composed of sex worker-led groups. The alliance estimates that 13% of Kamituga's 300,000 residents are sex workers. The town has 18 sex-worker committees, the alliance said, with a leadership that tries to work with government officials, protect and support colleagues, and advocate for their rights. But sex work in Congo is dangerous. Women face systematic violence that's tolerated by society, according to a report by UMANDE, a local sex-worker rights group. Many women are forced into the industry because of poverty or because, like Kunguja, they're single parents and must support their families. Getting mpox can put sex workers out of business The sex workers who spoke to AP described mpox as an added burden. Many are terrified of getting the virus — it means time away from work, lost income and perhaps losing business altogether. Those who recover are stigmatized, they said. Kamituga is a small place, where most everyone knows one another. Neighbors whisper and tell clients when someone is sick — people talk and point. Since contracting mpox in May, Kunguja said she's gone from about 20 clients daily to five. She's been supporting her 11 children through sex work for nearly a decade but said she now can't afford to send them to school. To compensate, she's selling alcohol by day, but it's not enough. Experts say information and awareness are key Disease experts say a lack of vaccines and information makes stemming the spread difficult. Some 250,000 vaccines have arrived in Congo, but it's unclear when any will get to Kamituga. Sex workers and miners are among those slated to receive them first. Community leaders and aid groups are trying to teach sex workers about protecting themselves and their clients via awareness sessions where they discuss signs and symptoms. They also press condom use, which they say isn't widespread enough in the industry. Sex workers told AP that they insist on using condoms when they have them, but that they simply don't have enough. Kamituga's general hospital gives them boxes of about 140 condoms every few months. Some sex workers see up to 60 clients a day — for less than $1 a person. Condoms run out, and workers say they can't afford more. Dr. Guy Mukari, an epidemiologist working with the National Institute of Biomedical Research in Congo, noted that the variant running rampant in Kamituga seems more susceptible to transmission via sex, making for a double whammy with the sex industry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sex-workers-find-themselves-at-center-of-congo-s-mpox-outbreak/7811318.html	2024-10-04T23:52:58-07:00	
Portugal looks to put new twist on cork industry	Mozelos, Portugal — Portugal, the world's leading cork producer, is finding new uses for the material, from footwear to furniture, as demand for wine bottle stoppers wanes. Producers highlight the environmentally friendly properties of cork, which is lightweight, recyclable, waterproof and fire-resistant, to encourage its use in diverse settings. Cork is obtained by stripping the bark of cork oak trees every nine years in a careful process that allows the tree to regenerate and grow, making the industry naturally sustainable. The material has 'a negative carbon footprint because it comes from a tree that captures CO2 day and night', Antonio Rios de Amorim, the CEO of the world's largest cork producer Corticeira Amorim, told AFP. The push to diversify comes as global sales of wine decline, reducing demand for cork wine stoppers which have long faced competition from cheaper plastic stoppers and screw tops. 'Periods of slowdown must be used to question what we do,' said Amorim, whose ancestors founded Corticeira Amorim 154 years ago in the northern village of Mozelos, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) south of second city Porto. Booster rockets, metro seats Thanks to cork's cell-like structure, the material is elastic and highly impermeable, making it suitable to make shoes as well as ties, pants and other clothes. Furniture designers are also increasingly drawn to the material. British designer Tom Dixon has called it a 'dream material' and put out a range of dark cork furniture that includes tables, stools and shelves using cork from Portugal. The Lisbon metro in 2020 replaced the fabric lining on all seats of its train fleet with cork, an easier to maintain material. Builders have been drawn to the material because of its unique thermal insulation and sound absorption properties. Cork is also finding its way into space. It is used in thermal protection coating on booster rockets because of its resistance 'to strong variations in temperature', said Amorim. Making wine bottle stoppers, however, remains the main activity for Portugal's cork industry, which employs around 8,000 people. Corticeira Amorim makes some six billion cork wine bottle stoppers per year, almost all of them for export mainly to Chile, France and the United States. It accounts for 70 percent of the global market share for cork stoppers and posted sales of 985 million euros (one billion dollars) in 2023, slightly lower than in the previous year. Traditional methods Cork is made from the bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber) found in countries of the Mediterranean basin. Portugal is home to about a third of the world's total area dedicated to this tree — more than any other country — and accounts for nearly half the world's supply of cork. There are also plantations in France, Spain, Italy. Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. In the province of Ribatejo around 80 kilometers east of Lisbon, cork oaks stretch as far as the eye can see. The bark is removed from the tree in summer using traditional methods handed down from generation to generation. It is a highly precise technique 'that takes several years to learn', said Nelson Ferreira, a 43-year-old cork bark harvester, adding he takes great care not to damage the tree. The bark is then taken to Corticeira Amorim's factories in the north of Portugal where it is steam-treated, cut into smaller pieces and then fed into machines that punch out stoppers. The preservation of cork oaks is crucial for Portugal, which has made them a protected species since it takes an average of 40 years for a tree to start producing cork that can be used by cork makers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/portugal-looks-to-put-new-twist-on-cork-industry-/7810370.html	2024-10-04T23:52:21-07:00	
South Korea adoptees endure emotional searches for their birth families	SEOUL, South Korea — They began a pilgrimage that thousands before them have done. They boarded long flights to their motherland, South Korea, to undertake an emotional, often frustrating, sometimes devastating search for their birth families. These adoptees are among the 200,000 sent from South Korea to Western nations as children. Many have grown up, searched for their origin story and discovered that their adoption paperwork was inaccurate or fabricated. They have only breadcrumbs to go on: grainy baby photos, names of orphanages and adoption agencies, the towns where they were said to have been abandoned. They don't speak the language. They're unfamiliar with the culture. Some never learn their truth. 'I want my mother to know I'm OK and that her sacrifice was not in vain,' says Kenneth Barthel, adopted in 1979 at 6 years old to Hawaii. He hung flyers all over Busan, where his mother abandoned him at a restaurant. She ordered him soup, went to the bathroom and never returned. Police found him wandering the streets and took him to an orphanage. He didn't think much about finding his birth family until he had his own son, imagined himself as a boy and yearned to understand where he came from. He has visited South Korea four times, without any luck. He says he'll keep coming back, and tears rolled down his cheeks. Some who make this trip learn things about themselves they'd thought were lost forever. In a small office at the Stars of the Sea orphanage in Incheon, South Korea, Maja Andersen sat holding Sister Christina Ahn's hands. Her eyes grew moist as the sister translated the few details available about her early life at the orphanage. She had loved being hugged, the orphanage documents said, and had sparkling eyes. 'Thank you so much, thank you so much,' Andersen repeated in a trembling voice. There was comfort in that — she had been hugged, she had smiled. She'd come here searching for her family. 'I just want to tell them I had a good life and I'm doing well,' Andersen said to Sister Ahn. Andersen had been admitted to the facility as a malnourished baby and was adopted at 7 months old to a family in Denmark, according to the documents. She says she's grateful for the love her adoptive family gave her, but has developed an unshakable need to know where she came from. She visited this orphanage, city hall and a police station, but found no new clues about her birth family. Still she remains hopeful, and plans to return to South Korea to keep trying. She posted a flyer on the wall of a police station not far from the orphanage, just above another left by an adoptee also searching for his roots. Korean adoptees have organized, and now they help those coming along behind them. Nonprofit groups conduct DNA testing. Sympathetic residents, police officers and city workers of the towns where they once lived often try to assist them. Sometimes adoption agencies are able to track down birth families. Nearly four decades after her adoption to the U.S., Nicole Motta in May sat across the table from a 70-year-old man her adoption agency had identified as her birth father. She typed 'thanks for meeting me today' into a translation program on her phone to show him. A social worker placed hair samples into plastic bags for DNA testing. But the moment they hugged, Motta, adopted to the United States in 1985, didn't need the results — she knew she'd come from this man. 'I am a sinner for not finding you,' he said. Motta's adoption documents say her father was away for work for long stretches and his wife struggled to raise three children alone. He told her she was gone when he came back from one trip, and claimed his brother gave her away. He hasn't spoken to the brother since, he said, and never knew she was adopted abroad. Motta's adoption file leaves it unclear whether the brother had a role in her adoption. It says she was under the care of unspecified neighbors before being sent to an orphanage that referred her to an adoption agency, which sent her abroad in 1985. She studied his face. She wondered if she looks like her siblings or her mother, who has since died. 'I think I have your nose,' Motta said softly. They both sobbed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-adoptees-endure-emotional-searches-for-their-birth-families/7810108.html	2024-10-04T23:51:42-07:00	
Through music and dance, Sudanese performers transport refugee audiences home	cairo — As the performers took the stage and the traditional drum beat gained momentum, Sudanese refugees sitting in the audience were moved to tears. Hadia Moussa said the melody reminded her of the country's Nuba Mountains, her family's ancestral home. 'Performances like this help people mentally affected by the war. It reminds us of the Sudanese folklore and our culture,' she said. Sudan has been engulfed by violence since April 2023, when war between the Sudanese military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces broke out across the country. The conflict has turned the capital, Khartoum, into an urban battlefield and displaced 4.6 million people, according to the United Nations migration agency, including more than 419,000 people who fled to Egypt. A band with 12 Sudanese members now lives with thousands of refugees in Egypt. The troupe, called 'Camirata,' includes researchers, singers and poets who are determined to preserve the knowledge of traditional Sudanese folk music and dance to keep it from being lost in the ruinous war. Founded in 1997, the band rose to popularity in Khartoum before it began traveling to different states, enlisting diverse musicians, dancers and styles. They sing in 25 different Sudanese languages. Founder Dafallah el-Hag said the band's members started relocating to Egypt recently, as Sudan struggled through a difficult economic and political transition after a 2019 popular uprising unseated longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir. Others followed after the violence began. El-Hag arrived late last year. The band uses a variety of local musical instruments on stage. El-Hag says audiences are often surprised to see instruments such as the tanbour, a stringed instrument, being played with the nuggara drums, combined with tunes of the banimbo, a wooden xylophone. 'This combination of musical instruments helped promote some sort of forgiveness and togetherness among the Sudanese people,' el-Hag said, adding that he is eager to revive a museum in Khartoum that housed historic instruments and was reportedly looted and damaged. Fatma Farid, 21, a singer and dancer from Kordofan, moved to Egypt in 2021. Her aunt was killed in 2023 when an explosive fell on their house in al-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan. 'The way I see art has changed a lot since the war began,' she said. 'You think of what you present as an artist. You can deliver a message.' Kawthar Osman, a native of Madani city who has been singing with the band since 1997, feels nostalgic when she sings about the Nile River, which forms in Sudan from two upper branches, the Blue and White Nile. 'It reminds me of what makes Sudan the way it is,' she said, adding that the war only 'pushed the band to sing more for peace.' More than 2 million Sudanese fled the country, mostly to neighboring Egypt and Chad, where the Global Hunger Index has reported a 'serious' level of hunger. Over half a million forcibly displaced Sudanese have sought refuge in Chad, mostly women and children. Living conditions for those who stayed in Sudan have worsened as the war spread beyond Khartoum. Many made hard decisions early in the war either to flee across frontlines or risk being caught in the middle of fighting. In Darfur, the war turned particularly brutal and created famine conditions, with militias attacking entire villages and burning them to the ground. Armed robberies, lootings and the seizure of homes for bases were some of the challenges faced by Sudanese who stayed in the country's urban areas. Others struggled to secure food and water, find sources for electricity, and obtain medical treatment since hospitals were raided by fighters or hit by airstrikes. Communications networks are often barely functional. The performers say they struggle to speak with family and friends still in the country, much less think about returning. 'We don't know if we'll return to Sudan again or will see Sudan again or walk in the same streets,' Farid said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/through-music-and-dance-sudanese-performers-transport-refugee-audiences-home-/7810054.html	2024-10-04T23:51:02-07:00	
After residents flee Israeli strikes, a man in Lebanon cares for pets left behind	beirut — A dog clings to Hussein Hamza inside a car as he pans his camera around to show the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon. 'Poor thing. Look at this, he's clinging to me out of fear,' Hamza says in the video he posted online. 'A missile hit here,' he said, his voice shaking. As Israel pummels southern Lebanon with airstrikes, tens of thousands of residents are fleeing their homes in fear. But Hamza is staying. His mission is to care for the dogs and other animals left behind. He runs an animal shelter that houses 200 dogs in the village of Kfour. Recently, he has also been driving around towns and villages in the south, looking for stray animals and abandoned pets to feed. 'I opened bags of food and left them water. I'm relying on God,' said Hamza as he spread food hundreds of meters away from the shelter he runs, in case the dogs need to escape the facility when airstrikes come too close. Israel has dramatically stepped up its airstrikes across many parts of Lebanon, which it says target Hezbollah and its weapons. However over 1,000 people have been killed in the country in the past two weeks, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. The Lebanese government said the fighting might have displaced up to 1 million people, although the United Nations estimate is around 200,000. With his town under constant bombardment, Hamza, 56, refused to abandon the animals in his care. Despite the danger, Hamza drives around looking for stray animals and pets left behind by families, many of them abandoned behind locked gates. He brings them food, and then posts the videos online. 'Come here, come here! I got you food,' Hamza called to a dog hiding behind a fence in one of his online videos. 'At least unleash your dogs,' he pleads with residents in his videos. 'The dog owners had to escape on foot and couldn't take them.' In the midst of the chaos, Hamza has become a lifeline for many who reach out to him, hoping he can get food to their pets. 'This nice man called me, crying. They (the family) left the dogs behind the fence, and they couldn't take them,' he said. 'I just got the dogs dry food.' Hamza's journey has been perilous. On more than one occasion, he's narrowly avoided airstrikes. His work extends beyond dogs. 'We found a chicken on the road,' Hamza explained in another clip. 'It flew from a pickup truck. I will take it home.' Hamza's shelter has attracted support online, allowing him to buy 200 bags of dog food to distribute to the dogs in the region. Even so, the danger keeps mounting. 'I hope someone can take some load off my shoulders,' Hamza said as he picked up an elderly stray dog off the street and into his car. 'God help people. At the time of a strike, people lose it and don't know what to do,' he said while dropping off food and water in remote areas. With an Israeli ground invasion of south Lebanon looking increasingly likely, Hamza worries about what comes next. But for now, his focus remains on the animals. 'As long as I can reach the dogs and leave them food and water, I will not leave,' he said. 'I have a responsibility. I can't leave them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-residents-flee-israeli-strikes-a-man-in-lebanon-cares-for-pets-left-behind-/7810027.html	2024-10-04T23:50:26-07:00	
Tickets for 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics cost up to 3,000 euros	milan — Ticket prices for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics range from 30 euros (U.S. $33) for men's and women's preliminary hockey games all the way up to nearly 3,000 euros ($3,300) for the most costly seats at the closing ceremony inside Verona's Arena, a large Roman amphitheater. The most expensive sports event is the men's hockey final with prices ranging from 450 to 1,400 euros ($500 to $1,545). Local organizers announced Thursday that more than 20% of the tickets for the games in February, 2026, are available for under 40 euros ($44) and more than half are priced at under 100 euros ($110). Anyone interested in attending should register on the official ticketing platform to enter a draw that will allocate specific time slots for purchasing tickets in the first phase of sales. Ticket prices for the Winter Paralympics in March, 2026, start at 10 euros ($11) for children under 14, with more than 200,000 tickets — about 90% of the total — available for less than ($40) euros each. It's not necessary to register for a draw for Paralympics tickets, which will go on sale in March, 2025. Starting in April, 2025, both Olympic and Paralympic tickets will be available to the general public on a first-come, first-served basis, with no need to register in advance. The 2026 Games will be held across a large swath of northern Italy, with ice sports in Milan, Alpine skiing in Bormio and Cortina, snowboard and freestyle in Livigno, Nordic sports in Val di Fiemme and biathlon in Anterselva. Questions remain whether the sliding center in Cortina will be completed in time or if bobsled, luge and skeleton events will be moved to another track in Austria (Igls), Switzerland (St. Moritz) or New York (Lake Placid).	https://www.voanews.com/a/ticket-prices-for-2026-milan-cortina-winter-olympics-range-from-30-to-nearly-3-000-euros-/7810012.html	2024-10-04T23:49:50-07:00	
Israel's air defense passes another test in fending off Iranian missile strike	jerusalem — Israel's multilayered air-defense system appears to have passed another test after fending off Iran's latest missile barrage. In Tuesday's night's strike, Iran fired over 180 missiles toward Israel. The attack set off air raid sirens across the country and sent residents scrambling for shelter, but caused only a handful of minor injuries and limited damage, in large part because many were intercepted or landed in open areas. It was the latest success for an air-defense system that over the past year has intercepted projectiles fired from Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran. They have ranged from short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to long-range ballistic missiles like those fired Tuesday night. In Tuesday's attack, the U.S. and Britain said they assisted in shooting down the incoming missiles. Explosions also were seen over the skies of Jordan, though it remains unclear who carried out the interceptions. But the vast majority of Israel's air defense over the past year has been carried out by Israel itself. Over the decades, Israel has developed a sophisticated system capable of detecting incoming fire and deploying only if the projectile is headed toward a population center or sensitive military or civilian infrastructure. Israeli leaders say the system isn't 100% guaranteed, but they credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties. Here's a closer look at Israel's multilayered air-defense system: The Arrow This system developed with the U.S. is designed to intercept long-range missiles, including the types of ballistic missiles Iran launched on Tuesday. The Arrow, which operates outside the atmosphere, has also been used in the current war to intercept long-range missiles launched by Houthi militants in Yemen. David's Sling Also developed with the U.S., David's Sling is meant to intercept medium-range missiles, such as those possessed by Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has been deployed on multiple occasions throughout the war. Iron Dome This system, developed by Israel with U.S. backing, specializes in shooting down short-range rockets. It has intercepted thousands of rockets since it was activated early last decade – including thousands of interceptions during the current war against Hamas and Hezbollah. Israel says it has a success rate of over 90%. Iron Beam Israel is developing a new system to intercept incoming threats with laser technology. Israel has said this system will be a game changer because it would be much cheaper to operate than existing systems. According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. Iron Beam interceptions, by contrast, would cost a few dollars apiece, according to Israeli officials — but the system is not yet operational.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-air-defense-passes-another-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike-/7809997.html	2024-10-04T23:49:14-07:00	
Envoy: 'Russian leadership’ decides to delist Taliban as terrorist group	ISLAMABAD — Russia reported Friday that a 'principal decision' had already been made to remove Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban from Moscow’s list of terrorist organizations. Zamir Kabulov, the Russian presidential envoy for the South Asian nation, was quoted by state-run TASS news agency as saying that the foreign ministry and national security agencies 'are putting finishing legal touches' on the Taliban's delisting in line with federal laws. 'A principal decision on this has already been made by the Russian leadership,' said Kabulov. 'Hopefully, the final decision will be announced soon.' The remarks were reported on the same day that Moscow hosted a conference of regional countries to discuss Afghanistan, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov presiding over the proceedings. Lavrov later held bilateral talks with Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who led his delegation at Friday’s multilateral event in the Russian capital, organized under the Moscow Format platform. 'We firmly believe in the importance of maintaining a pragmatic dialogue with the current Afghan government,' Lavrov said in his inaugural speech to delegates from countries such as China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan. 'Moscow will continue to develop political, trade, and economic ties with Kabul,' Lavrov pledged. Russia launched the Moscow Format in 2017 and it has since become a regular platform for discussing challenges facing impoverished, war-torn Afghanistan. Muttaqi, in his broadcast address to Friday’s gathering, welcomed Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan's recent announcements that they will remove the Taliban from their lists of outlawed groups. 'We also appreciate the positive remarks [made] by the high-ranking officials of the Russian Federation in this regard and hope to see more effective steps soon,' said the Taliban chief diplomat. Russia's involvement in Afghanistan has been tumultuous. The Soviet army entered the country in 1979 to help a pro-Moscow government in Kabul but pulled out a decade later due to heavy losses inflicted by U.S.-backed Afghan insurgents, or mujahideen. Moscow has developed close informal ties with the Taliban since they regained power in Afghanistan three years ago after the United States and NATO forces withdrew ending 20 years of war. President Vladimir Putin stated in July that Russia considered the Taliban an ally in the fight against terrorism. The former Afghan insurgent group has been on the Russian list of terrorist organizations since 2003. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov praised the Taliban for combating narcotics in Afghanistan and fighting a regional Islamic State affiliate known as IS-Khorasan (IS-K). 'We support the Afghan authorities’ resolve to combat the terrorist threat,' he told the conference Friday. Muttaqi called on all regional countries 'to cooperate in preventing the recruitment of their citizens by ISIS and then send them to Afghanistan and other countries to carry out subversive operations.' He used an acronym for IS-K, which the United Nations describes as the most significant terrorist regional threat emanating from Afghan soil. The Taliban foreign minister did not name any country, but Kabul formally alleged last week that the terrorist group is orchestrating attacks from bases in Pakistan, charges officials in Islamabad have refuted as unfounded. No country has officially recognized the de facto Taliban government, although China and the United Arab Emirates have formally accepted Taliban-appointed ambassadors. Washington remains opposed to any step toward easing sanctions or moving toward recognition of the Taliban as Afghanistan’s rightful government, saying Kabul must improve its human rights record to win international legitimacy and support. 'We will look for interest in any outcomes and deliverables from the upcoming Moscow Format meeting, but we do not participate,' Karen Decker, the head of the Doha-based U.S. diplomatic mission for Afghanistan, told reporters Thursday. The U.S. has never attended a Moscow Format meeting because it is seen as a regional conversation, said Decker, who has also been tasked with overseeing Afghan diplomacy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/envoy-russian-leadership-decides-to-delist-taliban-as-terrorist-group/7811394.html	2024-10-04T22:35:16-07:00	
A week after Helene hit, thousands still without water struggle to find enough	ASHEVILLE, North Carolina — Nearly a week after Hurricane Helene brought devastation to western North Carolina, a shiny stainless steel tanker truck in downtown Asheville attracted residents carrying 19-liter containers, milk jugs and buckets to fill with what has become a desperately scare resource — drinking water. Flooding tore through the city's water system, destroying so much infrastructure that officials said repairs could take weeks. To make do, Anna Ramsey arrived Wednesday with her two children, who each left carrying plastic bags filled with 7.6 liters of water. 'We have no water. We have no power. But I think it's also been humbling,' Ramsey said. Helene's path through the Southeast left a trail of power outages so large the darkness was visible from space. Tens of trillions of liters of rain fell and more than 200 people were killed, making Helene the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005. Hundreds of people are still unaccounted for, and search crews must trudge through knee-deep debris to learn whether residents are safe. It also damaged water utilities so severely and over such a wide inland area that one federal official said the toll 'could be considered unprecedented.' As of Thursday, about 136,000 people in the Southeast were served by a nonoperational water provider and more than 1.8 million were living under a boil water advisory, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Western North Carolina was especially hard hit. Officials are facing a difficult rebuilding task made harder by the steep, narrow valleys of the Blue Ridge Mountains that during a more typical October would attract throngs of fall tourists. 'The challenges of the geography are just fewer roads, fewer access points, fewer areas of flat ground to stage resources' said Brian Smith, acting deputy division director for the EPA's water division in the Southeast. After days without water, people long for more than just a sponge bath. 'I would love a shower,' said Sue Riles in Asheville. 'Running water would be incredible.' The raging floodwaters of Helene destroyed crucial parts of Asheville's water system, scouring out the pipes that convey water from a reservoir in the mountains above town that is the largest of three water supplies for the system. To reach a second reservoir that was knocked offline, a road had to be rebuilt. Boosted output from the third source restored water flow in some southern Asheville neighborhoods Friday, but without full repairs schools may not be able to resume in-person classes, hospitals may not restore normal operations, and the city's hotels and restaurants may not fully reopen. Even water that's unfit to drink is scarce. Drew Reisinger, the elected Buncombe County register of deeds, worries about people in apartments who can't easily haul a bucket of water from a creek to flush their toilet. Officials are advising people to collect nondrinkable water for household needs from a local swimming pool. 'One thing no one is talking about is the amount of poop that exists in every toilet in Asheville,' he said. 'We're dealing with a public health emergency.' It's a situation that becomes more dangerous the longer it lasts. Even in communities fortunate enough to have running water, hundreds of providers have issued boil water notices indicating the water could be contaminated. But boiling water for cooking and drinking is time consuming and small mistakes can cause stomach illness, according to Natalie Exum, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 'Every day that goes by, you could be exposed to a pathogen,' Exum said. 'These basic services that we take for granted in our everyday lives actually do do a lot to prevent illness.' Travis Edwards' faucet worked immediately after the storm. He filled as many containers as he could for himself and his child, but it didn't take long for the flow to weaken, then stop. They rationed water, switching to hand sanitizer and barely putting any on toothbrushes. '(We) didn't realize how dehydrated we were getting,' he said. Federal officials have shipped millions of liters of water to areas where people also might not be able to make phone calls or switch on the lights. Power has been restored to about 62% of homes and businesses and 8,000 crews are out working to restore power in the hardest hit parts of North Carolina, federal officials said Thursday. In 10 counties, about half of the cell sites are still down. The first step for some utilities is simply figuring out how bad the damage is, a job that might require EPA expertise in extreme cases. Ruptured water pipes are a huge problem. They often run beneath roads, many of which were crumpled and twisted by floodwaters. 'Pretty much anytime you see a major road damaged, there's a very good chance that there's a pipe in there that's also gotten damaged,' said Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. Generally, repairs start at the treatment plant and move outward, with fixes in nearby big pipes done first, according to the EPA. 'Over time, you'll gradually get water to more and more people,' White said. Many people are still missing, and water repair employees don't typically work around search and rescue operations. It takes a toll, according to Kevin Morley, manager of federal relations with the American Water Works Association. 'There's emotional support that is really important for all the people involved. You're seeing people's lives just wiped out,' he said. Even private well owners aren't immune. Pumps on private wells may have lost power and overtopping floodwaters can contaminate them. There's often a 'blind faith' assumption that drinking water won't fail. In this case, the technology was insufficient, according to Craig Colten. Before retiring to Asheville, he was a professor in Louisiana focused on resilience to extreme weather. He hopes Helene will prompt politicians to spend more to ensure infrastructure withstands destructive storms. And climate change will only make the problem more severe, said Erik Olson, a health and food expert at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council. 'I think states and the federal government really need to step back and start looking at how we're going to prepare for these extreme weather events that are going to be occurring and recurring every single year,' he said. Edwards has developed a system to save water. He'll soap dirty dishes and rinse them with a trickle of water with bleach, which is caught and transferred to a bucket — useable for the toilet. Power and some cell service have returned for him. And water distribution sites have guaranteed some measure of normalcy: Edwards feels like he can start going out to see friends again. 'To not feel guilty about using more than a cup of water to, like, wash yourself … I'm really, really grateful,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-week-after-helene-hit-thousands-still-without-water-struggle-to-find-enough/7811367.html	2024-10-04T19:52:02-07:00

China could wage economic war on Taiwan to force surrender, report says	washington — U.S. military officials and analysts have for years warned of possible armed attacks or blockades by China on Taiwan, but a report released Friday has raised a red flag about possible nonmilitary tactics that could be used effectively against the self-governed island. Beijing could wage an economic and cyber war to force a surrender from Taiwan without direct use of military power, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington research institute, said in the report. Such a likely but overlooked scenario, it said, poses a challenge for the U.S., the island's biggest ally, and it suggested Washington make preparations for how best to respond. FDD researchers teamed up with banking and finance experts in Taiwan over two days earlier this year to simulate likely nonmilitary moves by Beijing, such as disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks on infrastructure. The exercise was the first of its kind and sought to fill an analytical gap, FDD said. 'Modern globalization has created more economic connections that China can exploit to achieve coercive aims,' the report said. 'Technological innovation created even more digital connections, offering more possibilities for coercion, including through the targeting of critical infrastructure.' Beijing has vowed to take Taiwan by force if necessary, although Chinese President Xi Jinping has promised to make 'utmost efforts' to do so peacefully. Taiwan split from the mainland in 1949 during a civil war when the defeated nationalist government fled to the island. Years of pressure Tensions have flared in the Taiwan Strait since 2016 when Beijing began to increase diplomatic and military pressure on the island, prompting the U.S. to step up its support. Washington, which is obligated under U.S. law to provide Taipei with sufficient military hardware for its defense, has argued that it is in the U.S. interest to keep peace in the strait and to stand with democracies such as Taiwan to maintain the rules-based world order. Beijing has demanded the U.S. stay out of Taiwan, arguing it is a purely domestic affair. President Joe Biden has indicated he would send troops to defend Taiwan in case of an armed attack from China, but the U.S. government has yet to formulate a plan to respond to nonmilitary tactics, giving Beijing flexibility in working to undermine Taiwan without triggering an outright response from Washington that a military invasion would, the FDD researchers said. Taiwan’s foreign and defense ministries had no immediate comment on the report. With an estimated 1 million Taiwanese living and working in China, economic ties have grown ever closer. That has made the possibility of economic coercion, boycotts and military blockades an even bigger threat. Possible moves In the simulation exercises, the experts from the U.S. and Taiwan studied possible moves by Beijing such as conducting psychological wars to erode public trust, banning imports of Taiwanese products or raising tariffs on them, short-selling Taiwanese stocks, freezing bank transfers across the strait, cutting fiber-optic cables, and targeting energy imports and storage. The report recommended that Taiwan diversify its energy imports, relocate businesses away from the mainland, develop new markets, and build alliances and partnerships. The report also suggested that the United States develop a playbook of options to counter China and improve coordination with allies. The Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance, which worked with FDD on the simulation exercises, has argued that Taiwan must strengthen its financial resilience. 'China could destabilize Taiwan’s financial system to incite social unrest as a precursor to invasion,' the report said. Russell Hsiao, executive director of the Washington-based Global Taiwan Institute, said that Beijing has already been ramping up nonmilitary measures against Taiwan and that such efforts are expected to intensify in the coming years. 'It behooves the United States and Taiwan to work with allies and like-minded partners to strengthen our collective resilience to China’s weaponization of economic interdependence,' Hsiao said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-could-wage-economic-war-on-taiwan-to-force-surrender-report-says-/7811357.html	2024-10-04T18:57:14-07:00

Somalia-Ethiopia tensions escalate; UN urges diplomatic resolution	washington — In a crucial week for Somalia's security plan, discussions in Washington and New York have underscored the urgent need for preparation for the upcoming African Union Support Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM), as escalating tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia over a maritime agreement Ethiopia signed with Somaliland raised concerns among international stakeholders. Somalia is set to determine the composition of its upcoming AUSSOM following the expiration of the current AU mission. Hussein Moalim, Somalia's national security adviser, stated that Somalia is firm in its position on Ethiopian forces' participation in the new mission. 'Somalia would not consider Ethiopian troops to be part of the new mission unless it withdraws from the illegal memorandum of understanding signed with [Somalia's breakaway region of] Somaliland earlier this year,' Moalim said Thursday in an interview with VOA Somali. The controversial memorandum of understanding, also known as an MoU, has escalated tensions between the two neighboring nations, granting Ethiopia access to a 20-kilometer (12.4 mile) stretch of Red Sea coastline in return for potential recognition of Somaliland's independence. Somalia views the MoU, signed in January, as a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, leading to a diplomatic rift that has included the expulsion of the Ethiopian ambassador from Mogadishu and threats to remove thousands of Ethiopian troops stationed in parts of south and central regions of the country. Despite two rounds of mediated talks by Turkey yielding no results, Somalia's State Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Omar Balcad insists that effective dialogue hinges on addressing issues of Somalia's sovereignty infringement and restoring trust. 'First we need to solve the issue on our sovereignty infringement and second to restore the trust and the diplomatic relations between us, and then there comes the negotiation on the Ethiopia desire to access our sea and ports,' said Balcad in an interview with VOA Somali. UN urges diplomatic resolution In New York, the United Nations Security Council addressed the security situation in Somalia on Thursday, stressing the urgency of finalizing plans for the new AU stabilization mission. During the discussion, concerns were raised regarding escalating tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia, with James Swan, acting special representative of the secretary-general, urging both nations to seek a diplomatic solution within the framework of international law. Ambassador Robert Wood, the U.S. alternative representative for special political affairs, echoed these sentiments, highlighting the detrimental impact of rising tensions on regional security. 'Colleagues, we are deeply concerned about rising tension between Ethiopia and Somalia and the negative impact it is having on shared security interests,' Wood said. In discussions held in Washington this week, Somali officials, along with representatives from the U.S., Qatar, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the U.K., emphasized the urgency of finalizing funding options for the new peacekeeping mission. Somalia's Moalim reiterated the commitment of international partners to support Somalia's security, stability and sovereignty. 'The partners reaffirmed their unwavering support for the federal government of Somalia in its efforts to attain stability and security across the nation,' he said. Ethopia denies Somalia's allegations Briefing the U.N. Security Council, Somali Foreign Minister Ahmed Moalim Fiqi accused Ethiopia of using the fight against terrorism as a pretext for territorial expansion. 'Let me be clear. The claim that Ethiopia is in Somalia to fight terrorism is a pretext for annexation,' Fiqi asserted, adding that Somalia has intercepted three illegal arms shipments from Ethiopia in the past three months, fueling local conflicts and empowering extremist groups. 'We call these actions a clear violation of Somalia's sovereignty,' he said. Ethiopia has been constantly denying Somalia's accusations against Ethiopia, including its intention behind the MoU signed with Somaliland. During last month's meeting of U.N. General Assembly, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Taye Atske-Selassie said his country had nothing to do with Somalia's allegations. 'Ethiopia's memorandum of understanding with Somaliland is based on existing political dispensation in Somalia,' he said. 'Our objective is a shared growth and prosperity in the region. Similar agreements have been concluded by other states, and there is no reason for the government of Somalia to incite hostility that obviously intends to cover internal political tensions,' he added. 'I therefore reject the unfounded allegations leveled against my country.' Falastin Iman in Washington contributed to this report, which originated in VOA's Somali Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-s-security-dilemma-ethiopia-tensions-dominate-discussions-on-au-peacekeeping/7811115.html	2024-10-04T17:42:50-07:00	
China's National Day holiday subdued amid sluggish economy	washington — China's weeklong celebration of its National Day, from October 1, is known as the 'golden week' because it's the Asian giant's biggest week for travel, tourism and leisure spending. However, some Chinese who spoke to VOA Mandarin described this year's National Day as a national day of mourning because of higher costs while the economy is struggling. All those interviewed by VOA asked that their names not be used out of fear of retaliation from the Chinese government for their negative comments. Despite returning from a holiday in Japan in September, a 37-year-old white-collar worker in Beijing chose to join the crowd of travelers during China's National Day holiday for a seven-day vacation in South Korea. 'Usually the ticket is only 2,000 yuan [about $284], but now it has risen to almost 4,000 [about $568] during the National Day holiday. But I still decided to go out and have fun. Otherwise, what are you doing in Beijing? It's so boring,' she told VOA. The well-off urban dweller said, 'I went to get a manicure today, and the lady said that all of her friends have lost their jobs. Now a lot of people don't have money. The domestic economy is not good. We just don't know how bad it is, and we can't see the truth.' She noticed that even though it is the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, Beijing did not have many large-scale celebrations or a festive atmosphere, except for displays of national flags and flowerbeds. The Beijing resident thought the main reason was that the economy is suffering. 'Many people have lost their jobs, and if a grand National Day celebration were held, it would definitely be criticized. The government might not have the money to hold a celebration either,' she said. China also usually holds more elaborate celebrations when it hits a new decade for its founding anniversary. Not in 'mood' to celebrate A man who lives in Shanghai and works in the publishing industry said he believed that in today's China, national pride is becoming less and less marketable. He told VOA Mandarin, 'It's because the people's personal [economic] lives are not good. And now there is a bit of a difficult situation at home and abroad, and people are not in the mood for celebrations.' A middle-class translator who lives in Beijing told VOA Mandarin he and his friends thought that 'the national fortune is very gray' because the economy is unpredictable. 'Who would want to invest? So, are your economic fundamentals getting better? Is your business environment improving? Is your international environment improving? I think these are some of the basic questions,' he said. 'Not to mention the rule of law. So, we want it to get better, but you tell me, which aspect is getting better?' Li Yang, vice minister of transport, said at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office on September 27 that the cross-regional flow of people during this year's National Day holiday would reach 1.94 billion, with an average 277 million people traveling per day, and 80% of the trips by private vehicles. This would be an average daily increase of 0.7% over the same period last year and an average daily increase of 19.4% over the same period in 2019. The increase in travelers will give at least a temporary boost to domestic consumption, which China has been encouraging since the COVID-19 pandemic, especially as an overreliance on exports has fueled tariff retaliation from trade partners. But while stimulus measures last week boosted China's stock markets by the most since 2008, economists noted the fundamental reliance on exports has not changed and China's property market — a pillar of its domestic economy — is still struggling. 'Just a relative rebound' Despite jumps in markets, and travel for the golden week holiday, the translator and the white-collar worker said these did not signal a return to prosperity. 'It's not that your income is higher after three years of the pandemic, it's that you had spent less during the pandemic,' said the translator. 'It's just a relative rebound.' He continued, 'Generally speaking, the National Day has become a national mourning,' adding that if there is another pandemic or major upheaval, many people will not be able to maintain their standard of living. While China's middle class lamented the country's downturn, they noted the lives of people with limited skills are the most difficult. Meanwhile, taxi drivers are taking advantage of the temporary increase in passengers for the National Day holiday to earn as much as they can. The publisher told VOA he took a ride-hailing application taxi in Shanghai, and it was the driver's first week. 'He hadn't gotten out of the car for a week and even slept in the car,' he said. 'He slept in the car when he was tired and drove when he woke up.' He said, 'I asked the taxi driver today, 'How do you plan for the National Day? How many days a week do you work?' He said, 'If there were eight days in a week, I would work eight days and not think about vacation travel at all.' ' China's Transport Ministry described passenger transport since the beginning of this year as 'robust,' with nearly 44 billion passenger trips recorded during the first eight months, a 6% increase from the same period last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-national-day-holiday-subdued-amid-sluggish-economy/7811095.html	2024-10-04T16:40:34-07:00

Belarus court sentences activists for attempted sabotage of Russian plane	moscow — A court in Minsk sentenced a dozen individuals to prison terms of between two and 25 years Friday for helping commit what Belarus has called an 'act of terrorism' at a military airfield outside the capital last year. A group of Belarusian anti-government activists said in February 2023 that they had blown up a sophisticated Russian military surveillance aircraft in a drone attack at the base. Russia and Belarus dismissed the assertion as fake, with Belarusian state television publishing footage showing what it said was the undamaged Beriev A-50 surveillance craft. About a week later, Minsk said it had detained a 'terrorist' and more than 20 accomplices over attempted sabotage at the airfield. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin, alleged at the time that Ukrainian security services and the U.S. Central Intelligence agency were behind the operation. He said the aircraft had suffered only superficial damage in the attack, which was carried out using a 'small drone,' the Belta news agency reported. On Friday, Belarus' general prosecutor's office said the Minsk City Court had sentenced 12 individuals after finding them guilty of terrorism, extremism and other serious crimes. The main defendant, Ukrainian national Nikolai Shvets, was sentenced in absentia to 25 years in prison. Shvets, who gave an interview to Belarusian state television last April in which he detailed how he planned the attack, was released in a prisoner exchange with Ukraine in June, according to Belarusian rights group Viasna. It was not clear how many of the others were sentenced in absentia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/belarus-court-sentences-activists-for-attempted-sabotage-of-russian-plane-/7811091.html	2024-10-04T15:53:02-07:00	
China-connected spamouflage networks spread antisemitic disinformation	washington — Spamouflage networks with connections to China are posting antisemitic conspiracy theories on social media, casting doubt on Washington's independence from alleged Jewish influence and the integrity of the two U.S. presidential candidates, a joint investigation by VOA Mandarin and Taiwan's Doublethink Lab, a social media analytics firm, has found. The investigation has so far uncovered more than 30 such X posts, many of which claim or suggest that core American political institutions, including the White House and Congress, have pledged loyalty to or are controlled by Jewish elites and the Israeli government. One post shows a graphic of 18 U.S. officials of Jewish descent, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and the head of the Homeland Security Department, Alejandro Mayorkas, and asks: 'Jews only make up 2% of the U.S. population, so why do they have so many representatives in important government departments?!' Another post shows a cartoon depicting Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for president, and her opponent, Donald Trump, having their tongues tangled together and wrapped around an Israeli flagpole. The post proclaims that 'no matter who of them comes to power, they will not change their stance on Judaism.' Most of the 32 posts analyzed by VOA Mandarin and Doublethink Lab were posted during July and August. The posts came from three spamouflage accounts, two of which were previously reported by VOA. Each of the three accounts leads its own spamouflage network. The three networks consist of 140 accounts, which amplify content from the three main accounts, or seeders. A spamouflage network is a state-sponsored operation disguised as the work of authentic social media users to spread pro-government narratives and disinformation while discrediting criticism from adversaries. Jasper Hewitt, a digital intelligence analyst at Doublethink Lab, told VOA Mandarin that the impact of these antisemitic posts has been limited, as most of them failed to reach real users, despite having garnered over 160,000 views. U.S. officials have cast China as one of the major threats looking to disrupt this year's election. Beijing, however, has repeatedly denied these allegations and urged Washington to 'not make an issue of China in the election.' Tuvia Gering, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, has closely followed antisemitic disinformation coming from China. He told VOA Mandarin that Beijing isn't necessarily hostile toward Jews, but anti-Semitic conspiracy theories have historically been a handy tool to be used against Western countries. 'You can trace its origins back to the Cold War, when the Soviet Union promoted antisemitic conspiracy theories all over the world just to instigate in Western societies,' Gering said, 'because it divides them from within and it casts the West in a bad light in a strategic competition. [It's] the same thing you see here [with China].' Anti-Semitic speech floods Chinese internet Similar antisemitic narratives about U.S. politics posted by the spamouflage accounts have long been flourishing on the Chinese internet. An article that received thousands of likes and reposts on Chinese social media app WeChat claims that 'Jewish capital' has completed its control of the American political sphere 'through infiltration, marriages, campaign funds and lobbying.' The article also brings up the Jewish heritage of many current and former U.S. officials and their families as evidence of the alleged Jewish takeover of America. 'The wife of the U.S. president is Jewish, the son-in-law of the former U.S. president is Jewish, the mother of the previous former U.S. president was Jewish, the U.S. Secretary of State is Jewish, the U.S. Secretary of Treasury is Jewish, the Deputy Secretary of State, the Attorney General … are all Jewish,' it wrote. In fact, first lady Jill Biden is Roman Catholic, and the mother of former President Barack Obama was raised as a Christian. The others named are Jewish. Conspiracy theories and misinformation abounded on the Chinese internet after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill in May that would empower the Department of Education to adopt a new set of standards when investigating antisemitism in educational programs. Articles and videos assert that the bill marks the death of America because it 'definitively solidifies the superior and unquestionable position of the Jews in America,' claiming falsely that anyone who's labeled an antisemite will be arrested. One video with more than 1 million views claimed that the New Testament of the Bible would be deemed illegal under the bill. And since all U.S. presidents took their inaugural oath with the Bible, the bill allegedly invalidates the legitimacy of the commander in chief. None of that is true. The Chinese public hasn't historically been hostile toward Jews. A 2014 survey published by the Anti-Defamation League, a U.S.-based group against antisemitism, found that only 20% of the participants from China harbored an antisemitic attitude. But when the Israel-Hamas conflict broke out a year ago, the otherwise heavily censored Chinese social media was flooded with antisemitic comments and praise for Nazi Germany leader Adolf Hitler. The Chinese government has dismissed criticism of antisemitism on its internet. When asked about it at a news conference last year, Wang Wenbin, then the spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry, said that 'China's laws unequivocally prohibit disseminating information on extremism, ethnic hatred, discrimination and violence via the internet.' But online hate speech against Jews has hardly disappeared. Eric Liu, a former censor for Chinese social media Weibo who now monitors online censorship, told VOA Mandarin that whenever Israel is in the news, there would be a surge in online antisemitism. Just last month, after dozens of members of the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah were killed by explosions of their pagers, Chinese online commentators acidly condemned Israel and Jews. The attack 'proves that Jews are the most terrifying and cowardly people,' one Weibo user wrote. 'They are self-centered and believe themselves to be superior, when in fact they are considered the most indecent and shameless. When the time comes, it's going to be blood for blood.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-connected-spamouflage-networks-spread-antisemitic-disinformation/7811033.html	2024-10-04T15:38:25-07:00

River level in Amazon rainforest hits 122-year low amid drought, wildfires	manaus, brazil — The river port in the Amazon rainforest's largest city of Manaus on Friday hit its lowest level since 1902, as a drought drains waterways and snarls transport of grain exports and essential supplies that are the region's lifeline. Below-average rainfall — even through the rainy season — has plagued the Amazon and much of South America since last year, also feeding the worst wildfires in more than a decade in Brazil and Bolivia. Millions of hectares of forest and farmland have burned in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru as well. The same extreme heat and dryness that is driving the surging fires in the Amazon is impacting neighboring Pantanal, the world's largest wetlands. Bolivia is also on track to break a record for the most fires ever recorded, according to data from Brazil's space research agency. The Amazon basin, usually one of the wettest places on Earth, is experiencing its worst fires in nearly two decades, according to the European Union's Copernicus Observatory. And last week, satellite images from the National Institute for Space Research showed 80% of Brazil affected by smoke. Researchers say climate change is the main culprit behind wildfires and the drought. Scientists predict the Amazon region may not fully recover moisture levels until 2026. Last year, the drought became a humanitarian crisis, as people reliant on rivers were stranded without food, water or medicine. This year authorities are already on alert. In hard-hit Amazonas state, at least 62 municipalities are under states of emergency with more than half a million people affected, according to the state's civil defense corps. 'This is now the most severe drought in over 120 years of measurement at the Port of Manaus,' said Valmir Mendonca, the port's head of operations, who said the river level is likely to keep falling for another week or two. With the region never fully recovering because of weaker-than-usual seasonal rains, many of the impacts of the drought last year look set to repeat or reach new extremes. The Port of Manaus measured the Rio Negro at 12.66 meters Friday, according to its website, surpassing the previous all-time low recorded last year and still falling rapidly. The Rio Negro is a major tributary of the Amazon River, the world's largest river by volume. The port sits near the 'meeting of the waters' where the black water of the Negro meets the sandy-colored Solimoes, which also hit a record low this week. Grain shipments have been halted on the Madeira River, another tributary of the Amazon, because of low water levels, a port association said last month. Researchers are again finding the carcasses of Amazon freshwater river dolphins, which they blame on thinning waters driving the threatened species into closer contact with humans. National disaster monitoring agency Cemaden has already called the drought Brazil's worst such event since at least the 1950s. The drought has also sapped hydropower plants, Brazil's main source of electricity. Energy authorities have approved bringing back daylight saving time to conserve electricity, although the measure still requires presidential approval. The extreme weather and dryness are affecting much of South America, with the Paraguay River also at an all-time low. That river starts in Brazil and flows through Paraguay and Argentina to the Atlantic.	https://www.voanews.com/a/river-level-in-amazon-rainforest-hits-122-year-low-amid-drought-wildfires-/7811024.html	2024-10-04T14:33:43-07:00	
Despite obstacles, new NATO leader aims to increase support for Ukraine	london — With an escalating war in the Middle East, uncertainty over Western military aid for Ukraine, and the U.S. presidential election looming next month, new NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has no time to settle in. The former Dutch prime minister was appointed to the role at a ceremony at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday, where he told delegates that 'there can be no lasting security in Europe without a strong, independent Ukraine,' and affirmed that 'Ukraine's rightful place is in NATO.' On Thursday, Rutte was welcomed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Kyiv. Zelenskyy wasted no time in relaying his demands. 'We have discussed the most urgent needs of our troops, the weapons and the recruitment to the brigades,' Zelenskyy said at a news conference alongside Rutte on Thursday. 'We will have more time today to discuss more details on how to strengthen Ukraine's positions on the front so that we can exert more pressure on Russia in order to support just and realistic diplomacy. That is why we need sufficient quantity and quality of weapons, including long-range weapons, the decision on which, in my opinion, our Western partners are delaying,' he told reporters. Ukraine wants to use Western long-range missiles on targets inside Russia. The U.S. and other allies are holding back, fearing escalation with Moscow. NATO's new secretary-general made his position clear. 'Ukraine obviously has the right to defend itself and international law is on the side of Ukraine, meaning that this right does not end at the border. Russia is pursuing this illegal war … targeting Russian fighter jets and missiles before they can be used against Ukraine's civilian infrastructure can help save lives,' Rutte told reporters. Ukraine's president was asked whether he feared the world was forgetting about his country, amid the escalating conflict in the Middle East. 'I wish that Ukraine is not forgotten,' Zelenskyy said. 'And the best way to show this is by giving particular weapons, by giving particular permissions. And help to shoot down hostile drones — by the way, the same Iranian rockets and drones — to shoot them down the same way as they are shot down in the sky of Israel. Do the same over the skies of Ukraine.' Rutte is a longtime ally of Ukraine, noted analyst Armida van Rij, a senior research fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House. 'While he was prime minister of the Netherlands, he was very supportive of Ukraine. He's the one who signed off on the F-16s [fighter jets] deal for Ukraine as well. So, there is that history of support,' van Rij told VOA. However, Rutte is facing headwinds as he tries to boost military support for Ukraine among NATO allies. Next month, U.S. voters will choose a new president: Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. Rutte said he would work with whoever is elected — but neither outcome will be straightforward, said van Rij. 'There is a real risk for Ukraine that Trump may try to force Ukraine's hand and force Ukraine to capitulate to Russia, which would be terrible for European security. That's the first challenge. But the second challenge is even if Vice President Harris were to win the U.S. elections, she may still face a divided Congress and she may still struggle to pass aid packages in support for Ukraine through Congress.' Either scenario would require European NATO allies to step up their military aid. 'And there again, there's challenges because many countries have depleted their stocks. They've given as much as they feel comfortable with at this point. What I would like to see is to think through some of the practical ways in which we can advance EU and NATO collaborations specifically on this issue of developing a European defense industrial base,' van Rij told VOA. There are fears in Europe that a victory for Trump could upend the United States' relationship with NATO. 'Like [former NATO Secretary-General Jens] Stoltenberg, Rutte is known as a 'Trump whisperer.' He is one of the few European politicians who developed a good working relationship with Donald Trump. However, a potential second Trump term could prove much more disruptive, with less U.S. aid to Ukraine, more concessions to Russia and further questioning of the value of NATO,' said Oana Lungescu, a distinguished fellow at Britain's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) and a former NATO spokesperson, in an email to VOA. The Kremlin said this week that Russian President Vladimir Putin knew Rutte well from his time as Dutch prime minister. 'At that time there were hopes of building good pragmatic relations,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a phone call Tuesday. 'But we know what followed — the Netherlands adopted a rather defiant attitude to fully exclude all contacts with Russia. So, we don't think that anything new or significant will happen with the policy of the [NATO] alliance,' Peskov said. Meanwhile, Rutte takes the helm of NATO as it faces an increasingly assertive China. 'On Ukraine, everyone's very much on the same line. On China, there's still some allies saying, 'We're not sure we need to quite go into the Indo-Pacific theater.' In a scenario where U.S. resources and capabilities are drawn elsewhere, i.e., the Indo-Pacific, Europeans have to be able to fend for themselves — including look after Ukraine in the current short-term scenario,' van Rij told VOA. Rutte said another priority would be to strengthen NATO's partnerships with allies outside the alliance in an interconnected world. His primary focus must be on keeping NATO members safe, said Lungescu of RUSI. 'As NATO secretary-general, Rutte must take the lead in arguing for more defense spending across the alliance,' Lungescu said. 'He should make a strong case not just about figures and percentages, but about the concrete capabilities that are needed to keep NATO nations safe in a dangerous world.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/despite-obstacles-new-nato-leader-aims-to-boost-support-for-ukraine-/7810976.html	2024-10-04T14:28:16-07:00	
Uganda's military threatens US ambassador with expulsion	kampala, uganda — The chief of Uganda’s defense forces, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, has given U.S. Ambassador William Popp until Monday morning to apologize or leave the country. It is not clear why Kainerugaba, who is President Yoweri Museveni’s son, issued the ultimatum to the ambassador, although this week the United States sanctioned four Ugandan police officers for human rights violations. On Friday, Kainerugaba took to X three times to say Uganda was about to have a serious confrontation with Popp for 'disrespecting our beloved and celebrated president and for undermining the constitution of Uganda.' Five hours later, Kainerugaba tweeted again, saying if Popp did not apologize to the president personally by 9 a.m. Monday for what the general called Popp’s undiplomatic behavior, the government would demand that he leave. Speaking to VOA, Sewanyana Livingstone, director of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative Uganda, said Kainerugaba has no authority to declare Popp persona non grata unless he is appointed minister of foreign affairs. Sewanyana said Kainerugaba’s comments should be dismissed. 'He needs to calm down. He needs to understand that Uganda is not him, neither is he Uganda,' Sewanyana said. 'Uganda will always be there. Sanctions are not the functions of an ambassador. They are issued by the State Department. So, I think he is even targeting the wrong person. I think Ugandans need to call him to order. It’s high time.' On Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said four Ugandan police officers had been sanctioned for gross violations of human rights. These included torture and cruel inhumane treatment and punishment. The police officers were identified as Bob Kagarura, Alex Mwine, Elly Womanya and Hamdani Twesigye. The State Department said reports of the violations as documented by Ugandan civil court documents, civil society organizations and independent journalists were serious and credible. Ugandan authorities did not respond to requests for comment. A report released last month by the African Center for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture Victims, or ACTV, noted that torture cases in Uganda were on the rise despite laws against the practice. Herbert Sam Nsubuga, executive director of ACTV, said the organization was concerned about the situation in Uganda. 'The situation is not as good as we want it to be,' Nsubuga said. 'Because just halfway this year, we have made 903 cases. So, it’s still really an issue.' In 2023, monitors in Uganda recorded 1,235 cases of torture, with the Uganda People’s Defense forces and police as top perpetrators. The four designated officers in April 2020 raided a Ugandan legislator's home, accusing him of violating the regulations put in place to control the spread of COVID-19 as he distributed food to vulnerable communities. According to records produced in court, the legislator, Francis Zaake, was arrested and detained at the Defense Intelligence and Security headquarters, where he was tortured before he was left at a hospital. He later sued the four officers, and a court awarded him $20,400. In response to VOA questions on Kainerugaba’s threats, the U.S. Embassy in Uganda quoted State Department spokesman Miller as saying the embassy, the ambassador and the U.S. government were continuing to work directly and normally every day with Ugandan authorities on a full range of issues. Miller said in accordance with U.S. law, the United States was committed to supporting justice for victims and accountability of those involved in human rights violations around the world. This, he said, includes denying or restricting travel visas to visit the United States for individuals when there is demonstrated evidence that they have committed abuses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-s-military-threatens-us-ambassador-with-expulsion-/7810960.html	2024-10-04T13:55:46-07:00	
India faces tough balancing act amid escalating Middle East conflict	new delhi / washington — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided over a Cabinet meeting on security Friday to address the escalating conflict in the Middle East. According to Press Trust of India, the meeting focused on the implications on trade and the supply of petroleum products. India expressed grave concern regarding the escalation of the security situation involving Israel and its neighbors, emphasizing that 'the conflict must not take a wider regional dimension.' In view of the increasing tensions, the question is how India will balance its relations with all parties if the situation becomes worse. Analysts in New Delhi say India should adopt a neutral stance, especially if the situation worsens and a formal war breaks out between Iran and Israel. India's major concern is a potential extended disruption in trade. Traders worldwide are preparing for this, as the crucial Red Sea shipping route could stay closed to international shipping lines longer than initially expected, likely keeping freight rates and petroleum prices elevated. Former Indian diplomat Rajiv Dogra told VOA that if the situation got more tense, it would affect the supply chain, imports and exports, and India's interests in the region. Dogra said that big powers were trying to ensure that the situation does not deteriorate, and that India was also trying to establish peace. Journalist and author Nilofar Suhrawardy told VOA there would not be a formal war. Suhrawardy referred to U.S. President Joe Biden's statement that said that the Israeli reaction to the Iranian attack should be proportionate. She said the Iranian ballistic missile attack Tuesday on Israel was in reaction to the September 27 killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on the militant group's headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon. But if there is a full-scale war, what will be India's stand? Analysts said India would take a neutral stand. According to Suhrawardy, India has good relations with Israel, Iran, Arab countries and the Palestinians, so it will not take any party's side. She said she believed the policy India adopted in the Ukraine-Russia conflict would be applied to the Israel-Iran conflict, too. Modi has spoken to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the past two weeks. On September 23, he met Abbas in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Modi spoke to Netanyahu by phone on Monday. The Indian leader condemned terrorism and urged the release of citizens held hostage by Hamas.

Gang attacks Haitian town, killing more than 70	new york — The United Nations secretary-general joined the Haitian prime minister Friday in strongly condemning a horrific overnight gang attack on a town outside Haiti's capital that killed at least 70 people, including at least 10 women and three infants. 'The criminals responsible for these abominable acts will be hunted down and brought to justice, without respite,' Prime Minister Garry Conille said in a statement. Haiti's transition government said members of the Gran Grif gang perpetrated the attack in the town of Pont Sonde in the Artibonite department. A report in the Haiti Gazette said the gang was trying to extort money from the local population and they resisted paying it. The massacre was retribution. The U.N. human rights office said gang members firing automatic rifles also reportedly set fire to at least 45 houses and 34 vehicles, forcing a number of residents to flee. At least 3,000 people have been displaced by the attack. A number of people were also wounded, including two gang members. Sixteen people suffered serious injuries, the U.N. said. The government said many of the injured are being treated at the Saint-Nicolas public hospital in Saint-Marc. 'As gang violence continues to spread from the capital to other departments of Haiti, the secretary-general stresses the importance of the joint efforts undertaken by the Haitian National Police and the multinational security support mission,' Antonio Guterres' spokesperson told reporters Friday. 'Those efforts need to be supported.' In June, a multinational security support mission, or MSS, began its first deployment of about 400 police from Kenya, which is also leading the mission. About 100 others from Jamaica and Belize have also been deployed to assist the embattled Haitian National Police in subduing armed gangs, which have been terrorizing the country's capital and some outer lying areas. Other countries are expected to contribute police officers to the force. The mission has been beset with delays and financial and equipment shortages. But it has had some success inside the capital. The government said agents from the Haitian National Police Anti-Gang Unit have been deployed as reinforcements to support teams already on the ground in Artibonite. Specialized police units supported by the MSS are also deploying to the area. Haiti has been rocked by instability since 2021, when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated. Prime Minister Ariel Henry then led the country until he announced his resignation in March. A transitional government is now in place with the goal of organizing free and fair elections. Haiti has not held elections since 2016. The country is facing a massive humanitarian crisis due to the violence. On Monday, international food monitors said more than half the country's population — 5.4 million people — are struggling to feed themselves. At least 6,000 displaced persons in shelters in the capital are facing catastrophic levels of hunger, while 2 million people are one step behind them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gang-attacks-haitian-town-killing-more-than-70-/7810831.html	2024-10-04T12:24:54-07:00	
Exiled media fight to keep Belarusian language alive	washington — While the Belarusian government continues a long-running clampdown on use of the Belarusian language, exiled news outlets are leading the fight to keep their language — and cultural identity — alive. Although Belarusian has been the country’s official language since Belarus declared independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991, there has been an ongoing process of Russification since President Alexander Lukashenko came to power in 1994. That process has only accelerated since 2020 when Lukashenko — seen by some to be a puppet of Russian President Vladimir Putin — declared victory in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent. Since then, the Belarusian government has grown increasingly hostile toward Belarusian as the language has become more and more associated with resistance toward Lukashenko’s rule. As Minsk continues to grow closer to Moscow, Belarusian media outlets that left the country following the 2020 elections see it as their duty to help keep the Belarusian language alive through their reporting, multiple media leaders told VOA. 'It’s a strategic move to preserve the language, to preserve the culture, which is being actively attacked,' said Natalia Belikova, head of international cooperation at Press Club Belarus in Poland’s capital Warsaw. Belarusian not illegal, but unwelcome Speaking Belarusian isn’t illegal in Belarus, but the government has long made clear its preference for Russian, which has been the other official language in Belarus since 1995. Belarusian is more similar to Ukrainian than Russian. Instead of outlawing Belarusian entirely, the government has taken steps like targeting Belarusian-language newspapers and bookstores. Classes in school are more often taught in Russian, and there aren’t any universities where Belarusian is the primary language. Government officials tend to speak Russian, and government documents are often in Russian, too. 'The presence of Belarusian language is vividly vanishing,' Belikova said. '‘Upsetting’ is probably a milder word for this. It’s really devastating.' A 2019 census found that around 60% of the population consider Belarusian their native language, but only about 28% use the language at home. Still, since Belarusian isn’t banned, speaking it is one of the few remaining ways for people to safely signal their political beliefs and opposition to Lukashenko, multiple journalists said. However, multiple analysts said doing so in public is likely to draw negative attention from authorities because the language is so closely associated with the resistance. 'Formally, it’s safe. It’s OK to speak Belarusian in Belarus. But in practice, well, it’s not safe,' Pavel Sviardlou, editor-in-chief of European Radio for Belarus, told VOA from Warsaw. The Belarusian foreign ministry did not reply to VOA’s email requesting comment. As the Belarusian government works to suppress the Belarusian language in favor of Russian, leaders from prominent exiled outlets like European Radio for Belarus, Nasha Niva and Zerkalo say their outlets are prioritizing coverage in the Belarusian language. In the case of Nasha Niva, one of the oldest Belarusian newspapers, the outlet’s mission has long been to popularize the Belarusian language, culture and history, according to the newspaper’s director Nastassia Rouda. That mission has become more important since the contested 2020 election, after which hundreds of journalists fled the country to escape harassment and censorship. 'Who, if not us? This is the question,' Rouda told VOA from Lithuania. Nasha Niva’s primary language is Belarusian, but the outlet also translates everything into Russian. European Radio for Belarus operates similarly. 'This is a chance to, for example, listen to Belarusian every day, to read in Belarusian every day. And, of course, to feel that the language is not dead,' Sviardlou said. The fight to preserve the Belarusian language goes hand in hand with the more obvious role that exiled media play — ensuring people still inside Belarus can access independent news about what’s happening. 'Only media like us, who are working from exile right now, can give some truthful information about the political situation. No one inside can do this,' Nasha Niva’s Rouda said. Although Belarusian authorities block access to independent news sites, Belarusians still access them with circumvention tools like virtual private networks, or VPNs. Despite the risks and the fact that the government spent about 50 million euros ($55 million) on propaganda in 2023 alone, it’s clear that many people inside Belarus, which has a population of about 9 million, still regularly access banned news sites. The five biggest sites had over 17 million visits in December 2023, according to a 2024 JX Fund report. The news outlet Zerkalo, for instance, receives about 3 million unique visitors each month, with about 60% of them located inside Belarus, according to a 2024 Press Club Belarus report. Zerkalo is the successor outlet of Tut.by, which was the largest independent news site in Belarus until authorities shut it down in 2021. As the Belarus government grows ever closer with Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, exiled Belarusian media view their efforts as critical to maintaining a distinct Belarusian identity. The stakes are high, according to Aliaksandra Pushkina, a board member of Zerkalo. 'If we lose our culture, our language, we really will be a part of Russia,' she told VOA from Austria. While exiled outlets are prioritizing Belarusian language coverage, Belarusian propaganda outlets inside the country primarily use Russian, according to Sviardlou. 'They don’t even try to work in Belarusian because they understand that no one will listen to them,' he said. He asserted that Belarusian has taken on a different meaning, saying, 'It is a language of truth.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/exiled-media-fight-to-keep-belarusian-language-alive-/7810871.html	2024-10-04T12:19:07-07:00

2 sisters from Egypt were among those killed in Mexican army shooting	TAPACHULA, Mexico — An 11-year-old Egyptian girl and her 18-year-old sister were among those killed after Mexican army troops opened fire on a truck carrying migrants earlier this week, an official said Friday. The sisters, and four other migrants from countries including Peru and Honduras, were killed Tuesday in the southern state of Chiapas. An official in the state’s prosecutor's office confirmed the identification of the two sisters and said their father was wounded in the shooting but survived. Federal officials, including newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum, again refused Friday to confirm the ages or genders of the six migrants killed in the shooting, which occurred on Sheinbaum’s first day in office. Soldiers claimed they heard shots and returned fire, and officials have studiously avoided saying the migrants were killed by army gunfire. However, that appears to be the case, and two soldiers have been relieved of duty and turned over to civilian prosecutors for questioning. The killings placed in doubt Sheinbaum's statements over her first days in office that human rights will be at the forefront of her administration's policies. Asked about her immigration policy Friday, Sheinbaum said only that the killings were under investigation and doubled down on earlier claims that the government doesn't violate human rights. 'First of all, human rights are respected,' Sheinbaum said. 'That is very important, that is why it is called a humanistic immigration policy, because human rights are at the forefront.' Three of the dead were from Egypt, and one each from Peru and Honduras. The other has apparently not yet been identified. Ten other migrants were wounded in the shooting. but there has not been any information on their conditions. Peru’s foreign ministry confirmed one Peruvian was killed and demanded 'an urgent investigation' into the killings. Peru and Mexico have had damaged relations since a 2022 diplomatic spat. It was the worst killing of migrants by authorities in Mexico since police in the northern state of Tamaulipas killed 17 migrants in 2021. Sheinbaum has said the shootings are being investigated to see if any commanders might face punishment, and noted 'a situation like this cannot be repeated.' But she left out any mention of that Thursday at a ceremony at a Mexico City army base, where army and navy commanders pledged their loyalty to her in front of massed combat vehicles and hundreds of troops. 'In our country, there is not a state of siege, there are no violations of human rights,' Sheinbaum said, as she promised wage increases for soldiers and sailors. The shootings Tuesday occurred near the city of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala. The Defense Department initially said that soldiers claimed to have heard shots as a convoy of three trucks passed the soldiers’ position. The Attorney General’s Office later said all three trucks ignored orders to stop and tried to flee. The soldiers pursued them and reported coming under fire from the convoy and returned fire. One of the trucks eventually stopped, the driver reportedly fled, and a total of 33 migrants were found aboard, from the three countries already mentioned, as well as Nepal, Cuba, India and Pakistan. The Defense Department said four of the migrants were found dead, and 12 wounded. Two of the wounded later died of their injuries. Sheinbaum refused to say whether any weapons were found in the migrants’ truck. The area is a common route for smuggling migrants, who are often packed into crowded freight trucks. It has also been the scene of drug cartel turf battles, and the department said the trucks 'were similar to those used by criminal groups in the region.' Irineo Mujica, a migrant rights activist, said he doubted the migrants or their smugglers opened fire. 'It is really impossible that these people would have been shooting at the army,' Mujica said. 'Most of the time, they get through by paying bribes.' If the deaths were the result of army fire, as appears likely, it could prove a major embarrassment for Sheinbaum. The new president has followed the lead of former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in giving the armed forces extraordinary powers in law enforcement, state-run companies, airports, trains and construction projects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sisters-from-egypt-were-among-those-killed-in-mexican-army-shooting/7810904.html	2024-10-04T12:12:14-07:00	
Philippines condemns China attack of Vietnamese fishermen	manila, philippines — The Philippines on Friday denounced China 's alleged assault of Vietnamese fishermen in the South China Sea, where Manila and Beijing are also locked in violent confrontations that have led to fears of armed conflict. Vietnam has accused 'Chinese law enforcement forces' of beating the 10 fishermen with iron bars and robbing them Sunday of thousands of dollars' worth of fish and equipment off the Paracel Islands. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson acknowledged an incident took place there but disputed the Vietnamese version of the events. China and Vietnam both claim the Paracel Islands, but the Philippines does not. 'We strongly condemn the violent and illegal actions of Chinese maritime authorities against Vietnamese fishermen near the Paracel Islands on September 29, 2024,' Philippine National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano said in a statement. He described the 'unjustified assault' as an 'alarming act with no place in international relations.' The Philippine foreign department also issued a statement Friday saying it was aware of the 'serious incident.' 'The Philippines has consistently denounced the use of force, aggression and intimidation in the South China Sea, and emphasized the need for actors to exercise genuine self-restraint,' it said. 'It is a paramount obligation to ensure the safety at sea of vessels and their crew, especially fisherfolk.' The incident came just over three months after Chinese law enforcement personnel armed with knives, sticks and an axe attacked Filipino troops attempting to resupply a Philippine garrison on Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly archipelago. The Chinese seized guns and other equipment and damaged Philippine boats, while a Filipino sailor lost a thumb in the June 17 melee. Chinese coast guard and other vessels have in recent months also rammed, water-cannoned and blocked Philippine government vessels on several occasions around Second Thomas Shoal and Sabina Shoal in the Spratlys, as well as Scarborough Shoal in another area of the sea. Beijing claims most of the South China Sea and has for years sought to expand its presence in contested areas there, brushing aside an international ruling that its claim to most of the waterway has no legal basis. It has built artificial islands armed with missile systems and runways for fighter jets, and deployed vessels that the Philippines says harass its ships and block its fishermen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-condemns-china-attack-of-vietnamese-fishermen-/7810817.html	2024-10-04T11:03:46-07:00	
Middle East conflict sparks Chinese national pride, criticism of Israel	Washington — After Iran fired a barrage of 180 missiles at Israel on Tuesday in retaliation for the assassination of the leaders of two of its proxies and one of its senior military leaders, people in China went online, inundating social media platforms with a wide range of reactions to the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. On Weibo, a platform akin to X with added censorship, most users condemned Israel, while some voices called for a show of support in contrast with mainstream anti-Israel and anti-U.S. opinions. Chinese official government media leveraged the opportunity to promote national pride, highlighting the successful evacuation of Chinese citizens from Lebanon. Chinese officials call for peace In official statements, Chinese representatives made appeals for sovereignty and peace, with a focus on preventing Chinese citizens from being caught in the crossfire of the intensifying conflict. Responding to a question about Iran’s attack on Israel, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson simply said that China opposed the intrusion upon Lebanese sovereign rights and cited Gaza as the 'root cause of this round of turmoil in the Middle East.' The Chinese Embassy in Israel also issued a message following the bombardment, calling on Chinese citizens in Israel to take precautions and reminding Chinese citizens not to travel to Israel. 'Be prepared for various attacks involving missiles, rockets, and drones, and enter the bomb shelter as soon as the alarm sounds. Do not go out unless necessary, and avoid going to high-risk areas and sensitive locations such as the north.' Such warnings seemingly resonated with Chinese Weibo users. The search term on the Chinese social media site, '# Remind our country’s citizens to not travel to Israel for the time being' reached 33.6 million clicks and some 3,700 discussions and thread posts. For each topic with a hashtag on Weibo, the site shows the total clicks and comments. The government prioritized evacuating Chinese citizens in Lebanon. The popularity of this move was reflected online, with the phrase, '# Chinese planes flew from Lebanon amid gunfire to evacuate Chinese citizens' attracting 28.5 million clicks and more than 3,700 comments. Official news service China Daily posted a video of 146 Chinese citizens in Lebanon and five of their foreign family members walking out of the cabin of the Air China charter flight that evacuated them to Beijing. The video featured passengers waving Chinese flags as they entered the airport. One woman said, 'This war is ruthless, but our country is full of love.' Online commenters point fingers '# Israeli air base hit by Iranian missile' was another hot search topic on Weibo, which garnered 16.3 million clicks and more than 1,000 comments. Nearly 300 commenters expressed opinions on a post from Chinese Central Television reporting the news of the Iranian attack. A slim majority condemned Israel, some cracked jokes about Iran and the attack, and a small number expressed support for Israel. 'Israel is really a demon country,' said one user, while another said, 'Hit Israel hard. It will be a relief.' Striking a different tone, user 'Master Ji Xian' said, 'We firmly support Israel in eradicating all evil and eliminating terrorists.' An article posted by Sina News attracted more than 113,000 comments, which overwhelmingly condemned Israel and criticized the United States. 'Iran struck too late,' replied one user. Another wrote, 'A group of Israelis is disturbing the peace in the Middle East. Without the support of the United States, would they have such courage?' Despite the dominating anti-Israel sentiment on Weibo, some discussions on WeChat, which has relatively looser regulations on speech, show a different side of Chinese public opinion. WeChat public account 'Vision Talk' published an article titled 'Iran launches 200 missiles to attack Israel, Russia collectively shoots and kills 16 Ukrainian prisoners of war.' Many of the 150 comments on the post expressed support for Ukraine and Israel. 'Ukraine should learn from Israel and track down every last murderer,' one commenter wrote. Another user replied, 'There will be no peace in the Middle East until the Iranian villain is destroyed.'

Nobel Prizes will be announced against backdrop of wars, famine and artificial intelligence	stavanger, norway — Wars, a refugee crisis, famine and artificial intelligence could all be recognized when Nobel Prize announcements begin next week under a shroud of violence. The prize week coincides with the October 7 anniversary of the Hamas-led attacks on Israel, which began a year of bloodshed and war across the Middle East. The literature and science prizes could be immune. But the peace prize, which recognizes efforts to end conflict, will be awarded in an atmosphere of ratcheting international violence — if awarded at all. 'I look at the world and see so much conflict, hostility and confrontation, I wonder if this is the year the Nobel Peace Prize should be withheld,' said Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. As well as events roiling the Middle East, Smith cites the war in Sudan and risk of famine there, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and his institute's research showing that global military spending is increasing at its fastest pace since World War II. 'It could go to some groups which are making heroic efforts but are marginalized,' Smith said. 'But the trend is in the wrong direction. Perhaps it would be right to draw attention to that by withholding the peace prize this year.' Withholding the Nobel Peace is not new. It has been suspended 19 times in the past, including during the world wars. The last time it was not awarded was in 1972. However, Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, says withdrawal would be a mistake in 2024, saying the prize is 'arguably more important as a way to promote and recognize important work for peace.' Civil grassroot groups, and international organizations with missions to mitigate violence in the Middle East could be recognized. Nominees are kept secret for 50 years, but nominators often publicize their picks. Academics at the Free University Amsterdam said they have nominated the Middle East-based organizations EcoPeace, Women Wage Peace and Women of the Sun for peace efforts between Israelis and Palestinians. Urdal believes it's possible the committee could consider the Sudan Emergency Response Rooms, a group of grassroots initiatives providing aid to stricken Sudanese facing famine and buffeted by the country's brutal civil war. The announcements begin Monday with the physiology or medicine prize, followed on subsequent days by the physics, chemistry, literature and peace awards. The Peace Prize announcement will be made on Friday by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo, while all the others will be announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. The prize in economics will be announced the following week on October 14. New technology, possibly artificial intelligence, could be recognized in one or more of the categories. Critics of AI warn the rise of autonomous weapons shows the new technology could mean additional peace-shattering misery for many people. Yet AI has also enabled scientific breakthroughs that are tipped for recognition in other categories. David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clarivate's Institute for Scientific Information, says scientists from Google Deepmind, the AI lab, could be among those under consideration for the chemistry prize. The company's artificial intelligence, AlphaFold, 'accurately predicts the structure of proteins,' he said. It is already widely used in several fields, including medicine, where it could one day be used to develop a breakthrough drug. Pendlebury spearheads Clarivate's list of scientists whose papers are among the world's most cited, and whose work it says are ripe for Nobel recognition.

Clashes erupt in Kenya as people discuss deputy president's impeachment motion	NAIROBI, Kenya — Supporters and opponents of Kenya's deputy president clashed Friday at public forums over an impeachment motion against him, which was introduced in parliament by the ruling alliance this week. Rigathi Gachagua is accused of supporting anti-government protests in June and of being involved in corruption and other irregularities, charges he denies. A motion for the impeachment of Gachagua was proposed in parliament Tuesday and Kenyans were given until Friday to fill out public participation forms at their constituencies. Public forums are being held across the country to discuss the impeachment. In the capital, Nairobi, a public forum at the Bomas of Kenya turned violent as supporters of President William Ruto clashed with those supporting Gachagua. Chairs were thrown in the auditorium and an activist Morara Kebaso, known for exposing stalled government projects, said he had been injured. In central Kenya’s Nyeri county, police clashed with supporters of the deputy president as they chanted that there would be no president if his deputy is impeached. The two were elected on a joint ticket. In Nyandarua county, opponents were called out as being traitors and were chased out of the community hall. Some 291 legislators, more than the 117 constitutional requirement, signed the impeachment motion before it was introduced, but several of them from the deputy president’s home turf say they no longer support the motion after hearing contrary views from their constituents. 'If the deputy president is guilty, then his boss the president is equally guilty,' a female supporter told Citizen TV. Gachagua is facing impeachment on 10 grounds that include corruption, ethnic discrimination and contradicting government policies. He has maintained that he is innocent and has vowed to fight the impeachment motion. The high court Thursday declined to stop Friday’s public participation and set next Wednesday as the date for the hearing. Ruto has not weighed in on his deputy’s impeachment debate. He is on record in the earlier days of his presidency saying he would not publicly humiliate his deputy, alluding to the troubled relationship he had with his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta during their second term in office. The senate is expected to hear the impeachment motion Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-erupt-in-kenya-as-people-discuss-deputy-president-s-impeachment-motion/7810760.html	2024-10-04T10:47:38-07:00	
Collective trauma marks anniversary of Hamas attack on Israel	GENEVA — As the conflict in Gaza enters its second year, the World Health Organization is calling for an end to the 'unspeakable suffering' of civilians in Israel and the region and for health care to be protected and not attacked. The WHO says the horrific attacks by Hamas militants and other armed groups in Israel on October 7 of last year, have unleashed a chain of events that have caused tens of thousands of civilian deaths and injuries, as well as the displacement of millions of people in Israel, Gaza, the West Bank, and now in Lebanon. Dr. Michel Thieren, special WHO representative to Israel, told journalists at a briefing in Geneva Friday that for Israel, the October 7 massacres mark an event as significant and agonizing as the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United States. Ten thousand people remain buried under the rubble,' he said. 'The health system has suffered immensely from repeated attacks and an ongoing shortage of supplies, medicines, fuel, and staff.' The WHO said there have been at least 516 attacks on health care in Gaza, resulting in 765 deaths. It says only half of Gaza's hospitals are partially operational and 43% of primary health care centers are functional. It notes many essential health services are unavailable, including Gaza's only limb reconstruction center and sole psychiatric hospital. Other critical services, such as oncology and MRI services, specialized pediatric surgery and endocrinology services also are out of commission, 'At least 24,090 people are suffering from life-changing injuries due to the conflict, with no access to rehabilitation or specialized care,' the WHO's Ayadil Saparbekov said. 'We are deeply concerned about the conflict's impact on mental health in Gaza, where more than 485,000 people had already been diagnosed with mental disorders before the war.' The WHO flags malnutrition as another major concern. It said more than 20,000 children have been admitted for malnutrition treatment since January, including 4,437 for severe acute malnutrition, a condition that can lead to death if left untreated. The U.N. health agency warns communicable diseases are a significant public health threat, with cases of acute watery diarrhea and acute respiratory infections accounting for more than 80% of diseases reported during the first eight months of 2024. 'The poor water, sanitation, and hygiene situation, along with overcrowding in shelters, are the primary drivers of these diseases, Saparbekov said. 'These conditions are expected to worsen during winter, likely leading to a further rise in cases.' On a more positive note, he mentioned that preparations are underway for the second round of a polio vaccination campaign, scheduled to begin October 14 and end October 29. 'We have communicated these dates to the Israeli authorities, and we are having a meeting on Sunday to see whether this will be confirmed. We estimate that over 500,000 children between the ages of zero to 10 years will be vaccinated with the novel oral polio vaccine. 'In addition to the polio vaccinations, the children also will receive a dose of vitamin A to boost their immune system,' he said. WHO officials warn that repeated evacuation orders by Israel and ongoing hostilities continue to disrupt humanitarian operations in Gaza. As the grim one year anniversary of Hamas' terror attack on Israel nears, they are calling for 'effective deconfliction and protection of health care, safe access to health facilities, and sustained aid flow into and across Gaza' to assist the many in desperate need.	https://www.voanews.com/a/collective-trauma-marks-anniversary-of-hamas-attack-on-israel/7810793.html	2024-10-04T10:47:09-07:00	
Ukraine's Femen protest war at Iran embassy	kyiv, ukraine — Ukrainian feminist activists staged a topless protest Friday outside the Embassy of Iran, which Kyiv and the West say is arming Russia. Ukraine's Femen group is a feminist art collective that has for years staged stunts in Ukraine and abroad, with its trademark move being women appearing with their chests bare, protest slogans written across their bodies. Kyiv has branded Iran an 'accomplice' in Russia's invasion of Ukraine and regularly reports finding fragments of Iranian Shahed drones used by Moscow in attacks targeting civilian infrastructure. AFP saw two activists take their shirts off near the Iranian Embassy building in Kyiv, chanting and displaying anti-Iran and anti-Russia slogans written on their bodies. Western governments have accused Iran of supplying Moscow with both drones and missiles, which Tehran has repeatedly denied. At the U.N. last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced Russia involving authoritarian states Iran and North Korea — also widely believed to be arming Russia — in Moscow's more than two-year invasion of his country. 'Russia has no legitimate reason — none at all — for making Iran and North Korea de facto accomplices in its criminal war in Europe, with their weapons killing us, killing Ukrainians,' Zelenskyy said. Western countries have imposed sanctions on Iran's air transport links over its alleged supply of ballistic missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine. Femen, which campaigns for women's rights and against sexism and conservative Orthodoxy, originated in Ukraine but now also has branches in other countries. It has staged numerous stunts, including two of its activists lunging at Russian President Vladimir Putin on a visit to Germany in 2013 shouting 'dictator!'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-s-femen-protest-war-at-iran-embassy-/7810697.html	2024-10-04T09:45:41-07:00

US adds 254,000 jobs, unemployment dips to 4.1% in still-sturdy labor market	WASHINGTON — America’s employers added a surprisingly strong 254,000 jobs in September, the latest evidence that the U.S. labor market is still solid enough to support steady hiring and a growing economy. Last month’s hiring gain was far more than economists had expected, and it was up sharply from the 159,000 jobs that were added in August. And after rising for most of 2024, the unemployment rate dropped for a second straight month, from 4.2% in August to 4.1% in September, the Labor Department said Friday. The latest figures suggest that many companies are still confident enough to fill jobs despite the continued pressure of high interest rates. Few employers are laying off workers, though many have grown more cautious about hiring. In an encouraging sign, the Labor Department also revised up its estimate of job growth in July and August by a combined 72,000. The September job gains were fairly broad-based, a healthy trend if it continues. Restaurants and bars added 69,000 jobs. Health care companies gained 45,000, government agencies 31,000, social assistance employers 27,000 and construction companies 25,000. A category that includes professional and business services added 17,000 after having lost jobs for three straight months. Average hourly raises were solid, too. They rose by a higher-than-expected 0.4% from August, slightly less than the 0.5% gain the month before. Measured from a year earlier, hourly wages climbed 4%, up a tick from a 3.9% year-over-year gain in August. The economy’s progress in taming inflation led the Federal Reserve last month to cut its benchmark interest rate by a sizable half-point, its first rate cut in more than four years, and said further cuts were likely in the coming months. The Fed said it wanted to ease the cost of borrowing to help bolster the job market. Considering Friday’s strong jobs report, the Fed is now likely to reduce its key rate by more typical quarter-point increments. 'The September jobs report shows a nice bump in labor demand at the beginning of the fall,″ said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. 'The U.S. economy is growing solidly in 2024 even as inflation slows to near the Fed’s target.' The resilience of the economy has come as a relief. Economists had expected that the Fed’s aggressive campaign to subdue inflation — it jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 — would cause a recession. It didn’t. The economy kept growing even in the face of ever-higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Most economists say the Fed appears to have achieved the once unlikely prospect of a 'soft landing,' in which high interest rates help vanquish inflation without triggering a recession. The economy is weighing heavily on voters as the Nov. 5 presidential election nears. Many Americans are unimpressed by the job market’s durability and are still frustrated by high prices, which remain on average 19% above where they were in February 2021. That was when inflation began surging as the economy rebounded with unexpected speed and strength from the pandemic recession, causing severe shortages of goods and labor. The public’s discontent with inflation and the economy under President Joe Biden has been a political burden for Vice President Kamala Harris in her race for the White House against former President Donald Trump. The jobs report for October, which the government will issue four days before Election Day, will likely be muddied by the effects of Hurricane Helene and a strike by Boeing machinists. Across the economy, though, most indicators look solid. The U.S. economy, the world’s largest, grew at a vigorous 3% annual pace from April through June, boosted by consumer spending and business investment. A forecasting tool from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta points to slower but still healthy 2.5% annual growth in the just-ended July-September quarter. The Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, reported that America’s services businesses grew for a third straight month in September and at an unexpectedly fast pace. The economy’s service sector is closely watched because it represents more than 70% of U.S. jobs. Last month, the nation’s households increased their spending at retailers. And even with hiring having slowed, Americans are enjoying unusual job security. Layoffs are near a record low as a percentage of employment. The number of people filing for unemployment benefits also remains near historically low levels. Companies seem generally reluctant to let workers go even though some are also hesitant to expand their payrolls. That unusual dynamic may stem from many employers having been caught flat-footed and short of staff after the economy began roaring back from the pandemic recession. Posted job openings, too, have declined steadily, to 8 million in August, after having peaked at 12.2 million in March 2022. Workers have noticed the chillier environment for jobseekers. Far fewer feel confident enough to leave their jobs to seek a better position. The number of Americans who are quitting their jobs has reached its lowest level since August 2020, when the economy was still reeling from COVID.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-adds-254-000-jobs-unemployment-dips-to-4-1-in-still-sturdy-labor-market/7810508.html	2024-10-04T07:55:49-07:00

Tunisia's president faces little challenge ahead of Sunday's vote	paris — On a warm fall evening five years ago, supporters of the moderate Islamist Ennadha party packed one end of Tunis' Habib Bourguiba Boulevard, the iconic landmark of Tunisia's 2011 revolution. The other end hosted a boisterous get-out-the vote for business tycoon Nabil Karaoui — one of 26 candidates running in the North African country's 2019 presidential race. Tunisians voting Sunday will face a sharply narrower field. Out of 14 aspiring presidential candidates, the country's electoral commission — handpicked by current President Kais Saied — approved just three. The first is in prison. The second is considered close to Saied. The third is Saied himself. 'The climate today is one of repression of every form of liberty,' said Kamel Jendoubi, a former minister who headed Tunisia's first post-revolution electoral commission. 'Arrests have multiplied against the opposition. Today all the main political leaders, from the left, center and right, are in prison.' Jendoubi's remarks are echoed by a raft of opposition politicians, analysts and rights activists, even as Saied's supporters praise him for overhauling a corrupt and gridlocked system. Few dispute that after five years in office, the 66-year-old leader has dramatically reshaped Tunisia's political landscape, even as high unemployment and a struggling economy persist. With Sunday's vote seemingly stacked in the president's favor, some believe a second Saied term could consolidate a return to the country's authoritarian past. Others suggest Tunisians, notably a young, post-revolution generation, will not tolerate the loss of their fledgling democracy — especially if they judge the vote to be rigged. 'If he's elected under these circumstances, it will be a weak regime,' predicted Michael Ayari, senior Tunisia analyst for the International Crisis Group policy institute. 'And a weak regime will do spectacular things to gain legitimacy.' Cleaning up A law professor and political newcomer, Saied catapulted to power in 2019, running a one-man, shoestring campaign. His populist message of rooting out cronyism and returning power to the people resonated among an electorate fed up with years of dysfunctional governance. Thousands celebrated after Saied clinched runoff elections against businessman Karaoui, capturing 73% of the vote — a score some analysts believe he hopes to match or exceed. Tunisian taxi driver Mongi Ben Ameur voted for Saied then. He plans to vote for him again on Sunday. 'The former regime, the people in politics, they profited from the country, they profited from the people,' Ben Ameur says. 'Saied is trying to clean everything up. We won't harvest the fruits right away, but he's done things we haven't seen before.' In July 2021, Saied seized widespread powers, ultimately dissolving parliament. Over the next two years, he rewrote the country's constitution, beefing up presidential powers and reducing legislative ones. Voter turnout to approve each change was low, however, dipping to just over 11% in last year's legislative polls. 'I think he had this philosophy that he had to destroy everything to rebuild on solid foundations,' said Abdelkaddous Saadaoui, an activist and former Cabinet member, describing Saied's philosophy which he opposes. 'He's convinced he's found solutions for the people,' said Tunisian essayist Hatem Nafti, who authored a newly published book on Tunisia under Saied. 'He doesn't even realize he's a dictator.' Under Saied's presidency, authorities have detained or imprisoned dozens of opposition politicians, activists and journalists, dismissed judges and prosecutors, and weakened free expression and judicial independence. Even as Saied cracked down on corruption, analyst Ayari said, new forms have rooted and flourished. For now, Saied faces no major challengers. On Tuesday, a Tunisian court toughened a prison sentence against presidential candidate Ayachi Zammel on forgery charges, although he remains on the ballot. Separately, the elections commission rejected a top administrative court's decision authorizing three additional candidates to run. Last week, lawmakers hastily passed legislation stripping the court's authority to decide election disputes. 'He's afraid of losing,' former minister Jendoubi said of Saied. 'When Kais Saied did his coup, he was popular — people went out on the streets to applaud him. But his popularity has dropped considerably, because he's not been able to resolve people's problems.' Challenging times Internationally, Saied has moved beyond Tunisia's traditional Western alliances, reaching out to Iran, China and Russia, and rejecting foreign interference. He struck a controversial deal with the European Union to radically curb African migration to Europe, but rejected a $1.9 billion International Monetary Fund bailout, even as the country's public debt soars. Prices and joblessness are also high, and the country faces a major water crisis, which the president blames on a conspiracy. 'Mr. Saied has shown little interest in reforms: his economic policy does not go much beyond ranting about speculators and the odd anti-corruption drive (usually aimed at his political opponents),' The Economist wrote recently. 'Another five years of this all but ensures that Tunisia's economy will continue to flounder.' While some activists still take to the streets, fear has silenced others. One declined to be interviewed over safety concerns. 'We've returned to self-censorship,' another Tunisian said. 'It's true that some still dare to speak out, but no one knows when that will be deemed too much.' Still, one Tunisian businesswoman, with local government experience, does not regret Saied's tenure. 'These are challenging times, but sadly I feel we need to go through this,' she said. 'Because in the past, political parties always made agreements to get a piece of the pie instead of serving the people.' 'For the moment, populism works,' said Crisis Group analyst Ayari of Saied. 'Because each time he makes a mistake, he says 'it's not me — it's the others, it's the plotters.' But if there's a new narrative saying Kais Saied is responsible, then there will be mobilizations.'Members of Tunisia's weakened and divided opposition believe change will come, sooner or later. 'I think there will be resistance against Kais Saied if he is going to confiscate power through cheating and repression,' says Ridha Driss, a senior member of the opposition Ennahdha party. 'A peaceful political resistance will gain ground, and things won't last long for Kais Saied.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tunisia-s-president-faces-little-challenge-ahead-of-sunday-s-vote/7809412.html	2024-10-04T06:35:48-07:00	
Pakistan locks down capital, suspends cellphones to thwart opposition rally	Islamabad — Pakistan Friday imposed strict security measures in and around Islamabad to deter supporters of imprisoned former prime minister Imran Khan from marching on the country’s capital. Authorities have blocked highways and roads leading into the city with freight containers. They have suspended cellphone service and public transport, and closed schools. Police and paramilitary forces were stationed at entry and exit points, and the government temporarily banned public gatherings in Islamabad. Similar security measures were placed in the adjoining city of Rawalpindi, where Pakistan's military is headquartered. Khan has urged supporters of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party from all over the country to assemble at D-Chowk, a public square, near Parliament and the prime minister's office, to peacefully protest claimed election rigging and government efforts to introduce contentious constitutional amendments. Friday’s anti-government demonstration is the latest in a series of PTI rallies against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's coalition government in recent weeks. Khan, 71, contends that the ruling coalition has neither moral nor legal jurisdiction to amend the constitution, citing alleged election fraud as the basis for its illegitimacy. 'I want you all to reach D-Chowk today for a peaceful protest rally,' read an Urdu-language statement posted on Khan’s social media platform X on Friday. 'This war has entered a decisive phase,' he added. Police in the capital were seen rounding up several PTI activists Friday, including women, trying to make their way to the protest site. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi warned PTI supporters against storming and holding the rally in Islamabad. 'Anyone caught will not be shown any leniency, and no one should complain later,' he told a late Thursday news conference. Naqvi defended the government's response to the opposition rally, saying Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was in the capital, and preparations were underway for an October 15-16 Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting. He said Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang is scheduled to visit Islamabad before the SCO gathering, adding that the government 'can't allow any chaos' in the wake of these high-profile events, and urging Khan’s party to move the rally to a later date. Khan has been in jail since August of last year on highly contentious corruption and other criminal charges, while his party remains a target of a military-backed government crackdown. He rejects all the charges as politically motivated, and his convictions have either been quashed or suspended for lack of evidence. Despite facing challenges, PTI-backed candidates won the most seats in the general election in February, but not enough to form a government. That enabled Khan’s opponents, led by Sharif, to cobble together a ruling coalition, allegedly with the help of the powerful military. Khan, a former cricket star turned prime minister, was ousted from power in a 2022 opposition parliamentary no-confidence motion led by Sharif. The deposed Pakistani leader rejected the move as illegal and claimed the military orchestrated it, charges Sharif and army officials subsequently denied.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-locks-down-capital-suspends-cellphones-to-thwart-opposition-rally-/7810320.html	2024-10-04T05:08:30-07:00

Bosnia floods kill 14 people	Kiseljak, Bosnia and Herzegovina — Heavy rains that flooded towns and touched off landslides left at least 14 people dead in Bosnia on Friday, authorities said. Jablanica, some 70 kilometers (43 miles) southwest of Sarajevo, appeared to bear the brunt of the 24 hours of downpours, which cut it off from the outside world. Photos on local media from the Jablanica region showed mudslides coming up to roofs of houses and a mosque with only its minaret sticking out. 'For now, the bodies of 14 people have been found' in the region of Jablanica, spokesman Darko Jukan told AFP, adding that the toll was likely to rise. Jablanica 'cannot be entered or exited at the moment', a mountain rescue service said of the town of around 4,000 people. A number of people from the area were reported missing, the authorities said while some injured were evacuated with a helicopter from the European Union peacekeeping force (EUFOR). At mid-Friday the situation was the most critical in the village of Donja Jablanica that remained cut off, the spokesman said. Several roads and bridges in the region collapsed, he said. In Kiseljak, some 20 kilometers west of Sarajevo, houses, gardens and cars were under water, an AFP journalist reported. A large part of Bosnia's population is at risk due to heavy floods and landslides, the federal civil protection administration said in a statement. Firefighters, police and utility companies were working in the affected areas, but more help is needed to mitigate the consequences of storms and rainfall, the federal civil protection administration warned. Prime Minister of Bosnia's Muslim-Croat half Nermin Niksic wrote on social media platform X that the situation was 'very serious as many citizens are still trapped in their houses. In neighboring Croatia, weather authorities issued a warning for the northern Adriatic coast, Istria peninsula and central part of the country due to the heavy rains. In a statement, it said that urban flooding and interruption of traffic, communications, electricity and water supply were expected. Scientist warn that climate change worsens the impact of extreme weather events. Torrential rains and strong winds have led to widespread flooding in central and eastern Europe last month, killing at least 24 people and devastating towns and villages.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bosnia-floods-kill-14-people-/7810269.html	2024-10-04T04:34:55-07:00	
EU executive to adopt tariffs on Chinese EVs after vote	BRUSSELS — The European Commission said on Friday it had received enough support from E.U. members to impose tariffs of up to 45% on Chinese electric vehicle imports in the bloc's highest profile trade case, but would continue to negotiate with Beijing. The Commission, which oversees the bloc's trade policy, has proposed final duties on Chinese-built EVs for the next five years to counter what it sees as unfair Chinese subsidies after a year-long anti-subsidy investigation. In a vote on Friday, 10 E.U. members backed tariffs and five voted against, with 12 abstentions, E.U. sources said. It would have taken opposition from a qualified majority of 15 E.U. members, representing 65% of the E.U. population, to block the proposal. Reuters reported on Wednesday that the measure was likely to pass with France, Italy and Poland planning to vote in favor. The E.U. executive said it had obtained 'the necessary support' to adopt the tariffs, although it would continue talks with Beijing to find an alternative solution. The region's biggest economy and major car producer, Germany, voted against the proposal, sources said on Friday. BMW Chief Executive Oliver Zipse described the vote as 'a fatal signal for the European automotive industry'. He said a quick settlement was needed between Brussels and Beijing to prevent a trade conflict. Volkswagen said the planned tariffs were 'the wrong approach.' China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Stellantis said it supported free and fair competition and that the sector was under pressure from ambitious carbon reduction plans and 'the Chinese global commercial offensive.' Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that the E.U. was headed for an 'economic cold war' with China. The E.U.'s stance towards Beijing has hardened in the last five years. It views China as a potential partner in some issues, but also as a competitor and a systemic rival. In moves seen as a retaliation, Beijing this year launched its own probes into imports of E.U. brandy, dairy and pork products. The Commission says China's spare production capacity of three million EVs per year, which needed to be exported, is twice the size of the E.U. market. Given 100% tariffs in the United States and Canada, the most obvious outlet for those EVs is Europe. The E.U. executive has said it is willing to continue negotiating an alternative to tariffs with China and could re-examine a price undertaking — involving a minimum import price and typically a volume cap — having previously rejected those offered by Chinese companies. The tariffs range from 7.8% for Tesla TSLA.O to 35.3% for SAIC 600104.SS and other companies deemed not to have cooperated with the E.U. investigation. These tariffs are on top of the EU's standard 10% import duty for cars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-executive-to-adopt-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-after-vote-/7810243.html	2024-10-04T04:04:46-07:00	
Sudan's war to intensify as rainy season draws to a close	DUBAI — After almost 18 months of war, fighting in Sudan is escalating as seasonal rains end with the army using intensified airstrikes and allied fighters to shore up its position ahead of a likely surge by the rival Rapid Support Forces (RSF). An uptick in fighting will aggravate an already dire humanitarian crisis in which famine has been confirmed and over 10 million people — one fifth of the population — are displaced, more than anywhere else in the world. U.N. agencies have often been unable to deliver aid. 'There won't be a decisive breakthrough,' a senior Western diplomat in the region, speaking on condition of anonymity due to political sensitivities, told Reuters. 'What we expect to come into the fall more and more is much more fragmentation, to see more armed groups getting involved ... And this will make the situation in general much more difficult.' The paramilitary RSF has had the upper hand during much of the conflict but last week the army, after shunning U.S.-led talks in Switzerland, launched its biggest offensive yet in the capital Khartoum, advancing across a key bridge over the Nile. In Darfur, former rebel groups and volunteers from displacement camps have rallied to defend the densely populated city of al-Fashir, the army's last holdout in the western region, against waves of RSF attacks. Two army sources said the army had worked for months to replenish weaponry including drones and warplanes, as well as training up new volunteers, to strengthen its position on the ground before any negotiations. Three residents in the capital, which is made up of Khartoum and its adjoining cities of Omdurman and Bahri, said that in recent days the army had been carrying out more air bombardments with a larger number of drones and fighter jets than before. While the army has used its superior air power at the end of the rainy season to pound RSF-held territory in the capital, Darfur and El Gezira state, the RSF's more effective ground troops are expected to regain an edge as the dry season starts and roads become more passable. The RSF released a video on Monday with its fighters promising a 'hot winter' for its rivals in Sennar, where its progress had earlier been slowed by the rains. Witnesses there as well as in the capital reported heavy fighting on Thursday. Both sides have reinforced militarily as the conflict in Africa's third largest country by land area has deepened, drawing on material support from foreign backers, diplomats and analysts say. Battle in the capital The war began in April 2023 as the army and the RSF jostled to protect their power and wealth ahead of a planned political transition towards civilian rule and free elections. The RSF, which has its roots in the so-called Janjaweed militias that helped the government crush a rebellion by non-Arab groups in Darfur in the early 2000s, quickly occupied much of the capital before consolidating its grip on Darfur and seizing El Gezira state, south of Khartoum. Earlier this year, the army gained ground in Omdurman after acquiring Iranian drones. But it showed little sign of building on the advance before the surprise offensive it began last week on the day that its commander, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, told the United Nations that the RSF had to withdraw and lay down its arms for there to be peace. The army now has control of the capital's Halfaya bridge, allowing it to build a foothold in Bahri from its bases in Omdurman. It has also weathered heavy clashes and sniper fire to advance across another Nile bridge that leads to the heart of the capital, military sources and witnesses said. Disease and starvation For months the RSF has besieged al-Fashir, which is crammed with some 1.8 million residents and displaced people. Activists and diplomats have warned of ethnically-charged bloodletting if the city falls, after similar violence that was blamed on the RSF and its allies elsewhere in Darfur. Two witnesses in al-Fashir told Reuters that the RSF had been shelling large areas of the city as the army responded with air strikes. The battle has dragged on as non-Arab former rebel groups and volunteers from displacement camps who are better equipped for ground combat than the army fight to protect themselves and their families, the witnesses said. A local group representing displaced people in Darfur said this week that the fighting had exacerbated the humanitarian situation in two dozen camps across the Darfur region, 'all of which suffer from a lack of the most basic daily necessities', and that disease and starvation were spreading. Aid workers and human rights activists say there has been little increase in humanitarian relief, despite pledges by both sides to improve access for aid. Sudan, often overlooked amid armed conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza and elsewhere, received some diplomatic attention at the U.N. General Assembly last week. But USAID Deputy Administrator Isobel Coleman told Reuters there had been little progress getting outside players to stop fueling the war. 'Both of the actors in this conflict, both sides of this, have outside support which they believe is going to tip the scales to their advantage,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-s-war-to-intensify-as-rainy-season-draws-to-a-close-/7810231.html	2024-10-04T03:35:55-07:00	
Ukraine says Russia attacked its critical infrastructure with 19 drones	KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian air force said on Friday that Russia attacked critical infrastructure in the country with 19 drones overnight. Air defenses shot down nine drones, with seven more likely impacted by electronic jamming, it said in a statement, without saying what happened to the other three. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said an apartment building was damaged in the capital but reported no casualties. The fire was promptly extinguished there, he added. The attack also damaged a business administrative building in the central region of Kirovohrad, causing light injuries to one of the employees, governor Andriy Raykovych said. Russian forces also hit critical infrastructure, utility facilities and 35 private residences in the past day in the southern Kherson region, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Various attacks there killed one and injured four more, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-russia-attacked-its-critical-infrastructure-with-19-drones/7810176.html	2024-10-04T02:17:26-07:00	
Nuclear stalemate sparks debate over information campaign aimed at North Korea	Washington — As a nuclear standoff between the United States and North Korea continues with no diplomatic off-ramp in sight, some experts in Washington say an information campaign aimed at pressing North Korea should be considered as an alternative strategy, while others caution against such an approach. The discussion comes as the North escalates tensions while the U.N. Security Council remains split over how to respond to Pyongyang's increasing threats. Kim Song, North Korea's U.N. ambassador, told the U.N. General Assembly on Monday his country will resolutely hold onto its nuclear weapons, saying 'we will never bargain,' regardless of who gets elected as the next U.S. president in November. Last month, North Korea's state media outlets released photos showing leader Kim Jong Un visiting what they claimed to be a uranium enrichment facility, another move against international calls to resume talks on denuclearization. It was the first time it had disclosed a uranium enrichment facility publicly. Nuclear standoff Talks between the U.S. and North Korea have been stalled since October 2019. Moreover, Russia, one of five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council with veto power, has blocked U.N. action against the North since February 2022, when it invaded Ukraine. Moscow has deepened military ties with Pyongyang since it started the war. Russia has imported dozens of ballistic missiles and more than 18,000 containers of munitions and munitions-related materiel from North Korea since its invasion of Ukraine, Robert Wood, deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said at a U.N. Security Council meeting in September. Some experts suggest Washington consider launching an information campaign against Pyongyang, separate from the work of Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, U.S. government-funded broadcasters. The two networks reach people inside North Korea through their Korean language broadcasts. David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, said Washington policymakers have long neglected an information campaign aimed at North Korea as a viable strategy for pressing Pyongyang to change its provocative behavior. 'We really haven't had an overall information strategy that cuts across everything that is happening,' Maxwell told VOA Korean on Tuesday in an interview. Maxwell, a former U.S. Special Forces colonel who served on the Combined Forces Command of the U.S and South Korea, said information is a threat to Pyongyang and could possibly drive the North Korean leader to the negotiating table. The U.S. should respond to every North Korean provocation by actively informing North Korean people of their dire human rights situations, Maxwell argued. 'If North Korea conducts a missile test, the response should not just stop at condemning the act,' he said. 'Kim's deliberate decision to prioritize nuclear weapons and missiles is what is causing the suffering of the Korean people in the North. That should be a routine message that we should be sending in response to every action by North Korea.' Targeted information campaign Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation, said information could be part of the targeted efforts to put pressure on the Kim regime. 'We could tell Kim Jong Un, look, we know you're preparing to do a seventh nuclear weapon test. If you do that, we will send a million USB drives into the Pyongyang area with K-Pop, K-dramas and messages to your senior leaders,' he told VOA Korean by phone on Tuesday. Bennett stressed it is time that the U.S. government renews its understanding that information can be a powerful tool. 'You go back to World War II, we viewed information as being very powerful,' he said. 'But we've lost sight of that.' Bennett added that the U.S. government should mobilize its experts in psychological operations to put together an effective campaign plan. Some are cautious about using information tactics against North Korea. Robert Rapson, who served as chargé d'affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA Korean on Wednesday via email that an information campaign may complement sanctions and effective diplomacy, but risks could follow. 'Turning the volume and intensity of the information campaign way up, as some are now advocating, runs the clear risk of escalating tensions across the demilitarized zone in ways that threaten peace and stability, to include the distinct possibility of war,' Rapson said. 'The regime would undoubtedly see a high intensity information campaign as a major provocation of existential dimensions and would respond accordingly.' Rapson also said significant qualitative improvements are needed in dissemination technology as well as message focus and content, for an enhanced information campaign to have any chance of success, however long-term that might be. Potential risks Joseph DeTrani, who served as the special envoy for six-party denuclearization talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006, said implementing such an approach would prove challenging but is 'doable.' 'The North Korean regime fears exposing its people to the reality of the outside world — the real situation in South Korea and other countries as compared to the dire economic and health care situation in North Korea,' DeTrani told VOA Korean on Wednesday via email. 'Mindful of this, inserting truthful information into North Korea must be done with care, given the harsh treatment by the regime to those who dare to listen or read foreign broadcasts, videos, newspapers, etc.' Meanwhile, Maxwell said the end goal of the information strategy should be to empower the North Korean people with information. 'Only through information can the people be empowered to create conditions where new emerging leadership can come to power,' he said. 'So that, they change the direction of North Korea and ultimately, their leaders.' The U.S. State Department has stressed the need for an effort to facilitate the flow of independent information into North Korea when asked whether the U.S. should consider using information as a pressure tool against the North. 'An informed citizenry, with unfettered access to information, is critical for responsive governance and contributes to regional peace, security, and prosperity,' a State Department spokesperson said in an emailed response on Thursday to a VOA Korean inquiry. 'The United States will continue to coordinate with like-minded governments to cooperate on areas such as access to information and advancing accountability for those responsible for human rights violations and abuses in the DPRK.' DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nuclear-stalemate-sparks-debate-over-information-campaign-aimed-at-north-korea/7810170.html	2024-10-04T01:59:23-07:00	
Analysts: Japan's new prime minister may seek nuclear consulting body with US	Washington — Japan's new prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, who began his term this week, may advocate for forming a nuclear body with the United States that is similar to an arrangement between the U.S. and South Korea aimed at planning for nuclear warfare contingencies. 'The U.S.-ROK [Republic of Korea, or South Korea] approach is probably a good example of where the U.S. and Japan might go in the future if nuclear threats keep increasing,' said James Schoff, a senior director of the U.S.-Japan NEXT Alliance Initiative at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA. 'It's not about nuclear sharing or Japan building its own nuclear forces — both politically impossible at the moment and not necessary — but [about] the alliance taking more practical steps to be prepared for U.S. nuclear retaliation, if it becomes necessary,' Schoff said. He said creating such a body would demonstrate resolve, credibility and readiness to any potential adversary and thus deter nuclear use in the first place. Nuclear talk body The new body would resemble the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) that South Korea and the United States established as part of the Washington Declaration in April 2023. The Washington-Seoul nuclear body is aimed at planning for potential nuclear contingencies caused by North Korea. A U.S.-Japan nuclear consultative body would focus on nuclear threats from China and Russia in addition to North Korea, analysts say. In a joint statement issued at their Security Consultative Committee meeting in July, Tokyo and Washington shared concerns over China's 'rapid expansion of its nuclear weapons arsenal' and agreed to strengthen deterrence through their ongoing Extended Deterrence Dialogue. 'Ishiba is likely to continue the strategies of [his predecessor Fumio] Kishida against China, and may in fact try to be bolder,' said Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Indo-Pacific Security Initiative and an associate professor at Tokyo International University. Countering China Though he is not entirely anti-China, Ishiba, a former defense minister who analysts say tends to view foreign relations through a security framework, is expected to be tough on China's military assertions. 'Prime Minister Ishiba has spoken openly about the serious security challenges China poses to Japan,' said Ken Weinstein, the Japan chair at Hudson Institute. 'These challenges lie behind his desire for an Asian NATO and nuclear sharing, neither of which is likely to be policy,' Weinstein continued. 'Instead, we are likely to see a change in tone towards the PRC with a tougher line from the Kantei on Chinese provocations than we saw from the more establishmentarian Kishida government.' The People's Republic of China (PRC) is the official name of China, and the Kantei refers to the Japanese prime minister's office. Before Ishiba was elected, he wrote an article published in September by the Hudson Institute, an American conservative non-profit think tank based in Washington D.C., advocating for an Asian version of NATO that would consider sharing U.S. nuclear weapons or introducing nuclear weapons in the region. He said if nuclear threats by China and North Korea escalate in the region, 'the U.S. extended deterrence in the region will no longer function.' Extended deterrence involves a U.S. commitment to use all military assets, including nuclear weapons, to defend the region. Such a commitment would deter potential adversaries from causing any conflict. But in recent years, there has been growing skepticism among U.S. allies over its extended deterrence commitment, leading South Korea to call for its own nuclear weapons. In January 2023, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said South Korea may have to consider developing its own nuclear weapons or ask the U.S. to redeploy nuclear weapons in South Korea. Yoon later retracted his statement after the NCG was created in April 2023, saying that South Korea will instead focus on enhancing deterrence with the United States to deal with North Korea's nuclear threat. Asian NATO Ishiba's call for a collective security arrangement like an Asian NATO and nuclear deployment and sharing options stems from uncertainty in relying 'solely on the security alliance with the U.S.,' said Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in international policy focusing on Japanese foreign policy at Stanford University. Ishiba sees 'the need to protect Taiwan from Chinese attempts to forcefully reunify' the self-governed island that Beijing considers its own territory. He also wants Japan 'to be prepared for any eventualities, including the retreat of the United States from global leadership,' amid concerns over U.S. foreign policy after the presidential election in November, Sneider said. Before Japan's own election this month, Ishiba, as a member of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, visited Taiwan in August and told Taiwan President Lai Ching-te that enhanced deterrence was necessary to resist China's aggression in the Taiwan Strait. The Sasakawa Peace Foundation's Schoff said Ishiba probably knows that a true Asian NATO is not feasible, but 'he is sending a signal to China and Russia that their aggressive use of military forces harassing other countries and penetrating their sovereign space is being noticed and will push Asian countries closer together in collective defense if they keep it up.' Japan accused a Chinese spy plane of violating its airspace for the first time in August. Matthew Brummer, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo, said instead of calling for an Asian NATO, Japan will likely increase cooperation with NATO countries, deepening security agreements, especially regarding joint technology sharing and production.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-japan-s-new-prime-minister-may-seek-nuclear-consulting-body-with-us-/7810159.html	2024-10-04T01:23:42-07:00	
Dozens of zoo tigers die after contracting bird flu in southern Vietnam	HANOI, Vietnam — More than a dozen tigers were incinerated after the animals died after contracted bird flu at a zoo in southern Vietnam, officials said. State media VNExpress cited a caretaker at Vuon Xoai zoo in Bien Hoa city saying the animals were fed raw chicken bought from nearby farms. The panther and 20 tigers, including several cubs, weighed between 10 and 120 kilograms when they died. The bodies were incinerated and buried on the premises. 'The tigers died so fast. They looked weak, refused to eat and died after two days of falling sick,' said zoo manager Nguyen Ba Phuc. Samples taken from the tigers tested positive for H5N1, the virus that causes bird flu. The virus was first identified in 1959 and grew into a widespread and highly lethal menace to migratory birds and domesticated poultry. It has since evolved, and in recent years H5N1 was detected in a growing number of animals ranging from dogs and cats to sea lions and polar bears. In cats, scientists have found the virus attacking the brain, damaging and clotting blood vessels and causing seizures and death. More than 20 other tigers were isolated for monitoring. The zoo houses some 3,000 other animals including lions, bears, rhinos, hippos and giraffes. The 30 staff members who were taking care of the tigers tested negative for bird flu and were in normal health condition, VNExpress reported. Another outbreak also occurred at a zoo in nearby Long An province, where 27 tigers and three lions died within a week in September, the newspaper said. Unusual flu strains that come from animals are occasionally found in people. Health officials in the United States said Thursday that two dairy workers in California were infected — making 16 total cases detected in the country in 2024. 'The deaths of 47 tigers, three lions, and a panther at My Quynh Safari and Vuon Xoai Zoo amid Vietnam's bird flu outbreak are tragic and highlight the risks of keeping wild animals in captivity,' PETA Senior Vice President Jason Baker said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. 'The exploitation of wild animals also puts global human health at risk by increasing the likelihood of another pandemic,' Baker said. Bird flu has caused hundreds of deaths around the world, the vast majority of them involving direct contact between people and infected birds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-of-zoo-tigers-die-after-contracting-bird-flu-in-southern-vietnam/7810149.html	2024-10-04T00:52:12-07:00	
Israeli airstrikes rock southern suburbs of Beirut, cut off a key crossing into Syria	BEIRUT — Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates. Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the group's key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah. The blasts overnight rocked Beirut's southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday. The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It gave no other details. The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Lebanon's Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing. Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces. Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous. It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between September 23 — when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon — and September 30. There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon's minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanon's southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on October 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service. The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there. Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence. Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their October 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since September 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-airstrikes-rock-southern-suburbs-of-beirut-cut-off-a-key-crossing-into-syria-/7810144.html	2024-10-04T00:33:46-07:00	
Work and travel resume across Taiwan after Typhoon Krathon dissipates	KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan — Work, classes and flights resumed across Taiwan on Friday after Typhoon Krathon brought torrential rainfall to the island but finally dissipated over a mountain range. A heavy rain advisory remained in place for the northern coast and mountainous areas, where two landslides occurred early Friday. Krathon had brought much of the island to a standstill for three days but weakened to a tropical depression early Friday. Its center moved back over the sea after making a 'U-turn' across the island's southwestern tip overnight. Schools and businesses reopened with the exception of the city of Kaohsiung, Pingtung County, and some parts of Hualien County and New Taipei. Domestic flights, which had been grounded for two days, resumed. Krathon lashed Kaohsiung with winds up to 126 kph and higher gusts. It felled trees and flooded roads. Heavy rains and flooding also occurred along Taiwan's southern and eastern coasts. Mountainous Taitung County saw 171 centimeters of rain over six days. Two people died earlier in the week and one person remained missing, according to Taiwan's fire department. The missing person was swept off a bridge. Authorities had expected Krathon to bring devastation comparable to a major typhoon that swept Kaohsiung in 1977, causing 37 deaths. But it lost steam shortly after making landfall in Kaohsiung and reaching the mountains northeast of the city, according to the Central Weather Administration. Krathon was one of only two typhoons in recent history to 'die' over Taiwan, beside Typhoon Trami, in 2001, the weather agency said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/work-and-travel-resume-across-taiwan-after-typhoon-krathon-dissipates-/7810132.html	2024-10-03T23:22:37-07:00	
North Korea's Kim threatens to destroy South Korea with nuclear strikes if provoked	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to use nuclear weapons and destroy South Korea permanently if provoked, state media reported Friday, after the South's leader warned that Kim's regime would collapse if he attempted to use nuclear arms. The exchange of such rhetoric between the rival Koreas is nothing new, but the latest comments come during heightened animosities over the North's recent disclosure of a nuclear facility and its continuation of missile tests. Next week, observers say North Korea's rubber-stamp parliament is expected to constitutionally declare a hostile 'two-state' system on the Korean Peninsula to formally reject reconciliation with South Korea and codify new national borders. During a visit to a special operation forces unit on Wednesday, Kim said his military 'would use without hesitation all the offensive forces it possesses, including nuclear weapons,' if South Korea attempts to use armed forces encroaching upon the sovereignty of North Korea, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency. 'If such a situation comes, the permanent existence of Seoul and the Republic of Korea would be impossible,' Kim said, using South Korea's official name. Kim's statement was a response to South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's speech at his country's Armed Forces Day on Tuesday. Unveiling South Korea's most powerful Hyunmoo-5 ballistic missile and other conventional weapons that could target North Korea, Yoon said the day that North Korea tries to use nuclear weapons would be the end of the Kim government because Kim would face 'the resolute and overwhelming response' of the South Korean-U.S. alliance. Kim responded that Yoon's address fully betrayed his 'bellicose temerity' and showed 'the security uneasiness and irritating psychology of the puppet forces.' In a derisive comment, Kim called Yoon 'an abnormal man,' saying that 'the puppet Yoon bragged about an overwhelming counteraction of military muscle at the doorstep of a state that possesses nuclear weapons.' On Thursday, Kim's sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, also ridiculed South Korea's showcasing of the Hyunmoo-5 missile, saying there there's no way for South Korea to counter the North Korea's nuclear forces with conventional weapons. Since adopting an escalatory nuclear doctrine in 2022, Kim has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons preemptively. But many foreign experts say it's still unlikely that he would use his nuclear arms first because his military is outmatched by the U.S. and its allied forces. In July, South Korea and the U.S. signed a defense guideline on integrating South Korea's conventional capabilities with the U.S. nuclear forces to better deal with North Korea's advancing nuclear program. South Korea has no nuclear weapons. Animosities between the Koreas are at the worst point in years with Kim's provocative run of missile tests and the South Korean-U.S. military exercises intensifying in a cycle of tit-for-tat. All communication channels and exchange programs between the rivals remain stalled since 2019, when a broader U.S.-North Korea diplomacy on ending the North's nuclear program collapsed. In January, Kim called for rewriting North Korea's constitution to eliminate the idea of a peaceful unification between the war-divided countries and to cement the South as an 'invariable principal enemy.' He also reiterated that his country does not recognize the Northern Limit Line, a western sea boundary that was drawn by the U.S.-led U.N. Command at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. He called for the new constitution to include a clear definition of the North's territories. North Korea has traditionally insisted upon a boundary that encroaches deeply into waters currently controlled by South Korea. On Friday, South Korea's military said North Korea was again flying balloons likely carrying trash across the border into South Korea. Since late May, North Korea has launched thousands of rubbish-carrying balloons toward South Korea, prompting South Korea to resume anti-Pyongyang propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts at border areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-threatens-to-destroy-south-korea-with-nuclear-strikes-if-provoked/7810110.html	2024-10-03T21:43:46-07:00	
Year-old Gaza conflict takes toll on neighboring Egypt	Cairo — The war unleashed by Israel after the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, has ravaged not only the people of Gaza but also taken a toll on neighboring Egypt, keeping its government officials busy and straining its economy -- while also bringing some benefits. The conflict has spawned countless hours of diplomatic activity and a long list of visits by envoys from several countries. Mediation efforts have been unsuccessful, but the conflict has kept diplomats busy, with meetings of the Cairo-based Arab League and consultations involving Egypt, Qatar and the U.S., among others. Said Sadek, professor of peace studies and human rights at the Egypt-Japan University in Alexandria, told VOA Egypt has been one of the key players in mediation efforts between Israel and Hamas. He said its efforts have been successful at times and unsuccessful at others. 'Politically (the conflict) highlighted the Egyptian role in being a moderating force in the Middle East,' he said. 'In all the negotiations that took place later on between Hamas and Israel, they always needed a mediator, and it was Egypt and Qatar and the United States. And they all played a role in that and sometimes they succeeded and sometimes they failed.' The head of Egyptian intelligence, Abbas Kamel, spent many hours mediating between Israel and Hamas, as has U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Qatar's foreign minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al Thani. Economically, the Gaza conflict has caused serious damage to the Egyptian economy, but it has also brought benefits, as Washington-based Middle East analyst Paul Sullivan pointed out. 'Egypt is being squeezed between many rocks and many hard places, with a few positive bits of light,' he said. 'Those positive bits include money flows from the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council), the IMF (International Monetary Fund), the World Bank and others, to make sure that Egypt gets a bit more stabilized economically.' Sadek and Sullivan both agree the Egyptian economy suffered setbacks from the side effects of the Gaza conflict, including a massive drop in revenue from the Suez Canal, one of the Egyptian government's primary sources of income. 'The (Houthis) in Yemen blocked safe navigation across the Red Sea and that affected the Suez Canal that used to bring Egypt about $10 billion dollars,' said Sadek. 'Now we are getting only $3 billion, so there is a big loss of 70%.' Sullivan said Egypt is not only suffering from a loss of revenue from the Suez Canal due to ships going around the Horn of Africa to get to their destinations, but it is also in danger of a natural gas shortage 'if Israel were to cut off its gas exports to Egypt.' That would force the Egyptian government to import natural gas at considerably higher prices. Egyptians are already reeling. The government has raised the prices of petroleum and natural gas twice this year by as much as 15% each time. Egypt's overall inflation rate has hit 25%, with analysts blaming the jump largely on the war in Gaza. Tourism revenues are also down due to the Gaza conflict and some Western countries have warned their citizens not to travel to Egypt or other Middle Eastern countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/year-old-gaza-conflict-takes-toll-on-neighboring-egypt/7810073.html	2024-10-03T21:05:00-07:00	
Mixed verdict for 3 Memphis officers convicted in man’s fatal beating	MEMPHIS, Tennessee — Three former Memphis police officers were convicted Thursday in the 2023 fatal beating of Tyre Nichols, but were acquitted of the harshest charges they faced for a death that sparked national protests and calls for broad changes in policing. Jurors deliberated for about six hours before coming back with the mixed verdict for Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith. All were convicted of witness tampering related to the cover-up of the beating, but Bean and Smith were acquitted of civil rights charges. Haley was acquitted of violating Nichols' civil rights causing death, but convicted of the lesser charge of violating his civil rights causing bodily injury. He was also convicted of a conspiracy to witness tamper charge that the others were acquitted of. The court remained silent as the verdicts were read. The judge ordered all three officers to be taken into custody. He planned to hold a hearing Monday to hear from the defense lawyers about releasing them pending sentencing. The witness tampering charges carry possible sentences of up to 20 years in prison. The civil rights charge against Haley carries up to 10 years in prison. They had faced up to life in prison if convicted on the harshest charges. The verdict marked a partial setback for prosecutors who were unable to land a conviction for civil rights violations for two officers who played an active role in the encounter. Jurors repeatedly watched graphic clips from police video that showed the officers punch and kick Nichols and hit him with a police baton just steps from his home, as the 29-year-old called out for his mother. In a statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who oversees the Justice Department's civil rights division, said 'Tyre Nichols should be alive today.' 'We hope this prosecution provides some measure of comfort as the law enforcement officers tied to his death have been held accountable,' Clarke said. Bean and Smith were seen on video wrestling with Nichols and holding his arms, while also hitting him, but the jury was not convinced those actions amounted to civil rights violations. An FBI agent said Smith told him he punched Nichols, but defense lawyers argued Bean and Smith were merely slapping Nichols' hands away as they tried to put handcuffs on him. Rodney Wells, Nichols' stepfather, told The Associated Press outside the courtroom: 'A win is a win. They're all going to jail.' Five officers were charged in Nichols' death, but two pleaded guilty and testified against members of their old crime suppression unit. Prosecutors argued that Nichols was beaten for running from a traffic stop, saying it was part of a common police practice referred to in officer slang as a 'street tax' or 'run tax. ' They said the officers lied — to a supervisor, to medical professionals attending to Nichols and in required written reports — about the extent of the force they used. 'This has been a long journey for our family,' RowVaughn Wells, Nichols' mother, told reporters. 'I'm actually in shock right now because I still can't believe all the stuff that's going on. But we're happy that they all have been convicted and they have been arrested.' Smith's lawyer declined to comment. Attorneys for Bean and Haley did not respond to requests for comment. Nichols, who was Black, ran from the traffic stop despite being hit with pepper spray and a Taser. The five officers, who were fired after the beating, also are Black. Some of the most emotional testimony at trial came from one of the officers, Desmond Mills, who took a plea deal in which prosecutors call for up to 15 years in prison. He testified in tears that he was sorry, that he left Nichols' young son fatherless and that he wishes he stopped the punches. Later, he testified that he went along with a cover-up in hopes that Nichols would survive and the whole thing would 'blow over.' Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating. His son is now 7 years old. The other officer who reached a deal with prosecutors, Emmitt Martin, testified that Nichols was 'helpless' while officers pummeled him, and that afterward the officers understood 'they weren't going to tell on me, and I wasn't going to tell on them.' Under his plea agreement, prosecutors will suggest a prison sentence of up to 40 years. Defense attorneys sought to portray Martin as a principal aggressor. Martin testified Nichols was not a threat, yet he acknowledged punching and kicking Nichols in the head. Mills' lawyer declined to comment. Martin's attorney did not immediately respond to a phone message. The police video shows the officers milling about and talking as Nichols struggles with his injuries. An autopsy report shows he died from blows to the head. The report describes brain injuries, and cuts and bruises on his head and other areas. With the federal criminal trial complete, other investigations and court action still aren't settled. The five officers also have been charged with second-degree murder in state court, where they pleaded not guilty, although Mills and Martin are expected to change their pleas. A trial date in state court has not been set. The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a 'patterns and practices' investigation into how Memphis officers use force and conduct arrests, and whether the department in the majority-Black city engages in racially discriminatory policing. The Justice Department also has a separate review concerning use of force, de-escalation strategies and specialized units within Memphis police. Pastor Earle Fisher, a Memphis activist who has long called for investigations of the city's police, said he hopes the probes 'provide for us the remedies we so rightly deserve.' Additionally, Nichols' mother filed a $550 million lawsuit against the city and its police chief. Ben Crump and Anthony Romanucci, lawyers for Nichols' family, said the verdicts 'bring a measure of accountability for his senseless and tragic death.' 'Our fight for justice for Tyre is far from over,' the lawyers said in a joint statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mixed-verdict-for-3-memphis-officers-convicted-in-man-s-fatal-beating/7810093.html	2024-10-03T20:33:19-07:00	
Grace period for US student loan payments is over. Here's what you need to know	NEW YORK — The 12-month grace period for student loan borrowers ended on September 30. The 'on-ramp' period helped borrowers who are struggling to make payments avoid the risk of defaulting and hurting their credit score. 'The end of the on-ramp period means the beginning of the potentially harsh consequences for student loan borrowers who are not able to make payments,' said Persis Yu, Deputy Executive Director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Around 43 million Americans have student loan debt, amounting to $1.5 trillion. Around eight million of those borrowers had enrolled in the SAVE plan, the newest income-driven repayment plan that extended the eligibility for borrowers to have affordable monthly student loan payments. However, this plan is currently on hold due to legal challenges. With the on-ramp period and a separate program known as Fresh Start ending and the SAVE plan on hold, student loan borrowers who are struggling to afford their monthly payments have fewer options, added Yu. Student loan borrowers who haven't been able to afford their monthly payments must consider their options to avoid going into default. If you have student loans, here's what you need to know. What was the on-ramp period? The Education Department implemented this grace period to ease the borrower's transition to make payments after a three-year payment pause during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this year-long period, borrowers were encouraged to keep making payments since interest continued to accumulate. 'Normally, loans will default if you fall about nine months behind on making payments, but during this on-ramp period, missed payments would not move people towards defaulting and then being subject to forced collections. However, if you missed payments, you still be falling behind ultimately on repaying your loans,' said Abby Shaforth, director of National Consumer Law Center's Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project. Since this grace period has ended, student loan borrowers who don't make payments will go delinquent or, if their loans are not paid for nine months, go into default. Borrowers who cannot afford to make payments can apply for deferment or forbearance, which pause payments, though interest continues to accrue. What happens if I don't make my payments? Borrowers who can't or don't pay risk delinquency and eventually default. That can badly hurt your credit rating and make you ineligible for additional aid and government benefits. If a borrower missed one month's payment, they will start receiving email notifications, said Shaforth. Once the loan hasn't been paid for three months, loan servicers notify to the credit reporting agencies that the loan is delinquent, affecting your credit history. Once the borrower hasn't paid the loan for nine months, the loan goes into default. If you're struggling to pay, advisers first encourage you to check if you qualify for an income-driven repayment plan, which determines your payments by looking at your expenses. You can see whether you qualify by visiting the Federal Student Aid website. If you've worked for a government agency or a non-profit organization, you could also be eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which forgives student debt after 10 years. What happens when a loan goes into default? When you fall behind on a loan by 270 days — roughly nine months — the loan appears on your credit report as being in default. Once a loan is in default, it goes into collections. This means the government can garnish wages (without a court order) to go towards paying back the loan, intercept tax refunds, and seize portions of Social Security checks and other benefit payments. What if I can't pay? If your budget doesn't allow you to resume payments, it's important to know how to navigate the possibility of default and delinquency on a student loan. Both can hurt your credit rating, which would make you ineligible for additional aid. If you're in a short-term financial bind, you may qualify for deferment or forbearance — allowing you to temporarily suspend payment. To determine whether deferment or forbearance are good options for you, you can contact your loan servicer. One thing to note: interest still accrues during deferment or forbearance. Both can also impact potential loan forgiveness options. Depending on the conditions of your deferment or forbearance, it may make sense to continue paying the interest during the payment suspension. What is an income-driven repayment plan? The U.S. Education Department offers several plans for repaying federal student loans. Under the standard plan, borrowers are charged a fixed monthly amount that ensures all their debt will be repaid after 10 years. But if borrowers have difficulty paying that amount, they can enroll in one of several plans that offer lower monthly payments based on income and family size. Those are known as income-driven repayment plans. Income-driven options have been offered for years and generally cap monthly payments at 10% of a borrower's discretionary income. If a borrower's earnings are low enough, their bill is reduced to $0. And after 20 or 25 years, any remaining debt gets erased. What is the latest with the SAVE program? In August, the Supreme Court kept on hold the SAVE plan, the income-driven repayment plan that would have lowered payments for millions of borrowers, while lawsuits make their way through lower courts. Eight million borrowers who had already enrolled in the SAVE plan don't have to pay their monthly student loan bills until the court case is resolved. Debt that already had been forgiven under the plan was unaffected. The next court hearing about this case will be held on October 15. What happened with the Fresh Start program? The Fresh Start program, which gave benefits to borrowers who were delinquent prior to the pandemic payment pause, also closed on September 30. During this limited program, student loan borrowers who were in default prior to the pandemic were given the opportunity to remove their loans from default, allowing them to enroll in income-driven payment plans, or apply for deferment, among other benefits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/grace-period-for-us-student-loan-payments-is-over-here-s-what-you-need-to-know-/7810088.html	2024-10-03T20:16:49-07:00	
US dockworkers to suspend strike until January	detroit — The union representing 45,000 striking U.S. dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports reached a deal Thursday to suspend a three-day strike until January 15 to provide time to negotiate a new contract. The union, the International Longshoremen's Association, is to resume working immediately. The temporary end to the strike came after the union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies, reached a tentative agreement on wages, the union and ports said in a joint statement. A person briefed on the agreement said the ports sweetened their wage offer from about 50% over six years to 62%. The person didn't want to be identified because the agreement is tentative. Any wage increase would have to be approved by union members as part of the ratification of a final contract. The union went on strike early Tuesday after its contract expired in a dispute over pay and the automation of tasks at 36 ports stretching from Maine to Texas. The strike came at the peak of the holiday shopping season at the ports, which handle about half the cargo from ships coming into and out of the United States. The walkout raised the risk of shortages of goods on store shelves if it lasted more than a few weeks. Most retailers, though, had stocked up or shipped items early in anticipation of the dockworkers' strike. 'With the grace of God, and the goodwill of neighbors, it's gonna hold,' President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday night after the agreement. In a statement later, Biden applauded both sides 'for acting patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability of critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding.' Biden said that collective bargaining is 'critical to building a stronger economy from the middle out and the bottom up.' The union's membership won't need to vote on the temporary suspension of the strike, meaning that giant cranes should start loading and unloading shipping containers Thursday night. Until January 15, the workers will be covered under the old contract, which expired on September 30. The union had been demanding a 77% raise over six years, plus a complete ban on the use of automation at the ports, which members see as a threat to their jobs. Both sides also have been apart on the issues of pension contributions and the distribution of royalties paid on containers that are moved by workers. Thomas Kohler, who teaches labor and employment law at Boston College, said the agreement to halt the strike means that the two sides are close to a final deal. 'I'm sure that if they weren't going anywhere they wouldn't have suspended (the strike),' he said. 'They've got wages. They'll work out the language on automation, and I'm sure that what this really means is it gives the parties time to sit down and get exactly the language they can both live with.' Industry analysts have said that for every day of a port strike it takes four to six days to recover. But they said a short strike of a few days probably wouldn't gum up the supply chain too badly. Kohler said the surprise end to the strike may catch railroads with cars, engines and crews out of position. But railroads are likely to work quickly to fix that. Just before the strike had begun, the Maritime Alliance said both sides had moved off their original wage offers, a tentative sign of progress. The settlement pushes the strike and any potential shortages past the November presidential election, eliminating a potential liability for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. It's also a big plus for the Biden-Harris administration, which has billed itself as the most union-friendly in American history. Shortages could have driven up prices and reignited inflation. Thursday's deal came after administration officials met with foreign-owned shipping companies before dawn on Zoom, according to a person briefed on the day's events who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. The White House wanted to increase pressure to settle, emphasizing the responsibility to reopen the ports to help with recovery from Hurricane Helene, the person said. Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su told them she could get the union to the bargaining table to extend the contract if the carriers made a higher wage offer. Chief of Staff Jeff Zients told the carriers they had to make an offer by the end of the day so a manmade strike wouldn't worsen a natural disaster, the person said. By midday the Maritime Alliance members agreed to a large increase, bringing about the agreement, according to the person.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-dockworkers-union-to-suspend-strike-until-january-to-allow-time-to-negotiate-new-contract-/7810083.html	2024-10-03T20:05:11-07:00

UK gives sovereignty of long-contested Chagos Islands to Mauritius	london — The British government agreed Thursday to hand sovereignty of the long-contested Chagos Islands, an archipelago of more than 60 islands in the Indian Ocean, to Mauritius, in a deal to secure the future of a strategically important U.K.-U.S. military base. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the agreement would secure the future of the base at Diego Garcia, the largest in the chain of remote islands off the tip of India that has been under British control for over 50 years. The base, which is home to about 2,500 personnel, mainly Americans, has been involved in military operations including the 2003 war in Iraq and the long-running war in Afghanistan. Britain's Labour government said without the deal, the secure operation of the military base would be under threat, with contested sovereignty and legal challenges, including through various international courts and tribunals. 'It will strengthen our role in safeguarding global security, shut down any possibility of the Indian Ocean being used as a dangerous illegal migration route to the U.K., as well as guaranteeing our long-term relationship with Mauritius, a close Commonwealth partner,' Lammy said. The agreement also paves the way for the potential return of the few people still alive who were forcibly displaced from their homes on the islands decades ago. As part of the deal, the U.K. will retain sovereignty of Diego Garcia for an initial period of 99 years and will pay Mauritius an undisclosed rent. It will also create a 'resettlement' fund for displaced Chagossians aimed at letting them move back to the islands other than Diego Garcia. The Chagos Islands, which conjure up images of paradise with their lush vegetation and long stretches of white sandy beaches, have been at the heart of what Britain has called the British Indian Ocean Territory since 1965, when they were siphoned away from Mauritius, a former U.K. colony that gained independence three years later. Mauritius, which lies east of Madagascar in southern Africa, is around 2,100 kilometers (1,250 miles) southwest of the Chagos Islands. Following a lease agreement with Britain, the U.S. built the naval base at Diego Garcia for defense purposes in the 1970s. The U.S. has described the base as 'an all but indispensable platform' for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia and East Africa. Around 1,500 inhabitants from the Chagos Islands were displaced to make way for the U.S. base, in what Human Rights Watch said last year amounted to 'crimes against humanity committed by a colonial power against an indigenous people.' Chagossian Voices, a U.K.-based group representing the Chagossian diaspora around the world, voiced disappointment that the negotiations excluded those displaced. 'Chagossians have learned this outcome from the media and remain powerless and voiceless in determining our own future and the future of our homeland,' it said in a statement on social media. 'The views of Chagossians, the indigenous inhabitants of the islands, have been consistently and deliberately ignored and we demand full inclusion in the drafting of the treaty.' The agreement will be included in a treaty and is dependent on legal processes being finalized. Both sides have committed to complete this as quickly as possible. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he spoke to his Mauritius counterpart, Pravind Jugnauth, on Thursday morning, welcoming the agreement after two years of negotiations that began under the previous Conservative government. 'Fifty-six years after our independence, the decolonization is finally complete,' Jugnauth said in a televised address to the nation later Thursday. The Mauritius government said that the treaty would aim to resolve all outstanding issues related to the islands, including 'its former inhabitants,' as well as addressing 'the wrongs of the past.' It laid out the hope that those displaced who are still alive and their descendants, who are mainly living in the U.K., Mauritius and the Seychelles, would have a right to return, as it is now 'free' to implement a resettlement program on the islands except Diego Garcia. It added that the U.K. will financially support the Chagossians, who have fought a long-running legal battle about their displacement, most recently in 2016 when they lost out in a Supreme Court ruling in the U.K. At the time, the previous Conservative government refused their right to return but voiced its 'deep regret' for the way the Chagossian community had been mistreated in the 1960s and 1970s. Over the years, the Chagossians and Mauritius have garnered increasing international support, notably among African nations and within the United Nations. In 2019, in an advisory option that was nonbinding, the International Court of Justice ruled that the U.K. had unlawfully carved up Mauritius when it agreed to end colonial rule in the late 1960s. In a statement, the White House said President Joe Biden applauded the 'historic agreement' on the status of the Chagos Islands. 'The agreement secures the effective operation of the joint facility on Diego Garcia into the next century,' the statement said. In the U.K., Conservative lawmakers standing to be leader of Britain's opposition party expressed dismay at the decision to hand over sovereignty of all but one of the islands. They were criticized for the comments, given that the previous Conservative government started the negotiations. One of the candidates, Tom Tugendhat, said he has consistently opposed any plan to hand over sovereignty of the islands and warned that the move could see Mauritius potentially leasing one of the islands to China. 'This is a shameful retreat undermining our security and leaving our allies exposed,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-gives-sovereignty-of-long-contested-chagos-islands-to-mauritius-/7809658.html	2024-10-03T15:12:20-07:00

Hurricane pushes climate change to forefront of presidential campaign	WASHINGTON — The devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene has brought climate change to the forefront of the presidential campaign after the issue lingered on the margins for months. Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Georgia Wednesday to see hard-hit areas, two days after her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, was in the state and criticized the federal response to the storm, which has killed at least 200 people in the Southeast. Helene is the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. President Joe Biden toured some of the hardest-hit areas by helicopter on Wednesday and Thursday. Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms and other natural disasters, traveled to the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation. 'Storms are getting stronger and stronger,' Biden said Wednesday after surveying damage near Asheville, North Carolina. At least 70 people died in the state. 'Nobody can deny the impact of the climate crisis anymore,'' Biden said at a briefing in Raleigh, North Carolina. 'They must be brain dead if they do.' Harris, meanwhile, hugged and huddled with a family Wednesday in hurricane-ravaged Augusta, Georgia. 'There is real pain and trauma that resulted because of this hurricane'' and its aftermath, Harris said outside a storm-damaged house with downed trees in the yard. 'We are here for the long-haul,'' she said. Storm damage forces discussion The focus on the storm — and its link to climate change — was notable after climate change was only lightly mentioned in two presidential debates this year. The candidates instead focused on abortion rights, the economy, immigration and other issues. The hurricane featured prominently in Tuesday's vice-presidential debate as Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz were asked about the storm and the larger issue of climate change. Both men called the hurricane a tragedy and agreed on the need for a strong federal response. But it was Walz, the governor of Minnesota, who put the storm in the context of a warming climate. 'There's no doubt this thing roared onto the scene faster and stronger than anything we've seen,' he said. Bob Henson, a meteorologist and writer with Yale Climate Connections, said it was no surprise that Helene is pushing both the federal disaster response and human-caused climate change into the campaign conversation. 'Weather disasters are often overlooked as a factor in big elections,'' he said. 'Helene is a sprawling catastrophe, affecting millions of Americans. And it dovetails with several well-established links between hurricanes and climate change, including rapid intensification and intensified downpours.' More than 40 trillion gallons of rain drenched the Southeast in the last week, an amount that if concentrated in North Carolina would cover the state in 3 1/2 feet of water. 'That's an astronomical amount of precipitation,' said Ed Clark, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Candidates make claims, counter claims During Tuesday's debate, Walz credited Vance for past statements acknowledging that climate change is a problem. But he noted that Trump has called climate change 'a hoax' and joked that rising seas 'would make more beachfront property to be able to invest in.' Trump said in a speech Tuesday that 'the planet has actually gotten little bit cooler recently,' adding: 'Climate change covers everything.' In fact, summer 2024 sweltered to Earth's hottest on record, making it likely this year will end up as the warmest humanity has measured, according to the European climate service Copernicus. Global records were shattered just last year as human-caused climate change, with a temporary boost from an El Niño, keeps dialing up temperatures and extreme weather, scientists said. Vance, an Ohio senator, said he and Trump support clean air, clean water and 'want the environment to be cleaner and safer.' However, during Trump's four years in office, he took a series of actions to roll back more than 100 environmental regulations. Vance sidestepped a question about whether he agrees with Trump's statement that climate change is a hoax. 'What the president has said is that if the Democrats — in particular Kamala Harris and her leadership — really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America. And that's not what they're doing,' he said. 'This idea that carbon [dioxide] emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So, we're not arguing about weird science. If you believe that, what would you want to do?' Vance asked. The answer, he said, is to 'produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.'' Vance claimed that policies by Biden and Harris actually help China, because many solar panels, lithium-ion batteries and other materials used in renewable energy and electric vehicles are made in China and imported to the United States. Walz rebutted that claim, noting that the Inflation Reduction Act, the Democrats' signature climate law approved in 2022, includes the largest-ever investment in domestic clean energy production. The law, for which Harris cast the deciding vote, has created 200,000 jobs across the country, including in Ohio and Minnesota, Walz said. Vance was not in the Senate when the law was approved. 'We are producing more natural gas and more oil [in the United States] than we ever have,' Walz said. 'We're also producing more clean energy.' The comment echoed a remark by Harris in last month's presidential debate. The Biden-Harris administration has overseen 'the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil,' Harris said then. While Biden rarely mentions it, domestic fossil fuel production under his administration is at an all-time high. Crude oil production averaged 12.9 million barrels a day last year, eclipsing a previous record set in 2019 under Trump, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Democrats want to continue investments in renewable energy such as wind and solar power — and not just because supporters of the Green New Deal want that, Walz said. 'My farmers know climate change is real. They've seen 500-year droughts, 500-year floods back-to-back. But what they're doing is adapting,'' he said. 'The solution for us is to continue to move forward, [accept] that climate change is real' and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, Walz said, adding that the administration is doing exactly that. 'We are seeing us becoming an energy superpower for the future, not just the current'' time, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-pushes-climate-change-to-forefront-of-presidential-campaign-/7809571.html	2024-10-03T14:12:41-07:00	
Florida communities hit by 3 hurricanes grapple with whether to rebuild	HORSESHOE BEACH, Florida — It was just a month ago that Brooke Hiers left the state-issued emergency trailer where her family had lived since Hurricane Idalia slammed into her Gulf Coast fishing village of Horseshoe Beach in August 2023. Hiers and her husband, Clint, were still finishing the electrical work in the home they painstakingly rebuilt themselves, wiping out Clint's savings to do so. They will never finish that wiring job. Hurricane Helene blew their newly renovated home off its 4-foot-high pilings, sending it floating into the neighbor's yard next door. 'You always think, 'Oh, there's no way it can happen again,'' Hiers said. 'I don't know if anybody's ever experienced this in the history of hurricanes.' For the third time in 13 months, this windswept stretch of Florida's Big Bend took a direct hit from a hurricane — a one-two-three punch to an 80-kilometer (50-mile) sliver of the state's more than 13,500 kilometers (8,400 miles) of coastline, first by Idalia, then Hurricane Debby in August 2024 and now Helene. Hiers, who sits on Horseshoe Beach's town council, said words like 'unbelievable' are beginning to lose their meaning. 'I've tried to use them all. Catastrophic. Devastating. Heartbreaking … none of that explains what happened here,' Hiers said. The back-to-back hits to Florida's Big Bend are forcing residents to reckon with the true costs of living in an area under siege by storms that researchers say are becoming stronger because of climate change. The Hiers, like many others here, can't afford homeowners insurance on their flood-prone houses, even if it were available. Residents who have watched their life savings get washed away multiple times are left with few choices — leave the communities where their families have lived for generations, pay tens of thousands of dollars to rebuild their houses on stilts as building codes require, or move into a recreational vehicle they can drive out of harm's way. That's if they can afford any of those things. The storm left many residents bunking with family or friends, sleeping in their cars or sheltering in what's left of their collapsing homes. Janalea England wasn't waiting for outside organizations to get aid to her friends and neighbors, turning her commercial fish market in the river town of Steinhatchee into a pop-up donation distribution center, just like she did after Hurricane Idalia. A row of folding tables was stacked with water, canned food, diapers, soap, clothes and shoes, a steady stream of residents coming and going. 'I've never seen so many people homeless as what I have right now. Not in my community,' England said. 'They have nowhere to go.' The sparsely populated Big Bend is known for its towering pine forests and pristine salt marshes that disappear into the horizon, a remote stretch of largely undeveloped coastline that's mostly dodged the crush of condos, golf courses and souvenir strip malls that has carved up so much of the Sunshine State. This is a place where teachers, mill workers and housekeepers could still afford to live within walking distance of the Gulf's white sand beaches. Or at least they used to, until a third successive hurricane blew their homes apart. Helene was so destructive, many residents don't have a home left to clean up, escaping the storm with little more than the clothes on their backs, even losing their shoes to the surging tides. With marinas washed away, restaurants collapsed, and vacation homes blown apart, many commercial fishermen, servers and house cleaners lost their homes and their jobs on the same day. Those who worked at the local sawmill and paper mill, two bedrock employers in the area, were laid off in the past year too. Now a convoy of semi-trucks full of hurricane relief supplies have set up camp at the shuttered mill in the city of Perry. Hud Lilliott was a mill worker for 28 years, before losing his job and now his canal-front home in Dekle Beach, just down the street from the house where he grew up. Lilliott and his wife, Laurie, hope to rebuild their house there, but they don't know how they'll pay for it. And they're worried the school in Steinhatchee where Laurie teaches first grade could become another casualty of the storm, as the county watches its tax base float away. 'We've worked our whole lives, and we're so close to where they say the 'golden years,'' Laurie said. 'It's like you can see the light and it all goes dark.' Dave Beamer rebuilt his home in Steinhatchee after it was 'totaled' by Hurricane Idalia, only to see it washed into the marsh a year later. 'I don't think I can do that again,' Beamer said. 'Everybody's changing their mind about how we're going to live here.' Beamer plans to stay in this river town but will put his home on wheels. He says he’ll buy a camper and build a pole barn to park it under. In Horseshoe Beach, Hiers is waiting for a makeshift town hall to be delivered in the coming days, a double-wide trailer where they'll offer what services they can for as long as they can. She and her husband are staying with their daughter, a 45-minute drive away. 'You feel like this could be the end of things as you knew it. Of your town. Of your community,' Hiers said. 'We just don't even know how to recover at this point.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-communities-hit-by-3-hurricanes-grapple-with-whether-to-rebuild-/7809628.html	2024-10-03T14:07:46-07:00	
Thousands rally in Austria against far right	vienna — Thousands of people protested in Austria's capital, Vienna, on Thursday against a possible return to power for the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe), which topped national elections on Sunday. The FPOe won almost 29% of the vote in Sunday's general election, ahead of the conservative People's Party (OeVP) with just over 26%. 'The Austrian Freedom Party is a danger because it has already said that it wants to govern in the image of Hungary's Viktor Orban,' said student Rihab Toumi, 26, referring to the nationalist leader of Austria's neighboring country. Although the FPOe topped the polls, there is no guarantee that its radical leader, Herbert Kickl, will be given a chance to form a government since no other party is willing to work with him. 'This result was a shock, and we cannot let a party that drifts so far to the right garner so much support without saying anything,' said social worker Marianne, 53, who declined to share her surname. Organizers said there were 15,000 to 17,000 protesters in central Vienna who marched toward parliament. Demonstrators held up placards that said, 'Let's defend democracy,' 'No alliances with Putin's friends,' and other anti-FPOe slogans. Kickl has criticized European Union sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his inner circle over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Demonstrators intend to march every Thursday, having similarly done so after the far-right formed part of short-lived coalition governments in 2000 and 2017.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-rally-in-austria-against-far-right-/7809618.html	2024-10-03T13:58:48-07:00	
Yazidi sex slave rescued from Gaza in rare, internationally collaborative mission	Washington — The State Department has confirmed to VOA the success of a complicated mission to rescue an Iraqi national and former Islamic State sex slave from Gaza via Israel. Because of a long-running diplomatic rift between Israel and Iraq, it took months of vigorous efforts by humanitarian activists and direct intervention from U.S. diplomatic missions in the region to coordinate the young woman’s rescue. Cooperation among Israeli, Jordanian, Iraqi and United Nations officials was involved. 'On October 1, 2024, the United States helped to safely evacuate from Gaza a young Yazidi woman to be reunited with her family in Iraq,' a State Department spokesperson told VOA on Wednesday, adding that the young woman’s story 'is heartbreaking, and we are glad that she will be reunited with her family in Iraq.' Enslaved by Islamic State Now 21, Fawzia Amin Saydo was kidnapped by Islamic State militants from her hometown of Sinjar in August 2014, just a month before her 11th birthday. She and two of her brothers, aged 7 and 10 at the time, were among thousands of Yazidis enslaved by IS due to their religious beliefs. Although the brothers found a way to escape, Saydo spent years suffering violence, injustice and rape by IS fighters. By early 2015, she was taken to the Syrian city of Raqqa where she was imprisoned and raped before being forcibly 'married' to a then 24-year-old Palestinian IS fighter. 'He told me that I had to sleep with him. On the third day, he went to a pharmacy and brought a drug that numbs part of the body. He gave me the drug and I cried,' Saydo recounted in an August 2023 interview from Gaza with the Kurdish media outlet Rudaw. About a year after her arrival in Raqqa, Saydo’s life took another turn when she gave birth to a boy, the first of two children she would have with the Palestinian IS fighter. Saydo decided to dedicate her life to her children, despite the husband turning more abusive, especially after he married another woman. By the end of 2018, when the U.S.-led Kurdish forces squeezed IS out of the group’s territories in Syria, Saydo, then 15 years old, lost contact with her Palestinian captor, who had escaped from northeast Syria to the rebel-held Idlib province in northwest Syria. In early 2019 she was driven to Idlib to be returned to her captor, but their reunion was brief, as the Palestinian militant was soon reported dead. No cause of death was reported. Fearing that her community back in Sinjar, Iraq, might not accept her children — Yazidi spiritual leaders that same year had issued a decree stating that children of rape by IS militants would not be welcomed into the faith — Saydo decided to move in with the Palestinian man’s family in Gaza, where she arrived in 2020. Stuck in Gaza Humanitarian activists who followed Saydo’s case told VOA that her circumstances in Gaza presented a gut-wrenching choice: stay with her children and endure the Palestinian family that became abusive just as their late son had been, or escape — alone and without her children — in the hopes of reuniting with long-lost family in Sinjar. Her resolve to leave was strengthened by Hamas’ deadly October 7 attack on Israel. 'This has been by far the most complicated case I have worked on,' said Steve Maman of the Montreal-based Liberation of Christian and Yazidi Children of Iraq. It took Maman and a small team of Iraqi activists several months of lobbying Iraqi, U.S., and Israeli officials. While waiting for a final decision from Israel, Maman and his supporters helped her escape the Palestinian family’s home and hide in a house about 2 kilometers away from the Israeli army at Kerm Shalom crossing. The rescue process, which VOA has followed since early September, was slow and rescheduled several times due to the difficulty of navigating the Israel-Iraq diplomatic rift. 'I have no idea why every party was so hesitant to act on such a humanitarian case. Now I can finally get my much-needed sleep,' one of Maman’s supporters who asked that his name be withheld, told VOA. Another activist from Sinjar, Sufyan Waheed Hammo, told VOA, 'The Iraqi officials were very helpful when it came to preparing paperwork, but they couldn’t do much diplomatically because of the Iraqi law.' Iraq's parliament in May 2022 passed legislation that criminalized any ties with Israel. According to Maman, what finally triggered U.S. officials in the region to make a final push to rescue her was 'a deeply troubling incident' that occurred just a day before her rescue. 'She was walking alone when a group of men abused her.' Complicated handoff In the early morning of October 1, a 'personnel team' whose individual identities are known only to U.S., U.N. and likely Israeli officials, drove Saydo to Israel via Kerm Shalom crossing in a U.N. ambulance. According to Maman’s supporters, Saydo arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem that day before moving on to Jordan via the Allenby Bridge crossing. Salwan Sinjaree, chief of staff to Iraq’s foreign minister, told VOA that his government had no contact with the Israeli government during the rescue process. 'Our embassy in Amman received her, prepared travel documents for her, and hired a plane to fly her back to Baghdad with one of our female embassy staff,' Sinjaree told VOA. 'All our contacts during the process have been with the U.S. embassy, the Jordanian foreign ministry, and the U.N. We have not made any communication with Israel.' The official from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office who was tasked to handle the case turned down VOA’s request for comment. Saydo arrived in Baghdad via a plane around 10:30 a.m. local time Wednesday. She was then escorted by a team of Iraqi intelligence officers to Mosul, where she was reunited with family. Saydo’s brother Barzan told VOA from Germany that the rest of his family, including their mother, sister, and two brothers, are thrilled to see her after a decade apart. Her father, however, would not be there to witness his daughter’s return, Barzan added, because he died of a heart attack just two months prior, 'caused by the pain of the separation from her.' 'We welcome her back and support her decision to return home. She didn’t have any choice in what happened,' he told VOA. 'My heartfelt thanks every single person who helped to rescue her.' Ongoing trauma Beyond Saydo’s trauma of the past decade, however, is a new kind of pain in the wake of reunion: the reality of now living apart from her young son and daughter, who remain with their father’s family in Gaza. Despite the impossible choice with which Saydo was confronted in Gaza, some still insist on judging her decision to flee her captor’s family. 'No mother would leave her children. They came from her belly,' an activist associated with Maman who wanted to be cited only by his first initial, D, told VOA. According to Mirza Dinnayi, a Yazidi activist based in Germany, at least 2,745 Yazidis remain missing since the 2014 IS massacre of some 5,000 members of their religious community. That event, which the U.N. has said constitutes an act of genocide, also resulted in the abductions of young Yazidi women like Saydo and the displacement of an estimated 100,000 members of the faith who were forced to take refuge outside of Iraq. 'We do not know if those missing people are still alive or not. If they are alive, they are probably held in different places of Syria such as in al-Hol camp or in areas controlled by terrorists in northwest Syria,' Dinnayi told VOA. 'There are rare cases of Yazidis found in Turkey and some unverified reports about some people taken to Egypt.' For Maman and his fellow activists, saving Saydo from conflict-ridden Gaza is a way to help the community recover. It is also a message of hope at a time when tensions between Israel and Iran enter a new phase. 'I am a practicing Jew, and I was willing to put aside my life to help a Yazidi girl get out,' he told VOA. 'I had to fight my contacts in this case because it was not that easy, but the result is at the end a life is saved.' The State Department spokesperson told VOA that they are asking people to respect Saydo’s privacy 'for her own safety while she reunites with loved ones and returns home.'

California investigating possible case of bird flu in dairy worker	chicago — California is investigating a possible case of bird flu in a dairy worker who had contact with infected cattle, the state's public health department said Thursday. The virus' jump to cattle in 14 states and infections of 13 dairy and poultry farmworkers this year have concerned scientists and federal officials about the risks to humans from further spread. The worker had a 'presumptive positive' result to a test for bird flu, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will do further testing to confirm the finding, the California Department of Public Health said in a statement. The person, who was not identified, suffered only conjunctivitis, or pink eye, the department said in a statement. The person is being treated with antiviral medication and staying home, it added. The person works at a Central Valley dairy facility suffering an outbreak in cattle, according to the statement. Cows at dairy farms in California, the top U.S. milk-producing state, began testing positive for bird flu in late August. 'The risk to the general public remains low, although people who interact with infected animals are at higher risk of getting bird flu,' the department said. Missouri last month confirmed bird flu in a person with underlying medical conditions who had no immediate known animal exposure. Six health care workers who cared for the Missouri patient developed respiratory symptoms, but the virus was not confirmed in any of them. Scientists are watching closely for signs that the virus has begun to spread more easily in people. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday said it would begin testing raw cow's milk intended for pasteurization at dairy plants to better understand the prevalence of the bird flu virus in milk. Participation in the study, set to begin October 28, is voluntary, and pasteurized dairy products remain safe to consume, the agency said. Prior FDA testing of retail dairy samples came back negative, and more such testing is underway.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-investigating-possible-case-of-bird-flu-in-dairy-worker-/7809564.html	2024-10-03T13:14:25-07:00	
In the fast lane: Chinese car imports grow in South Africa	Johannesburg — In South Africa’s capital of Johannesburg, some of the most ubiquitous vehicles on the streets are the thousands of minibus taxis crammed tight with daily commuters traveling from the dusty townships into work. At the other end of the spectrum are souped-up sports cars and flashy convertibles zooming around the leafy suburbs that are home to the elite. Increasingly, however, there’s another kind of vehicle cruising Johannesburg’s streets: new gas-powered SUVs with names like Chery, BAIC and Haval — all Chinese cars that industry experts say are giving more established brands a run for their money and gaining popularity with South Africans. Potential car buyer Ross Grey was considering a large pick-up truck made by Chinese manufacturer JAC Motors. 'I’m a sales manager at a kitchen company, hence why I’m looking at buying a double cab, because I’ve got a young family and I need to also carry a lot of goods on the back of the vehicle, I’m often on building sites and that sort of thing,' he told VOA recently. His interest in a Chinese-made vehicle stemmed in part from a bad experience. 'The Chinese vehicles are not on the stolen list like the big brands are,' said Grey, who was a loyal Toyota Hilux owner until car thieves stole his car. The Hilux is one of the most stolen cars in South Africa – often for its engine, which fits perfectly into commuter minibus taxis. Along with consumers, car thieves are taking notice of Chinese makes and models, data shows. South Africans used to be skeptical about cars with the 'made in China' label. While Grey acknowledged Chinese brands have not yet stood the test of time, he said his research shows the quality seems to have improved in recent years. In the fast lane The biggest draw for many Chinese car buyers, including Grey, is the cost. 'The reason I’m looking at something like this, the Chinese vehicles, is because first of all the price, it’s a lot cheaper than your big brands that have been in the country for many, many years,' he said. Chinese-imported vehicles cost a lot less than most SUVs from Germany’s Volkswagen, America’s Ford or Japan’s Toyota, said Mikel Mabasa, CEO of South Africa’s car industry organization Naamsa. 'These Chinese brands have actually been growing at double digits, particularly in the last three years,' he told VOA. 'So if you look at growth between 2019 and 2023, we’ve seen actually a more than 200% increase in terms of Chinese brands that are coming into the South African market, and that is obviously very, very unusual.' Mabasa added: 'But I think there are reasons … many of those brands, if you look at the price points, are much cheaper than competing brands.' The number of imported Chinese vehicles in South Africa has steadily increased, with more than 39,000 automobiles brought into the country last year, compared with some 11,000 in 2019, according to Naamsa figures. German imports showed the opposite trend, with just over 21,000 coming into the country in 2023, down from almost 37,000 in 2019. Vehicles imported from Japan show similar figures. The U.S. exported almost 4,200 vehicles in 2019 but close to 300 fewer automobiles last year, statistics show. In terms of sales, certain models of established brands such as Ford and Toyota are still leading the pack, but Chinese upstarts are not far behind. Between July 2023 and July 2024, Chinese brand Chery sold more than 11,000 of their Tiggo 4 Pro models in South Africa. That’s compared with 25,000 Ford Rangers and 34,000 Toyota Hilux pickup trucks during the same period. Going electric South Africa is itself a major producer of cars, with manufacturing plants in the country for brands including Ford, Toyota, BMW, Mercedes, Nissan, Volkswagen and Suzuki. 'Thirty-nine percent of the components that they use in the manufacturing process are sourced locally in South Africa,' Mabasa told VOA. He said that while some of the cars made in South Africa go to the local market, more than 60% are exported overseas to nearly 150 countries. The first local Chinese car manufacturing plant for BAIC was opened by Chinese President Xi Jinping and South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa in Eastern Cape province to great fanfare in 2018. The Chinese consulate in Cape Town described the project 'as a milestone for the two countries' economies.' But the project hit some bumps in the road. 'They’re still in the setting up phase, they’ve obviously experienced some hiccups in getting that particular plant off the ground,' said Mabasa. BAIC executives have told local South African media the pandemic and labor disputes were to blame for the delay. But Mabasa is still hopeful. 'We obviously wish them well, and I think it’s a model that a number of other plants or companies from China would definitely adopt as a template should they wish to come into South Africa and start manufacturing vehicles,' he said. That’s something Ramaphosa is also encouraging. On a state visit to China last month, he visited the headquarters of massive Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD. 'We have introduced policies to promote the development of the electric vehicle industry in South Africa,' the South African president said on the trip. 'We are certain that companies such as BYD … will find South Africa a unique and advantageous location that can serve as a hub to reach other markets.' The electric vehicle revolution is in the very nascent stages in South Africa, where gas is still king. However, BYD is looking to Africa as it faces increasing trade restrictions in the U.S. and Europe. BYD already has a showroom in South Africa and recently opened others in Rwanda, Zambia and Kenya.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-the-fast-lane-chinese-car-imports-grow-in-south-africa/7809451.html	2024-10-03T11:54:21-07:00

Boston university relaunches journalism curriculum to encompass humanities	Washington — As the fall semester begins, a women’s college in Boston, Massachusetts, has retooled its media-related curriculum to best reflect the ideals of the school’s namesake, the late journalist Gwen Ifill. Simmons University announced it would relaunch the media school as the Gwen Ifill School of Media, Humanities and Social Sciences. A search committee also named media scholar Ammina Kothari as the new dean. The Ifill School’s new structure expands its media curriculum to include humanities and social sciences. The attributes that defined Ifill also shape a new, holistic approach, 'An unwavering commitment to accuracy and objectivity, a nuanced understanding of social and historical context and a compassion-based appreciation of policymaking’s real-world implications,' according to a Simmons press release. 'Folks here are very proud of Gwen’s legacy and want to honor it in many different ways,' said Bert Ifill, Gwen’s brother and a longtime university administrator. A crucial component of the Ifill School is its emphasis on communications, a field Gwen excelled in, Bert told VOA. After graduating from Simmons in 1977, she had long careers in both print and television journalism, working for The Baltimore Evening Sun, The Washington Post, The New York Times, NBC and PBS. She covered seven presidential campaigns and died in 2016 at age 61. Ifill was the first African American woman to moderate a vice presidential debate and to coanchor a national newscast, 'PBS NewsHour.' 'Gwen valued storytelling, and she was an amazing journalist,' Kothari, the school’s new dean, told VOA. 'But she also worked really hard to raise awareness about important social issues and to highlight underrepresented voices.' Abigail Meyers, a current junior at the Ifill School, admires the journalist’s 'groundbreaking work' in both journalism and racial justice, she told VOA. Raised near Baltimore, Maryland, Meyers feels a special connection to Ifill’s work for the Baltimore Evening Sun newspaper. The school has been instrumental in supporting Meyers’ aspirations to become a professional journalist, she told VOA. 'The support that you get from the faculty and alumni is unlike really any other journalism program,' she said. Being a double major in communications and political science, Meyers appreciates the new curriculum’s flexibility, as she is able to take classes across different disciplines. This flexibility will help prime Simmons’ students to achieve success, Kothari said. She believes interdisciplinary training leads to stronger leaders in the world. 'As we think about communications or media, including journalism or social sciences, we need a strong foundation in humanities to understand the historical context for what we see happening today,' Kothari said. The school’s increased focus on humanities 'couldn’t be more timely,' according to the press release. Nearly three of four Americans believe media literacy is an important skill in today’s news landscape, a 2023 Boston University survey found. However, humanities-focused degree programs like the Ifill School’s receive little recognition. Of all the bachelor’s degrees awarded in 2020, humanities degrees made up less than 10%, a number that has only been decreasing, according to a 2022 MIT study. Meanwhile, science, technology, engineering and math degrees, or STEM, have grown exponentially. But humanities and STEM shouldn’t be seen as opposites, Kothari said. She cited the COVID-19 pandemic response as an example. Many precautionary measures such as social distancing were grounded in 'amazing scientific research,' but weren’t effectively communicated to the public, she said. 'As we have new knowledge being produced, we also need journalists,' Kothari said. 'We need communicators who are able to translate very complex information to the audience so they can see, ‘How does it matter to me? What is the effect for me?’' Ifill’s legacy is not only celebrated within her namesake school, but also through press freedom organizations around the world. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a press freedom nonprofit, honors Ifill with the annual Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award, which is presented to individuals who have 'shown extraordinary and sustained achievement in the cause of press freedom,' according to CPJ’s website. Christophe Deloire, the late director of international media freedom organization Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, received the 2024 Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award. 'Christophe was one of journalism's greatest-ever champions,' RSF Executive Director Clayton Weimers told VOA in an email. 'There was hardly a fight or an advance in press freedom in the past decade that he wasn't a part of, if not leading.' As Ifill’s legacy spreads, there is one person who couldn’t be prouder: her brother, Bert. He told VOA it often seems as though his full-time job is 'to talk nicely about Gwen.' 'It's always a great pleasure and honor for me to talk about her and to talk about her legacy, not only as obviously a very skilled journalist, but as an extraordinary mentor and confidant,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boston-university-relaunches-journalism-curriculum-to-encompass-humanities/7808224.html	2024-10-03T11:22:10-07:00

Ethiopian military boosts operations in Amhara region	ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Ethiopia’s army said it has launched a major operation against Fano rebel groups in the Amhara region, as the conflict continues, despite calls by rights groups and international partners for a peaceful resolution. Army spokesperson Colonel Getnet Adane said Tuesday that the Ethiopian National Defense Force, or the ENDF, in coordination with the region’s security forces, have started a military operation. He claimed continued calls for peace have 'fallen on deaf ears.' 'The only language they [armed rebel groups] understand is force. From now on we will talk to them in that language,' said Getnet. 'For peace to prevail they need to be met with force. They have to be targeted, hit.' He indicated the operation started this past weekend. Federal and regional officials said measures are also being taken against suspected supporters of the rebel group, including members of the business community. The announcement of the operation came on the day human rights group Amnesty International accused Ethiopia’s army of conducting 'mass arbitrary detentions' in the Amhara region. Amnesty’s regional director for East and Southern Africa, Tigere Chagutah, alleged that hundreds have been detained, including members of the academic community, in major towns across the Amhara region since Sept. 28. 'The Ethiopian army and police’s ongoing campaign of arbitrary mass detentions in Amhara region is yet more evidence of the government’s total disregard for the rule of law,' the director said in a statement. 'Eyewitnesses have stated that authorities came with a ‘list’ and failed to obtain arrest and search warrants before detaining hundreds of civilians across the region. Those detained have largely not been brought before a court of law within 48 hours, as required by the country’s national laws and constitution.' Amnesty urged authorities to 'immediately end these arbitrary arrests, press charges against those detained for internationally recognized crimes and follow due process, or release them without further delay.' It is time for authorities to stop using arbitrary detention as a tool of repression, the statement said. Fighting in the Amhara region began more than a year ago with a dispute over the disarming of regional paramilitary forces. Fresh fighting was reported as recently as last week. VOA’s Horn of Africa service attempted to reach an Amhara region spokesperson, the federal government of Ethiopian communication affairs minister and ENDF spokesperson and Fano rebels. None of them could be reached for comment on Amnesty International’s statement. Abductions Meanwhile, police in Ethiopia have reported that abductions are on the rise in two conflict regions where armed groups are fighting government forces. A spokesperson for the Amhara regional police, Mesafint Eshete, said the commission recorded 287 abduction cases in the Ethiopian fiscal year 2016, which ended three weeks ago. The Ethiopian calendar runs several years behind the calendar in most other countries. Speaking to the Horn of Africa service, Mesafint hinted the figure could be higher as most victims don’t report incidents to the police. In a report issued last week, the state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, or EHRC, linked the kidnapping cases to the political and security crisis in the country. The report said that kidnappings have become a recurrent fixture, especially in the Oromia and Amhara areas. The EHRC also said that kidnapping cases in those areas involve diverse actors with different goals and modus operandi. While financial gain drives most of them, others seek to further a political agenda, the report added. According to the EHRC report, armed groups operating in the regions, criminal gangs and some members of the security forces are implicated in the kidnapping cases. The World Food Program said last week that the conflict in the Amhara region has become the biggest challenge for humanitarian operations. 'Growing insecurity, particularly in the Amhara region, is hindering our deliveries. Our operations face severe security risks,' the WFP Ethiopia representative and country director, Zlatan Milisic, told reporters in Addis Ababa. He said that this year, eight humanitarian workers have lost their lives and more than 20 people have been abducted. Six of the killings took place in the Amhara region, while one happened in Tigray and the other occurred in the Gambela area. Despite the security challenges, Milisic said WFP didn’t stop operating in the region, and has reached 90% of its intended aid beneficiaries in Ethiopia this year. 'We want to be there, and we plan to continue supporting the needy,' Milisic said. Speaking on funding gaps, Milisic indicated that over the past three months, 4.6 million people needed aid, but only 1.3 million received humanitarian support. He appealed for $341 million for WFP humanitarian operations through February 2025. This story originated in VOA’s Horn of Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopian-military-boosts-operations-in-amhara-region/7809375.html	2024-10-03T11:03:21-07:00	
Beijing tests regional resolve in South China Sea amid Middle East conflict	Taipei, Taiwan — As the United States and other like-minded countries hold joint military exercises in the South China Sea, Chinese vessels have been aggressively asserting Beijing’s territorial claims in the hotly contested waterway, testing the resolve of the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. Last week on September 26, China used two missile boats and a high-intensity laser to disrupt an attempt by the Philippines to deliver supplies to local fishermen posted near the Half Moon Shoal, an atoll that lies within Manila’s Exclusive Economic Zone, or EEZ. On Sunday, Chinese law enforcement reportedly attacked Vietnamese fishermen with iron pipes, confiscating fishing equipment near the Paracel Islands. And a new report by the Washington-based Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative released Tuesday highlighted how the Chinese coast guard vessels have been operating 'like clockwork' this year in waters claimed by Malaysia as the resource-rich country tries to expand oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea. On Thursday, The Washington Post also reported that Chinese vessels have been disrupting the repair and construction of subsea cables running under the South China Sea. China emboldened Analysts say these actions suggest Beijing is attempting to test regional countries’ resolves to safeguard their territorial claims at a time when the United States is fixated on the conflict in the Middle East. 'The serious crisis in the Middle East has emboldened China and allowed them to test the Americans further in the Indo-Pacific region,' said Collin Koh, a maritime security expert at the Singapore-based S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. He added that Beijing is using physical actions and lawfare to try to change the situation in the South China Sea 'altogether.' The Philippines has characterized Beijing’s harassment of its vessels as 'irresponsible, dangerous, and provocative,' while Hanoi said the attack on the Vietnamese fishermen violated its sovereignty and international law. China’s Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request from VOA regarding the harassment of Philippine vessels. Commenting on the attack on the fishermen, Beijing claims Chinese law enforcement forces were stopping Vietnamese fishermen from illegally fishing near the Paracel Islands, which China calls Xisha. The islands are an equal distance from China and Vietnam, but Beijing has maintained de facto control of the islands since it seized them in 1974 after a clash with Vietnamese forces. In recent years, Beijing has reclaimed land and established military installations in the Paracel Islands, including an airstrip and artificial harbor. New front Koh told VOA that the incident near Half Moon Shoal, which comes after Chinese and Philippine coast guard vessels collided twice near the disputed Sabina Shoal since August, shows Beijing may be 'opening a new front' against Manila. 'The Philippines wants to apply the provisional agreement that they have reached with China over Second Thomas Shoal in July to the other contested reefs in the South China Sea, but I don’t think the Chinese are keen to expand the agreement throughout the region,' he said in a phone interview. While the United States and other countries, including Australia, Japan and New Zealand, have been conducting more joint patrols in the South China Sea to counter China’s aggression, experts say that appears to have done little to thwart Beijing's ability to challenge its neighbors in the region. 'There needs to be more concrete minilateral cooperation between regional countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, including joint military exercises, expansion of maritime domain awareness activities or search and rescue drills,' Stephen Nagy, a regional security expert at the International Christian University in Japan, told VOA by phone. In January, Vietnam and the Philippines signed an agreement aimed at boosting cooperation between their coast guard forces to prevent incidents in the South China Sea. Then in August, Manila and Hanoi held their first joint coast guard drill, focusing on firefighting, rescue and medical response in Manila Bay. In addition to bilateral cooperation between the Philippines and Vietnam, some regional observers say all Southeast Asian countries that have competing territorial claims with China in the South China Sea should explore the possibility of establishing a regional alliance. Such a mechanism 'could potentially evolve into a coast guard alliance specifically designed to address China’s actions in the region, and such a coalition would present a more formidable deterrent and could more effectively safeguard the interests of these nations in the South China Sea,' Duan Dang, a Vietnam-based maritime security analyst, told VOA in a written response. However, he said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 'appears too weak and divided' on issues related to the South China Sea to present a united front. As the U.S. and Japan both gear up for major elections in the coming weeks, Nagy thinks China is also trying to use this 'window of opportunity' to try to 'lock in some strategic gains' in the South China Sea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/beijing-tests-regional-resolve-in-south-china-sea-amid-middle-east-conflict/7809345.html	2024-10-03T10:55:24-07:00

WHO launches plan to tackle growing threat of dengue, other diseases	GENEVA — The World Health Organization launched a global plan Thursday to address the growing threat of dengue and other deadly arboviruses, which have affected millions of people around the world and put billions more at risk. 'The rapid spread of dengue and other arboviral diseases in recent years is an alarming trend that demands a coordinated response across sectors and across borders,' said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. An arbovirus is a virus that is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, ticks, or other arthropods, such as crustaceans, insects and arachnids. Dengue has emerged as the most problematic arbovirus disease. The WHO notes the number of cases has nearly doubled each year since 2021, with over 12.3 million cases at the end of August of this year, including more than 6,000 deaths. The WHO aims to 'turn the tide' against dengue and arboviral diseases, Tedros said, noting that the measures in the proposal could 'protect vulnerable populations and pave the way for a healthier future.' The WHO chief said everyone has a role to play in the fight against dengue, 'from maintaining clean environments to supporting vector control and seeking and providing timely medical care.' 'Factors such as unplanned urbanization and poor water, sanitation and hygiene practices, climate change and international travel, are facilitating the rapid geographical spread of dengue,' Dr. Raman Velayudhan, WHO unit head, global program on control of neglected tropical diseases, told journalists in Geneva Tuesday, in advance of the plan’s launch. 'The disease is now endemic in more than 130 countries,' he said. 'Similar trends are also observed for other arboviral diseases, such as Zika, chikungunya, and more recently, the Oropouche virus disease, especially in the Americas.' Dengue is endemic in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific and the Americas. The WHO says the majority of dengue cases, as well as several other arboviruses, have been reported from the American region this year. WHO officials say the situation is also of concern in Africa, 'where countries are battling multiple diseases amid conflict and natural disasters,' placing additional strain on already fragile health systems. The Africa CDC reports more than 15,000 cases of dengue have been recorded in 13 African countries this year. 'This global escalation underscores the urgent need for a robust strategy to mitigate risks and safeguard populations taking into account that urban centers are at greater risk,' Velayudhan said. Dengue is a viral infection that spreads from mosquitoes to people. Most people who get dengue get better in one to two weeks. However, some people who develop severe cases can die. According to the WHO, prevention is the best protection from dengue. It recommends people avoid mosquito bites, especially during the day, 'by covering up.' Chikungunya, a virus spread by Aedes mosquitoes, has been reported in 118 countries, with the highest circulation found in Brazil. Dr. Diana Rojas Alvarez, team lead on arboviruses, epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention at the WHO, notes newborns, elderly and people with pre-existing conditions 'have been identified as a risk factor for poor disease outcome.' Besides chikungunya, she said Zika and Oropouche, which are spreading widely in the Americas, have symptoms similar to dengue and 'can be easily misdiagnosed in areas with co-circulation of multiple arboviruses.' To avoid misidentifying those diseases, she said it is critical for countries to strengthen their detection, surveillance, and testing activities and 'to make sure populations know which measures to take to protect themselves and their communities.' The World Health Organization says the global escalation of arboviral diseases underscores the urgent need for 'a robust strategy to mitigate risks and safeguard populations.' It urges governments to implement five components of its strategic global plan: Emergency coordination activities, collaborative detection and surveillance, community protection and prevention measures, safe and scalable care to prevent illness and death, and access to countermeasures, such as the promotion of research for improved treatments and vaccines. The WHO estimates $55 million will be required to put the plan into action over the next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-launches-plan-to-tackle-growing-threat-of-dengue-other-diseases/7809252.html	2024-10-03T09:42:01-07:00	
Trump, Harris stances on China differ, but not completely	The United States’ policy on China has been mostly consistent from the administration of Donald Trump to the White House of Joe Biden — with both presidents viewing China as America’s biggest competitor. But in the race for the next president, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have slightly different approaches toward the global superpower. VOA’s Elizabeth Lee explains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-harris-stances-on-china-differ-but-not-completely/7809235.html	2024-10-03T09:29:46-07:00	
Taliban FM to be ‘chief guest’ in Russia-hosted Afghanistan talks	Islamabad, Pakistan — Russia is set to convene a meeting of regional countries on Friday to discuss, among other issues, the expansion of 'practical interaction' with Taliban-governed Afghanistan in political, economic, counterterrorism and counternarcotics areas. Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi will participate as the 'chief guest' in what will be the sixth round of the 'Moscow Format' of consultations on Afghanistan, reported Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, on the eve of the gathering. Russia launched the Moscow Format in 2017, and it has since become a regular platform for discussion of challenges facing impoverished, war-torn Afghanistan. Zakharova told reporters in the Russian capital on Wednesday that special representatives and senior officials from China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan will attend the gathering. She said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will preside over the closed-door meeting, and that 'the main focus of the discussions' would be advancing the Afghan national reconciliation process. Zakharova also said, without elaborating, that Lavrov plans to hold bilateral talks separately with Muttaqi and his team on key areas of collaboration between Moscow and Kabul. Muttaqi’s office in Kabul reported separately that he is scheduled to meet Lavrov on the sidelines of the Moscow Format gathering. Moscow has established close informal ties with the Taliban since the former insurgents regained control of Afghanistan three years ago, following the withdrawal of U.S.-led coalition troops after almost two decades of war. Russia, however, has not recognized the Taliban as a legitimate government, in line with international consensus on the issue. But the Russian foreign and justice ministries submitted a proposal to President Vladimir Putin in June to remove the Taliban from Russia’s list of designated terrorist organizations. Taliban officials confirmed last week that they had formally sought to join the coming Russia-led summit of the BRICS intergovernmental group of major emerging economies. There has been no public response from Moscow. The Taliban said that Afghanistan is a developing country and needs to attend forums like BRICS to help improve the national economy. The leaders of the 10-nation BRICS, whose original members were Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, are set to convene October 22-24 in the southwestern Russian city of Kazan. The U.S. remains opposed to any step toward easing sanctions or moving toward recognition of the Taliban as Afghanistan’s rightful government. 'We have been very clear that we judge the Taliban by what they do, not by what they say,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said last week while responding to the de facto Afghan government’s bid to attend BRICS. She reiterated that the Taliban would need to improve its human rights record to win international legitimacy and be removed from sanctions lists so they can rejuvenate the Afghan economy. 'Afghanistan cannot strengthen its economy unless women are able to participate in all aspects of society without limitations,' stated Jean-Pierre. 'So, we will continue to engage with the Taliban on matters of our interest — for example, on respect for the rights of women and girls and the return of wrongfully detained U.S. citizens — and that's how we're going to move forward with them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-fm-to-be-chief-guest-in-russia-hosted-afghanistan-talks/7809205.html	2024-10-03T09:00:15-07:00	
Pressure to hold elections motivating, Bangladesh student leader tells VOA	Dhaka — Along Dhaka’s chaotic roads, where cycle rickshaws and dilapidated double-deckers compete for space with honking cars and scurrying pedestrians, brightly painted graffiti tells the story of the protests that in just over five weeks ended the 15-year rule of Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The uprising, popularly known in Bangladesh as the 'July 36 Revolution,' began as a student-led protest against a job quota system on July 1. It ended on August 5 with Hasina fleeing to India on a helicopter, as millions of people angered by the regime's deadly crackdown on students descended on the capital calling for the prime minister's ouster. Nahid Islam, a 26-year-old student leader who announced the mass movement's demand for Hasina's resignation on August 3, is one of two student leaders who are part of a 19-member 'advisory council' – in effect, an interim government – headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. 'My lifestyle has changed drastically,' 26-year-old Islam told VOA in his office Sunday about the dramatic shift from student politics to running two ministries. The young activist is heading the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology as well as the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. 'In the case of government, it’s an official set up, and again we are re-learning how to work for the people,' said the casually dressed Islam. 'So, we have organizational capacity and that is being put to work right now but the government has different rules, there is a bureaucratic setup. We have started working in the system and are trying to adjust.' He was also trying to change the system, Islam said. His 100-day plan includes breaking down silos to increase communication with lower-level officials, investigating corruption in government projects, expanding internet access, and getting rid of draconian cybersecurity and media laws. 'If we cannot realize those wishes, we will not be fulfilling people’s demands,' Islam said, adding that without necessary reforms, the next elected government will not be able to function well. However, the advisory council is under pressure from political parties to return the nation of 170 million people to democracy. After years of facing crackdowns, major parties like Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamat-e-Islami have resumed political activities. Party leaders have expressed support for the advisory council but are also pushing for elections. 'This pressure should be on us,' said Islam. 'If we face the pressure, we will also actively work to pave the way for elections,' Islam told VOA. Islam said the entire reform program of the interim government which includes electoral, judicial, and police reforms could take more than a year to implement. He said the bureaucracy needs to be cleansed of norms installed by Hasina's Awami League party that allowed corruption and politicization of government institutions. Bangladesh's military chief Wakar-Uz-Zaman told Reuters last month the country could head to polls within 18 months. Speaking to VOA Bangla earlier this week, Yunus refused to say when his interim government of academics, technocrats, student leaders, and rights defenders will hand over charge to a democratically elected government. Despite enjoying mass support, Islam said student leaders of the mass movement are currently not focusing on turning the alliance into a political party for the next elections. 'The people have a desire to see the students in political leadership but actually we are not paying attention to this issue right now,' the young leader said. 'After the goals of the uprising are achieved or the nation has been reconstructed, the students will decide how they want to proceed.' Several hundred people died between July and early August as the outgoing regime used deadly force against protesters across Bangladesh. Dozens of policemen were killed in revenge attacks. Anger at Hasina's Awami League is still high as hospitals across the country continue to treat injured protesters, most suffering from bullet and pellet gun wounds. While anti-Awami League students now have access to power, many student leaders of Awami League's student wing, known as the Bangladesh Chhatra League, now face the risk of attacks. Last month a mob beat a former organizing secretary of the Chhatra League for allegedly supporting violence against the protesters in July. The student leader died hours later. Another student leader told VOA he is afraid to go to his hostel on the Dhaka University campus. Islam said the Awami League may still have a role in Bangladesh's democracy but not without accountability. 'We have not banned Awami League so far. But since the party and its beneficiary class are involved in mass killings, they should face the law. Those who are found to be guilty will face punishment according to the law and those who are found to be innocent, they will continue to enjoy their democratic rights.' In a show of anger, student groups marked Hasina's birthday on September 28 by throwing shoes at her images. In Dhaka, a giant mural of the former leader next to an equally huge painting of her father, Shaikh Mujib, the founder of Bangladesh, has a garland of shoes hanging over it. Hasina is facing more than 200 cases. The list of cases against her party leaders, many of whom have fled, continues to grow. Islam, who was abducted and tortured in July – allegedly by intelligence agencies notorious for extrajudicial actions, believes justice will heal the nation. 'Everything will be decided by the courts,' said Islam, 'Through such a process society will achieve reconciliation.' Across Bangladesh's capital, messages of defiance, hope, and people power painted on walls celebrate hard-won political freedom. They are also a reminder of the burden of expectations that Islam and his fellow interim leaders carry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pressure-to-hold-elections-motivating-bangladesh-student-leader-tells-voa/7809199.html	2024-10-03T08:52:46-07:00

Denmark jails 2 Swedish teens over blasts near Israeli Embassy	COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Two Swedish teenagers were jailed Thursday in pretrial detention in connection with two predawn explosions in the vicinity of the Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen a day earlier. Prosecutors said investigators were establishing 'whether the motive could be a terror attack.' No one was injured in the blasts on early Wednesday in a neighborhood with several foreign diplomatic missions, although the nearby Jewish school was closed following the explosions. The pair, who cannot be identified under a court order, were ordered held for 27 days. They faced preliminary charges of possessing illegal weapons and carrying five hand grenades. Two of the grenades blew up when the suspects threw them at a house near the embassy, prosecutor Soren Harbo said. 'This was pretty close to the Israeli Embassy,' Harbo said before Thursday's court hearing. The explosions caused damage to a roof terrace of a nearby house. The diplomatic mission was not harmed. Thursday's hearing was held behind closed doors after the preliminary charges were read. Reporting from inside the court room, Danish broadcaster DR said the teenagers, ages 16 and 19, are suspected of acting 'in association and together with prior agreement with one or more perpetrators.' Both denied the charges, local media reported. The two suspects were arrested Wednesday shortly before noon on a train at Copenhagen's central station. Danish media ran photos of a man in a white hazmat suit being taken away by police on a train platform at the station. A third suspect, age 19, who had been arrested near the embassy, has been released, police said Thursday. In Denmark, the charges are one step short of formal charges and allow authorities to keep criminal suspects in custody during an investigation. Separately, shots were fired late Tuesday at the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm. No one was injured. No arrests have been made. The Danish domestic security service, known by its acronym PET, said that 'Swedish authorities have assessed that at least one specific act directed at the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm, which was carried out by young criminals in Sweden, has links to Iran.' In May the Swedish domestic security agency SAPO accused Iran of using established criminal networks in Sweden as a proxy to target Israeli or Jewish people. The announcement came after the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm was sealed off in late January after what was then described as 'a dangerous object' was found on the grounds of the diplomatic mission. Swedish media said the object was a hand grenade. In a statement, PET said, 'If we have a state actor who gets young criminals to carry out actions aimed at Jewish targets in our neighboring country, then we can be concerned that this will also happen in Denmark.' In Stockholm, the operative of Sweden's domestic security agency SAPO, Fredrik Hallstrom, said, 'The latest incident at the Israeli Embassy is not classified as a terrorist crime at the moment.' His counterpart at the Swedish police's National Operations Department, Johan Olsson, told the same press conference that the charges were of 'aggravated weapons offenses, causing danger or other serious illegal threats and damage.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/denmark-jails-2-swedish-teens-over-blasts-near-israeli-embassy/7809092.html	2024-10-03T07:48:40-07:00	
Georgian parliament speaker signs anti-LGBTQ+ law after president refuses to	Tbilisi, Georgia — The speaker of the Georgian parliament signed into a law Thursday a bill that severely curtails LGBTQ+ rights in the country and mirrors legislation adopted in neighboring Russia. Shalva Papuashvili, the parliament speaker, said on social media that the legislation does 'not reflect current, temporary, changing ideas and ideologies, but is based on common sense, historical experience and centuries-old Christian, Georgian and European values.' Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili had refused to sign the bill and returned it to parliament on Wednesday. It was introduced by the governing Georgian Dream party and approved by lawmakers last month. The bill includes bans on same-sex marriages, adoptions by same-sex couples and public endorsement and depictions of LGBTQ+ relations and people in the media. It also bans gender-affirming care and changing gender designations in official documents. 'This law protects the rights of all citizens, including freedom of expression, so that the rights of others are not violated, which is the essence and idea of true democracy,' Papuashvili wrote. Parliament gave the legislation its final approval as Georgia, a largely conservative country where the Orthodox Church wields significant influence, prepares to vote in a parliamentary election. The law has been widely seen as an effort by the governing party to shore up support among conservative groups. It was decried by human rights advocates and LGBTQ+ activists, who said it further marginalized an already vulnerable community. By signing the law, Georgian Dream 'have taken homophobia to a new level, and that is political and institutional homophobia,' said Ana Tavadze, an activist with Tbilisi Pride, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group. Georgian Dream's aim is to 'fabricate' problems ahead of the election to distract people from 'their failure' to solve issues involving unemployment, education and healthcare, Tavadze told The Associated Press. The law has drawn comparisons with Russia, where the Kremlin has been highlighting what it calls traditional family values. Russian authorities in the last decade have banned public endorsement of 'nontraditional sexual relations' and introduced laws against gender-affirming care, among other measures. Its Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism by labeling what the authorities called the LGBTQ+ 'movement' operating in Russia as an extremist organization and banning it. In Georgia, the LGBTQ+ community has struggled even before the legislation was introduced. Demonstrations and violent outbursts against LGBTQ+ people have been common, and last year hundreds of opponents of gay rights stormed an LGBTQ+ festival in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, forcing the event's cancellation. This year, tens of thousands marched in Tbilisi to promote 'traditional family values.' A day after parliament gave its final approval to the anti-LGBTQ+ bill, transgender actor and model Kesaria Avramidze was stabbed to death in her apartment in Tbilisi. Rights advocates had worried that the bill would stoke more violence. Papuashvili, the parliament speaker, said that by not signing the bill, President Zourabichvili and the Georgian opposition 'did not have enough courage to openly express their opinion regarding this law.' Some analysts say parts of the Georgian opposition are walking a fine line ahead of the Oct. 26 election between condemning the move to curtail LGBTQ+ rights and not wanting to alienate some voters. Zourabichvili has long been at odds with the governing party and vetoed a 'foreign influence' law adopted by parliament earlier this year. She was overridden by parliament, where Georgian Dream dominates. The measure requires media and nongovernmental organizations to register as 'pursuing the interests of a foreign power' if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad. It ignited weeks of protests and was widely criticized as threatening democratic freedoms. Those opposing the law compared it to similar legislation in Russia which is routinely used to suppress dissent, and accused the governing party of acting in concert with Moscow, jeopardizing Georgia's chances of joining the European Union. The South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million formally applied to join the EU in 2022, after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but the bloc halted its accession in response to the 'foreign influence' law and froze some of its financial support. The United States imposed sanctions on dozens of Georgian officials in response to the law. Georgian Dream was set up by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia's prime minister in 2012. It promised to restore civil rights and 'reset' relations with Moscow, which fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008 over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Russia then recognized the independence of South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian province, Abkhazia, and established military bases there. Many Georgians backed Ukraine as Kyiv battled Russia's invasion in 2022. But the Georgian government abstained from joining sanctions against Moscow, barred dozens of Kremlin critics from entering the country, and accused the West of trying to drag Georgia into open conflict with Russia. The opposition has accused the governing party of steering the country into Russia's orbit to the detriment of its European aspirations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-parliament-speaker-signs-anti-lgbtq-law-after-president-refuses-to/7808951.html	2024-10-03T07:16:29-07:00	
Russia to try American accused of being Ukrainian mercenary in secret	MOSCOW — The trial of a 72-year-old American man whom Russia accuses of working as a mercenary for Ukraine will take place behind closed doors, and the verdict will be announced Monday, Russian state media reported. Stephen Hubbard is accused of signing a $1,000-per-month contract with a Ukrainian territorial defense unit in the city of Izyum in February 2022. He was captured by Russian forces in April that year, and he faces a sentence of seven to 15 years if convicted. The RIA news agency said the judge on Thursday accepted a prosecutor's request to hold the proceedings in secret to ensure the safety of the participants. It was not clear why the prosecutor believed an open trial would have placed them at risk. RIA said Hubbard himself supported the move, saying he did not want outsiders to be present. RIA reported earlier that he had pleaded guilty to the charges. Another state agency, TASS, said the verdict would come on October 7. A U.S. embassy spokesperson said: 'We are aware of reports of the arrest of an American citizen. Due to privacy restrictions, we are unable to comment any further.' Prosecutors have said Hubbard was provided with training, weapons and ammunition when he allegedly signed up. Hubbard's sister Patricia Fox and another relative have cast doubt on his reported confession, saying he held pro-Russian views and was unlikely to have taken up arms at his age. 'He never had a gun, owned a gun, done any of that. ... He's more of a pacifist,' Fox told Reuters last month. Hubbard is one of at least 10 U.S. nationals behind bars in Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-to-try-american-accused-of-being-ukrainian-mercenary-in-secret/7809004.html	2024-10-03T07:11:41-07:00

Kazakhstan seeks clarity from Russia over grain transit halt	ASTANA, Kazakhstan — Kazakhstan has halted grain exports to Russia, Kazakh officials said on Thursday, adding it has asked Moscow to prove claims it has breached rules on plant health, the reason cited by Moscow for an effective ban of imports and transit of Kazakh grain. Both Russia and Kazakhstan are net grain exporters, but Kazakhstan relies on transit through Russian territory to sell its grain in Europe and the Mediterranean. The two countries also tranship each others' oil to foreign markets. The Russian state agricultural watchdog said this week that from Sept. 23, its systems would automatically block the issuance of phytosanitary certificates for grain, grain products, sunflower seeds, tomatoes, and peppers from Kazakhstan. In the absence of such certificates, the goods cannot legally cross the border, and the Kazakh state railway company confirmed on Thursday that grain shipments to Russia have been halted. Kazakh deputy agriculture minister Yermek Kenzhekhanuly said the Astana government has requested more detailed information on the alleged violations, had not heard back from Moscow and therefore could not comment further on what some industry players have described as a potential trade war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kazakhstan-seeks-clarity-from-russia-over-grain-transit-halt/7808775.html	2024-10-03T02:35:45-07:00	
Vietnam protests Chinese attack on fishing vessels in South China Sea	WASHINGTON — Vietnam Wednesday protested China's reported behavior toward fishermen near the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea after Vietnamese state media said Chinese personnel boarded a Vietnamese fishing boat and beat crew members. The Vietnamese reporting said Chinese government personnel Sunday attacked the boat, leaving 10 fishermen with injuries, some serious. Vietnam’s state-run Tien Phong newspaper reported Tuesday that the fishermen said around 40 people from the foreign vessels beat them with iron pipes and took away their fishing equipment. Four Vietnamese fishermen from the central Vietnamese city of Quang Ngai were hospitalized with serious injuries, VietnamNet reported Tuesday. The newspaper cited Nguyen Thanh Bien, the vessel's captain, describing the two vessels as having the numbers '101' and '301.' 'On the morning of September 29, while operating in the waters, they spotted a foreign ship identified as number 301 pursuing them. Sensing danger, Bien ordered the crew to head back to Sa Ky port [on the seashore of Quang Ngai]. However, an additional foreign vessel with number 101 joined the pursuit, deploying three smaller boats to encircle them,' VietnamNet reported. 'They were beating us mercilessly. I raised my hands to defend myself, knowing we couldn’t fight back. After their attack, they forced us to the front of the ship and covered us with a tarp,' said Nguyen Thuong, 34, one the hospitalized fishermen, who suffered injuries to his left arm, according to VietnamNet. Vietnamese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokeswoman Pham Thu Hang said in her statement that Chinese law enforcement forces 'suppressed, injured, and confiscated property' of Vietnamese fishermen aboard the QNg 95739 TS fishing vessel of Quang Ngai province. 'Việt Nam is extremely concerned about, discontented with, and resolutely opposes the Chinese law enforcement force’s brutal behaviors towards the Vietnamese fishermen,' Hang said. 'The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sternly communicated with the Chinese Embassy in Hanoi, strongly opposed the abovementioned acts by the Chinese law enforcement force and demanded China to fully respect Vietnam’s sovereignty over the Hoàng Sa archipelago, quickly investigate and announce results to the Vietnamese side, and not repeat similar acts,' Hang added, using the Vietnamese name for the Paracel Islands. Two Chinese government vessels, the Sansha Zhifa 101 and Sansha Zhifa 301, have been identified as the ships that allegedly attacked a Vietnamese fishing crew on September 29, according to the geoint.asia and South China Sea expert Duan Dang. 'Two Chinese coast guard ships, Sansha Zhifa 101 and Sansha Zhifa 301, unprovokedly attacked Vietnamese fishermen and ships,' Hoang Viet, a lecturer with the University of Law of Ho Chi Minh City, told VOA by phone Wednesday. 'This clearly shows China's plot to monopolize the East Sea,' Hoang Viet said, using the Vietnamese name of the South China Sea. China's Foreign Affairs Ministry said Tuesday that Vietnamese fishing boats were fishing without Beijing’s permission, so Chinese authorities took measures to stop them, according to Reuters. 'The on-site operations were professional and restrained, and no injuries were found,' the ministry said, in response to a Reuters request for comment, without specifically referring to the attack. 'China’s assertion of its maritime claims are growing increasingly violent. Its law enforcement ships have been effectively turned into a paramilitary force, with authorization to use all available means to coerce its neighbors into submission,' Raymond Powell, founder and director of SeaLight, a project that monitors activities in the South China Sea, told VOA by text message Wednesday. 'It seems only a matter of time before someone is killed during one of these encounters,' Powell wrote. 'Vietnam government responded rather fast to the incident,' Hoang Viet, the law lecturer, said by phone. 'Vietnam always prioritizes its relationship with China, and it also puts its territorial sovereignty at a more important level.' 'China has never stopped its ambition to occupy the East Sea. Vietnam, as well as other Southeast Asian countries, are always in China's sights. When will it act? It's just a matter of time,' Hoang Viet said. Some information in this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-protests-chinese-attack-on-fishing-vessels-in-south-china-sea/7808763.html	2024-10-03T02:00:02-07:00	
VOA Interview: Muhammad Yunus on restoring order in Bangladesh	New York — After a series of student-led protests resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties, former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stepped down and fled the country on August 5. Days later, Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel laureate who pioneered the global microcredit movement, was sworn in as the nation’s interim leader. He spoke with Voice of America Bangla Service reporter Anis Ahmed on Friday in New York, where he explained his decision to grant temporary magistracy powers to the army to restore law and order after the police lost public trust. He also stressed the critical role of youth leadership in shaping the country's future. Yunus, who took office amid widespread unrest, highlighted key priorities such as strengthening relations with neighboring countries, holding elections, reforming the constitution and addressing the Rohingya refugee crisis. He confirmed that reforms and elections remained essential before power could be handed over to elected representatives. The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity: VOA: First, we would like to know that after nearly one and a half months of assuming this responsibility on August 8, you have now delegated magistracy power to army officers. Why do you feel it was necessary? Muhammad Yunus, chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh: To bring law and order to the country. We were trying to work it out through the police, which is normal. But the police have lost their moral courage because when they face people, they hear bitter words. Just a few days ago they killed some students, so they are distancing themselves — they don’t want to be out front. So, as they lost morale, we lost the strength of law and order. But as we’ve said before, not everyone in the police is responsible for wrongdoing. We will identify those who have done wrong. They will be brought to justice. But this is a long process; it’s not happening all of a sudden. And in the meantime, law and order is being violated — different types of violations are happening. We thought that if we allowed this to continue, then conditions would deteriorate, so the issue of giving powers to our army came up. We asked the army, and they agreed. They said, 'We're here, but no one is heeding us because we do not have any power. If we had some power, the people would be cautious.' We then gave them the magistracy power but for a limited period, for two months. That’s how it happened. VOA: So, you’re hopeful that the police service will return in two months? Yunus: Yes, I hope so. They’re not able to use their power; the army has come in and that’s not very pleasing for them that their duties are being performed by someone else. VOA: We know students took the role of leadership amid the unrest, and that there are student representatives in your government as well. But is it also true that we are seeing students trying to establish their authority in different sectors and institutions of the country? Are these students running the country? What role are they playing? Yunus: Yes, they should. The youth should assume authority. So far, the old people have made mistakes, so let there be an effort for youth to come forward and take responsibility. They might also make mistakes and then correct those, but their leadership ushered in big changes. So, I don’t find any reasons to doubt their capacity for leadership. VOA: So, can we say that the students are running your administration? Yunus: No, I didn’t say they are running the administration, I said they should. Let the youth take it. I have always said, even before I took this responsibility, that it should be in the hands of the youth because they will build their future. If we try to write the future for them, that would not be right. So, I’ll say again that not only in Bangladesh but in the entire world, youth should be given this responsibility. VOA: We haven’t heard anything from you regarding the duration of this interim government, but General Waqar-Uz-Zaman recently said an election would occur within the next 18 months. Are we safe to assume the interim government would dissolve at that time? Yunus: Well, if you want to presume, you may, but that’s not the decision of the government. The government has not given any opinion so far. The government needs to say when they would take a decision about their duration. VOA: The Advisory Committee to the interim government has yet to make any decisions? Yunus: We have discussed but no decisions have been taken yet. VOA: What are the plans of your government to improve relations with India? Yunus: We are telling them clearly that we want good relations with them. Because that is needed for India and for us, too. We are neighbors. If relations between neighbors are bad, it’s not good for any nation. It’s not good for them, nor for us. It’s in the interest of our two countries that our relations should be close and cordial. VOA: Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is in India. What steps are you taking to extradite her to Bangladesh? Yunus: This is a legal matter. Definitely we will want her back, wherever she might be, whenever we can legally implement the decision. VOA: After August 5, Bangabandhu Memorial Museum, once home to Hasina’s father but turned into a museum after his assasination there, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was destroyed. Your government subsequently canceled the national day of mourning. Obviously, some look on Rahman, in their words, as a fascist icon. But Rahman has long been recognized as the father of the nation. What’s the viewpoint of your interim government? Yunus: You’re talking about the past. Apparently, you don’t remember that a mass uprising has since taken place. You’re speaking as if it never happened. You need to see what’s happening in this new situation. You do not seem to have any questions about how many students have sacrificed their lives, why they sacrificed their lives. First, we must admit that they, the students, said that we have pushed a reset button. The past is gone for sure. Now we will build up in new way. People also want that. And this new way means we must bring reforms. VOA: We’ve paid respect to those killed during the student-led uprisings, and you have said that their killers will be brought to justice. But at the same time, after August 5, many others were killed. A short while ago we were talking about many police being killed. What steps are being taken by your government to bring the perpetrators to justice? Yunus: Whoever has committed a crime and wherever that might be, they will be brought to justice. If that’s not done, justice won’t be complete. To judge one type of crime and not another, that’s not acceptable. That would be a form of partisan justice. So, if we return to that kind of partisanship, the mass movement would have been meaningless. So, if crime is committed, the criminal will face the law. VOA: There are more than a million Rohingya currently displaced in Bangladesh. Will your government grant them refugee status? Yunus: International institutions have given them this status. The United Nations refugee agency [UNHCR] has been working there for a long time. So, they are refugees. They are not citizens of our country. VOA: But officially they are not recognized as refugees. Yunus: If they were not refugees, UNHCR couldn’t reach them. VOA: Thousands of Rohingya recently arrived in Bangladesh, and it is assumed that more are on the way. So, if more Rohingya enter Bangladesh, then what would be your decision? Yunus: According to international law, if they want to come, we will let them. We will accept them. And then we’ll do whatever is necessary. It’s not our problem alone. It is the responsibility of the entire world. When one’s life is at stake, one seeks refuge. We cannot close doors on them. You know, it’s been going on for ages. They have been here for the last seven years. Questions are being raised about their future and the future of their children. Nearly 32,000 Rohingya children are born here every year, so the Rohingya community is growing, even independently of new arrivals. When they came, they brought infant children with them. They, too, have grown up. What are you going to do about them? They can’t even see their future. Because of high-tech media they can see the entire world, but they’re confined like in a prison. They may grow angry; they may grow rebellious. This is not a good thing. We don’t know how it’s going to spread, where it will go. We really don’t know, so the whole world should focus on how to help them have a satisfying life. We are looking for a solution. VOA: There are discussions about constitutional amendments. You've even established a committee about it. Is it going to happen during your interim government’s time and what kind of changes or amendments are you expecting? Yunus: As I said before, we must begin everything anew. The previous government destroyed everything. So, from that destruction we need to rise afresh. That’s why we are establishing commissions for all fields. We have made six commissions; more commissions will come soon. Of those, one commission is on the constitution. The whole country wants the constitution to be amended. However, the topic may be subject to debate. That’s why the commission will create guidelines for those debates. That will give the country an opportunity to debate on it so that the political parties can give their opinion and can decide whether they are going to amend right now or later, and what exactly they would do. The constitution that we have now will not be helpful. If the country runs according to the present constitution, the same situation will happen again. VOA: Some people are talking about changing the constitution, others are talking about amending it. Whatever happens, how is it going to be implemented? Yunus: It is a matter of law. What we are now doing is not on the process of implementation, we are focusing on why we need it. When they sit for discussion, they will decide those matters from a legal perspective. We are trying to reach a unanimous opinion on what exactly we need. Then there will be another round of discussion on the legal process. VOA: What are your main objectives as interim leader? Yunus: My main objectives are to bring in reforms, to arrange an election and hand over the power to the elected representatives. VOA: The chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh, Dr. Muhammad Yunus, thank you so much on behalf of Voice of America. Yunus: Thanks to you, too.

EU to vote on tariff hike for Chinese EVs as Germany fears retaliation	Vienna — The European Union is set to vote Friday on a massive tariff increase on Chinese electric vehicles that Germany fears could spark a trade war with Beijing. Reuters reported Wednesday that the measure already has enough votes to pass, with support from France, Greece, Italy and Poland, whose populations make up 39% of the EU. At least 65% of the EU's population must vote against the tariff plan to stop it. Regardless, analysts say, continued negotiations will be needed on China's subsidies to its EV industry. On Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin called Chinese subsidies 'unbearable.' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday said talks with China must continue, and he indicated Germany might abstain from the vote. 'More trade with more partners from more countries — that's what sensible risk management looks like in an uncertain world,' Scholz said, as reported by Reuters. 'That's why negotiations with China on electric vehicles must continue and why we must finally tackle the areas where cheap Chinese imports are harming our economy, for example steel,' he said. Bloomberg reported that Germany expected a significant number of EU states to abstain from voting on the tariffs. German automakers are against tariffs, fearing that retaliation from Beijing could impact access to China, their largest market. German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said Wednesday 'A trade war with China would do us more harm than good for a key European industry and a crucial sector in Germany.' If the vote passes, it could see tariffs on Chinese EVs as high as 45%. Beijing has hinted that it could retaliate with tariffs on German and Italian vehicles and on European agricultural products such as dairy, pork and French brandy. Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao visited Europe in late September and met with officials and businesspeople in charge of foreign trade and commerce in the EU, Belgium, Germany, Italy and other auto-manufacturing countries to lobby the EU to abandon the tariffs. During the negotiations, the Chinese side proposed to set a minimum import price, but the European side refused. The vote was pushed from September 25 to Friday to allow time for more consultation between the two sides. Analysts believe the EU may make some compromises due to the complex interests within the EU. Ja Ian Chong, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, told VOA, 'Because the EU is made up of many national entities with cross-cutting interests, these may lead to the vetoing of tougher action, much the same way ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is ineffective in the face of PRC (People's Republic of China) pressure.' Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said during a visit to Beijing in early September that he would urge the European Commission to reconsider raising tariffs on China's EVs. Francesco Sisci, an Italian Sinologist, told VOA that the centrifugal forces of member states and political parties within the EU are too strong to make difficult decisions. In the past, the EU 'was ruled by a solid majority centered around People's parties and Social-Democratic parties and a triangle made of Germany, France and Italy, Sisci said. 'Both these two architectures are now partially shattered.' 'The People's parties and Social-Democratic parties have still a majority but a thin one,' he said. 'Italy, with a right leaning government, didn't vote for the present President of the commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and it is dragging its feet on many EU policies.' 'Germany and France have governments at home that are under siege from new rightist parties,' he added. Sisci told VOA Mandarin that Germany's car industry 'is dependent on the sales in the Chinese market and yet risks being squeezed out of all markets because of the Chinese EV competition. There are no good or clear alternatives.' Although China's EVs have a price advantage in the European market, Chinese businesspeople working in the automotive industry there are more cautious. Yang is a Chinese businessman in Austria who does automobile maintenance, annual inspection and second-hand car trading. He did not give his full name because of privacy concerns. Yang said that because of Europe’s economic downturn, consumers there are careful with their money and will not easily replace their gasoline-powered vehicles with all-electric vehicles. 'Many European consumers choose hybrid electric vehicles,' Yang said, talking about his own business. 'This year's data report shows that the sales of all-electric vehicles have decreased by one-third, while hybrid electric vehicles have increased.' He said tariffs will certainly affect the price of Chinese electric vehicles in Europe, but European consumers are more concerned about other factors such as the life and endurance of the car. 'All-electric vehicles may not be a big market in Europe,' he said. The EU's vote comes after a probe into China's subsidies for the industry and 100% tariff hikes on Chinese EV imports to the U.S. and Canada.

In India, pride in Harris’s run for US presidency, but excitement missing	NEW DELHI — In the small South Indian village of Thulasendrapuram, where U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris’s maternal grandfather once lived, locals and priests have prayed to the local deity at a Hindu temple for her victory as she runs for the U.S. presidency. In the capital, New Delhi, many express pride that one of the candidates for the world’s most powerful office has Indian roots – she is the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father. But Harris has failed to enthuse others who feel she never built on her Indian connection during her vice presidency. 'It’s quite exciting for someone like me who is a common girl around town,' said New Delhi resident, Simran Singh. Another city resident, Nandita Soni, and her husband watched Harris debate her opponent, former U.S. President Donald Trump, last month. 'I think she won hands down. Of course, there is a sense of pride for us. That she is, firstly, a woman and then of Indian heritage, feels really good,' Soni said. Harris is not the only Indian connection to the American presidential race. Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance, is also the daughter of Indian immigrants. Not many in India have heard of Usha Vance. Those who have, see it as a tribute to a country where immigrants can make a mark. 'I think both of them having a role in the elections is a very good thing for our Indian heritage and diaspora, but I think it is much more important for the American system,' said Shyam Bajpai, a retired professional. He praises Harris for 'reviving the Democrat Party’s energy after a very difficult moment with Mr. Biden.' However, the euphoria witnessed in India four years ago when Harris became vice president is missing. She hosted a luncheon for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year during his state visit to Washington, where she spoke of her deep personal connection to India. In interviews she has said that her introduction to the concepts of equality, freedom and democracy came from her Indian grandfather during her visits to her maternal family’s hometown, Chennai, when she was young. But some point out that she neither visited India during her tenure as vice president nor emphasized her Indian identity much while in office. 'To be honest we did not hear much of her in India, because as vice president, her connections with India were not all that great,' said Pradeep Bhargava, a New Delhi resident. 'We were not getting much news about her.' That may be why many young Indians ask: Who is Kamala Harris? 'I think she is not on social media,' said Simar Kaur, an undergraduate student in Delhi University. 'I get most of the news from social media only.' But IT professionals who have long eyed the United States for career opportunities are excited about the possibility of an American president with roots in India. 'I am sure this will help in more job opportunities for Indians in the future,' said software engineer Vishal Chabra. 'It will be good for India as well.' Those who are tracking the U.S. race see Harris’s bid as another huge milestone for its diaspora in Western countries -- Rishi Sunak, who became British Prime Minister in 2022 but lost in July, was also of Indian origin. They also point to the success of Indian Americans who have risen to the top of the corporate ladder in the U.S., heading companies like Google. 'With UK also and now America, Indians are all the way, and it is the way to go from them,' said Soni.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-india-pride-in-harris-s-run-for-us-presidency-but-excitement-missing/7808740.html	2024-10-03T00:07:33-07:00

Singapore's disgraced former transport minister jailed for 12 months in landmark case	SINGAPORE — A Singapore court on Thursday sentenced a former minister to 12 months in prison for obstructing justice and receiving more than $300,000 worth of gifts, in the first jailing of an ex-cabinet member in a city-state famous for its clean governance. S. Iswaran, who was a cabinet member for 13 years and has held the trade, communications and transport portfolios, pleaded guilty last week to four counts of improperly receiving gifts and one of obstructing justice. The sentence handed down was more severe than the six to seven months sought by the prosecution, which presiding judge Vincent Hoong said was 'manifestly inadequate' given the gravity of Iswaran's offenses and their impact on public trust. 'Trust and confidence in public institutions were the bedrock of effective governance, which could all too easily be undermined by the appearance that an individual public servant had fallen below the standards of integrity and accountability,' he said in sentencing Iswaran. The case has shocked Singapore, which prides itself on having a well-paid and efficient bureaucracy as well as strong and squeaky clean governance. It was among the world's top five least corrupt countries last year, according to Transparency International's corruption perception index. The last corruption case involving a Singaporean minister was in 1986, when its national development minister was investigated for alleged bribery but died before any charges were filed in court. The investigation caused a stir in the Asian financial hub and centered on allegations Iswaran while transport minister accepted expensive gifts from businessmen that included tickets to English Premier League soccer matches, the Singapore Formula 1 Grand Prix, London musicals and a ride on a private jet. Iswaran, 62, faced a huge media scrum as he arrived in court and declined to answer questions. He showed no emotion during the court session. The judge allowed him to remain on bail for the next few days and begin his jail term on Monday. Iswaran had initially said he was innocent and would fight to clear his name but pleaded guilty last week to the five charges put before the court. The former minister faced a total of 35 charges, two of which were corruption-related but were later amended to charges of receiving gifts while a public servant. The attorney-general's chambers last week said they made amendments because of litigation risks involved in proving the corruption charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Iswaran was arrested in July last year and was accused of taking kickbacks from businessmen including property tycoon Ong Beng Seng. Iswaran was an adviser to the Singapore Grand Prix's steering committee, while Ong owns the rights to the race. Ong has not been charged with any offense and has issued no public comment on the allegations. The attorney-general's chambers last week said it would decide whether to take action against Ong soon. Judge Hoong in his ruling said there was a higher level of culpability when a public servant holds high office that wield greater influence over business transactions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/singapore-s-disgraced-former-transport-minister-jailed-for-12-months-in-landmark-case/7808732.html	2024-10-02T23:10:52-07:00

Supporters demand release of highly regarded Cambodian journalist	Bangkok — Cambodia this week has seen an outpouring of support from journalists, media groups and embassies for Mech Dara, one of the country’s last remaining independent journalists, who recently was taken into custody and charged with incitement. The U.S. Embassy in Cambodia posted on social media platform X that it was deeply troubled by Monday’s arrest and called for Dara’s release. 'He is a leading voice against human trafficking & online scams,' the embassy posted on X, noting that he was presented with an award by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken last year for his work to combat human trafficking. Describing Dara as an advocate for the freedom of expression that is guaranteed in Cambodia’s constitution, the embassy added, 'We encourage authorities to engage [with] diverse voices & foster a free, independent press.' Cambodian-state media confirmed that Dara, 36, was charged with incitement related to social media posts he made at the end of September. He is now in pre-trial detention and could face up to two years in prison for his alleged offenses. Local media quoted a family member saying Dara’s car was stopped while he was traveling from Sihanoukville to Phnom Penh and that police arrived in a military vehicle and five other cars. The relative said police cited an arrest warrant, seized Dara’s phone and asked his family members to stay in their car. He has since been taken to a prison in Kandal Province, outside Phnom Penh, where he will remain until his trial. The Phnom Penh provincial court issued a statement saying Dara has been charged under two articles of Cambodia’s criminal code for incitement to provoke serious social disorder. It said Dara has admitted his guilt. His arrest came a day after authorities in Prey Veng accused Dara of posting 'fake news.' The journalist had posted a photo on Facebook showing destroyed concrete stairs leading to a pagoda that serves as a religious site and tourist destination in the province. Neil Loughlin, an assistant professor in comparative politics at City University of London who specializes in Southeast Asia, described Dara as one of Cambodia’s most respected journalists. 'His posts related to alleged damage to a temple site cut through, because there is a lot of this kind of thing in the country, where resource extraction and wealth concentration in the hands of the country’s elite is a central part of its elite political settlement,' Loughlin told VOA. But a spokesman for Cambodia’s Ministry of Information said in a statement that Dara was charged for incitement intended to cause serious unrest impacting social security. The statement said the actions Dara is charged with are not a 'journalism related affair.' It added that 'falsifying information and posting incident messages that distort the truth, slander, fabricate false information that is done with malicious intent to ignite anger among the public with confusions and misconceptions are not considered as freedom of expression.' Over the years, Dara’s investigative reporting has focused on human trafficking and its connection to illegal scam operations in Cambodia. Dara was once detained by police while reporting on the activities of a scam center in Sihanoukville. One of his best-known stories saw him link Cambodian tycoon and senator Ly Yong Phat to scam compounds. The U.S. imposed sanctions on the businessman in September. Cambodia is home to scam centers that have operated in several cities, towns and provinces throughout the country. These include 'pig butchering,' in which victims generally are contacted via the internet and enticed to gradually invest in fake and fraudulent schemes over a period of time. According to a report by the United States Institute of Peace, 100,000 scammers have been involved in pig butchering in Cambodia, generating income estimated at $12.8 billion in 2023. But Chou Bun Eng, the permanent vice chair of Cambodia’s National Committee for Counter Trafficking, told the pro-government newspaper Khmer Times in March that 80% of human trafficking cases they’ve investigated are 'false.' Journalists like Dara have long faced security risks when covering the illegal scam centers in Cambodia or reporting on other matters that show the government in a bad light. In 2020, journalist Sok Oudom was convicted and sentenced to 20 months in prison for broadcasting false news with the intent to cause incitement. In 2021, reporter Khou Piseth was charged with incitement for criticizing officials on Facebook over COVID-19 measures. The same year saw Youn Chhiv sentenced to one year in prison for incitement to cause a felony after he made a Facebook post criticizing a provincial court prosecutor. 'The vague charge of incitement has often been used by Cambodian authorities to target critics, including journalists,' Beh Lih Yi, Asia program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, told VOA via email. 'Arresting one of Cambodia's best-known journalists on vague charges like incitement is a clear attempt to muzzle any remaining independent reporting left in the country,' she wrote. Loughlin said incitement charges are typical of the government’s tactics against dissenting voices. 'The charge of incitement to social unrest is telling. Over the past decade, as part of the broader crackdown on dissent, the CPP government has promoted a narrative of stability to legitimate its use of coercion to silence those who criticise it or shine a light on corruption etc.,' he wrote to VOA. 'It uses this narrative to legitimize its repressive control over the country in perpetuity, with anybody who the government doesn’t like targeted for repression, justified in the name of that stability,' he added. Cambodia has been ruled by the same political party, the Cambodia People Party (CPP), since 1979 and has maintained its grip on power by banning opposition parties and cracking down on dissidents. The CPP shared power with co-prime ministers from 1993-97 with a royalist party. Hun Manet came into power in 2023, taking over as prime minister from his father Hun Sen, who led Cambodia for nearly 40 years. Reporters without Borders, a media watchdog that ranks 180 countries and territories worldwide for their level of press freedom, has ranked Cambodia at 151, a lowly position in its World Press Freedom Index for 2024. Cambodia's Ministry of Information says the country has taken a firm stand to promote the freedom of the press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supporters-demand-release-of-highly-regarded-cambodian-journalist-/7808721.html	2024-10-02T22:15:29-07:00

Israel’s threat to retaliate against Iran triggers panic buying at Iranian gas stations	WASHINGTON — Israel’s vow to make Iran pay a price for carrying out a large-scale missile strike on the Jewish state has prompted panic buying of gasoline in major Iranian cities and the temporary closure of Iranian airspace to all commercial flights. Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel after nightfall on Tuesday, in a major escalation of a yearlong conflict between Israel and Iran’s regional proxy forces. The Israeli military intercepted most of the missiles with help from allied U.S. naval forces. Speaking late Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran’s Islamist rulers had made a 'big mistake' by attacking his nation. Other Israeli officials warned those rulers to expect a powerful and painful response. Israel’s threats sparked long lines of cars outside gas stations in major Iranian cities as drivers rushed to fill their vehicles’ tanks. One video posted to social media and vetted by VOA Persian showed dozens of cars waiting to fill up at a gas station in Tehran, apparently on Wednesday. Other social media clips reviewed by VOA Persian appeared to show similar long lines of vehicles outside gas stations late Tuesday in the Tehran provincial city of Eslamshahr and in the central city of Isfahan. VOA could not independently confirm the panic buying at the gas stations seen in the videos because it is barred from operating inside Iran. In another apparent reaction to Israel’s threat of a retaliatory strike, Iran shut its airspace to all domestic and international flights after completing its missile attack. The Iranian Civil Aviation Organization’s Aerospace Committee said in a Wednesday statement that flights would remain suspended until at least 5 a.m. local time on Thursday to 'maintain the safety of passengers.' Western media reported on Wednesday that Israel may target Iran’s oil and other energy facilities in its threatened retaliation. There was no confirmation from Israel. Any Israeli strike on Iranian oil or gas infrastructure would have a big economic impact on the country, according to Kpler’s Homayoun Falakshahi, a senior oil analyst for the Belgium-based global trade data firm. In a message to VOA, Falakshahi said Iran sources most of its gasoline from domestically produced oil that it refines into petroleum products. Iran’s Islamist rulers also rely heavily on revenue from energy exports to major customers such as China, a practice they have maintained for years in defiance of U.S. sanctions. Tehran has shipped an average of 1.54 million barrels of crude oil and gas condensate per day for the year to date, according to Falakshahi. Iran does not publish official data on its energy exports as part of its efforts to circumvent sanctions. Kpler uses a variety of sources to estimate those Iranian exports, such as location data from oil tankers' Automatic Identification System transponders, satellite imagery, and information provided by personnel at ports. The impact of an Israeli attack on Iran's energy exports would depend on whether Israel targets export infrastructure, Falakshahi said. 'For now, I don’t think such an attack will be the case, because China would get quite upset,' he added. This story was produced in collaboration with VOA’s Persian Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-threat-to-retaliate-against-iran-triggers-panic-buying-at-iranian-gas-stations/7808689.html	2024-10-02T20:35:04-07:00
