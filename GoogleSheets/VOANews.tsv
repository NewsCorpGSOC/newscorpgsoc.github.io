A week after Helene hit, thousands still without water struggle to find enough	ASHEVILLE, North Carolina — Nearly a week after Hurricane Helene brought devastation to western North Carolina, a shiny stainless steel tanker truck in downtown Asheville attracted residents carrying 19-liter containers, milk jugs and buckets to fill with what has become a desperately scare resource — drinking water. Flooding tore through the city's water system, destroying so much infrastructure that officials said repairs could take weeks. To make do, Anna Ramsey arrived Wednesday with her two children, who each left carrying plastic bags filled with 7.6 liters of water. 'We have no water. We have no power. But I think it's also been humbling,' Ramsey said. Helene's path through the Southeast left a trail of power outages so large the darkness was visible from space. Tens of trillions of liters of rain fell and more than 200 people were killed, making Helene the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005. Hundreds of people are still unaccounted for, and search crews must trudge through knee-deep debris to learn whether residents are safe. It also damaged water utilities so severely and over such a wide inland area that one federal official said the toll 'could be considered unprecedented.' As of Thursday, about 136,000 people in the Southeast were served by a nonoperational water provider and more than 1.8 million were living under a boil water advisory, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Western North Carolina was especially hard hit. Officials are facing a difficult rebuilding task made harder by the steep, narrow valleys of the Blue Ridge Mountains that during a more typical October would attract throngs of fall tourists. 'The challenges of the geography are just fewer roads, fewer access points, fewer areas of flat ground to stage resources' said Brian Smith, acting deputy division director for the EPA's water division in the Southeast. After days without water, people long for more than just a sponge bath. 'I would love a shower,' said Sue Riles in Asheville. 'Running water would be incredible.' The raging floodwaters of Helene destroyed crucial parts of Asheville's water system, scouring out the pipes that convey water from a reservoir in the mountains above town that is the largest of three water supplies for the system. To reach a second reservoir that was knocked offline, a road had to be rebuilt. Boosted output from the third source restored water flow in some southern Asheville neighborhoods Friday, but without full repairs schools may not be able to resume in-person classes, hospitals may not restore normal operations, and the city's hotels and restaurants may not fully reopen. Even water that's unfit to drink is scarce. Drew Reisinger, the elected Buncombe County register of deeds, worries about people in apartments who can't easily haul a bucket of water from a creek to flush their toilet. Officials are advising people to collect nondrinkable water for household needs from a local swimming pool. 'One thing no one is talking about is the amount of poop that exists in every toilet in Asheville,' he said. 'We're dealing with a public health emergency.' It's a situation that becomes more dangerous the longer it lasts. Even in communities fortunate enough to have running water, hundreds of providers have issued boil water notices indicating the water could be contaminated. But boiling water for cooking and drinking is time consuming and small mistakes can cause stomach illness, according to Natalie Exum, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 'Every day that goes by, you could be exposed to a pathogen,' Exum said. 'These basic services that we take for granted in our everyday lives actually do do a lot to prevent illness.' Travis Edwards' faucet worked immediately after the storm. He filled as many containers as he could for himself and his child, but it didn't take long for the flow to weaken, then stop. They rationed water, switching to hand sanitizer and barely putting any on toothbrushes. '(We) didn't realize how dehydrated we were getting,' he said. Federal officials have shipped millions of liters of water to areas where people also might not be able to make phone calls or switch on the lights. Power has been restored to about 62% of homes and businesses and 8,000 crews are out working to restore power in the hardest hit parts of North Carolina, federal officials said Thursday. In 10 counties, about half of the cell sites are still down. The first step for some utilities is simply figuring out how bad the damage is, a job that might require EPA expertise in extreme cases. Ruptured water pipes are a huge problem. They often run beneath roads, many of which were crumpled and twisted by floodwaters. 'Pretty much anytime you see a major road damaged, there's a very good chance that there's a pipe in there that's also gotten damaged,' said Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. Generally, repairs start at the treatment plant and move outward, with fixes in nearby big pipes done first, according to the EPA. 'Over time, you'll gradually get water to more and more people,' White said. Many people are still missing, and water repair employees don't typically work around search and rescue operations. It takes a toll, according to Kevin Morley, manager of federal relations with the American Water Works Association. 'There's emotional support that is really important for all the people involved. You're seeing people's lives just wiped out,' he said. Even private well owners aren't immune. Pumps on private wells may have lost power and overtopping floodwaters can contaminate them. There's often a 'blind faith' assumption that drinking water won't fail. In this case, the technology was insufficient, according to Craig Colten. Before retiring to Asheville, he was a professor in Louisiana focused on resilience to extreme weather. He hopes Helene will prompt politicians to spend more to ensure infrastructure withstands destructive storms. And climate change will only make the problem more severe, said Erik Olson, a health and food expert at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council. 'I think states and the federal government really need to step back and start looking at how we're going to prepare for these extreme weather events that are going to be occurring and recurring every single year,' he said. Edwards has developed a system to save water. He'll soap dirty dishes and rinse them with a trickle of water with bleach, which is caught and transferred to a bucket — useable for the toilet. Power and some cell service have returned for him. And water distribution sites have guaranteed some measure of normalcy: Edwards feels like he can start going out to see friends again. 'To not feel guilty about using more than a cup of water to, like, wash yourself … I'm really, really grateful,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-week-after-helene-hit-thousands-still-without-water-struggle-to-find-enough/7811367.html	2024-10-04T19:52:02-07:00

China could wage economic war on Taiwan to force surrender, report says	washington — U.S. military officials and analysts have for years warned of possible armed attacks or blockades by China on Taiwan, but a report released Friday has raised a red flag about possible nonmilitary tactics that could be used effectively against the self-governed island. Beijing could wage an economic and cyber war to force a surrender from Taiwan without direct use of military power, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington research institute, said in the report. Such a likely but overlooked scenario, it said, poses a challenge for the U.S., the island's biggest ally, and it suggested Washington make preparations for how best to respond. FDD researchers teamed up with banking and finance experts in Taiwan over two days earlier this year to simulate likely nonmilitary moves by Beijing, such as disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks on infrastructure. The exercise was the first of its kind and sought to fill an analytical gap, FDD said. 'Modern globalization has created more economic connections that China can exploit to achieve coercive aims,' the report said. 'Technological innovation created even more digital connections, offering more possibilities for coercion, including through the targeting of critical infrastructure.' Beijing has vowed to take Taiwan by force if necessary, although Chinese President Xi Jinping has promised to make 'utmost efforts' to do so peacefully. Taiwan split from the mainland in 1949 during a civil war when the defeated nationalist government fled to the island. Years of pressure Tensions have flared in the Taiwan Strait since 2016 when Beijing began to increase diplomatic and military pressure on the island, prompting the U.S. to step up its support. Washington, which is obligated under U.S. law to provide Taipei with sufficient military hardware for its defense, has argued that it is in the U.S. interest to keep peace in the strait and to stand with democracies such as Taiwan to maintain the rules-based world order. Beijing has demanded the U.S. stay out of Taiwan, arguing it is a purely domestic affair. President Joe Biden has indicated he would send troops to defend Taiwan in case of an armed attack from China, but the U.S. government has yet to formulate a plan to respond to nonmilitary tactics, giving Beijing flexibility in working to undermine Taiwan without triggering an outright response from Washington that a military invasion would, the FDD researchers said. Taiwan’s foreign and defense ministries had no immediate comment on the report. With an estimated 1 million Taiwanese living and working in China, economic ties have grown ever closer. That has made the possibility of economic coercion, boycotts and military blockades an even bigger threat. Possible moves In the simulation exercises, the experts from the U.S. and Taiwan studied possible moves by Beijing such as conducting psychological wars to erode public trust, banning imports of Taiwanese products or raising tariffs on them, short-selling Taiwanese stocks, freezing bank transfers across the strait, cutting fiber-optic cables, and targeting energy imports and storage. The report recommended that Taiwan diversify its energy imports, relocate businesses away from the mainland, develop new markets, and build alliances and partnerships. The report also suggested that the United States develop a playbook of options to counter China and improve coordination with allies. The Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance, which worked with FDD on the simulation exercises, has argued that Taiwan must strengthen its financial resilience. 'China could destabilize Taiwan’s financial system to incite social unrest as a precursor to invasion,' the report said. Russell Hsiao, executive director of the Washington-based Global Taiwan Institute, said that Beijing has already been ramping up nonmilitary measures against Taiwan and that such efforts are expected to intensify in the coming years. 'It behooves the United States and Taiwan to work with allies and like-minded partners to strengthen our collective resilience to China’s weaponization of economic interdependence,' Hsiao said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-could-wage-economic-war-on-taiwan-to-force-surrender-report-says-/7811357.html	2024-10-04T18:57:14-07:00

Somalia-Ethiopia tensions escalate; UN urges diplomatic resolution	washington — In a crucial week for Somalia's security plan, discussions in Washington and New York have underscored the urgent need for preparation for the upcoming African Union Support Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM), as escalating tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia over a maritime agreement Ethiopia signed with Somaliland raised concerns among international stakeholders. Somalia is set to determine the composition of its upcoming AUSSOM following the expiration of the current AU mission. Hussein Moalim, Somalia's national security adviser, stated that Somalia is firm in its position on Ethiopian forces' participation in the new mission. 'Somalia would not consider Ethiopian troops to be part of the new mission unless it withdraws from the illegal memorandum of understanding signed with [Somalia's breakaway region of] Somaliland earlier this year,' Moalim said Thursday in an interview with VOA Somali. The controversial memorandum of understanding, also known as an MoU, has escalated tensions between the two neighboring nations, granting Ethiopia access to a 20-kilometer (12.4 mile) stretch of Red Sea coastline in return for potential recognition of Somaliland's independence. Somalia views the MoU, signed in January, as a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, leading to a diplomatic rift that has included the expulsion of the Ethiopian ambassador from Mogadishu and threats to remove thousands of Ethiopian troops stationed in parts of south and central regions of the country. Despite two rounds of mediated talks by Turkey yielding no results, Somalia's State Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Omar Balcad insists that effective dialogue hinges on addressing issues of Somalia's sovereignty infringement and restoring trust. 'First we need to solve the issue on our sovereignty infringement and second to restore the trust and the diplomatic relations between us, and then there comes the negotiation on the Ethiopia desire to access our sea and ports,' said Balcad in an interview with VOA Somali. UN urges diplomatic resolution In New York, the United Nations Security Council addressed the security situation in Somalia on Thursday, stressing the urgency of finalizing plans for the new AU stabilization mission. During the discussion, concerns were raised regarding escalating tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia, with James Swan, acting special representative of the secretary-general, urging both nations to seek a diplomatic solution within the framework of international law. Ambassador Robert Wood, the U.S. alternative representative for special political affairs, echoed these sentiments, highlighting the detrimental impact of rising tensions on regional security. 'Colleagues, we are deeply concerned about rising tension between Ethiopia and Somalia and the negative impact it is having on shared security interests,' Wood said. In discussions held in Washington this week, Somali officials, along with representatives from the U.S., Qatar, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the U.K., emphasized the urgency of finalizing funding options for the new peacekeeping mission. Somalia's Moalim reiterated the commitment of international partners to support Somalia's security, stability and sovereignty. 'The partners reaffirmed their unwavering support for the federal government of Somalia in its efforts to attain stability and security across the nation,' he said. Ethopia denies Somalia's allegations Briefing the U.N. Security Council, Somali Foreign Minister Ahmed Moalim Fiqi accused Ethiopia of using the fight against terrorism as a pretext for territorial expansion. 'Let me be clear. The claim that Ethiopia is in Somalia to fight terrorism is a pretext for annexation,' Fiqi asserted, adding that Somalia has intercepted three illegal arms shipments from Ethiopia in the past three months, fueling local conflicts and empowering extremist groups. 'We call these actions a clear violation of Somalia's sovereignty,' he said. Ethiopia has been constantly denying Somalia's accusations against Ethiopia, including its intention behind the MoU signed with Somaliland. During last month's meeting of U.N. General Assembly, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Taye Atske-Selassie said his country had nothing to do with Somalia's allegations. 'Ethiopia's memorandum of understanding with Somaliland is based on existing political dispensation in Somalia,' he said. 'Our objective is a shared growth and prosperity in the region. Similar agreements have been concluded by other states, and there is no reason for the government of Somalia to incite hostility that obviously intends to cover internal political tensions,' he added. 'I therefore reject the unfounded allegations leveled against my country.' Falastin Iman in Washington contributed to this report, which originated in VOA's Somali Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-s-security-dilemma-ethiopia-tensions-dominate-discussions-on-au-peacekeeping/7811115.html	2024-10-04T17:42:50-07:00	
China's National Day holiday subdued amid sluggish economy	washington — China's weeklong celebration of its National Day, from October 1, is known as the 'golden week' because it's the Asian giant's biggest week for travel, tourism and leisure spending. However, some Chinese who spoke to VOA Mandarin described this year's National Day as a national day of mourning because of higher costs while the economy is struggling. All those interviewed by VOA asked that their names not be used out of fear of retaliation from the Chinese government for their negative comments. Despite returning from a holiday in Japan in September, a 37-year-old white-collar worker in Beijing chose to join the crowd of travelers during China's National Day holiday for a seven-day vacation in South Korea. 'Usually the ticket is only 2,000 yuan [about $284], but now it has risen to almost 4,000 [about $568] during the National Day holiday. But I still decided to go out and have fun. Otherwise, what are you doing in Beijing? It's so boring,' she told VOA. The well-off urban dweller said, 'I went to get a manicure today, and the lady said that all of her friends have lost their jobs. Now a lot of people don't have money. The domestic economy is not good. We just don't know how bad it is, and we can't see the truth.' She noticed that even though it is the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, Beijing did not have many large-scale celebrations or a festive atmosphere, except for displays of national flags and flowerbeds. The Beijing resident thought the main reason was that the economy is suffering. 'Many people have lost their jobs, and if a grand National Day celebration were held, it would definitely be criticized. The government might not have the money to hold a celebration either,' she said. China also usually holds more elaborate celebrations when it hits a new decade for its founding anniversary. Not in 'mood' to celebrate A man who lives in Shanghai and works in the publishing industry said he believed that in today's China, national pride is becoming less and less marketable. He told VOA Mandarin, 'It's because the people's personal [economic] lives are not good. And now there is a bit of a difficult situation at home and abroad, and people are not in the mood for celebrations.' A middle-class translator who lives in Beijing told VOA Mandarin he and his friends thought that 'the national fortune is very gray' because the economy is unpredictable. 'Who would want to invest? So, are your economic fundamentals getting better? Is your business environment improving? Is your international environment improving? I think these are some of the basic questions,' he said. 'Not to mention the rule of law. So, we want it to get better, but you tell me, which aspect is getting better?' Li Yang, vice minister of transport, said at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office on September 27 that the cross-regional flow of people during this year's National Day holiday would reach 1.94 billion, with an average 277 million people traveling per day, and 80% of the trips by private vehicles. This would be an average daily increase of 0.7% over the same period last year and an average daily increase of 19.4% over the same period in 2019. The increase in travelers will give at least a temporary boost to domestic consumption, which China has been encouraging since the COVID-19 pandemic, especially as an overreliance on exports has fueled tariff retaliation from trade partners. But while stimulus measures last week boosted China's stock markets by the most since 2008, economists noted the fundamental reliance on exports has not changed and China's property market — a pillar of its domestic economy — is still struggling. 'Just a relative rebound' Despite jumps in markets, and travel for the golden week holiday, the translator and the white-collar worker said these did not signal a return to prosperity. 'It's not that your income is higher after three years of the pandemic, it's that you had spent less during the pandemic,' said the translator. 'It's just a relative rebound.' He continued, 'Generally speaking, the National Day has become a national mourning,' adding that if there is another pandemic or major upheaval, many people will not be able to maintain their standard of living. While China's middle class lamented the country's downturn, they noted the lives of people with limited skills are the most difficult. Meanwhile, taxi drivers are taking advantage of the temporary increase in passengers for the National Day holiday to earn as much as they can. The publisher told VOA he took a ride-hailing application taxi in Shanghai, and it was the driver's first week. 'He hadn't gotten out of the car for a week and even slept in the car,' he said. 'He slept in the car when he was tired and drove when he woke up.' He said, 'I asked the taxi driver today, 'How do you plan for the National Day? How many days a week do you work?' He said, 'If there were eight days in a week, I would work eight days and not think about vacation travel at all.' ' China's Transport Ministry described passenger transport since the beginning of this year as 'robust,' with nearly 44 billion passenger trips recorded during the first eight months, a 6% increase from the same period last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-national-day-holiday-subdued-amid-sluggish-economy/7811095.html	2024-10-04T16:40:34-07:00

Belarus court sentences activists for attempted sabotage of Russian plane	moscow — A court in Minsk sentenced a dozen individuals to prison terms of between two and 25 years Friday for helping commit what Belarus has called an 'act of terrorism' at a military airfield outside the capital last year. A group of Belarusian anti-government activists said in February 2023 that they had blown up a sophisticated Russian military surveillance aircraft in a drone attack at the base. Russia and Belarus dismissed the assertion as fake, with Belarusian state television publishing footage showing what it said was the undamaged Beriev A-50 surveillance craft. About a week later, Minsk said it had detained a 'terrorist' and more than 20 accomplices over attempted sabotage at the airfield. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin, alleged at the time that Ukrainian security services and the U.S. Central Intelligence agency were behind the operation. He said the aircraft had suffered only superficial damage in the attack, which was carried out using a 'small drone,' the Belta news agency reported. On Friday, Belarus' general prosecutor's office said the Minsk City Court had sentenced 12 individuals after finding them guilty of terrorism, extremism and other serious crimes. The main defendant, Ukrainian national Nikolai Shvets, was sentenced in absentia to 25 years in prison. Shvets, who gave an interview to Belarusian state television last April in which he detailed how he planned the attack, was released in a prisoner exchange with Ukraine in June, according to Belarusian rights group Viasna. It was not clear how many of the others were sentenced in absentia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/belarus-court-sentences-activists-for-attempted-sabotage-of-russian-plane-/7811091.html	2024-10-04T15:53:02-07:00	
China-connected spamouflage networks spread antisemitic disinformation	washington — Spamouflage networks with connections to China are posting antisemitic conspiracy theories on social media, casting doubt on Washington's independence from alleged Jewish influence and the integrity of the two U.S. presidential candidates, a joint investigation by VOA Mandarin and Taiwan's Doublethink Lab, a social media analytics firm, has found. The investigation has so far uncovered more than 30 such X posts, many of which claim or suggest that core American political institutions, including the White House and Congress, have pledged loyalty to or are controlled by Jewish elites and the Israeli government. One post shows a graphic of 18 U.S. officials of Jewish descent, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and the head of the Homeland Security Department, Alejandro Mayorkas, and asks: 'Jews only make up 2% of the U.S. population, so why do they have so many representatives in important government departments?!' Another post shows a cartoon depicting Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for president, and her opponent, Donald Trump, having their tongues tangled together and wrapped around an Israeli flagpole. The post proclaims that 'no matter who of them comes to power, they will not change their stance on Judaism.' Most of the 32 posts analyzed by VOA Mandarin and Doublethink Lab were posted during July and August. The posts came from three spamouflage accounts, two of which were previously reported by VOA. Each of the three accounts leads its own spamouflage network. The three networks consist of 140 accounts, which amplify content from the three main accounts, or seeders. A spamouflage network is a state-sponsored operation disguised as the work of authentic social media users to spread pro-government narratives and disinformation while discrediting criticism from adversaries. Jasper Hewitt, a digital intelligence analyst at Doublethink Lab, told VOA Mandarin that the impact of these antisemitic posts has been limited, as most of them failed to reach real users, despite having garnered over 160,000 views. U.S. officials have cast China as one of the major threats looking to disrupt this year's election. Beijing, however, has repeatedly denied these allegations and urged Washington to 'not make an issue of China in the election.' Tuvia Gering, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, has closely followed antisemitic disinformation coming from China. He told VOA Mandarin that Beijing isn't necessarily hostile toward Jews, but anti-Semitic conspiracy theories have historically been a handy tool to be used against Western countries. 'You can trace its origins back to the Cold War, when the Soviet Union promoted antisemitic conspiracy theories all over the world just to instigate in Western societies,' Gering said, 'because it divides them from within and it casts the West in a bad light in a strategic competition. [It's] the same thing you see here [with China].' Anti-Semitic speech floods Chinese internet Similar antisemitic narratives about U.S. politics posted by the spamouflage accounts have long been flourishing on the Chinese internet. An article that received thousands of likes and reposts on Chinese social media app WeChat claims that 'Jewish capital' has completed its control of the American political sphere 'through infiltration, marriages, campaign funds and lobbying.' The article also brings up the Jewish heritage of many current and former U.S. officials and their families as evidence of the alleged Jewish takeover of America. 'The wife of the U.S. president is Jewish, the son-in-law of the former U.S. president is Jewish, the mother of the previous former U.S. president was Jewish, the U.S. Secretary of State is Jewish, the U.S. Secretary of Treasury is Jewish, the Deputy Secretary of State, the Attorney General … are all Jewish,' it wrote. In fact, first lady Jill Biden is Roman Catholic, and the mother of former President Barack Obama was raised as a Christian. The others named are Jewish. Conspiracy theories and misinformation abounded on the Chinese internet after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill in May that would empower the Department of Education to adopt a new set of standards when investigating antisemitism in educational programs. Articles and videos assert that the bill marks the death of America because it 'definitively solidifies the superior and unquestionable position of the Jews in America,' claiming falsely that anyone who's labeled an antisemite will be arrested. One video with more than 1 million views claimed that the New Testament of the Bible would be deemed illegal under the bill. And since all U.S. presidents took their inaugural oath with the Bible, the bill allegedly invalidates the legitimacy of the commander in chief. None of that is true. The Chinese public hasn't historically been hostile toward Jews. A 2014 survey published by the Anti-Defamation League, a U.S.-based group against antisemitism, found that only 20% of the participants from China harbored an antisemitic attitude. But when the Israel-Hamas conflict broke out a year ago, the otherwise heavily censored Chinese social media was flooded with antisemitic comments and praise for Nazi Germany leader Adolf Hitler. The Chinese government has dismissed criticism of antisemitism on its internet. When asked about it at a news conference last year, Wang Wenbin, then the spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry, said that 'China's laws unequivocally prohibit disseminating information on extremism, ethnic hatred, discrimination and violence via the internet.' But online hate speech against Jews has hardly disappeared. Eric Liu, a former censor for Chinese social media Weibo who now monitors online censorship, told VOA Mandarin that whenever Israel is in the news, there would be a surge in online antisemitism. Just last month, after dozens of members of the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah were killed by explosions of their pagers, Chinese online commentators acidly condemned Israel and Jews. The attack 'proves that Jews are the most terrifying and cowardly people,' one Weibo user wrote. 'They are self-centered and believe themselves to be superior, when in fact they are considered the most indecent and shameless. When the time comes, it's going to be blood for blood.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-connected-spamouflage-networks-spread-antisemitic-disinformation/7811033.html	2024-10-04T15:38:25-07:00

River level in Amazon rainforest hits 122-year low amid drought, wildfires	manaus, brazil — The river port in the Amazon rainforest's largest city of Manaus on Friday hit its lowest level since 1902, as a drought drains waterways and snarls transport of grain exports and essential supplies that are the region's lifeline. Below-average rainfall — even through the rainy season — has plagued the Amazon and much of South America since last year, also feeding the worst wildfires in more than a decade in Brazil and Bolivia. Millions of hectares of forest and farmland have burned in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru as well. The same extreme heat and dryness that is driving the surging fires in the Amazon is impacting neighboring Pantanal, the world's largest wetlands. Bolivia is also on track to break a record for the most fires ever recorded, according to data from Brazil's space research agency. The Amazon basin, usually one of the wettest places on Earth, is experiencing its worst fires in nearly two decades, according to the European Union's Copernicus Observatory. And last week, satellite images from the National Institute for Space Research showed 80% of Brazil affected by smoke. Researchers say climate change is the main culprit behind wildfires and the drought. Scientists predict the Amazon region may not fully recover moisture levels until 2026. Last year, the drought became a humanitarian crisis, as people reliant on rivers were stranded without food, water or medicine. This year authorities are already on alert. In hard-hit Amazonas state, at least 62 municipalities are under states of emergency with more than half a million people affected, according to the state's civil defense corps. 'This is now the most severe drought in over 120 years of measurement at the Port of Manaus,' said Valmir Mendonca, the port's head of operations, who said the river level is likely to keep falling for another week or two. With the region never fully recovering because of weaker-than-usual seasonal rains, many of the impacts of the drought last year look set to repeat or reach new extremes. The Port of Manaus measured the Rio Negro at 12.66 meters Friday, according to its website, surpassing the previous all-time low recorded last year and still falling rapidly. The Rio Negro is a major tributary of the Amazon River, the world's largest river by volume. The port sits near the 'meeting of the waters' where the black water of the Negro meets the sandy-colored Solimoes, which also hit a record low this week. Grain shipments have been halted on the Madeira River, another tributary of the Amazon, because of low water levels, a port association said last month. Researchers are again finding the carcasses of Amazon freshwater river dolphins, which they blame on thinning waters driving the threatened species into closer contact with humans. National disaster monitoring agency Cemaden has already called the drought Brazil's worst such event since at least the 1950s. The drought has also sapped hydropower plants, Brazil's main source of electricity. Energy authorities have approved bringing back daylight saving time to conserve electricity, although the measure still requires presidential approval. The extreme weather and dryness are affecting much of South America, with the Paraguay River also at an all-time low. That river starts in Brazil and flows through Paraguay and Argentina to the Atlantic.	https://www.voanews.com/a/river-level-in-amazon-rainforest-hits-122-year-low-amid-drought-wildfires-/7811024.html	2024-10-04T14:33:43-07:00	
Despite obstacles, new NATO leader aims to increase support for Ukraine	london — With an escalating war in the Middle East, uncertainty over Western military aid for Ukraine, and the U.S. presidential election looming next month, new NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has no time to settle in. The former Dutch prime minister was appointed to the role at a ceremony at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday, where he told delegates that 'there can be no lasting security in Europe without a strong, independent Ukraine,' and affirmed that 'Ukraine's rightful place is in NATO.' On Thursday, Rutte was welcomed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Kyiv. Zelenskyy wasted no time in relaying his demands. 'We have discussed the most urgent needs of our troops, the weapons and the recruitment to the brigades,' Zelenskyy said at a news conference alongside Rutte on Thursday. 'We will have more time today to discuss more details on how to strengthen Ukraine's positions on the front so that we can exert more pressure on Russia in order to support just and realistic diplomacy. That is why we need sufficient quantity and quality of weapons, including long-range weapons, the decision on which, in my opinion, our Western partners are delaying,' he told reporters. Ukraine wants to use Western long-range missiles on targets inside Russia. The U.S. and other allies are holding back, fearing escalation with Moscow. NATO's new secretary-general made his position clear. 'Ukraine obviously has the right to defend itself and international law is on the side of Ukraine, meaning that this right does not end at the border. Russia is pursuing this illegal war … targeting Russian fighter jets and missiles before they can be used against Ukraine's civilian infrastructure can help save lives,' Rutte told reporters. Ukraine's president was asked whether he feared the world was forgetting about his country, amid the escalating conflict in the Middle East. 'I wish that Ukraine is not forgotten,' Zelenskyy said. 'And the best way to show this is by giving particular weapons, by giving particular permissions. And help to shoot down hostile drones — by the way, the same Iranian rockets and drones — to shoot them down the same way as they are shot down in the sky of Israel. Do the same over the skies of Ukraine.' Rutte is a longtime ally of Ukraine, noted analyst Armida van Rij, a senior research fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House. 'While he was prime minister of the Netherlands, he was very supportive of Ukraine. He's the one who signed off on the F-16s [fighter jets] deal for Ukraine as well. So, there is that history of support,' van Rij told VOA. However, Rutte is facing headwinds as he tries to boost military support for Ukraine among NATO allies. Next month, U.S. voters will choose a new president: Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. Rutte said he would work with whoever is elected — but neither outcome will be straightforward, said van Rij. 'There is a real risk for Ukraine that Trump may try to force Ukraine's hand and force Ukraine to capitulate to Russia, which would be terrible for European security. That's the first challenge. But the second challenge is even if Vice President Harris were to win the U.S. elections, she may still face a divided Congress and she may still struggle to pass aid packages in support for Ukraine through Congress.' Either scenario would require European NATO allies to step up their military aid. 'And there again, there's challenges because many countries have depleted their stocks. They've given as much as they feel comfortable with at this point. What I would like to see is to think through some of the practical ways in which we can advance EU and NATO collaborations specifically on this issue of developing a European defense industrial base,' van Rij told VOA. There are fears in Europe that a victory for Trump could upend the United States' relationship with NATO. 'Like [former NATO Secretary-General Jens] Stoltenberg, Rutte is known as a 'Trump whisperer.' He is one of the few European politicians who developed a good working relationship with Donald Trump. However, a potential second Trump term could prove much more disruptive, with less U.S. aid to Ukraine, more concessions to Russia and further questioning of the value of NATO,' said Oana Lungescu, a distinguished fellow at Britain's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) and a former NATO spokesperson, in an email to VOA. The Kremlin said this week that Russian President Vladimir Putin knew Rutte well from his time as Dutch prime minister. 'At that time there were hopes of building good pragmatic relations,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a phone call Tuesday. 'But we know what followed — the Netherlands adopted a rather defiant attitude to fully exclude all contacts with Russia. So, we don't think that anything new or significant will happen with the policy of the [NATO] alliance,' Peskov said. Meanwhile, Rutte takes the helm of NATO as it faces an increasingly assertive China. 'On Ukraine, everyone's very much on the same line. On China, there's still some allies saying, 'We're not sure we need to quite go into the Indo-Pacific theater.' In a scenario where U.S. resources and capabilities are drawn elsewhere, i.e., the Indo-Pacific, Europeans have to be able to fend for themselves — including look after Ukraine in the current short-term scenario,' van Rij told VOA. Rutte said another priority would be to strengthen NATO's partnerships with allies outside the alliance in an interconnected world. His primary focus must be on keeping NATO members safe, said Lungescu of RUSI. 'As NATO secretary-general, Rutte must take the lead in arguing for more defense spending across the alliance,' Lungescu said. 'He should make a strong case not just about figures and percentages, but about the concrete capabilities that are needed to keep NATO nations safe in a dangerous world.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/despite-obstacles-new-nato-leader-aims-to-boost-support-for-ukraine-/7810976.html	2024-10-04T14:28:16-07:00	
Uganda's military threatens US ambassador with expulsion	kampala, uganda — The chief of Uganda’s defense forces, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, has given U.S. Ambassador William Popp until Monday morning to apologize or leave the country. It is not clear why Kainerugaba, who is President Yoweri Museveni’s son, issued the ultimatum to the ambassador, although this week the United States sanctioned four Ugandan police officers for human rights violations. On Friday, Kainerugaba took to X three times to say Uganda was about to have a serious confrontation with Popp for 'disrespecting our beloved and celebrated president and for undermining the constitution of Uganda.' Five hours later, Kainerugaba tweeted again, saying if Popp did not apologize to the president personally by 9 a.m. Monday for what the general called Popp’s undiplomatic behavior, the government would demand that he leave. Speaking to VOA, Sewanyana Livingstone, director of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative Uganda, said Kainerugaba has no authority to declare Popp persona non grata unless he is appointed minister of foreign affairs. Sewanyana said Kainerugaba’s comments should be dismissed. 'He needs to calm down. He needs to understand that Uganda is not him, neither is he Uganda,' Sewanyana said. 'Uganda will always be there. Sanctions are not the functions of an ambassador. They are issued by the State Department. So, I think he is even targeting the wrong person. I think Ugandans need to call him to order. It’s high time.' On Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said four Ugandan police officers had been sanctioned for gross violations of human rights. These included torture and cruel inhumane treatment and punishment. The police officers were identified as Bob Kagarura, Alex Mwine, Elly Womanya and Hamdani Twesigye. The State Department said reports of the violations as documented by Ugandan civil court documents, civil society organizations and independent journalists were serious and credible. Ugandan authorities did not respond to requests for comment. A report released last month by the African Center for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture Victims, or ACTV, noted that torture cases in Uganda were on the rise despite laws against the practice. Herbert Sam Nsubuga, executive director of ACTV, said the organization was concerned about the situation in Uganda. 'The situation is not as good as we want it to be,' Nsubuga said. 'Because just halfway this year, we have made 903 cases. So, it’s still really an issue.' In 2023, monitors in Uganda recorded 1,235 cases of torture, with the Uganda People’s Defense forces and police as top perpetrators. The four designated officers in April 2020 raided a Ugandan legislator's home, accusing him of violating the regulations put in place to control the spread of COVID-19 as he distributed food to vulnerable communities. According to records produced in court, the legislator, Francis Zaake, was arrested and detained at the Defense Intelligence and Security headquarters, where he was tortured before he was left at a hospital. He later sued the four officers, and a court awarded him $20,400. In response to VOA questions on Kainerugaba’s threats, the U.S. Embassy in Uganda quoted State Department spokesman Miller as saying the embassy, the ambassador and the U.S. government were continuing to work directly and normally every day with Ugandan authorities on a full range of issues. Miller said in accordance with U.S. law, the United States was committed to supporting justice for victims and accountability of those involved in human rights violations around the world. This, he said, includes denying or restricting travel visas to visit the United States for individuals when there is demonstrated evidence that they have committed abuses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-s-military-threatens-us-ambassador-with-expulsion-/7810960.html	2024-10-04T13:55:46-07:00	
India faces tough balancing act amid escalating Middle East conflict	new delhi / washington — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided over a Cabinet meeting on security Friday to address the escalating conflict in the Middle East. According to Press Trust of India, the meeting focused on the implications on trade and the supply of petroleum products. India expressed grave concern regarding the escalation of the security situation involving Israel and its neighbors, emphasizing that 'the conflict must not take a wider regional dimension.' In view of the increasing tensions, the question is how India will balance its relations with all parties if the situation becomes worse. Analysts in New Delhi say India should adopt a neutral stance, especially if the situation worsens and a formal war breaks out between Iran and Israel. India's major concern is a potential extended disruption in trade. Traders worldwide are preparing for this, as the crucial Red Sea shipping route could stay closed to international shipping lines longer than initially expected, likely keeping freight rates and petroleum prices elevated. Former Indian diplomat Rajiv Dogra told VOA that if the situation got more tense, it would affect the supply chain, imports and exports, and India's interests in the region. Dogra said that big powers were trying to ensure that the situation does not deteriorate, and that India was also trying to establish peace. Journalist and author Nilofar Suhrawardy told VOA there would not be a formal war. Suhrawardy referred to U.S. President Joe Biden's statement that said that the Israeli reaction to the Iranian attack should be proportionate. She said the Iranian ballistic missile attack Tuesday on Israel was in reaction to the September 27 killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on the militant group's headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon. But if there is a full-scale war, what will be India's stand? Analysts said India would take a neutral stand. According to Suhrawardy, India has good relations with Israel, Iran, Arab countries and the Palestinians, so it will not take any party's side. She said she believed the policy India adopted in the Ukraine-Russia conflict would be applied to the Israel-Iran conflict, too. Modi has spoken to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the past two weeks. On September 23, he met Abbas in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Modi spoke to Netanyahu by phone on Monday. The Indian leader condemned terrorism and urged the release of citizens held hostage by Hamas.

Gang attacks Haitian town, killing more than 70	new york — The United Nations secretary-general joined the Haitian prime minister Friday in strongly condemning a horrific overnight gang attack on a town outside Haiti's capital that killed at least 70 people, including at least 10 women and three infants. 'The criminals responsible for these abominable acts will be hunted down and brought to justice, without respite,' Prime Minister Garry Conille said in a statement. Haiti's transition government said members of the Gran Grif gang perpetrated the attack in the town of Pont Sonde in the Artibonite department. A report in the Haiti Gazette said the gang was trying to extort money from the local population and they resisted paying it. The massacre was retribution. The U.N. human rights office said gang members firing automatic rifles also reportedly set fire to at least 45 houses and 34 vehicles, forcing a number of residents to flee. At least 3,000 people have been displaced by the attack. A number of people were also wounded, including two gang members. Sixteen people suffered serious injuries, the U.N. said. The government said many of the injured are being treated at the Saint-Nicolas public hospital in Saint-Marc. 'As gang violence continues to spread from the capital to other departments of Haiti, the secretary-general stresses the importance of the joint efforts undertaken by the Haitian National Police and the multinational security support mission,' Antonio Guterres' spokesperson told reporters Friday. 'Those efforts need to be supported.' In June, a multinational security support mission, or MSS, began its first deployment of about 400 police from Kenya, which is also leading the mission. About 100 others from Jamaica and Belize have also been deployed to assist the embattled Haitian National Police in subduing armed gangs, which have been terrorizing the country's capital and some outer lying areas. Other countries are expected to contribute police officers to the force. The mission has been beset with delays and financial and equipment shortages. But it has had some success inside the capital. The government said agents from the Haitian National Police Anti-Gang Unit have been deployed as reinforcements to support teams already on the ground in Artibonite. Specialized police units supported by the MSS are also deploying to the area. Haiti has been rocked by instability since 2021, when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated. Prime Minister Ariel Henry then led the country until he announced his resignation in March. A transitional government is now in place with the goal of organizing free and fair elections. Haiti has not held elections since 2016. The country is facing a massive humanitarian crisis due to the violence. On Monday, international food monitors said more than half the country's population — 5.4 million people — are struggling to feed themselves. At least 6,000 displaced persons in shelters in the capital are facing catastrophic levels of hunger, while 2 million people are one step behind them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gang-attacks-haitian-town-killing-more-than-70-/7810831.html	2024-10-04T12:24:54-07:00	
Exiled media fight to keep Belarusian language alive	washington — While the Belarusian government continues a long-running clampdown on use of the Belarusian language, exiled news outlets are leading the fight to keep their language — and cultural identity — alive. Although Belarusian has been the country’s official language since Belarus declared independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991, there has been an ongoing process of Russification since President Alexander Lukashenko came to power in 1994. That process has only accelerated since 2020 when Lukashenko — seen by some to be a puppet of Russian President Vladimir Putin — declared victory in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent. Since then, the Belarusian government has grown increasingly hostile toward Belarusian as the language has become more and more associated with resistance toward Lukashenko’s rule. As Minsk continues to grow closer to Moscow, Belarusian media outlets that left the country following the 2020 elections see it as their duty to help keep the Belarusian language alive through their reporting, multiple media leaders told VOA. 'It’s a strategic move to preserve the language, to preserve the culture, which is being actively attacked,' said Natalia Belikova, head of international cooperation at Press Club Belarus in Poland’s capital Warsaw. Belarusian not illegal, but unwelcome Speaking Belarusian isn’t illegal in Belarus, but the government has long made clear its preference for Russian, which has been the other official language in Belarus since 1995. Belarusian is more similar to Ukrainian than Russian. Instead of outlawing Belarusian entirely, the government has taken steps like targeting Belarusian-language newspapers and bookstores. Classes in school are more often taught in Russian, and there aren’t any universities where Belarusian is the primary language. Government officials tend to speak Russian, and government documents are often in Russian, too. 'The presence of Belarusian language is vividly vanishing,' Belikova said. '‘Upsetting’ is probably a milder word for this. It’s really devastating.' A 2019 census found that around 60% of the population consider Belarusian their native language, but only about 28% use the language at home. Still, since Belarusian isn’t banned, speaking it is one of the few remaining ways for people to safely signal their political beliefs and opposition to Lukashenko, multiple journalists said. However, multiple analysts said doing so in public is likely to draw negative attention from authorities because the language is so closely associated with the resistance. 'Formally, it’s safe. It’s OK to speak Belarusian in Belarus. But in practice, well, it’s not safe,' Pavel Sviardlou, editor-in-chief of European Radio for Belarus, told VOA from Warsaw. The Belarusian foreign ministry did not reply to VOA’s email requesting comment. As the Belarusian government works to suppress the Belarusian language in favor of Russian, leaders from prominent exiled outlets like European Radio for Belarus, Nasha Niva and Zerkalo say their outlets are prioritizing coverage in the Belarusian language. In the case of Nasha Niva, one of the oldest Belarusian newspapers, the outlet’s mission has long been to popularize the Belarusian language, culture and history, according to the newspaper’s director Nastassia Rouda. That mission has become more important since the contested 2020 election, after which hundreds of journalists fled the country to escape harassment and censorship. 'Who, if not us? This is the question,' Rouda told VOA from Lithuania. Nasha Niva’s primary language is Belarusian, but the outlet also translates everything into Russian. European Radio for Belarus operates similarly. 'This is a chance to, for example, listen to Belarusian every day, to read in Belarusian every day. And, of course, to feel that the language is not dead,' Sviardlou said. The fight to preserve the Belarusian language goes hand in hand with the more obvious role that exiled media play — ensuring people still inside Belarus can access independent news about what’s happening. 'Only media like us, who are working from exile right now, can give some truthful information about the political situation. No one inside can do this,' Nasha Niva’s Rouda said. Although Belarusian authorities block access to independent news sites, Belarusians still access them with circumvention tools like virtual private networks, or VPNs. Despite the risks and the fact that the government spent about 50 million euros ($55 million) on propaganda in 2023 alone, it’s clear that many people inside Belarus, which has a population of about 9 million, still regularly access banned news sites. The five biggest sites had over 17 million visits in December 2023, according to a 2024 JX Fund report. The news outlet Zerkalo, for instance, receives about 3 million unique visitors each month, with about 60% of them located inside Belarus, according to a 2024 Press Club Belarus report. Zerkalo is the successor outlet of Tut.by, which was the largest independent news site in Belarus until authorities shut it down in 2021. As the Belarus government grows ever closer with Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, exiled Belarusian media view their efforts as critical to maintaining a distinct Belarusian identity. The stakes are high, according to Aliaksandra Pushkina, a board member of Zerkalo. 'If we lose our culture, our language, we really will be a part of Russia,' she told VOA from Austria. While exiled outlets are prioritizing Belarusian language coverage, Belarusian propaganda outlets inside the country primarily use Russian, according to Sviardlou. 'They don’t even try to work in Belarusian because they understand that no one will listen to them,' he said. He asserted that Belarusian has taken on a different meaning, saying, 'It is a language of truth.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/exiled-media-fight-to-keep-belarusian-language-alive-/7810871.html	2024-10-04T12:19:07-07:00

2 sisters from Egypt were among those killed in Mexican army shooting	TAPACHULA, Mexico — An 11-year-old Egyptian girl and her 18-year-old sister were among those killed after Mexican army troops opened fire on a truck carrying migrants earlier this week, an official said Friday. The sisters, and four other migrants from countries including Peru and Honduras, were killed Tuesday in the southern state of Chiapas. An official in the state’s prosecutor's office confirmed the identification of the two sisters and said their father was wounded in the shooting but survived. Federal officials, including newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum, again refused Friday to confirm the ages or genders of the six migrants killed in the shooting, which occurred on Sheinbaum’s first day in office. Soldiers claimed they heard shots and returned fire, and officials have studiously avoided saying the migrants were killed by army gunfire. However, that appears to be the case, and two soldiers have been relieved of duty and turned over to civilian prosecutors for questioning. The killings placed in doubt Sheinbaum's statements over her first days in office that human rights will be at the forefront of her administration's policies. Asked about her immigration policy Friday, Sheinbaum said only that the killings were under investigation and doubled down on earlier claims that the government doesn't violate human rights. 'First of all, human rights are respected,' Sheinbaum said. 'That is very important, that is why it is called a humanistic immigration policy, because human rights are at the forefront.' Three of the dead were from Egypt, and one each from Peru and Honduras. The other has apparently not yet been identified. Ten other migrants were wounded in the shooting. but there has not been any information on their conditions. Peru’s foreign ministry confirmed one Peruvian was killed and demanded 'an urgent investigation' into the killings. Peru and Mexico have had damaged relations since a 2022 diplomatic spat. It was the worst killing of migrants by authorities in Mexico since police in the northern state of Tamaulipas killed 17 migrants in 2021. Sheinbaum has said the shootings are being investigated to see if any commanders might face punishment, and noted 'a situation like this cannot be repeated.' But she left out any mention of that Thursday at a ceremony at a Mexico City army base, where army and navy commanders pledged their loyalty to her in front of massed combat vehicles and hundreds of troops. 'In our country, there is not a state of siege, there are no violations of human rights,' Sheinbaum said, as she promised wage increases for soldiers and sailors. The shootings Tuesday occurred near the city of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala. The Defense Department initially said that soldiers claimed to have heard shots as a convoy of three trucks passed the soldiers’ position. The Attorney General’s Office later said all three trucks ignored orders to stop and tried to flee. The soldiers pursued them and reported coming under fire from the convoy and returned fire. One of the trucks eventually stopped, the driver reportedly fled, and a total of 33 migrants were found aboard, from the three countries already mentioned, as well as Nepal, Cuba, India and Pakistan. The Defense Department said four of the migrants were found dead, and 12 wounded. Two of the wounded later died of their injuries. Sheinbaum refused to say whether any weapons were found in the migrants’ truck. The area is a common route for smuggling migrants, who are often packed into crowded freight trucks. It has also been the scene of drug cartel turf battles, and the department said the trucks 'were similar to those used by criminal groups in the region.' Irineo Mujica, a migrant rights activist, said he doubted the migrants or their smugglers opened fire. 'It is really impossible that these people would have been shooting at the army,' Mujica said. 'Most of the time, they get through by paying bribes.' If the deaths were the result of army fire, as appears likely, it could prove a major embarrassment for Sheinbaum. The new president has followed the lead of former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in giving the armed forces extraordinary powers in law enforcement, state-run companies, airports, trains and construction projects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sisters-from-egypt-were-among-those-killed-in-mexican-army-shooting/7810904.html	2024-10-04T12:12:14-07:00	
Philippines condemns China attack of Vietnamese fishermen	manila, philippines — The Philippines on Friday denounced China 's alleged assault of Vietnamese fishermen in the South China Sea, where Manila and Beijing are also locked in violent confrontations that have led to fears of armed conflict. Vietnam has accused 'Chinese law enforcement forces' of beating the 10 fishermen with iron bars and robbing them Sunday of thousands of dollars' worth of fish and equipment off the Paracel Islands. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson acknowledged an incident took place there but disputed the Vietnamese version of the events. China and Vietnam both claim the Paracel Islands, but the Philippines does not. 'We strongly condemn the violent and illegal actions of Chinese maritime authorities against Vietnamese fishermen near the Paracel Islands on September 29, 2024,' Philippine National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano said in a statement. He described the 'unjustified assault' as an 'alarming act with no place in international relations.' The Philippine foreign department also issued a statement Friday saying it was aware of the 'serious incident.' 'The Philippines has consistently denounced the use of force, aggression and intimidation in the South China Sea, and emphasized the need for actors to exercise genuine self-restraint,' it said. 'It is a paramount obligation to ensure the safety at sea of vessels and their crew, especially fisherfolk.' The incident came just over three months after Chinese law enforcement personnel armed with knives, sticks and an axe attacked Filipino troops attempting to resupply a Philippine garrison on Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly archipelago. The Chinese seized guns and other equipment and damaged Philippine boats, while a Filipino sailor lost a thumb in the June 17 melee. Chinese coast guard and other vessels have in recent months also rammed, water-cannoned and blocked Philippine government vessels on several occasions around Second Thomas Shoal and Sabina Shoal in the Spratlys, as well as Scarborough Shoal in another area of the sea. Beijing claims most of the South China Sea and has for years sought to expand its presence in contested areas there, brushing aside an international ruling that its claim to most of the waterway has no legal basis. It has built artificial islands armed with missile systems and runways for fighter jets, and deployed vessels that the Philippines says harass its ships and block its fishermen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-condemns-china-attack-of-vietnamese-fishermen-/7810817.html	2024-10-04T11:03:46-07:00	
Middle East conflict sparks Chinese national pride, criticism of Israel	Washington — After Iran fired a barrage of 180 missiles at Israel on Tuesday in retaliation for the assassination of the leaders of two of its proxies and one of its senior military leaders, people in China went online, inundating social media platforms with a wide range of reactions to the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. On Weibo, a platform akin to X with added censorship, most users condemned Israel, while some voices called for a show of support in contrast with mainstream anti-Israel and anti-U.S. opinions. Chinese official government media leveraged the opportunity to promote national pride, highlighting the successful evacuation of Chinese citizens from Lebanon. Chinese officials call for peace In official statements, Chinese representatives made appeals for sovereignty and peace, with a focus on preventing Chinese citizens from being caught in the crossfire of the intensifying conflict. Responding to a question about Iran’s attack on Israel, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson simply said that China opposed the intrusion upon Lebanese sovereign rights and cited Gaza as the 'root cause of this round of turmoil in the Middle East.' The Chinese Embassy in Israel also issued a message following the bombardment, calling on Chinese citizens in Israel to take precautions and reminding Chinese citizens not to travel to Israel. 'Be prepared for various attacks involving missiles, rockets, and drones, and enter the bomb shelter as soon as the alarm sounds. Do not go out unless necessary, and avoid going to high-risk areas and sensitive locations such as the north.' Such warnings seemingly resonated with Chinese Weibo users. The search term on the Chinese social media site, '# Remind our country’s citizens to not travel to Israel for the time being' reached 33.6 million clicks and some 3,700 discussions and thread posts. For each topic with a hashtag on Weibo, the site shows the total clicks and comments. The government prioritized evacuating Chinese citizens in Lebanon. The popularity of this move was reflected online, with the phrase, '# Chinese planes flew from Lebanon amid gunfire to evacuate Chinese citizens' attracting 28.5 million clicks and more than 3,700 comments. Official news service China Daily posted a video of 146 Chinese citizens in Lebanon and five of their foreign family members walking out of the cabin of the Air China charter flight that evacuated them to Beijing. The video featured passengers waving Chinese flags as they entered the airport. One woman said, 'This war is ruthless, but our country is full of love.' Online commenters point fingers '# Israeli air base hit by Iranian missile' was another hot search topic on Weibo, which garnered 16.3 million clicks and more than 1,000 comments. Nearly 300 commenters expressed opinions on a post from Chinese Central Television reporting the news of the Iranian attack. A slim majority condemned Israel, some cracked jokes about Iran and the attack, and a small number expressed support for Israel. 'Israel is really a demon country,' said one user, while another said, 'Hit Israel hard. It will be a relief.' Striking a different tone, user 'Master Ji Xian' said, 'We firmly support Israel in eradicating all evil and eliminating terrorists.' An article posted by Sina News attracted more than 113,000 comments, which overwhelmingly condemned Israel and criticized the United States. 'Iran struck too late,' replied one user. Another wrote, 'A group of Israelis is disturbing the peace in the Middle East. Without the support of the United States, would they have such courage?' Despite the dominating anti-Israel sentiment on Weibo, some discussions on WeChat, which has relatively looser regulations on speech, show a different side of Chinese public opinion. WeChat public account 'Vision Talk' published an article titled 'Iran launches 200 missiles to attack Israel, Russia collectively shoots and kills 16 Ukrainian prisoners of war.' Many of the 150 comments on the post expressed support for Ukraine and Israel. 'Ukraine should learn from Israel and track down every last murderer,' one commenter wrote. Another user replied, 'There will be no peace in the Middle East until the Iranian villain is destroyed.'

Nobel Prizes will be announced against backdrop of wars, famine and artificial intelligence	stavanger, norway — Wars, a refugee crisis, famine and artificial intelligence could all be recognized when Nobel Prize announcements begin next week under a shroud of violence. The prize week coincides with the October 7 anniversary of the Hamas-led attacks on Israel, which began a year of bloodshed and war across the Middle East. The literature and science prizes could be immune. But the peace prize, which recognizes efforts to end conflict, will be awarded in an atmosphere of ratcheting international violence — if awarded at all. 'I look at the world and see so much conflict, hostility and confrontation, I wonder if this is the year the Nobel Peace Prize should be withheld,' said Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. As well as events roiling the Middle East, Smith cites the war in Sudan and risk of famine there, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and his institute's research showing that global military spending is increasing at its fastest pace since World War II. 'It could go to some groups which are making heroic efforts but are marginalized,' Smith said. 'But the trend is in the wrong direction. Perhaps it would be right to draw attention to that by withholding the peace prize this year.' Withholding the Nobel Peace is not new. It has been suspended 19 times in the past, including during the world wars. The last time it was not awarded was in 1972. However, Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, says withdrawal would be a mistake in 2024, saying the prize is 'arguably more important as a way to promote and recognize important work for peace.' Civil grassroot groups, and international organizations with missions to mitigate violence in the Middle East could be recognized. Nominees are kept secret for 50 years, but nominators often publicize their picks. Academics at the Free University Amsterdam said they have nominated the Middle East-based organizations EcoPeace, Women Wage Peace and Women of the Sun for peace efforts between Israelis and Palestinians. Urdal believes it's possible the committee could consider the Sudan Emergency Response Rooms, a group of grassroots initiatives providing aid to stricken Sudanese facing famine and buffeted by the country's brutal civil war. The announcements begin Monday with the physiology or medicine prize, followed on subsequent days by the physics, chemistry, literature and peace awards. The Peace Prize announcement will be made on Friday by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo, while all the others will be announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. The prize in economics will be announced the following week on October 14. New technology, possibly artificial intelligence, could be recognized in one or more of the categories. Critics of AI warn the rise of autonomous weapons shows the new technology could mean additional peace-shattering misery for many people. Yet AI has also enabled scientific breakthroughs that are tipped for recognition in other categories. David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clarivate's Institute for Scientific Information, says scientists from Google Deepmind, the AI lab, could be among those under consideration for the chemistry prize. The company's artificial intelligence, AlphaFold, 'accurately predicts the structure of proteins,' he said. It is already widely used in several fields, including medicine, where it could one day be used to develop a breakthrough drug. Pendlebury spearheads Clarivate's list of scientists whose papers are among the world's most cited, and whose work it says are ripe for Nobel recognition. 'AI will increasingly be a part of the panoply of tools that researchers use,' Pendlebury said. He said he would be extremely surprised if a discovery 'firmly anchored in AI' did not win Nobel prizes in the next 10 years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nobel-prizes-will-be-announced-against-backdrop-of-wars-famine-and-artificial-intelligence-/7810764.html	2024-10-04T10:47:52-07:00	
Clashes erupt in Kenya as people discuss deputy president's impeachment motion	NAIROBI, Kenya — Supporters and opponents of Kenya's deputy president clashed Friday at public forums over an impeachment motion against him, which was introduced in parliament by the ruling alliance this week. Rigathi Gachagua is accused of supporting anti-government protests in June and of being involved in corruption and other irregularities, charges he denies. A motion for the impeachment of Gachagua was proposed in parliament Tuesday and Kenyans were given until Friday to fill out public participation forms at their constituencies. Public forums are being held across the country to discuss the impeachment. In the capital, Nairobi, a public forum at the Bomas of Kenya turned violent as supporters of President William Ruto clashed with those supporting Gachagua. Chairs were thrown in the auditorium and an activist Morara Kebaso, known for exposing stalled government projects, said he had been injured. In central Kenya’s Nyeri county, police clashed with supporters of the deputy president as they chanted that there would be no president if his deputy is impeached. The two were elected on a joint ticket. In Nyandarua county, opponents were called out as being traitors and were chased out of the community hall. Some 291 legislators, more than the 117 constitutional requirement, signed the impeachment motion before it was introduced, but several of them from the deputy president’s home turf say they no longer support the motion after hearing contrary views from their constituents. 'If the deputy president is guilty, then his boss the president is equally guilty,' a female supporter told Citizen TV. Gachagua is facing impeachment on 10 grounds that include corruption, ethnic discrimination and contradicting government policies. He has maintained that he is innocent and has vowed to fight the impeachment motion. The high court Thursday declined to stop Friday’s public participation and set next Wednesday as the date for the hearing. Ruto has not weighed in on his deputy’s impeachment debate. He is on record in the earlier days of his presidency saying he would not publicly humiliate his deputy, alluding to the troubled relationship he had with his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta during their second term in office. The senate is expected to hear the impeachment motion Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-erupt-in-kenya-as-people-discuss-deputy-president-s-impeachment-motion/7810760.html	2024-10-04T10:47:38-07:00	
Collective trauma marks anniversary of Hamas attack on Israel	GENEVA — As the conflict in Gaza enters its second year, the World Health Organization is calling for an end to the 'unspeakable suffering' of civilians in Israel and the region and for health care to be protected and not attacked. The WHO says the horrific attacks by Hamas militants and other armed groups in Israel on October 7 of last year, have unleashed a chain of events that have caused tens of thousands of civilian deaths and injuries, as well as the displacement of millions of people in Israel, Gaza, the West Bank, and now in Lebanon. Dr. Michel Thieren, special WHO representative to Israel, told journalists at a briefing in Geneva Friday that for Israel, the October 7 massacres mark an event as significant and agonizing as the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United States. Ten thousand people remain buried under the rubble,' he said. 'The health system has suffered immensely from repeated attacks and an ongoing shortage of supplies, medicines, fuel, and staff.' The WHO said there have been at least 516 attacks on health care in Gaza, resulting in 765 deaths. It says only half of Gaza's hospitals are partially operational and 43% of primary health care centers are functional. It notes many essential health services are unavailable, including Gaza's only limb reconstruction center and sole psychiatric hospital. Other critical services, such as oncology and MRI services, specialized pediatric surgery and endocrinology services also are out of commission, 'At least 24,090 people are suffering from life-changing injuries due to the conflict, with no access to rehabilitation or specialized care,' the WHO's Ayadil Saparbekov said. 'We are deeply concerned about the conflict's impact on mental health in Gaza, where more than 485,000 people had already been diagnosed with mental disorders before the war.' The WHO flags malnutrition as another major concern. It said more than 20,000 children have been admitted for malnutrition treatment since January, including 4,437 for severe acute malnutrition, a condition that can lead to death if left untreated. The U.N. health agency warns communicable diseases are a significant public health threat, with cases of acute watery diarrhea and acute respiratory infections accounting for more than 80% of diseases reported during the first eight months of 2024. 'The poor water, sanitation, and hygiene situation, along with overcrowding in shelters, are the primary drivers of these diseases, Saparbekov said. 'These conditions are expected to worsen during winter, likely leading to a further rise in cases.' On a more positive note, he mentioned that preparations are underway for the second round of a polio vaccination campaign, scheduled to begin October 14 and end October 29. 'We have communicated these dates to the Israeli authorities, and we are having a meeting on Sunday to see whether this will be confirmed. We estimate that over 500,000 children between the ages of zero to 10 years will be vaccinated with the novel oral polio vaccine. 'In addition to the polio vaccinations, the children also will receive a dose of vitamin A to boost their immune system,' he said. WHO officials warn that repeated evacuation orders by Israel and ongoing hostilities continue to disrupt humanitarian operations in Gaza. As the grim one year anniversary of Hamas' terror attack on Israel nears, they are calling for 'effective deconfliction and protection of health care, safe access to health facilities, and sustained aid flow into and across Gaza' to assist the many in desperate need.	https://www.voanews.com/a/collective-trauma-marks-anniversary-of-hamas-attack-on-israel/7810793.html	2024-10-04T10:47:09-07:00	
Ukraine's Femen protest war at Iran embassy	kyiv, ukraine — Ukrainian feminist activists staged a topless protest Friday outside the Embassy of Iran, which Kyiv and the West say is arming Russia. Ukraine's Femen group is a feminist art collective that has for years staged stunts in Ukraine and abroad, with its trademark move being women appearing with their chests bare, protest slogans written across their bodies. Kyiv has branded Iran an 'accomplice' in Russia's invasion of Ukraine and regularly reports finding fragments of Iranian Shahed drones used by Moscow in attacks targeting civilian infrastructure. AFP saw two activists take their shirts off near the Iranian Embassy building in Kyiv, chanting and displaying anti-Iran and anti-Russia slogans written on their bodies. Western governments have accused Iran of supplying Moscow with both drones and missiles, which Tehran has repeatedly denied. At the U.N. last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced Russia involving authoritarian states Iran and North Korea — also widely believed to be arming Russia — in Moscow's more than two-year invasion of his country. 'Russia has no legitimate reason — none at all — for making Iran and North Korea de facto accomplices in its criminal war in Europe, with their weapons killing us, killing Ukrainians,' Zelenskyy said. Western countries have imposed sanctions on Iran's air transport links over its alleged supply of ballistic missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine. Femen, which campaigns for women's rights and against sexism and conservative Orthodoxy, originated in Ukraine but now also has branches in other countries. It has staged numerous stunts, including two of its activists lunging at Russian President Vladimir Putin on a visit to Germany in 2013 shouting 'dictator!'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-s-femen-protest-war-at-iran-embassy-/7810697.html	2024-10-04T09:45:41-07:00

US adds 254,000 jobs, unemployment dips to 4.1% in still-sturdy labor market	WASHINGTON — America’s employers added a surprisingly strong 254,000 jobs in September, the latest evidence that the U.S. labor market is still solid enough to support steady hiring and a growing economy. Last month’s hiring gain was far more than economists had expected, and it was up sharply from the 159,000 jobs that were added in August. And after rising for most of 2024, the unemployment rate dropped for a second straight month, from 4.2% in August to 4.1% in September, the Labor Department said Friday. The latest figures suggest that many companies are still confident enough to fill jobs despite the continued pressure of high interest rates. Few employers are laying off workers, though many have grown more cautious about hiring. In an encouraging sign, the Labor Department also revised up its estimate of job growth in July and August by a combined 72,000. The September job gains were fairly broad-based, a healthy trend if it continues. Restaurants and bars added 69,000 jobs. Health care companies gained 45,000, government agencies 31,000, social assistance employers 27,000 and construction companies 25,000. A category that includes professional and business services added 17,000 after having lost jobs for three straight months. Average hourly raises were solid, too. They rose by a higher-than-expected 0.4% from August, slightly less than the 0.5% gain the month before. Measured from a year earlier, hourly wages climbed 4%, up a tick from a 3.9% year-over-year gain in August. The economy’s progress in taming inflation led the Federal Reserve last month to cut its benchmark interest rate by a sizable half-point, its first rate cut in more than four years, and said further cuts were likely in the coming months. The Fed said it wanted to ease the cost of borrowing to help bolster the job market. Considering Friday’s strong jobs report, the Fed is now likely to reduce its key rate by more typical quarter-point increments. 'The September jobs report shows a nice bump in labor demand at the beginning of the fall,″ said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. 'The U.S. economy is growing solidly in 2024 even as inflation slows to near the Fed’s target.' The resilience of the economy has come as a relief. Economists had expected that the Fed’s aggressive campaign to subdue inflation — it jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 — would cause a recession. It didn’t. The economy kept growing even in the face of ever-higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Most economists say the Fed appears to have achieved the once unlikely prospect of a 'soft landing,' in which high interest rates help vanquish inflation without triggering a recession. The economy is weighing heavily on voters as the Nov. 5 presidential election nears. Many Americans are unimpressed by the job market’s durability and are still frustrated by high prices, which remain on average 19% above where they were in February 2021. That was when inflation began surging as the economy rebounded with unexpected speed and strength from the pandemic recession, causing severe shortages of goods and labor. The public’s discontent with inflation and the economy under President Joe Biden has been a political burden for Vice President Kamala Harris in her race for the White House against former President Donald Trump. The jobs report for October, which the government will issue four days before Election Day, will likely be muddied by the effects of Hurricane Helene and a strike by Boeing machinists. Across the economy, though, most indicators look solid. The U.S. economy, the world’s largest, grew at a vigorous 3% annual pace from April through June, boosted by consumer spending and business investment. A forecasting tool from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta points to slower but still healthy 2.5% annual growth in the just-ended July-September quarter. The Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, reported that America’s services businesses grew for a third straight month in September and at an unexpectedly fast pace. The economy’s service sector is closely watched because it represents more than 70% of U.S. jobs. Last month, the nation’s households increased their spending at retailers. And even with hiring having slowed, Americans are enjoying unusual job security. Layoffs are near a record low as a percentage of employment. The number of people filing for unemployment benefits also remains near historically low levels. Companies seem generally reluctant to let workers go even though some are also hesitant to expand their payrolls. That unusual dynamic may stem from many employers having been caught flat-footed and short of staff after the economy began roaring back from the pandemic recession. Posted job openings, too, have declined steadily, to 8 million in August, after having peaked at 12.2 million in March 2022. Workers have noticed the chillier environment for jobseekers. Far fewer feel confident enough to leave their jobs to seek a better position. The number of Americans who are quitting their jobs has reached its lowest level since August 2020, when the economy was still reeling from COVID.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-adds-254-000-jobs-unemployment-dips-to-4-1-in-still-sturdy-labor-market/7810508.html	2024-10-04T07:55:49-07:00

Tunisia's president faces little challenge ahead of Sunday's vote	paris — On a warm fall evening five years ago, supporters of the moderate Islamist Ennadha party packed one end of Tunis' Habib Bourguiba Boulevard, the iconic landmark of Tunisia's 2011 revolution. The other end hosted a boisterous get-out-the vote for business tycoon Nabil Karaoui — one of 26 candidates running in the North African country's 2019 presidential race. Tunisians voting Sunday will face a sharply narrower field. Out of 14 aspiring presidential candidates, the country's electoral commission — handpicked by current President Kais Saied — approved just three. The first is in prison. The second is considered close to Saied. The third is Saied himself. 'The climate today is one of repression of every form of liberty,' said Kamel Jendoubi, a former minister who headed Tunisia's first post-revolution electoral commission. 'Arrests have multiplied against the opposition. Today all the main political leaders, from the left, center and right, are in prison.' Jendoubi's remarks are echoed by a raft of opposition politicians, analysts and rights activists, even as Saied's supporters praise him for overhauling a corrupt and gridlocked system. Few dispute that after five years in office, the 66-year-old leader has dramatically reshaped Tunisia's political landscape, even as high unemployment and a struggling economy persist. With Sunday's vote seemingly stacked in the president's favor, some believe a second Saied term could consolidate a return to the country's authoritarian past. Others suggest Tunisians, notably a young, post-revolution generation, will not tolerate the loss of their fledgling democracy — especially if they judge the vote to be rigged. 'If he's elected under these circumstances, it will be a weak regime,' predicted Michael Ayari, senior Tunisia analyst for the International Crisis Group policy institute. 'And a weak regime will do spectacular things to gain legitimacy.' Cleaning up A law professor and political newcomer, Saied catapulted to power in 2019, running a one-man, shoestring campaign. His populist message of rooting out cronyism and returning power to the people resonated among an electorate fed up with years of dysfunctional governance. Thousands celebrated after Saied clinched runoff elections against businessman Karaoui, capturing 73% of the vote — a score some analysts believe he hopes to match or exceed. Tunisian taxi driver Mongi Ben Ameur voted for Saied then. He plans to vote for him again on Sunday. 'The former regime, the people in politics, they profited from the country, they profited from the people,' Ben Ameur says. 'Saied is trying to clean everything up. We won't harvest the fruits right away, but he's done things we haven't seen before.' In July 2021, Saied seized widespread powers, ultimately dissolving parliament. Over the next two years, he rewrote the country's constitution, beefing up presidential powers and reducing legislative ones. Voter turnout to approve each change was low, however, dipping to just over 11% in last year's legislative polls. 'I think he had this philosophy that he had to destroy everything to rebuild on solid foundations,' said Abdelkaddous Saadaoui, an activist and former Cabinet member, describing Saied's philosophy which he opposes. 'He's convinced he's found solutions for the people,' said Tunisian essayist Hatem Nafti, who authored a newly published book on Tunisia under Saied. 'He doesn't even realize he's a dictator.' Under Saied's presidency, authorities have detained or imprisoned dozens of opposition politicians, activists and journalists, dismissed judges and prosecutors, and weakened free expression and judicial independence. Even as Saied cracked down on corruption, analyst Ayari said, new forms have rooted and flourished. For now, Saied faces no major challengers. On Tuesday, a Tunisian court toughened a prison sentence against presidential candidate Ayachi Zammel on forgery charges, although he remains on the ballot. Separately, the elections commission rejected a top administrative court's decision authorizing three additional candidates to run. Last week, lawmakers hastily passed legislation stripping the court's authority to decide election disputes. 'He's afraid of losing,' former minister Jendoubi said of Saied. 'When Kais Saied did his coup, he was popular — people went out on the streets to applaud him. But his popularity has dropped considerably, because he's not been able to resolve people's problems.' Challenging times Internationally, Saied has moved beyond Tunisia's traditional Western alliances, reaching out to Iran, China and Russia, and rejecting foreign interference. He struck a controversial deal with the European Union to radically curb African migration to Europe, but rejected a $1.9 billion International Monetary Fund bailout, even as the country's public debt soars. Prices and joblessness are also high, and the country faces a major water crisis, which the president blames on a conspiracy. 'Mr. Saied has shown little interest in reforms: his economic policy does not go much beyond ranting about speculators and the odd anti-corruption drive (usually aimed at his political opponents),' The Economist wrote recently. 'Another five years of this all but ensures that Tunisia's economy will continue to flounder.' While some activists still take to the streets, fear has silenced others. One declined to be interviewed over safety concerns. 'We've returned to self-censorship,' another Tunisian said. 'It's true that some still dare to speak out, but no one knows when that will be deemed too much.' Still, one Tunisian businesswoman, with local government experience, does not regret Saied's tenure. 'These are challenging times, but sadly I feel we need to go through this,' she said. 'Because in the past, political parties always made agreements to get a piece of the pie instead of serving the people.' 'For the moment, populism works,' said Crisis Group analyst Ayari of Saied. 'Because each time he makes a mistake, he says 'it's not me — it's the others, it's the plotters.' But if there's a new narrative saying Kais Saied is responsible, then there will be mobilizations.'Members of Tunisia's weakened and divided opposition believe change will come, sooner or later. 'I think there will be resistance against Kais Saied if he is going to confiscate power through cheating and repression,' says Ridha Driss, a senior member of the opposition Ennahdha party. 'A peaceful political resistance will gain ground, and things won't last long for Kais Saied.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tunisia-s-president-faces-little-challenge-ahead-of-sunday-s-vote/7809412.html	2024-10-04T06:35:48-07:00	
Pakistan locks down capital, suspends cellphones to thwart opposition rally	Islamabad — Pakistan Friday imposed strict security measures in and around Islamabad to deter supporters of imprisoned former prime minister Imran Khan from marching on the country’s capital. Authorities have blocked highways and roads leading into the city with freight containers. They have suspended cellphone service and public transport, and closed schools. Police and paramilitary forces were stationed at entry and exit points, and the government temporarily banned public gatherings in Islamabad. Similar security measures were placed in the adjoining city of Rawalpindi, where Pakistan's military is headquartered. Khan has urged supporters of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party from all over the country to assemble at D-Chowk, a public square, near Parliament and the prime minister's office, to peacefully protest claimed election rigging and government efforts to introduce contentious constitutional amendments. Friday’s anti-government demonstration is the latest in a series of PTI rallies against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's coalition government in recent weeks. Khan, 71, contends that the ruling coalition has neither moral nor legal jurisdiction to amend the constitution, citing alleged election fraud as the basis for its illegitimacy. 'I want you all to reach D-Chowk today for a peaceful protest rally,' read an Urdu-language statement posted on Khan’s social media platform X on Friday. 'This war has entered a decisive phase,' he added. Police in the capital were seen rounding up several PTI activists Friday, including women, trying to make their way to the protest site. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi warned PTI supporters against storming and holding the rally in Islamabad. 'Anyone caught will not be shown any leniency, and no one should complain later,' he told a late Thursday news conference. Naqvi defended the government's response to the opposition rally, saying Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was in the capital, and preparations were underway for an October 15-16 Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting. He said Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang is scheduled to visit Islamabad before the SCO gathering, adding that the government 'can't allow any chaos' in the wake of these high-profile events, and urging Khan’s party to move the rally to a later date. Khan has been in jail since August of last year on highly contentious corruption and other criminal charges, while his party remains a target of a military-backed government crackdown. He rejects all the charges as politically motivated, and his convictions have either been quashed or suspended for lack of evidence. Despite facing challenges, PTI-backed candidates won the most seats in the general election in February, but not enough to form a government. That enabled Khan’s opponents, led by Sharif, to cobble together a ruling coalition, allegedly with the help of the powerful military. Khan, a former cricket star turned prime minister, was ousted from power in a 2022 opposition parliamentary no-confidence motion led by Sharif. The deposed Pakistani leader rejected the move as illegal and claimed the military orchestrated it, charges Sharif and army officials subsequently denied.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-locks-down-capital-suspends-cellphones-to-thwart-opposition-rally-/7810320.html	2024-10-04T05:08:30-07:00

Bosnia floods kill 14 people	Kiseljak, Bosnia and Herzegovina — Heavy rains that flooded towns and touched off landslides left at least 14 people dead in Bosnia on Friday, authorities said. Jablanica, some 70 kilometers (43 miles) southwest of Sarajevo, appeared to bear the brunt of the 24 hours of downpours, which cut it off from the outside world. Photos on local media from the Jablanica region showed mudslides coming up to roofs of houses and a mosque with only its minaret sticking out. 'For now, the bodies of 14 people have been found' in the region of Jablanica, spokesman Darko Jukan told AFP, adding that the toll was likely to rise. Jablanica 'cannot be entered or exited at the moment', a mountain rescue service said of the town of around 4,000 people. A number of people from the area were reported missing, the authorities said while some injured were evacuated with a helicopter from the European Union peacekeeping force (EUFOR). At mid-Friday the situation was the most critical in the village of Donja Jablanica that remained cut off, the spokesman said. Several roads and bridges in the region collapsed, he said. In Kiseljak, some 20 kilometers west of Sarajevo, houses, gardens and cars were under water, an AFP journalist reported. A large part of Bosnia's population is at risk due to heavy floods and landslides, the federal civil protection administration said in a statement. Firefighters, police and utility companies were working in the affected areas, but more help is needed to mitigate the consequences of storms and rainfall, the federal civil protection administration warned. Prime Minister of Bosnia's Muslim-Croat half Nermin Niksic wrote on social media platform X that the situation was 'very serious as many citizens are still trapped in their houses. In neighboring Croatia, weather authorities issued a warning for the northern Adriatic coast, Istria peninsula and central part of the country due to the heavy rains. In a statement, it said that urban flooding and interruption of traffic, communications, electricity and water supply were expected. Scientist warn that climate change worsens the impact of extreme weather events. Torrential rains and strong winds have led to widespread flooding in central and eastern Europe last month, killing at least 24 people and devastating towns and villages.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bosnia-floods-kill-14-people-/7810269.html	2024-10-04T04:34:55-07:00	
EU executive to adopt tariffs on Chinese EVs after vote	BRUSSELS — The European Commission said on Friday it had received enough support from E.U. members to impose tariffs of up to 45% on Chinese electric vehicle imports in the bloc's highest profile trade case, but would continue to negotiate with Beijing. The Commission, which oversees the bloc's trade policy, has proposed final duties on Chinese-built EVs for the next five years to counter what it sees as unfair Chinese subsidies after a year-long anti-subsidy investigation. In a vote on Friday, 10 E.U. members backed tariffs and five voted against, with 12 abstentions, E.U. sources said. It would have taken opposition from a qualified majority of 15 E.U. members, representing 65% of the E.U. population, to block the proposal. Reuters reported on Wednesday that the measure was likely to pass with France, Italy and Poland planning to vote in favor. The E.U. executive said it had obtained 'the necessary support' to adopt the tariffs, although it would continue talks with Beijing to find an alternative solution. The region's biggest economy and major car producer, Germany, voted against the proposal, sources said on Friday. BMW Chief Executive Oliver Zipse described the vote as 'a fatal signal for the European automotive industry'. He said a quick settlement was needed between Brussels and Beijing to prevent a trade conflict. Volkswagen said the planned tariffs were 'the wrong approach.' China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Stellantis said it supported free and fair competition and that the sector was under pressure from ambitious carbon reduction plans and 'the Chinese global commercial offensive.' Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that the E.U. was headed for an 'economic cold war' with China. The E.U.'s stance towards Beijing has hardened in the last five years. It views China as a potential partner in some issues, but also as a competitor and a systemic rival. In moves seen as a retaliation, Beijing this year launched its own probes into imports of E.U. brandy, dairy and pork products. The Commission says China's spare production capacity of three million EVs per year, which needed to be exported, is twice the size of the E.U. market. Given 100% tariffs in the United States and Canada, the most obvious outlet for those EVs is Europe. The E.U. executive has said it is willing to continue negotiating an alternative to tariffs with China and could re-examine a price undertaking — involving a minimum import price and typically a volume cap — having previously rejected those offered by Chinese companies. The tariffs range from 7.8% for Tesla TSLA.O to 35.3% for SAIC 600104.SS and other companies deemed not to have cooperated with the E.U. investigation. These tariffs are on top of the EU's standard 10% import duty for cars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-executive-to-adopt-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-after-vote-/7810243.html	2024-10-04T04:04:46-07:00	
Sudan's war to intensify as rainy season draws to a close	DUBAI — After almost 18 months of war, fighting in Sudan is escalating as seasonal rains end with the army using intensified airstrikes and allied fighters to shore up its position ahead of a likely surge by the rival Rapid Support Forces (RSF). An uptick in fighting will aggravate an already dire humanitarian crisis in which famine has been confirmed and over 10 million people — one fifth of the population — are displaced, more than anywhere else in the world. U.N. agencies have often been unable to deliver aid. 'There won't be a decisive breakthrough,' a senior Western diplomat in the region, speaking on condition of anonymity due to political sensitivities, told Reuters. 'What we expect to come into the fall more and more is much more fragmentation, to see more armed groups getting involved ... And this will make the situation in general much more difficult.' The paramilitary RSF has had the upper hand during much of the conflict but last week the army, after shunning U.S.-led talks in Switzerland, launched its biggest offensive yet in the capital Khartoum, advancing across a key bridge over the Nile. In Darfur, former rebel groups and volunteers from displacement camps have rallied to defend the densely populated city of al-Fashir, the army's last holdout in the western region, against waves of RSF attacks. Two army sources said the army had worked for months to replenish weaponry including drones and warplanes, as well as training up new volunteers, to strengthen its position on the ground before any negotiations. Three residents in the capital, which is made up of Khartoum and its adjoining cities of Omdurman and Bahri, said that in recent days the army had been carrying out more air bombardments with a larger number of drones and fighter jets than before. While the army has used its superior air power at the end of the rainy season to pound RSF-held territory in the capital, Darfur and El Gezira state, the RSF's more effective ground troops are expected to regain an edge as the dry season starts and roads become more passable. The RSF released a video on Monday with its fighters promising a 'hot winter' for its rivals in Sennar, where its progress had earlier been slowed by the rains. Witnesses there as well as in the capital reported heavy fighting on Thursday. Both sides have reinforced militarily as the conflict in Africa's third largest country by land area has deepened, drawing on material support from foreign backers, diplomats and analysts say. Battle in the capital The war began in April 2023 as the army and the RSF jostled to protect their power and wealth ahead of a planned political transition towards civilian rule and free elections. The RSF, which has its roots in the so-called Janjaweed militias that helped the government crush a rebellion by non-Arab groups in Darfur in the early 2000s, quickly occupied much of the capital before consolidating its grip on Darfur and seizing El Gezira state, south of Khartoum. Earlier this year, the army gained ground in Omdurman after acquiring Iranian drones. But it showed little sign of building on the advance before the surprise offensive it began last week on the day that its commander, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, told the United Nations that the RSF had to withdraw and lay down its arms for there to be peace. The army now has control of the capital's Halfaya bridge, allowing it to build a foothold in Bahri from its bases in Omdurman. It has also weathered heavy clashes and sniper fire to advance across another Nile bridge that leads to the heart of the capital, military sources and witnesses said. Disease and starvation For months the RSF has besieged al-Fashir, which is crammed with some 1.8 million residents and displaced people. Activists and diplomats have warned of ethnically-charged bloodletting if the city falls, after similar violence that was blamed on the RSF and its allies elsewhere in Darfur. Two witnesses in al-Fashir told Reuters that the RSF had been shelling large areas of the city as the army responded with air strikes. The battle has dragged on as non-Arab former rebel groups and volunteers from displacement camps who are better equipped for ground combat than the army fight to protect themselves and their families, the witnesses said. A local group representing displaced people in Darfur said this week that the fighting had exacerbated the humanitarian situation in two dozen camps across the Darfur region, 'all of which suffer from a lack of the most basic daily necessities', and that disease and starvation were spreading. Aid workers and human rights activists say there has been little increase in humanitarian relief, despite pledges by both sides to improve access for aid. Sudan, often overlooked amid armed conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza and elsewhere, received some diplomatic attention at the U.N. General Assembly last week. But USAID Deputy Administrator Isobel Coleman told Reuters there had been little progress getting outside players to stop fueling the war. 'Both of the actors in this conflict, both sides of this, have outside support which they believe is going to tip the scales to their advantage,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-s-war-to-intensify-as-rainy-season-draws-to-a-close-/7810231.html	2024-10-04T03:35:55-07:00	
Ukraine says Russia attacked its critical infrastructure with 19 drones	KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian air force said on Friday that Russia attacked critical infrastructure in the country with 19 drones overnight. Air defenses shot down nine drones, with seven more likely impacted by electronic jamming, it said in a statement, without saying what happened to the other three. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said an apartment building was damaged in the capital but reported no casualties. The fire was promptly extinguished there, he added. The attack also damaged a business administrative building in the central region of Kirovohrad, causing light injuries to one of the employees, governor Andriy Raykovych said. Russian forces also hit critical infrastructure, utility facilities and 35 private residences in the past day in the southern Kherson region, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Various attacks there killed one and injured four more, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-russia-attacked-its-critical-infrastructure-with-19-drones/7810176.html	2024-10-04T02:17:26-07:00	
Nuclear stalemate sparks debate over information campaign aimed at North Korea	Washington — As a nuclear standoff between the United States and North Korea continues with no diplomatic off-ramp in sight, some experts in Washington say an information campaign aimed at pressing North Korea should be considered as an alternative strategy, while others caution against such an approach. The discussion comes as the North escalates tensions while the U.N. Security Council remains split over how to respond to Pyongyang's increasing threats. Kim Song, North Korea's U.N. ambassador, told the U.N. General Assembly on Monday his country will resolutely hold onto its nuclear weapons, saying 'we will never bargain,' regardless of who gets elected as the next U.S. president in November. Last month, North Korea's state media outlets released photos showing leader Kim Jong Un visiting what they claimed to be a uranium enrichment facility, another move against international calls to resume talks on denuclearization. It was the first time it had disclosed a uranium enrichment facility publicly. Nuclear standoff Talks between the U.S. and North Korea have been stalled since October 2019. Moreover, Russia, one of five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council with veto power, has blocked U.N. action against the North since February 2022, when it invaded Ukraine. Moscow has deepened military ties with Pyongyang since it started the war. Russia has imported dozens of ballistic missiles and more than 18,000 containers of munitions and munitions-related materiel from North Korea since its invasion of Ukraine, Robert Wood, deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said at a U.N. Security Council meeting in September. Some experts suggest Washington consider launching an information campaign against Pyongyang, separate from the work of Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, U.S. government-funded broadcasters. The two networks reach people inside North Korea through their Korean language broadcasts. David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, said Washington policymakers have long neglected an information campaign aimed at North Korea as a viable strategy for pressing Pyongyang to change its provocative behavior. 'We really haven't had an overall information strategy that cuts across everything that is happening,' Maxwell told VOA Korean on Tuesday in an interview. Maxwell, a former U.S. Special Forces colonel who served on the Combined Forces Command of the U.S and South Korea, said information is a threat to Pyongyang and could possibly drive the North Korean leader to the negotiating table. The U.S. should respond to every North Korean provocation by actively informing North Korean people of their dire human rights situations, Maxwell argued. 'If North Korea conducts a missile test, the response should not just stop at condemning the act,' he said. 'Kim's deliberate decision to prioritize nuclear weapons and missiles is what is causing the suffering of the Korean people in the North. That should be a routine message that we should be sending in response to every action by North Korea.' Targeted information campaign Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation, said information could be part of the targeted efforts to put pressure on the Kim regime. 'We could tell Kim Jong Un, look, we know you're preparing to do a seventh nuclear weapon test. If you do that, we will send a million USB drives into the Pyongyang area with K-Pop, K-dramas and messages to your senior leaders,' he told VOA Korean by phone on Tuesday. Bennett stressed it is time that the U.S. government renews its understanding that information can be a powerful tool. 'You go back to World War II, we viewed information as being very powerful,' he said. 'But we've lost sight of that.' Bennett added that the U.S. government should mobilize its experts in psychological operations to put together an effective campaign plan. Some are cautious about using information tactics against North Korea. Robert Rapson, who served as chargé d'affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA Korean on Wednesday via email that an information campaign may complement sanctions and effective diplomacy, but risks could follow. 'Turning the volume and intensity of the information campaign way up, as some are now advocating, runs the clear risk of escalating tensions across the demilitarized zone in ways that threaten peace and stability, to include the distinct possibility of war,' Rapson said. 'The regime would undoubtedly see a high intensity information campaign as a major provocation of existential dimensions and would respond accordingly.' Rapson also said significant qualitative improvements are needed in dissemination technology as well as message focus and content, for an enhanced information campaign to have any chance of success, however long-term that might be. Potential risks Joseph DeTrani, who served as the special envoy for six-party denuclearization talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006, said implementing such an approach would prove challenging but is 'doable.' 'The North Korean regime fears exposing its people to the reality of the outside world — the real situation in South Korea and other countries as compared to the dire economic and health care situation in North Korea,' DeTrani told VOA Korean on Wednesday via email. 'Mindful of this, inserting truthful information into North Korea must be done with care, given the harsh treatment by the regime to those who dare to listen or read foreign broadcasts, videos, newspapers, etc.' Meanwhile, Maxwell said the end goal of the information strategy should be to empower the North Korean people with information. 'Only through information can the people be empowered to create conditions where new emerging leadership can come to power,' he said. 'So that, they change the direction of North Korea and ultimately, their leaders.' The U.S. State Department has stressed the need for an effort to facilitate the flow of independent information into North Korea when asked whether the U.S. should consider using information as a pressure tool against the North. 'An informed citizenry, with unfettered access to information, is critical for responsive governance and contributes to regional peace, security, and prosperity,' a State Department spokesperson said in an emailed response on Thursday to a VOA Korean inquiry. 'The United States will continue to coordinate with like-minded governments to cooperate on areas such as access to information and advancing accountability for those responsible for human rights violations and abuses in the DPRK.' DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nuclear-stalemate-sparks-debate-over-information-campaign-aimed-at-north-korea/7810170.html	2024-10-04T01:59:23-07:00	
Analysts: Japan's new prime minister may seek nuclear consulting body with US	Washington — Japan's new prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, who began his term this week, may advocate for forming a nuclear body with the United States that is similar to an arrangement between the U.S. and South Korea aimed at planning for nuclear warfare contingencies. 'The U.S.-ROK [Republic of Korea, or South Korea] approach is probably a good example of where the U.S. and Japan might go in the future if nuclear threats keep increasing,' said James Schoff, a senior director of the U.S.-Japan NEXT Alliance Initiative at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA. 'It's not about nuclear sharing or Japan building its own nuclear forces — both politically impossible at the moment and not necessary — but [about] the alliance taking more practical steps to be prepared for U.S. nuclear retaliation, if it becomes necessary,' Schoff said. He said creating such a body would demonstrate resolve, credibility and readiness to any potential adversary and thus deter nuclear use in the first place. Nuclear talk body The new body would resemble the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) that South Korea and the United States established as part of the Washington Declaration in April 2023. The Washington-Seoul nuclear body is aimed at planning for potential nuclear contingencies caused by North Korea. A U.S.-Japan nuclear consultative body would focus on nuclear threats from China and Russia in addition to North Korea, analysts say. In a joint statement issued at their Security Consultative Committee meeting in July, Tokyo and Washington shared concerns over China's 'rapid expansion of its nuclear weapons arsenal' and agreed to strengthen deterrence through their ongoing Extended Deterrence Dialogue. 'Ishiba is likely to continue the strategies of [his predecessor Fumio] Kishida against China, and may in fact try to be bolder,' said Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Indo-Pacific Security Initiative and an associate professor at Tokyo International University. Countering China Though he is not entirely anti-China, Ishiba, a former defense minister who analysts say tends to view foreign relations through a security framework, is expected to be tough on China's military assertions. 'Prime Minister Ishiba has spoken openly about the serious security challenges China poses to Japan,' said Ken Weinstein, the Japan chair at Hudson Institute. 'These challenges lie behind his desire for an Asian NATO and nuclear sharing, neither of which is likely to be policy,' Weinstein continued. 'Instead, we are likely to see a change in tone towards the PRC with a tougher line from the Kantei on Chinese provocations than we saw from the more establishmentarian Kishida government.' The People's Republic of China (PRC) is the official name of China, and the Kantei refers to the Japanese prime minister's office. Before Ishiba was elected, he wrote an article published in September by the Hudson Institute, an American conservative non-profit think tank based in Washington D.C., advocating for an Asian version of NATO that would consider sharing U.S. nuclear weapons or introducing nuclear weapons in the region. He said if nuclear threats by China and North Korea escalate in the region, 'the U.S. extended deterrence in the region will no longer function.' Extended deterrence involves a U.S. commitment to use all military assets, including nuclear weapons, to defend the region. Such a commitment would deter potential adversaries from causing any conflict. But in recent years, there has been growing skepticism among U.S. allies over its extended deterrence commitment, leading South Korea to call for its own nuclear weapons. In January 2023, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said South Korea may have to consider developing its own nuclear weapons or ask the U.S. to redeploy nuclear weapons in South Korea. Yoon later retracted his statement after the NCG was created in April 2023, saying that South Korea will instead focus on enhancing deterrence with the United States to deal with North Korea's nuclear threat. Asian NATO Ishiba's call for a collective security arrangement like an Asian NATO and nuclear deployment and sharing options stems from uncertainty in relying 'solely on the security alliance with the U.S.,' said Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in international policy focusing on Japanese foreign policy at Stanford University. Ishiba sees 'the need to protect Taiwan from Chinese attempts to forcefully reunify' the self-governed island that Beijing considers its own territory. He also wants Japan 'to be prepared for any eventualities, including the retreat of the United States from global leadership,' amid concerns over U.S. foreign policy after the presidential election in November, Sneider said. Before Japan's own election this month, Ishiba, as a member of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, visited Taiwan in August and told Taiwan President Lai Ching-te that enhanced deterrence was necessary to resist China's aggression in the Taiwan Strait. The Sasakawa Peace Foundation's Schoff said Ishiba probably knows that a true Asian NATO is not feasible, but 'he is sending a signal to China and Russia that their aggressive use of military forces harassing other countries and penetrating their sovereign space is being noticed and will push Asian countries closer together in collective defense if they keep it up.' Japan accused a Chinese spy plane of violating its airspace for the first time in August. Matthew Brummer, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo, said instead of calling for an Asian NATO, Japan will likely increase cooperation with NATO countries, deepening security agreements, especially regarding joint technology sharing and production.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-japan-s-new-prime-minister-may-seek-nuclear-consulting-body-with-us-/7810159.html	2024-10-04T01:23:42-07:00	
Dozens of zoo tigers die after contracting bird flu in southern Vietnam	HANOI, Vietnam — More than a dozen tigers were incinerated after the animals died after contracted bird flu at a zoo in southern Vietnam, officials said. State media VNExpress cited a caretaker at Vuon Xoai zoo in Bien Hoa city saying the animals were fed raw chicken bought from nearby farms. The panther and 20 tigers, including several cubs, weighed between 10 and 120 kilograms when they died. The bodies were incinerated and buried on the premises. 'The tigers died so fast. They looked weak, refused to eat and died after two days of falling sick,' said zoo manager Nguyen Ba Phuc. Samples taken from the tigers tested positive for H5N1, the virus that causes bird flu. The virus was first identified in 1959 and grew into a widespread and highly lethal menace to migratory birds and domesticated poultry. It has since evolved, and in recent years H5N1 was detected in a growing number of animals ranging from dogs and cats to sea lions and polar bears. In cats, scientists have found the virus attacking the brain, damaging and clotting blood vessels and causing seizures and death. More than 20 other tigers were isolated for monitoring. The zoo houses some 3,000 other animals including lions, bears, rhinos, hippos and giraffes. The 30 staff members who were taking care of the tigers tested negative for bird flu and were in normal health condition, VNExpress reported. Another outbreak also occurred at a zoo in nearby Long An province, where 27 tigers and three lions died within a week in September, the newspaper said. Unusual flu strains that come from animals are occasionally found in people. Health officials in the United States said Thursday that two dairy workers in California were infected — making 16 total cases detected in the country in 2024. 'The deaths of 47 tigers, three lions, and a panther at My Quynh Safari and Vuon Xoai Zoo amid Vietnam's bird flu outbreak are tragic and highlight the risks of keeping wild animals in captivity,' PETA Senior Vice President Jason Baker said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. 'The exploitation of wild animals also puts global human health at risk by increasing the likelihood of another pandemic,' Baker said. Bird flu has caused hundreds of deaths around the world, the vast majority of them involving direct contact between people and infected birds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-of-zoo-tigers-die-after-contracting-bird-flu-in-southern-vietnam/7810149.html	2024-10-04T00:52:12-07:00	
Israeli airstrikes rock southern suburbs of Beirut, cut off a key crossing into Syria	BEIRUT — Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates. Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the group's key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah. The blasts overnight rocked Beirut's southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday. The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It gave no other details. The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Lebanon's Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing. Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces. Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous. It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between September 23 — when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon — and September 30. There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon's minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanon's southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on October 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service. The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there. Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence. Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their October 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since September 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-airstrikes-rock-southern-suburbs-of-beirut-cut-off-a-key-crossing-into-syria-/7810144.html	2024-10-04T00:33:46-07:00	
Work and travel resume across Taiwan after Typhoon Krathon dissipates	KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan — Work, classes and flights resumed across Taiwan on Friday after Typhoon Krathon brought torrential rainfall to the island but finally dissipated over a mountain range. A heavy rain advisory remained in place for the northern coast and mountainous areas, where two landslides occurred early Friday. Krathon had brought much of the island to a standstill for three days but weakened to a tropical depression early Friday. Its center moved back over the sea after making a 'U-turn' across the island's southwestern tip overnight. Schools and businesses reopened with the exception of the city of Kaohsiung, Pingtung County, and some parts of Hualien County and New Taipei. Domestic flights, which had been grounded for two days, resumed. Krathon lashed Kaohsiung with winds up to 126 kph and higher gusts. It felled trees and flooded roads. Heavy rains and flooding also occurred along Taiwan's southern and eastern coasts. Mountainous Taitung County saw 171 centimeters of rain over six days. Two people died earlier in the week and one person remained missing, according to Taiwan's fire department. The missing person was swept off a bridge. Authorities had expected Krathon to bring devastation comparable to a major typhoon that swept Kaohsiung in 1977, causing 37 deaths. But it lost steam shortly after making landfall in Kaohsiung and reaching the mountains northeast of the city, according to the Central Weather Administration. Krathon was one of only two typhoons in recent history to 'die' over Taiwan, beside Typhoon Trami, in 2001, the weather agency said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/work-and-travel-resume-across-taiwan-after-typhoon-krathon-dissipates-/7810132.html	2024-10-03T23:22:37-07:00	
North Korea's Kim threatens to destroy South Korea with nuclear strikes if provoked	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to use nuclear weapons and destroy South Korea permanently if provoked, state media reported Friday, after the South's leader warned that Kim's regime would collapse if he attempted to use nuclear arms. The exchange of such rhetoric between the rival Koreas is nothing new, but the latest comments come during heightened animosities over the North's recent disclosure of a nuclear facility and its continuation of missile tests. Next week, observers say North Korea's rubber-stamp parliament is expected to constitutionally declare a hostile 'two-state' system on the Korean Peninsula to formally reject reconciliation with South Korea and codify new national borders. During a visit to a special operation forces unit on Wednesday, Kim said his military 'would use without hesitation all the offensive forces it possesses, including nuclear weapons,' if South Korea attempts to use armed forces encroaching upon the sovereignty of North Korea, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency. 'If such a situation comes, the permanent existence of Seoul and the Republic of Korea would be impossible,' Kim said, using South Korea's official name. Kim's statement was a response to South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's speech at his country's Armed Forces Day on Tuesday. Unveiling South Korea's most powerful Hyunmoo-5 ballistic missile and other conventional weapons that could target North Korea, Yoon said the day that North Korea tries to use nuclear weapons would be the end of the Kim government because Kim would face 'the resolute and overwhelming response' of the South Korean-U.S. alliance. Kim responded that Yoon's address fully betrayed his 'bellicose temerity' and showed 'the security uneasiness and irritating psychology of the puppet forces.' In a derisive comment, Kim called Yoon 'an abnormal man,' saying that 'the puppet Yoon bragged about an overwhelming counteraction of military muscle at the doorstep of a state that possesses nuclear weapons.' On Thursday, Kim's sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, also ridiculed South Korea's showcasing of the Hyunmoo-5 missile, saying there there's no way for South Korea to counter the North Korea's nuclear forces with conventional weapons. Since adopting an escalatory nuclear doctrine in 2022, Kim has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons preemptively. But many foreign experts say it's still unlikely that he would use his nuclear arms first because his military is outmatched by the U.S. and its allied forces. In July, South Korea and the U.S. signed a defense guideline on integrating South Korea's conventional capabilities with the U.S. nuclear forces to better deal with North Korea's advancing nuclear program. South Korea has no nuclear weapons. Animosities between the Koreas are at the worst point in years with Kim's provocative run of missile tests and the South Korean-U.S. military exercises intensifying in a cycle of tit-for-tat. All communication channels and exchange programs between the rivals remain stalled since 2019, when a broader U.S.-North Korea diplomacy on ending the North's nuclear program collapsed. In January, Kim called for rewriting North Korea's constitution to eliminate the idea of a peaceful unification between the war-divided countries and to cement the South as an 'invariable principal enemy.' He also reiterated that his country does not recognize the Northern Limit Line, a western sea boundary that was drawn by the U.S.-led U.N. Command at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. He called for the new constitution to include a clear definition of the North's territories. North Korea has traditionally insisted upon a boundary that encroaches deeply into waters currently controlled by South Korea. On Friday, South Korea's military said North Korea was again flying balloons likely carrying trash across the border into South Korea. Since late May, North Korea has launched thousands of rubbish-carrying balloons toward South Korea, prompting South Korea to resume anti-Pyongyang propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts at border areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-threatens-to-destroy-south-korea-with-nuclear-strikes-if-provoked/7810110.html	2024-10-03T21:43:46-07:00	
Year-old Gaza conflict takes toll on neighboring Egypt	Cairo — The war unleashed by Israel after the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, has ravaged not only the people of Gaza but also taken a toll on neighboring Egypt, keeping its government officials busy and straining its economy -- while also bringing some benefits. The conflict has spawned countless hours of diplomatic activity and a long list of visits by envoys from several countries. Mediation efforts have been unsuccessful, but the conflict has kept diplomats busy, with meetings of the Cairo-based Arab League and consultations involving Egypt, Qatar and the U.S., among others. Said Sadek, professor of peace studies and human rights at the Egypt-Japan University in Alexandria, told VOA Egypt has been one of the key players in mediation efforts between Israel and Hamas. He said its efforts have been successful at times and unsuccessful at others. 'Politically (the conflict) highlighted the Egyptian role in being a moderating force in the Middle East,' he said. 'In all the negotiations that took place later on between Hamas and Israel, they always needed a mediator, and it was Egypt and Qatar and the United States. And they all played a role in that and sometimes they succeeded and sometimes they failed.' The head of Egyptian intelligence, Abbas Kamel, spent many hours mediating between Israel and Hamas, as has U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Qatar's foreign minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al Thani. Economically, the Gaza conflict has caused serious damage to the Egyptian economy, but it has also brought benefits, as Washington-based Middle East analyst Paul Sullivan pointed out. 'Egypt is being squeezed between many rocks and many hard places, with a few positive bits of light,' he said. 'Those positive bits include money flows from the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council), the IMF (International Monetary Fund), the World Bank and others, to make sure that Egypt gets a bit more stabilized economically.' Sadek and Sullivan both agree the Egyptian economy suffered setbacks from the side effects of the Gaza conflict, including a massive drop in revenue from the Suez Canal, one of the Egyptian government's primary sources of income. 'The (Houthis) in Yemen blocked safe navigation across the Red Sea and that affected the Suez Canal that used to bring Egypt about $10 billion dollars,' said Sadek. 'Now we are getting only $3 billion, so there is a big loss of 70%.' Sullivan said Egypt is not only suffering from a loss of revenue from the Suez Canal due to ships going around the Horn of Africa to get to their destinations, but it is also in danger of a natural gas shortage 'if Israel were to cut off its gas exports to Egypt.' That would force the Egyptian government to import natural gas at considerably higher prices. Egyptians are already reeling. The government has raised the prices of petroleum and natural gas twice this year by as much as 15% each time. Egypt's overall inflation rate has hit 25%, with analysts blaming the jump largely on the war in Gaza. Tourism revenues are also down due to the Gaza conflict and some Western countries have warned their citizens not to travel to Egypt or other Middle Eastern countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/year-old-gaza-conflict-takes-toll-on-neighboring-egypt/7810073.html	2024-10-03T21:05:00-07:00	
Mixed verdict for 3 Memphis officers convicted in man’s fatal beating	MEMPHIS, Tennessee — Three former Memphis police officers were convicted Thursday in the 2023 fatal beating of Tyre Nichols, but were acquitted of the harshest charges they faced for a death that sparked national protests and calls for broad changes in policing. Jurors deliberated for about six hours before coming back with the mixed verdict for Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith. All were convicted of witness tampering related to the cover-up of the beating, but Bean and Smith were acquitted of civil rights charges. Haley was acquitted of violating Nichols' civil rights causing death, but convicted of the lesser charge of violating his civil rights causing bodily injury. He was also convicted of a conspiracy to witness tamper charge that the others were acquitted of. The court remained silent as the verdicts were read. The judge ordered all three officers to be taken into custody. He planned to hold a hearing Monday to hear from the defense lawyers about releasing them pending sentencing. The witness tampering charges carry possible sentences of up to 20 years in prison. The civil rights charge against Haley carries up to 10 years in prison. They had faced up to life in prison if convicted on the harshest charges. The verdict marked a partial setback for prosecutors who were unable to land a conviction for civil rights violations for two officers who played an active role in the encounter. Jurors repeatedly watched graphic clips from police video that showed the officers punch and kick Nichols and hit him with a police baton just steps from his home, as the 29-year-old called out for his mother. In a statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who oversees the Justice Department's civil rights division, said 'Tyre Nichols should be alive today.' 'We hope this prosecution provides some measure of comfort as the law enforcement officers tied to his death have been held accountable,' Clarke said. Bean and Smith were seen on video wrestling with Nichols and holding his arms, while also hitting him, but the jury was not convinced those actions amounted to civil rights violations. An FBI agent said Smith told him he punched Nichols, but defense lawyers argued Bean and Smith were merely slapping Nichols' hands away as they tried to put handcuffs on him. Rodney Wells, Nichols' stepfather, told The Associated Press outside the courtroom: 'A win is a win. They're all going to jail.' Five officers were charged in Nichols' death, but two pleaded guilty and testified against members of their old crime suppression unit. Prosecutors argued that Nichols was beaten for running from a traffic stop, saying it was part of a common police practice referred to in officer slang as a 'street tax' or 'run tax. ' They said the officers lied — to a supervisor, to medical professionals attending to Nichols and in required written reports — about the extent of the force they used. 'This has been a long journey for our family,' RowVaughn Wells, Nichols' mother, told reporters. 'I'm actually in shock right now because I still can't believe all the stuff that's going on. But we're happy that they all have been convicted and they have been arrested.' Smith's lawyer declined to comment. Attorneys for Bean and Haley did not respond to requests for comment. Nichols, who was Black, ran from the traffic stop despite being hit with pepper spray and a Taser. The five officers, who were fired after the beating, also are Black. Some of the most emotional testimony at trial came from one of the officers, Desmond Mills, who took a plea deal in which prosecutors call for up to 15 years in prison. He testified in tears that he was sorry, that he left Nichols' young son fatherless and that he wishes he stopped the punches. Later, he testified that he went along with a cover-up in hopes that Nichols would survive and the whole thing would 'blow over.' Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating. His son is now 7 years old. The other officer who reached a deal with prosecutors, Emmitt Martin, testified that Nichols was 'helpless' while officers pummeled him, and that afterward the officers understood 'they weren't going to tell on me, and I wasn't going to tell on them.' Under his plea agreement, prosecutors will suggest a prison sentence of up to 40 years. Defense attorneys sought to portray Martin as a principal aggressor. Martin testified Nichols was not a threat, yet he acknowledged punching and kicking Nichols in the head. Mills' lawyer declined to comment. Martin's attorney did not immediately respond to a phone message. The police video shows the officers milling about and talking as Nichols struggles with his injuries. An autopsy report shows he died from blows to the head. The report describes brain injuries, and cuts and bruises on his head and other areas. With the federal criminal trial complete, other investigations and court action still aren't settled. The five officers also have been charged with second-degree murder in state court, where they pleaded not guilty, although Mills and Martin are expected to change their pleas. A trial date in state court has not been set. The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a 'patterns and practices' investigation into how Memphis officers use force and conduct arrests, and whether the department in the majority-Black city engages in racially discriminatory policing. The Justice Department also has a separate review concerning use of force, de-escalation strategies and specialized units within Memphis police. Pastor Earle Fisher, a Memphis activist who has long called for investigations of the city's police, said he hopes the probes 'provide for us the remedies we so rightly deserve.' Additionally, Nichols' mother filed a $550 million lawsuit against the city and its police chief. Ben Crump and Anthony Romanucci, lawyers for Nichols' family, said the verdicts 'bring a measure of accountability for his senseless and tragic death.' 'Our fight for justice for Tyre is far from over,' the lawyers said in a joint statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mixed-verdict-for-3-memphis-officers-convicted-in-man-s-fatal-beating/7810093.html	2024-10-03T20:33:19-07:00	
Grace period for US student loan payments is over. Here's what you need to know	NEW YORK — The 12-month grace period for student loan borrowers ended on September 30. The 'on-ramp' period helped borrowers who are struggling to make payments avoid the risk of defaulting and hurting their credit score. 'The end of the on-ramp period means the beginning of the potentially harsh consequences for student loan borrowers who are not able to make payments,' said Persis Yu, Deputy Executive Director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Around 43 million Americans have student loan debt, amounting to $1.5 trillion. Around eight million of those borrowers had enrolled in the SAVE plan, the newest income-driven repayment plan that extended the eligibility for borrowers to have affordable monthly student loan payments. However, this plan is currently on hold due to legal challenges. With the on-ramp period and a separate program known as Fresh Start ending and the SAVE plan on hold, student loan borrowers who are struggling to afford their monthly payments have fewer options, added Yu. Student loan borrowers who haven't been able to afford their monthly payments must consider their options to avoid going into default. If you have student loans, here's what you need to know. What was the on-ramp period? The Education Department implemented this grace period to ease the borrower's transition to make payments after a three-year payment pause during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this year-long period, borrowers were encouraged to keep making payments since interest continued to accumulate. 'Normally, loans will default if you fall about nine months behind on making payments, but during this on-ramp period, missed payments would not move people towards defaulting and then being subject to forced collections. However, if you missed payments, you still be falling behind ultimately on repaying your loans,' said Abby Shaforth, director of National Consumer Law Center's Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project. Since this grace period has ended, student loan borrowers who don't make payments will go delinquent or, if their loans are not paid for nine months, go into default. Borrowers who cannot afford to make payments can apply for deferment or forbearance, which pause payments, though interest continues to accrue. What happens if I don't make my payments? Borrowers who can't or don't pay risk delinquency and eventually default. That can badly hurt your credit rating and make you ineligible for additional aid and government benefits. If a borrower missed one month's payment, they will start receiving email notifications, said Shaforth. Once the loan hasn't been paid for three months, loan servicers notify to the credit reporting agencies that the loan is delinquent, affecting your credit history. Once the borrower hasn't paid the loan for nine months, the loan goes into default. If you're struggling to pay, advisers first encourage you to check if you qualify for an income-driven repayment plan, which determines your payments by looking at your expenses. You can see whether you qualify by visiting the Federal Student Aid website. If you've worked for a government agency or a non-profit organization, you could also be eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which forgives student debt after 10 years. What happens when a loan goes into default? When you fall behind on a loan by 270 days — roughly nine months — the loan appears on your credit report as being in default. Once a loan is in default, it goes into collections. This means the government can garnish wages (without a court order) to go towards paying back the loan, intercept tax refunds, and seize portions of Social Security checks and other benefit payments. What if I can't pay? If your budget doesn't allow you to resume payments, it's important to know how to navigate the possibility of default and delinquency on a student loan. Both can hurt your credit rating, which would make you ineligible for additional aid. If you're in a short-term financial bind, you may qualify for deferment or forbearance — allowing you to temporarily suspend payment. To determine whether deferment or forbearance are good options for you, you can contact your loan servicer. One thing to note: interest still accrues during deferment or forbearance. Both can also impact potential loan forgiveness options. Depending on the conditions of your deferment or forbearance, it may make sense to continue paying the interest during the payment suspension. What is an income-driven repayment plan? The U.S. Education Department offers several plans for repaying federal student loans. Under the standard plan, borrowers are charged a fixed monthly amount that ensures all their debt will be repaid after 10 years. But if borrowers have difficulty paying that amount, they can enroll in one of several plans that offer lower monthly payments based on income and family size. Those are known as income-driven repayment plans. Income-driven options have been offered for years and generally cap monthly payments at 10% of a borrower's discretionary income. If a borrower's earnings are low enough, their bill is reduced to $0. And after 20 or 25 years, any remaining debt gets erased. What is the latest with the SAVE program? In August, the Supreme Court kept on hold the SAVE plan, the income-driven repayment plan that would have lowered payments for millions of borrowers, while lawsuits make their way through lower courts. Eight million borrowers who had already enrolled in the SAVE plan don't have to pay their monthly student loan bills until the court case is resolved. Debt that already had been forgiven under the plan was unaffected. The next court hearing about this case will be held on October 15. What happened with the Fresh Start program? The Fresh Start program, which gave benefits to borrowers who were delinquent prior to the pandemic payment pause, also closed on September 30. During this limited program, student loan borrowers who were in default prior to the pandemic were given the opportunity to remove their loans from default, allowing them to enroll in income-driven payment plans, or apply for deferment, among other benefits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/grace-period-for-us-student-loan-payments-is-over-here-s-what-you-need-to-know-/7810088.html	2024-10-03T20:16:49-07:00	
US dockworkers to suspend strike until January	detroit — The union representing 45,000 striking U.S. dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports reached a deal Thursday to suspend a three-day strike until January 15 to provide time to negotiate a new contract. The union, the International Longshoremen's Association, is to resume working immediately. The temporary end to the strike came after the union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies, reached a tentative agreement on wages, the union and ports said in a joint statement. A person briefed on the agreement said the ports sweetened their wage offer from about 50% over six years to 62%. The person didn't want to be identified because the agreement is tentative. Any wage increase would have to be approved by union members as part of the ratification of a final contract. The union went on strike early Tuesday after its contract expired in a dispute over pay and the automation of tasks at 36 ports stretching from Maine to Texas. The strike came at the peak of the holiday shopping season at the ports, which handle about half the cargo from ships coming into and out of the United States. The walkout raised the risk of shortages of goods on store shelves if it lasted more than a few weeks. Most retailers, though, had stocked up or shipped items early in anticipation of the dockworkers' strike. 'With the grace of God, and the goodwill of neighbors, it's gonna hold,' President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday night after the agreement. In a statement later, Biden applauded both sides 'for acting patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability of critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding.' Biden said that collective bargaining is 'critical to building a stronger economy from the middle out and the bottom up.' The union's membership won't need to vote on the temporary suspension of the strike, meaning that giant cranes should start loading and unloading shipping containers Thursday night. Until January 15, the workers will be covered under the old contract, which expired on September 30. The union had been demanding a 77% raise over six years, plus a complete ban on the use of automation at the ports, which members see as a threat to their jobs. Both sides also have been apart on the issues of pension contributions and the distribution of royalties paid on containers that are moved by workers. Thomas Kohler, who teaches labor and employment law at Boston College, said the agreement to halt the strike means that the two sides are close to a final deal. 'I'm sure that if they weren't going anywhere they wouldn't have suspended (the strike),' he said. 'They've got wages. They'll work out the language on automation, and I'm sure that what this really means is it gives the parties time to sit down and get exactly the language they can both live with.' Industry analysts have said that for every day of a port strike it takes four to six days to recover. But they said a short strike of a few days probably wouldn't gum up the supply chain too badly. Kohler said the surprise end to the strike may catch railroads with cars, engines and crews out of position. But railroads are likely to work quickly to fix that. Just before the strike had begun, the Maritime Alliance said both sides had moved off their original wage offers, a tentative sign of progress. The settlement pushes the strike and any potential shortages past the November presidential election, eliminating a potential liability for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. It's also a big plus for the Biden-Harris administration, which has billed itself as the most union-friendly in American history. Shortages could have driven up prices and reignited inflation. Thursday's deal came after administration officials met with foreign-owned shipping companies before dawn on Zoom, according to a person briefed on the day's events who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. The White House wanted to increase pressure to settle, emphasizing the responsibility to reopen the ports to help with recovery from Hurricane Helene, the person said. Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su told them she could get the union to the bargaining table to extend the contract if the carriers made a higher wage offer. Chief of Staff Jeff Zients told the carriers they had to make an offer by the end of the day so a manmade strike wouldn't worsen a natural disaster, the person said. By midday the Maritime Alliance members agreed to a large increase, bringing about the agreement, according to the person.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-dockworkers-union-to-suspend-strike-until-january-to-allow-time-to-negotiate-new-contract-/7810083.html	2024-10-03T20:05:11-07:00

UK gives sovereignty of long-contested Chagos Islands to Mauritius	london — The British government agreed Thursday to hand sovereignty of the long-contested Chagos Islands, an archipelago of more than 60 islands in the Indian Ocean, to Mauritius, in a deal to secure the future of a strategically important U.K.-U.S. military base. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the agreement would secure the future of the base at Diego Garcia, the largest in the chain of remote islands off the tip of India that has been under British control for over 50 years. The base, which is home to about 2,500 personnel, mainly Americans, has been involved in military operations including the 2003 war in Iraq and the long-running war in Afghanistan. Britain's Labour government said without the deal, the secure operation of the military base would be under threat, with contested sovereignty and legal challenges, including through various international courts and tribunals. 'It will strengthen our role in safeguarding global security, shut down any possibility of the Indian Ocean being used as a dangerous illegal migration route to the U.K., as well as guaranteeing our long-term relationship with Mauritius, a close Commonwealth partner,' Lammy said. The agreement also paves the way for the potential return of the few people still alive who were forcibly displaced from their homes on the islands decades ago. As part of the deal, the U.K. will retain sovereignty of Diego Garcia for an initial period of 99 years and will pay Mauritius an undisclosed rent. It will also create a 'resettlement' fund for displaced Chagossians aimed at letting them move back to the islands other than Diego Garcia. The Chagos Islands, which conjure up images of paradise with their lush vegetation and long stretches of white sandy beaches, have been at the heart of what Britain has called the British Indian Ocean Territory since 1965, when they were siphoned away from Mauritius, a former U.K. colony that gained independence three years later. Mauritius, which lies east of Madagascar in southern Africa, is around 2,100 kilometers (1,250 miles) southwest of the Chagos Islands. Following a lease agreement with Britain, the U.S. built the naval base at Diego Garcia for defense purposes in the 1970s. The U.S. has described the base as 'an all but indispensable platform' for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia and East Africa. Around 1,500 inhabitants from the Chagos Islands were displaced to make way for the U.S. base, in what Human Rights Watch said last year amounted to 'crimes against humanity committed by a colonial power against an indigenous people.' Chagossian Voices, a U.K.-based group representing the Chagossian diaspora around the world, voiced disappointment that the negotiations excluded those displaced. 'Chagossians have learned this outcome from the media and remain powerless and voiceless in determining our own future and the future of our homeland,' it said in a statement on social media. 'The views of Chagossians, the indigenous inhabitants of the islands, have been consistently and deliberately ignored and we demand full inclusion in the drafting of the treaty.' The agreement will be included in a treaty and is dependent on legal processes being finalized. Both sides have committed to complete this as quickly as possible. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he spoke to his Mauritius counterpart, Pravind Jugnauth, on Thursday morning, welcoming the agreement after two years of negotiations that began under the previous Conservative government. 'Fifty-six years after our independence, the decolonization is finally complete,' Jugnauth said in a televised address to the nation later Thursday. The Mauritius government said that the treaty would aim to resolve all outstanding issues related to the islands, including 'its former inhabitants,' as well as addressing 'the wrongs of the past.' It laid out the hope that those displaced who are still alive and their descendants, who are mainly living in the U.K., Mauritius and the Seychelles, would have a right to return, as it is now 'free' to implement a resettlement program on the islands except Diego Garcia. It added that the U.K. will financially support the Chagossians, who have fought a long-running legal battle about their displacement, most recently in 2016 when they lost out in a Supreme Court ruling in the U.K. At the time, the previous Conservative government refused their right to return but voiced its 'deep regret' for the way the Chagossian community had been mistreated in the 1960s and 1970s. Over the years, the Chagossians and Mauritius have garnered increasing international support, notably among African nations and within the United Nations. In 2019, in an advisory option that was nonbinding, the International Court of Justice ruled that the U.K. had unlawfully carved up Mauritius when it agreed to end colonial rule in the late 1960s. In a statement, the White House said President Joe Biden applauded the 'historic agreement' on the status of the Chagos Islands. 'The agreement secures the effective operation of the joint facility on Diego Garcia into the next century,' the statement said. In the U.K., Conservative lawmakers standing to be leader of Britain's opposition party expressed dismay at the decision to hand over sovereignty of all but one of the islands. They were criticized for the comments, given that the previous Conservative government started the negotiations. One of the candidates, Tom Tugendhat, said he has consistently opposed any plan to hand over sovereignty of the islands and warned that the move could see Mauritius potentially leasing one of the islands to China. 'This is a shameful retreat undermining our security and leaving our allies exposed,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-gives-sovereignty-of-long-contested-chagos-islands-to-mauritius-/7809658.html	2024-10-03T15:12:20-07:00

Hurricane pushes climate change to forefront of presidential campaign	WASHINGTON — The devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene has brought climate change to the forefront of the presidential campaign after the issue lingered on the margins for months. Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Georgia Wednesday to see hard-hit areas, two days after her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, was in the state and criticized the federal response to the storm, which has killed at least 200 people in the Southeast. Helene is the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. President Joe Biden toured some of the hardest-hit areas by helicopter on Wednesday and Thursday. Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms and other natural disasters, traveled to the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation. 'Storms are getting stronger and stronger,' Biden said Wednesday after surveying damage near Asheville, North Carolina. At least 70 people died in the state. 'Nobody can deny the impact of the climate crisis anymore,'' Biden said at a briefing in Raleigh, North Carolina. 'They must be brain dead if they do.' Harris, meanwhile, hugged and huddled with a family Wednesday in hurricane-ravaged Augusta, Georgia. 'There is real pain and trauma that resulted because of this hurricane'' and its aftermath, Harris said outside a storm-damaged house with downed trees in the yard. 'We are here for the long-haul,'' she said. Storm damage forces discussion The focus on the storm — and its link to climate change — was notable after climate change was only lightly mentioned in two presidential debates this year. The candidates instead focused on abortion rights, the economy, immigration and other issues. The hurricane featured prominently in Tuesday's vice-presidential debate as Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz were asked about the storm and the larger issue of climate change. Both men called the hurricane a tragedy and agreed on the need for a strong federal response. But it was Walz, the governor of Minnesota, who put the storm in the context of a warming climate. 'There's no doubt this thing roared onto the scene faster and stronger than anything we've seen,' he said. Bob Henson, a meteorologist and writer with Yale Climate Connections, said it was no surprise that Helene is pushing both the federal disaster response and human-caused climate change into the campaign conversation. 'Weather disasters are often overlooked as a factor in big elections,'' he said. 'Helene is a sprawling catastrophe, affecting millions of Americans. And it dovetails with several well-established links between hurricanes and climate change, including rapid intensification and intensified downpours.' More than 40 trillion gallons of rain drenched the Southeast in the last week, an amount that if concentrated in North Carolina would cover the state in 3 1/2 feet of water. 'That's an astronomical amount of precipitation,' said Ed Clark, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Candidates make claims, counter claims During Tuesday's debate, Walz credited Vance for past statements acknowledging that climate change is a problem. But he noted that Trump has called climate change 'a hoax' and joked that rising seas 'would make more beachfront property to be able to invest in.' Trump said in a speech Tuesday that 'the planet has actually gotten little bit cooler recently,' adding: 'Climate change covers everything.' In fact, summer 2024 sweltered to Earth's hottest on record, making it likely this year will end up as the warmest humanity has measured, according to the European climate service Copernicus. Global records were shattered just last year as human-caused climate change, with a temporary boost from an El Niño, keeps dialing up temperatures and extreme weather, scientists said. Vance, an Ohio senator, said he and Trump support clean air, clean water and 'want the environment to be cleaner and safer.' However, during Trump's four years in office, he took a series of actions to roll back more than 100 environmental regulations. Vance sidestepped a question about whether he agrees with Trump's statement that climate change is a hoax. 'What the president has said is that if the Democrats — in particular Kamala Harris and her leadership — really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America. And that's not what they're doing,' he said. 'This idea that carbon [dioxide] emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So, we're not arguing about weird science. If you believe that, what would you want to do?' Vance asked. The answer, he said, is to 'produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.'' Vance claimed that policies by Biden and Harris actually help China, because many solar panels, lithium-ion batteries and other materials used in renewable energy and electric vehicles are made in China and imported to the United States. Walz rebutted that claim, noting that the Inflation Reduction Act, the Democrats' signature climate law approved in 2022, includes the largest-ever investment in domestic clean energy production. The law, for which Harris cast the deciding vote, has created 200,000 jobs across the country, including in Ohio and Minnesota, Walz said. Vance was not in the Senate when the law was approved. 'We are producing more natural gas and more oil [in the United States] than we ever have,' Walz said. 'We're also producing more clean energy.' The comment echoed a remark by Harris in last month's presidential debate. The Biden-Harris administration has overseen 'the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil,' Harris said then. While Biden rarely mentions it, domestic fossil fuel production under his administration is at an all-time high. Crude oil production averaged 12.9 million barrels a day last year, eclipsing a previous record set in 2019 under Trump, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Democrats want to continue investments in renewable energy such as wind and solar power — and not just because supporters of the Green New Deal want that, Walz said. 'My farmers know climate change is real. They've seen 500-year droughts, 500-year floods back-to-back. But what they're doing is adapting,'' he said. 'The solution for us is to continue to move forward, [accept] that climate change is real' and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, Walz said, adding that the administration is doing exactly that. 'We are seeing us becoming an energy superpower for the future, not just the current'' time, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-pushes-climate-change-to-forefront-of-presidential-campaign-/7809571.html	2024-10-03T14:12:41-07:00	
Florida communities hit by 3 hurricanes grapple with whether to rebuild	HORSESHOE BEACH, Florida — It was just a month ago that Brooke Hiers left the state-issued emergency trailer where her family had lived since Hurricane Idalia slammed into her Gulf Coast fishing village of Horseshoe Beach in August 2023. Hiers and her husband, Clint, were still finishing the electrical work in the home they painstakingly rebuilt themselves, wiping out Clint's savings to do so. They will never finish that wiring job. Hurricane Helene blew their newly renovated home off its 4-foot-high pilings, sending it floating into the neighbor's yard next door. 'You always think, 'Oh, there's no way it can happen again,'' Hiers said. 'I don't know if anybody's ever experienced this in the history of hurricanes.' For the third time in 13 months, this windswept stretch of Florida's Big Bend took a direct hit from a hurricane — a one-two-three punch to an 80-kilometer (50-mile) sliver of the state's more than 13,500 kilometers (8,400 miles) of coastline, first by Idalia, then Hurricane Debby in August 2024 and now Helene. Hiers, who sits on Horseshoe Beach's town council, said words like 'unbelievable' are beginning to lose their meaning. 'I've tried to use them all. Catastrophic. Devastating. Heartbreaking … none of that explains what happened here,' Hiers said. The back-to-back hits to Florida's Big Bend are forcing residents to reckon with the true costs of living in an area under siege by storms that researchers say are becoming stronger because of climate change. The Hiers, like many others here, can't afford homeowners insurance on their flood-prone houses, even if it were available. Residents who have watched their life savings get washed away multiple times are left with few choices — leave the communities where their families have lived for generations, pay tens of thousands of dollars to rebuild their houses on stilts as building codes require, or move into a recreational vehicle they can drive out of harm's way. That's if they can afford any of those things. The storm left many residents bunking with family or friends, sleeping in their cars or sheltering in what's left of their collapsing homes. Janalea England wasn't waiting for outside organizations to get aid to her friends and neighbors, turning her commercial fish market in the river town of Steinhatchee into a pop-up donation distribution center, just like she did after Hurricane Idalia. A row of folding tables was stacked with water, canned food, diapers, soap, clothes and shoes, a steady stream of residents coming and going. 'I've never seen so many people homeless as what I have right now. Not in my community,' England said. 'They have nowhere to go.' The sparsely populated Big Bend is known for its towering pine forests and pristine salt marshes that disappear into the horizon, a remote stretch of largely undeveloped coastline that's mostly dodged the crush of condos, golf courses and souvenir strip malls that has carved up so much of the Sunshine State. This is a place where teachers, mill workers and housekeepers could still afford to live within walking distance of the Gulf's white sand beaches. Or at least they used to, until a third successive hurricane blew their homes apart. Helene was so destructive, many residents don't have a home left to clean up, escaping the storm with little more than the clothes on their backs, even losing their shoes to the surging tides. With marinas washed away, restaurants collapsed, and vacation homes blown apart, many commercial fishermen, servers and house cleaners lost their homes and their jobs on the same day. Those who worked at the local sawmill and paper mill, two bedrock employers in the area, were laid off in the past year too. Now a convoy of semi-trucks full of hurricane relief supplies have set up camp at the shuttered mill in the city of Perry. Hud Lilliott was a mill worker for 28 years, before losing his job and now his canal-front home in Dekle Beach, just down the street from the house where he grew up. Lilliott and his wife, Laurie, hope to rebuild their house there, but they don't know how they'll pay for it. And they're worried the school in Steinhatchee where Laurie teaches first grade could become another casualty of the storm, as the county watches its tax base float away. 'We've worked our whole lives, and we're so close to where they say the 'golden years,'' Laurie said. 'It's like you can see the light and it all goes dark.' Dave Beamer rebuilt his home in Steinhatchee after it was 'totaled' by Hurricane Idalia, only to see it washed into the marsh a year later. 'I don't think I can do that again,' Beamer said. 'Everybody's changing their mind about how we're going to live here.' Beamer plans to stay in this river town but will put his home on wheels. He says he’ll buy a camper and build a pole barn to park it under. In Horseshoe Beach, Hiers is waiting for a makeshift town hall to be delivered in the coming days, a double-wide trailer where they'll offer what services they can for as long as they can.

Thousands rally in Austria against far right	vienna — Thousands of people protested in Austria's capital, Vienna, on Thursday against a possible return to power for the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe), which topped national elections on Sunday. The FPOe won almost 29% of the vote in Sunday's general election, ahead of the conservative People's Party (OeVP) with just over 26%. 'The Austrian Freedom Party is a danger because it has already said that it wants to govern in the image of Hungary's Viktor Orban,' said student Rihab Toumi, 26, referring to the nationalist leader of Austria's neighboring country. Although the FPOe topped the polls, there is no guarantee that its radical leader, Herbert Kickl, will be given a chance to form a government since no other party is willing to work with him. 'This result was a shock, and we cannot let a party that drifts so far to the right garner so much support without saying anything,' said social worker Marianne, 53, who declined to share her surname. Organizers said there were 15,000 to 17,000 protesters in central Vienna who marched toward parliament. Demonstrators held up placards that said, 'Let's defend democracy,' 'No alliances with Putin's friends,' and other anti-FPOe slogans. Kickl has criticized European Union sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his inner circle over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Demonstrators intend to march every Thursday, having similarly done so after the far-right formed part of short-lived coalition governments in 2000 and 2017.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-rally-in-austria-against-far-right-/7809618.html	2024-10-03T13:58:48-07:00	
Yazidi sex slave rescued from Gaza in rare, internationally collaborative mission	Washington — The State Department has confirmed to VOA the success of a complicated mission to rescue an Iraqi national and former Islamic State sex slave from Gaza via Israel. Because of a long-running diplomatic rift between Israel and Iraq, it took months of vigorous efforts by humanitarian activists and direct intervention from U.S. diplomatic missions in the region to coordinate the young woman’s rescue. Cooperation among Israeli, Jordanian, Iraqi and United Nations officials was involved. 'On October 1, 2024, the United States helped to safely evacuate from Gaza a young Yazidi woman to be reunited with her family in Iraq,' a State Department spokesperson told VOA on Wednesday, adding that the young woman’s story 'is heartbreaking, and we are glad that she will be reunited with her family in Iraq.' Enslaved by Islamic State Now 21, Fawzia Amin Saydo was kidnapped by Islamic State militants from her hometown of Sinjar in August 2014, just a month before her 11th birthday. She and two of her brothers, aged 7 and 10 at the time, were among thousands of Yazidis enslaved by IS due to their religious beliefs. Although the brothers found a way to escape, Saydo spent years suffering violence, injustice and rape by IS fighters. By early 2015, she was taken to the Syrian city of Raqqa where she was imprisoned and raped before being forcibly 'married' to a then 24-year-old Palestinian IS fighter. 'He told me that I had to sleep with him. On the third day, he went to a pharmacy and brought a drug that numbs part of the body. He gave me the drug and I cried,' Saydo recounted in an August 2023 interview from Gaza with the Kurdish media outlet Rudaw. About a year after her arrival in Raqqa, Saydo’s life took another turn when she gave birth to a boy, the first of two children she would have with the Palestinian IS fighter. Saydo decided to dedicate her life to her children, despite the husband turning more abusive, especially after he married another woman. By the end of 2018, when the U.S.-led Kurdish forces squeezed IS out of the group’s territories in Syria, Saydo, then 15 years old, lost contact with her Palestinian captor, who had escaped from northeast Syria to the rebel-held Idlib province in northwest Syria. In early 2019 she was driven to Idlib to be returned to her captor, but their reunion was brief, as the Palestinian militant was soon reported dead. No cause of death was reported. Fearing that her community back in Sinjar, Iraq, might not accept her children — Yazidi spiritual leaders that same year had issued a decree stating that children of rape by IS militants would not be welcomed into the faith — Saydo decided to move in with the Palestinian man’s family in Gaza, where she arrived in 2020. Stuck in Gaza Humanitarian activists who followed Saydo’s case told VOA that her circumstances in Gaza presented a gut-wrenching choice: stay with her children and endure the Palestinian family that became abusive just as their late son had been, or escape — alone and without her children — in the hopes of reuniting with long-lost family in Sinjar. Her resolve to leave was strengthened by Hamas’ deadly October 7 attack on Israel. 'This has been by far the most complicated case I have worked on,' said Steve Maman of the Montreal-based Liberation of Christian and Yazidi Children of Iraq. It took Maman and a small team of Iraqi activists several months of lobbying Iraqi, U.S., and Israeli officials. While waiting for a final decision from Israel, Maman and his supporters helped her escape the Palestinian family’s home and hide in a house about 2 kilometers away from the Israeli army at Kerm Shalom crossing. The rescue process, which VOA has followed since early September, was slow and rescheduled several times due to the difficulty of navigating the Israel-Iraq diplomatic rift. 'I have no idea why every party was so hesitant to act on such a humanitarian case. Now I can finally get my much-needed sleep,' one of Maman’s supporters who asked that his name be withheld, told VOA. Another activist from Sinjar, Sufyan Waheed Hammo, told VOA, 'The Iraqi officials were very helpful when it came to preparing paperwork, but they couldn’t do much diplomatically because of the Iraqi law.' Iraq's parliament in May 2022 passed legislation that criminalized any ties with Israel. According to Maman, what finally triggered U.S. officials in the region to make a final push to rescue her was 'a deeply troubling incident' that occurred just a day before her rescue. 'She was walking alone when a group of men abused her.' Complicated handoff In the early morning of October 1, a 'personnel team' whose individual identities are known only to U.S., U.N. and likely Israeli officials, drove Saydo to Israel via Kerm Shalom crossing in a U.N. ambulance. According to Maman’s supporters, Saydo arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem that day before moving on to Jordan via the Allenby Bridge crossing. Salwan Sinjaree, chief of staff to Iraq’s foreign minister, told VOA that his government had no contact with the Israeli government during the rescue process. 'Our embassy in Amman received her, prepared travel documents for her, and hired a plane to fly her back to Baghdad with one of our female embassy staff,' Sinjaree told VOA. 'All our contacts during the process have been with the U.S. embassy, the Jordanian foreign ministry, and the U.N. We have not made any communication with Israel.' The official from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office who was tasked to handle the case turned down VOA’s request for comment. Saydo arrived in Baghdad via a plane around 10:30 a.m. local time Wednesday. She was then escorted by a team of Iraqi intelligence officers to Mosul, where she was reunited with family. Saydo’s brother Barzan told VOA from Germany that the rest of his family, including their mother, sister, and two brothers, are thrilled to see her after a decade apart. Her father, however, would not be there to witness his daughter’s return, Barzan added, because he died of a heart attack just two months prior, 'caused by the pain of the separation from her.' 'We welcome her back and support her decision to return home. She didn’t have any choice in what happened,' he told VOA. 'My heartfelt thanks every single person who helped to rescue her.' Ongoing trauma Beyond Saydo’s trauma of the past decade, however, is a new kind of pain in the wake of reunion: the reality of now living apart from her young son and daughter, who remain with their father’s family in Gaza. Despite the impossible choice with which Saydo was confronted in Gaza, some still insist on judging her decision to flee her captor’s family. 'No mother would leave her children. They came from her belly,' an activist associated with Maman who wanted to be cited only by his first initial, D, told VOA. According to Mirza Dinnayi, a Yazidi activist based in Germany, at least 2,745 Yazidis remain missing since the 2014 IS massacre of some 5,000 members of their religious community. That event, which the U.N. has said constitutes an act of genocide, also resulted in the abductions of young Yazidi women like Saydo and the displacement of an estimated 100,000 members of the faith who were forced to take refuge outside of Iraq. 'We do not know if those missing people are still alive or not. If they are alive, they are probably held in different places of Syria such as in al-Hol camp or in areas controlled by terrorists in northwest Syria,' Dinnayi told VOA. 'There are rare cases of Yazidis found in Turkey and some unverified reports about some people taken to Egypt.' For Maman and his fellow activists, saving Saydo from conflict-ridden Gaza is a way to help the community recover. It is also a message of hope at a time when tensions between Israel and Iran enter a new phase. 'I am a practicing Jew, and I was willing to put aside my life to help a Yazidi girl get out,' he told VOA. 'I had to fight my contacts in this case because it was not that easy, but the result is at the end a life is saved.' The State Department spokesperson told VOA that they are asking people to respect Saydo’s privacy 'for her own safety while she reunites with loved ones and returns home.' Dakhil Shammo of VOA’s Kurdish Service contributed reporting from Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/yazidi-sex-slave-rescued-from-gaza-in-rare-internationally-collaborative-mission/7809579.html	2024-10-03T13:40:27-07:00	
California investigating possible case of bird flu in dairy worker	chicago — California is investigating a possible case of bird flu in a dairy worker who had contact with infected cattle, the state's public health department said Thursday. The virus' jump to cattle in 14 states and infections of 13 dairy and poultry farmworkers this year have concerned scientists and federal officials about the risks to humans from further spread. The worker had a 'presumptive positive' result to a test for bird flu, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will do further testing to confirm the finding, the California Department of Public Health said in a statement. The person, who was not identified, suffered only conjunctivitis, or pink eye, the department said in a statement. The person is being treated with antiviral medication and staying home, it added. The person works at a Central Valley dairy facility suffering an outbreak in cattle, according to the statement. Cows at dairy farms in California, the top U.S. milk-producing state, began testing positive for bird flu in late August. 'The risk to the general public remains low, although people who interact with infected animals are at higher risk of getting bird flu,' the department said. Missouri last month confirmed bird flu in a person with underlying medical conditions who had no immediate known animal exposure. Six health care workers who cared for the Missouri patient developed respiratory symptoms, but the virus was not confirmed in any of them. Scientists are watching closely for signs that the virus has begun to spread more easily in people. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday said it would begin testing raw cow's milk intended for pasteurization at dairy plants to better understand the prevalence of the bird flu virus in milk. Participation in the study, set to begin October 28, is voluntary, and pasteurized dairy products remain safe to consume, the agency said. Prior FDA testing of retail dairy samples came back negative, and more such testing is underway.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-investigating-possible-case-of-bird-flu-in-dairy-worker-/7809564.html	2024-10-03T13:14:25-07:00	
In the fast lane: Chinese car imports grow in South Africa	Johannesburg — In South Africa’s capital of Johannesburg, some of the most ubiquitous vehicles on the streets are the thousands of minibus taxis crammed tight with daily commuters traveling from the dusty townships into work. At the other end of the spectrum are souped-up sports cars and flashy convertibles zooming around the leafy suburbs that are home to the elite. Increasingly, however, there’s another kind of vehicle cruising Johannesburg’s streets: new gas-powered SUVs with names like Chery, BAIC and Haval — all Chinese cars that industry experts say are giving more established brands a run for their money and gaining popularity with South Africans. Potential car buyer Ross Grey was considering a large pick-up truck made by Chinese manufacturer JAC Motors. 'I’m a sales manager at a kitchen company, hence why I’m looking at buying a double cab, because I’ve got a young family and I need to also carry a lot of goods on the back of the vehicle, I’m often on building sites and that sort of thing,' he told VOA recently. His interest in a Chinese-made vehicle stemmed in part from a bad experience. 'The Chinese vehicles are not on the stolen list like the big brands are,' said Grey, who was a loyal Toyota Hilux owner until car thieves stole his car. The Hilux is one of the most stolen cars in South Africa – often for its engine, which fits perfectly into commuter minibus taxis. Along with consumers, car thieves are taking notice of Chinese makes and models, data shows. South Africans used to be skeptical about cars with the 'made in China' label. While Grey acknowledged Chinese brands have not yet stood the test of time, he said his research shows the quality seems to have improved in recent years. In the fast lane The biggest draw for many Chinese car buyers, including Grey, is the cost. 'The reason I’m looking at something like this, the Chinese vehicles, is because first of all the price, it’s a lot cheaper than your big brands that have been in the country for many, many years,' he said. Chinese-imported vehicles cost a lot less than most SUVs from Germany’s Volkswagen, America’s Ford or Japan’s Toyota, said Mikel Mabasa, CEO of South Africa’s car industry organization Naamsa. 'These Chinese brands have actually been growing at double digits, particularly in the last three years,' he told VOA. 'So if you look at growth between 2019 and 2023, we’ve seen actually a more than 200% increase in terms of Chinese brands that are coming into the South African market, and that is obviously very, very unusual.' Mabasa added: 'But I think there are reasons … many of those brands, if you look at the price points, are much cheaper than competing brands.' The number of imported Chinese vehicles in South Africa has steadily increased, with more than 39,000 automobiles brought into the country last year, compared with some 11,000 in 2019, according to Naamsa figures. German imports showed the opposite trend, with just over 21,000 coming into the country in 2023, down from almost 37,000 in 2019. Vehicles imported from Japan show similar figures. The U.S. exported almost 4,200 vehicles in 2019 but close to 300 fewer automobiles last year, statistics show. In terms of sales, certain models of established brands such as Ford and Toyota are still leading the pack, but Chinese upstarts are not far behind. Between July 2023 and July 2024, Chinese brand Chery sold more than 11,000 of their Tiggo 4 Pro models in South Africa. That’s compared with 25,000 Ford Rangers and 34,000 Toyota Hilux pickup trucks during the same period. Going electric South Africa is itself a major producer of cars, with manufacturing plants in the country for brands including Ford, Toyota, BMW, Mercedes, Nissan, Volkswagen and Suzuki. 'Thirty-nine percent of the components that they use in the manufacturing process are sourced locally in South Africa,' Mabasa told VOA. He said that while some of the cars made in South Africa go to the local market, more than 60% are exported overseas to nearly 150 countries. The first local Chinese car manufacturing plant for BAIC was opened by Chinese President Xi Jinping and South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa in Eastern Cape province to great fanfare in 2018. The Chinese consulate in Cape Town described the project 'as a milestone for the two countries' economies.' But the project hit some bumps in the road. 'They’re still in the setting up phase, they’ve obviously experienced some hiccups in getting that particular plant off the ground,' said Mabasa. BAIC executives have told local South African media the pandemic and labor disputes were to blame for the delay. But Mabasa is still hopeful. 'We obviously wish them well, and I think it’s a model that a number of other plants or companies from China would definitely adopt as a template should they wish to come into South Africa and start manufacturing vehicles,' he said. That’s something Ramaphosa is also encouraging. On a state visit to China last month, he visited the headquarters of massive Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD. 'We have introduced policies to promote the development of the electric vehicle industry in South Africa,' the South African president said on the trip. 'We are certain that companies such as BYD … will find South Africa a unique and advantageous location that can serve as a hub to reach other markets.' The electric vehicle revolution is in the very nascent stages in South Africa, where gas is still king. However, BYD is looking to Africa as it faces increasing trade restrictions in the U.S. and Europe. BYD already has a showroom in South Africa and recently opened others in Rwanda, Zambia and Kenya.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-the-fast-lane-chinese-car-imports-grow-in-south-africa/7809451.html	2024-10-03T11:54:21-07:00

Boston university relaunches journalism curriculum to encompass humanities	Washington — As the fall semester begins, a women’s college in Boston, Massachusetts, has retooled its media-related curriculum to best reflect the ideals of the school’s namesake, the late journalist Gwen Ifill. Simmons University announced it would relaunch the media school as the Gwen Ifill School of Media, Humanities and Social Sciences. A search committee also named media scholar Ammina Kothari as the new dean. The Ifill School’s new structure expands its media curriculum to include humanities and social sciences. The attributes that defined Ifill also shape a new, holistic approach, 'An unwavering commitment to accuracy and objectivity, a nuanced understanding of social and historical context and a compassion-based appreciation of policymaking’s real-world implications,' according to a Simmons press release. 'Folks here are very proud of Gwen’s legacy and want to honor it in many different ways,' said Bert Ifill, Gwen’s brother and a longtime university administrator. A crucial component of the Ifill School is its emphasis on communications, a field Gwen excelled in, Bert told VOA. After graduating from Simmons in 1977, she had long careers in both print and television journalism, working for The Baltimore Evening Sun, The Washington Post, The New York Times, NBC and PBS. She covered seven presidential campaigns and died in 2016 at age 61. Ifill was the first African American woman to moderate a vice presidential debate and to coanchor a national newscast, 'PBS NewsHour.' 'Gwen valued storytelling, and she was an amazing journalist,' Kothari, the school’s new dean, told VOA. 'But she also worked really hard to raise awareness about important social issues and to highlight underrepresented voices.' Abigail Meyers, a current junior at the Ifill School, admires the journalist’s 'groundbreaking work' in both journalism and racial justice, she told VOA. Raised near Baltimore, Maryland, Meyers feels a special connection to Ifill’s work for the Baltimore Evening Sun newspaper. The school has been instrumental in supporting Meyers’ aspirations to become a professional journalist, she told VOA. 'The support that you get from the faculty and alumni is unlike really any other journalism program,' she said. Being a double major in communications and political science, Meyers appreciates the new curriculum’s flexibility, as she is able to take classes across different disciplines. This flexibility will help prime Simmons’ students to achieve success, Kothari said. She believes interdisciplinary training leads to stronger leaders in the world. 'As we think about communications or media, including journalism or social sciences, we need a strong foundation in humanities to understand the historical context for what we see happening today,' Kothari said. The school’s increased focus on humanities 'couldn’t be more timely,' according to the press release. Nearly three of four Americans believe media literacy is an important skill in today’s news landscape, a 2023 Boston University survey found. However, humanities-focused degree programs like the Ifill School’s receive little recognition. Of all the bachelor’s degrees awarded in 2020, humanities degrees made up less than 10%, a number that has only been decreasing, according to a 2022 MIT study. Meanwhile, science, technology, engineering and math degrees, or STEM, have grown exponentially. But humanities and STEM shouldn’t be seen as opposites, Kothari said. She cited the COVID-19 pandemic response as an example. Many precautionary measures such as social distancing were grounded in 'amazing scientific research,' but weren’t effectively communicated to the public, she said. 'As we have new knowledge being produced, we also need journalists,' Kothari said. 'We need communicators who are able to translate very complex information to the audience so they can see, ‘How does it matter to me? What is the effect for me?’' Ifill’s legacy is not only celebrated within her namesake school, but also through press freedom organizations around the world. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a press freedom nonprofit, honors Ifill with the annual Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award, which is presented to individuals who have 'shown extraordinary and sustained achievement in the cause of press freedom,' according to CPJ’s website. Christophe Deloire, the late director of international media freedom organization Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, received the 2024 Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award. 'Christophe was one of journalism's greatest-ever champions,' RSF Executive Director Clayton Weimers told VOA in an email. 'There was hardly a fight or an advance in press freedom in the past decade that he wasn't a part of, if not leading.' As Ifill’s legacy spreads, there is one person who couldn’t be prouder: her brother, Bert. He told VOA it often seems as though his full-time job is 'to talk nicely about Gwen.' 'It's always a great pleasure and honor for me to talk about her and to talk about her legacy, not only as obviously a very skilled journalist, but as an extraordinary mentor and confidant,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boston-university-relaunches-journalism-curriculum-to-encompass-humanities/7808224.html	2024-10-03T11:22:10-07:00

Ethiopian military boosts operations in Amhara region	ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Ethiopia’s army said it has launched a major operation against Fano rebel groups in the Amhara region, as the conflict continues, despite calls by rights groups and international partners for a peaceful resolution. Army spokesperson Colonel Getnet Adane said Tuesday that the Ethiopian National Defense Force, or the ENDF, in coordination with the region’s security forces, have started a military operation. He claimed continued calls for peace have 'fallen on deaf ears.' 'The only language they [armed rebel groups] understand is force. From now on we will talk to them in that language,' said Getnet. 'For peace to prevail they need to be met with force. They have to be targeted, hit.' He indicated the operation started this past weekend. Federal and regional officials said measures are also being taken against suspected supporters of the rebel group, including members of the business community. The announcement of the operation came on the day human rights group Amnesty International accused Ethiopia’s army of conducting 'mass arbitrary detentions' in the Amhara region. Amnesty’s regional director for East and Southern Africa, Tigere Chagutah, alleged that hundreds have been detained, including members of the academic community, in major towns across the Amhara region since Sept. 28. 'The Ethiopian army and police’s ongoing campaign of arbitrary mass detentions in Amhara region is yet more evidence of the government’s total disregard for the rule of law,' the director said in a statement. 'Eyewitnesses have stated that authorities came with a ‘list’ and failed to obtain arrest and search warrants before detaining hundreds of civilians across the region. Those detained have largely not been brought before a court of law within 48 hours, as required by the country’s national laws and constitution.' Amnesty urged authorities to 'immediately end these arbitrary arrests, press charges against those detained for internationally recognized crimes and follow due process, or release them without further delay.' It is time for authorities to stop using arbitrary detention as a tool of repression, the statement said. Fighting in the Amhara region began more than a year ago with a dispute over the disarming of regional paramilitary forces. Fresh fighting was reported as recently as last week. VOA’s Horn of Africa service attempted to reach an Amhara region spokesperson, the federal government of Ethiopian communication affairs minister and ENDF spokesperson and Fano rebels. None of them could be reached for comment on Amnesty International’s statement. Abductions Meanwhile, police in Ethiopia have reported that abductions are on the rise in two conflict regions where armed groups are fighting government forces. A spokesperson for the Amhara regional police, Mesafint Eshete, said the commission recorded 287 abduction cases in the Ethiopian fiscal year 2016, which ended three weeks ago. The Ethiopian calendar runs several years behind the calendar in most other countries. Speaking to the Horn of Africa service, Mesafint hinted the figure could be higher as most victims don’t report incidents to the police. In a report issued last week, the state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, or EHRC, linked the kidnapping cases to the political and security crisis in the country. The report said that kidnappings have become a recurrent fixture, especially in the Oromia and Amhara areas. The EHRC also said that kidnapping cases in those areas involve diverse actors with different goals and modus operandi. While financial gain drives most of them, others seek to further a political agenda, the report added. According to the EHRC report, armed groups operating in the regions, criminal gangs and some members of the security forces are implicated in the kidnapping cases. The World Food Program said last week that the conflict in the Amhara region has become the biggest challenge for humanitarian operations. 'Growing insecurity, particularly in the Amhara region, is hindering our deliveries. Our operations face severe security risks,' the WFP Ethiopia representative and country director, Zlatan Milisic, told reporters in Addis Ababa. He said that this year, eight humanitarian workers have lost their lives and more than 20 people have been abducted. Six of the killings took place in the Amhara region, while one happened in Tigray and the other occurred in the Gambela area. Despite the security challenges, Milisic said WFP didn’t stop operating in the region, and has reached 90% of its intended aid beneficiaries in Ethiopia this year. 'We want to be there, and we plan to continue supporting the needy,' Milisic said. Speaking on funding gaps, Milisic indicated that over the past three months, 4.6 million people needed aid, but only 1.3 million received humanitarian support. He appealed for $341 million for WFP humanitarian operations through February 2025. This story originated in VOA’s Horn of Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopian-military-boosts-operations-in-amhara-region/7809375.html	2024-10-03T11:03:21-07:00	
Beijing tests regional resolve in South China Sea amid Middle East conflict	Taipei, Taiwan — As the United States and other like-minded countries hold joint military exercises in the South China Sea, Chinese vessels have been aggressively asserting Beijing’s territorial claims in the hotly contested waterway, testing the resolve of the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. Last week on September 26, China used two missile boats and a high-intensity laser to disrupt an attempt by the Philippines to deliver supplies to local fishermen posted near the Half Moon Shoal, an atoll that lies within Manila’s Exclusive Economic Zone, or EEZ. On Sunday, Chinese law enforcement reportedly attacked Vietnamese fishermen with iron pipes, confiscating fishing equipment near the Paracel Islands. And a new report by the Washington-based Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative released Tuesday highlighted how the Chinese coast guard vessels have been operating 'like clockwork' this year in waters claimed by Malaysia as the resource-rich country tries to expand oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea. On Thursday, The Washington Post also reported that Chinese vessels have been disrupting the repair and construction of subsea cables running under the South China Sea. China emboldened Analysts say these actions suggest Beijing is attempting to test regional countries’ resolves to safeguard their territorial claims at a time when the United States is fixated on the conflict in the Middle East. 'The serious crisis in the Middle East has emboldened China and allowed them to test the Americans further in the Indo-Pacific region,' said Collin Koh, a maritime security expert at the Singapore-based S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. He added that Beijing is using physical actions and lawfare to try to change the situation in the South China Sea 'altogether.' The Philippines has characterized Beijing’s harassment of its vessels as 'irresponsible, dangerous, and provocative,' while Hanoi said the attack on the Vietnamese fishermen violated its sovereignty and international law. China’s Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request from VOA regarding the harassment of Philippine vessels. Commenting on the attack on the fishermen, Beijing claims Chinese law enforcement forces were stopping Vietnamese fishermen from illegally fishing near the Paracel Islands, which China calls Xisha. The islands are an equal distance from China and Vietnam, but Beijing has maintained de facto control of the islands since it seized them in 1974 after a clash with Vietnamese forces. In recent years, Beijing has reclaimed land and established military installations in the Paracel Islands, including an airstrip and artificial harbor. New front Koh told VOA that the incident near Half Moon Shoal, which comes after Chinese and Philippine coast guard vessels collided twice near the disputed Sabina Shoal since August, shows Beijing may be 'opening a new front' against Manila. 'The Philippines wants to apply the provisional agreement that they have reached with China over Second Thomas Shoal in July to the other contested reefs in the South China Sea, but I don’t think the Chinese are keen to expand the agreement throughout the region,' he said in a phone interview. While the United States and other countries, including Australia, Japan and New Zealand, have been conducting more joint patrols in the South China Sea to counter China’s aggression, experts say that appears to have done little to thwart Beijing's ability to challenge its neighbors in the region. 'There needs to be more concrete minilateral cooperation between regional countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, including joint military exercises, expansion of maritime domain awareness activities or search and rescue drills,' Stephen Nagy, a regional security expert at the International Christian University in Japan, told VOA by phone. In January, Vietnam and the Philippines signed an agreement aimed at boosting cooperation between their coast guard forces to prevent incidents in the South China Sea. Then in August, Manila and Hanoi held their first joint coast guard drill, focusing on firefighting, rescue and medical response in Manila Bay. In addition to bilateral cooperation between the Philippines and Vietnam, some regional observers say all Southeast Asian countries that have competing territorial claims with China in the South China Sea should explore the possibility of establishing a regional alliance. Such a mechanism 'could potentially evolve into a coast guard alliance specifically designed to address China’s actions in the region, and such a coalition would present a more formidable deterrent and could more effectively safeguard the interests of these nations in the South China Sea,' Duan Dang, a Vietnam-based maritime security analyst, told VOA in a written response. However, he said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 'appears too weak and divided' on issues related to the South China Sea to present a united front. As the U.S. and Japan both gear up for major elections in the coming weeks, Nagy thinks China is also trying to use this 'window of opportunity' to try to 'lock in some strategic gains' in the South China Sea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/beijing-tests-regional-resolve-in-south-china-sea-amid-middle-east-conflict/7809345.html	2024-10-03T10:55:24-07:00

WHO launches plan to tackle growing threat of dengue, other diseases	GENEVA — The World Health Organization launched a global plan Thursday to address the growing threat of dengue and other deadly arboviruses, which have affected millions of people around the world and put billions more at risk. 'The rapid spread of dengue and other arboviral diseases in recent years is an alarming trend that demands a coordinated response across sectors and across borders,' said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. An arbovirus is a virus that is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, ticks, or other arthropods, such as crustaceans, insects and arachnids. Dengue has emerged as the most problematic arbovirus disease. The WHO notes the number of cases has nearly doubled each year since 2021, with over 12.3 million cases at the end of August of this year, including more than 6,000 deaths. The WHO aims to 'turn the tide' against dengue and arboviral diseases, Tedros said, noting that the measures in the proposal could 'protect vulnerable populations and pave the way for a healthier future.' The WHO chief said everyone has a role to play in the fight against dengue, 'from maintaining clean environments to supporting vector control and seeking and providing timely medical care.' 'Factors such as unplanned urbanization and poor water, sanitation and hygiene practices, climate change and international travel, are facilitating the rapid geographical spread of dengue,' Dr. Raman Velayudhan, WHO unit head, global program on control of neglected tropical diseases, told journalists in Geneva Tuesday, in advance of the plan’s launch. 'The disease is now endemic in more than 130 countries,' he said. 'Similar trends are also observed for other arboviral diseases, such as Zika, chikungunya, and more recently, the Oropouche virus disease, especially in the Americas.' Dengue is endemic in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific and the Americas. The WHO says the majority of dengue cases, as well as several other arboviruses, have been reported from the American region this year. WHO officials say the situation is also of concern in Africa, 'where countries are battling multiple diseases amid conflict and natural disasters,' placing additional strain on already fragile health systems. The Africa CDC reports more than 15,000 cases of dengue have been recorded in 13 African countries this year. 'This global escalation underscores the urgent need for a robust strategy to mitigate risks and safeguard populations taking into account that urban centers are at greater risk,' Velayudhan said. Dengue is a viral infection that spreads from mosquitoes to people. Most people who get dengue get better in one to two weeks. However, some people who develop severe cases can die. According to the WHO, prevention is the best protection from dengue. It recommends people avoid mosquito bites, especially during the day, 'by covering up.' Chikungunya, a virus spread by Aedes mosquitoes, has been reported in 118 countries, with the highest circulation found in Brazil. Dr. Diana Rojas Alvarez, team lead on arboviruses, epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention at the WHO, notes newborns, elderly and people with pre-existing conditions 'have been identified as a risk factor for poor disease outcome.' Besides chikungunya, she said Zika and Oropouche, which are spreading widely in the Americas, have symptoms similar to dengue and 'can be easily misdiagnosed in areas with co-circulation of multiple arboviruses.' To avoid misidentifying those diseases, she said it is critical for countries to strengthen their detection, surveillance, and testing activities and 'to make sure populations know which measures to take to protect themselves and their communities.' The World Health Organization says the global escalation of arboviral diseases underscores the urgent need for 'a robust strategy to mitigate risks and safeguard populations.' It urges governments to implement five components of its strategic global plan: Emergency coordination activities, collaborative detection and surveillance, community protection and prevention measures, safe and scalable care to prevent illness and death, and access to countermeasures, such as the promotion of research for improved treatments and vaccines. The WHO estimates $55 million will be required to put the plan into action over the next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-launches-plan-to-tackle-growing-threat-of-dengue-other-diseases/7809252.html	2024-10-03T09:42:01-07:00	
Trump, Harris stances on China differ, but not completely	The United States’ policy on China has been mostly consistent from the administration of Donald Trump to the White House of Joe Biden — with both presidents viewing China as America’s biggest competitor. But in the race for the next president, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have slightly different approaches toward the global superpower. VOA’s Elizabeth Lee explains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-harris-stances-on-china-differ-but-not-completely/7809235.html	2024-10-03T09:29:46-07:00	
Taliban FM to be ‘chief guest’ in Russia-hosted Afghanistan talks	Islamabad, Pakistan — Russia is set to convene a meeting of regional countries on Friday to discuss, among other issues, the expansion of 'practical interaction' with Taliban-governed Afghanistan in political, economic, counterterrorism and counternarcotics areas. Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi will participate as the 'chief guest' in what will be the sixth round of the 'Moscow Format' of consultations on Afghanistan, reported Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, on the eve of the gathering. Russia launched the Moscow Format in 2017, and it has since become a regular platform for discussion of challenges facing impoverished, war-torn Afghanistan. Zakharova told reporters in the Russian capital on Wednesday that special representatives and senior officials from China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan will attend the gathering. She said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will preside over the closed-door meeting, and that 'the main focus of the discussions' would be advancing the Afghan national reconciliation process. Zakharova also said, without elaborating, that Lavrov plans to hold bilateral talks separately with Muttaqi and his team on key areas of collaboration between Moscow and Kabul. Muttaqi’s office in Kabul reported separately that he is scheduled to meet Lavrov on the sidelines of the Moscow Format gathering. Moscow has established close informal ties with the Taliban since the former insurgents regained control of Afghanistan three years ago, following the withdrawal of U.S.-led coalition troops after almost two decades of war. Russia, however, has not recognized the Taliban as a legitimate government, in line with international consensus on the issue. But the Russian foreign and justice ministries submitted a proposal to President Vladimir Putin in June to remove the Taliban from Russia’s list of designated terrorist organizations. Taliban officials confirmed last week that they had formally sought to join the coming Russia-led summit of the BRICS intergovernmental group of major emerging economies. There has been no public response from Moscow. The Taliban said that Afghanistan is a developing country and needs to attend forums like BRICS to help improve the national economy. The leaders of the 10-nation BRICS, whose original members were Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, are set to convene October 22-24 in the southwestern Russian city of Kazan. The U.S. remains opposed to any step toward easing sanctions or moving toward recognition of the Taliban as Afghanistan’s rightful government. 'We have been very clear that we judge the Taliban by what they do, not by what they say,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said last week while responding to the de facto Afghan government’s bid to attend BRICS. She reiterated that the Taliban would need to improve its human rights record to win international legitimacy and be removed from sanctions lists so they can rejuvenate the Afghan economy. 'Afghanistan cannot strengthen its economy unless women are able to participate in all aspects of society without limitations,' stated Jean-Pierre. 'So, we will continue to engage with the Taliban on matters of our interest — for example, on respect for the rights of women and girls and the return of wrongfully detained U.S. citizens — and that's how we're going to move forward with them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-fm-to-be-chief-guest-in-russia-hosted-afghanistan-talks/7809205.html	2024-10-03T09:00:15-07:00	
Pressure to hold elections motivating, Bangladesh student leader tells VOA	Dhaka — Along Dhaka’s chaotic roads, where cycle rickshaws and dilapidated double-deckers compete for space with honking cars and scurrying pedestrians, brightly painted graffiti tells the story of the protests that in just over five weeks ended the 15-year rule of Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The uprising, popularly known in Bangladesh as the 'July 36 Revolution,' began as a student-led protest against a job quota system on July 1. It ended on August 5 with Hasina fleeing to India on a helicopter, as millions of people angered by the regime's deadly crackdown on students descended on the capital calling for the prime minister's ouster. Nahid Islam, a 26-year-old student leader who announced the mass movement's demand for Hasina's resignation on August 3, is one of two student leaders who are part of a 19-member 'advisory council' – in effect, an interim government – headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. 'My lifestyle has changed drastically,' 26-year-old Islam told VOA in his office Sunday about the dramatic shift from student politics to running two ministries. The young activist is heading the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology as well as the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. 'In the case of government, it’s an official set up, and again we are re-learning how to work for the people,' said the casually dressed Islam. 'So, we have organizational capacity and that is being put to work right now but the government has different rules, there is a bureaucratic setup. We have started working in the system and are trying to adjust.' He was also trying to change the system, Islam said. His 100-day plan includes breaking down silos to increase communication with lower-level officials, investigating corruption in government projects, expanding internet access, and getting rid of draconian cybersecurity and media laws. 'If we cannot realize those wishes, we will not be fulfilling people’s demands,' Islam said, adding that without necessary reforms, the next elected government will not be able to function well. However, the advisory council is under pressure from political parties to return the nation of 170 million people to democracy. After years of facing crackdowns, major parties like Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamat-e-Islami have resumed political activities. Party leaders have expressed support for the advisory council but are also pushing for elections. 'This pressure should be on us,' said Islam. 'If we face the pressure, we will also actively work to pave the way for elections,' Islam told VOA. Islam said the entire reform program of the interim government which includes electoral, judicial, and police reforms could take more than a year to implement. He said the bureaucracy needs to be cleansed of norms installed by Hasina's Awami League party that allowed corruption and politicization of government institutions. Bangladesh's military chief Wakar-Uz-Zaman told Reuters last month the country could head to polls within 18 months. Speaking to VOA Bangla earlier this week, Yunus refused to say when his interim government of academics, technocrats, student leaders, and rights defenders will hand over charge to a democratically elected government. Despite enjoying mass support, Islam said student leaders of the mass movement are currently not focusing on turning the alliance into a political party for the next elections. 'The people have a desire to see the students in political leadership but actually we are not paying attention to this issue right now,' the young leader said. 'After the goals of the uprising are achieved or the nation has been reconstructed, the students will decide how they want to proceed.' Several hundred people died between July and early August as the outgoing regime used deadly force against protesters across Bangladesh. Dozens of policemen were killed in revenge attacks. Anger at Hasina's Awami League is still high as hospitals across the country continue to treat injured protesters, most suffering from bullet and pellet gun wounds. While anti-Awami League students now have access to power, many student leaders of Awami League's student wing, known as the Bangladesh Chhatra League, now face the risk of attacks. Last month a mob beat a former organizing secretary of the Chhatra League for allegedly supporting violence against the protesters in July. The student leader died hours later. Another student leader told VOA he is afraid to go to his hostel on the Dhaka University campus. Islam said the Awami League may still have a role in Bangladesh's democracy but not without accountability. 'We have not banned Awami League so far. But since the party and its beneficiary class are involved in mass killings, they should face the law. Those who are found to be guilty will face punishment according to the law and those who are found to be innocent, they will continue to enjoy their democratic rights.' In a show of anger, student groups marked Hasina's birthday on September 28 by throwing shoes at her images. In Dhaka, a giant mural of the former leader next to an equally huge painting of her father, Shaikh Mujib, the founder of Bangladesh, has a garland of shoes hanging over it. Hasina is facing more than 200 cases. The list of cases against her party leaders, many of whom have fled, continues to grow. Islam, who was abducted and tortured in July – allegedly by intelligence agencies notorious for extrajudicial actions, believes justice will heal the nation. 'Everything will be decided by the courts,' said Islam, 'Through such a process society will achieve reconciliation.' Across Bangladesh's capital, messages of defiance, hope, and people power painted on walls celebrate hard-won political freedom. They are also a reminder of the burden of expectations that Islam and his fellow interim leaders carry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pressure-to-hold-elections-motivating-bangladesh-student-leader-tells-voa/7809199.html	2024-10-03T08:52:46-07:00

Denmark jails 2 Swedish teens over blasts near Israeli Embassy	COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Two Swedish teenagers were jailed Thursday in pretrial detention in connection with two predawn explosions in the vicinity of the Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen a day earlier. Prosecutors said investigators were establishing 'whether the motive could be a terror attack.' No one was injured in the blasts on early Wednesday in a neighborhood with several foreign diplomatic missions, although the nearby Jewish school was closed following the explosions. The pair, who cannot be identified under a court order, were ordered held for 27 days. They faced preliminary charges of possessing illegal weapons and carrying five hand grenades. Two of the grenades blew up when the suspects threw them at a house near the embassy, prosecutor Soren Harbo said. 'This was pretty close to the Israeli Embassy,' Harbo said before Thursday's court hearing. The explosions caused damage to a roof terrace of a nearby house. The diplomatic mission was not harmed. Thursday's hearing was held behind closed doors after the preliminary charges were read. Reporting from inside the court room, Danish broadcaster DR said the teenagers, ages 16 and 19, are suspected of acting 'in association and together with prior agreement with one or more perpetrators.' Both denied the charges, local media reported. The two suspects were arrested Wednesday shortly before noon on a train at Copenhagen's central station. Danish media ran photos of a man in a white hazmat suit being taken away by police on a train platform at the station. A third suspect, age 19, who had been arrested near the embassy, has been released, police said Thursday. In Denmark, the charges are one step short of formal charges and allow authorities to keep criminal suspects in custody during an investigation. Separately, shots were fired late Tuesday at the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm. No one was injured. No arrests have been made. The Danish domestic security service, known by its acronym PET, said that 'Swedish authorities have assessed that at least one specific act directed at the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm, which was carried out by young criminals in Sweden, has links to Iran.' In May the Swedish domestic security agency SAPO accused Iran of using established criminal networks in Sweden as a proxy to target Israeli or Jewish people. The announcement came after the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm was sealed off in late January after what was then described as 'a dangerous object' was found on the grounds of the diplomatic mission. Swedish media said the object was a hand grenade. In a statement, PET said, 'If we have a state actor who gets young criminals to carry out actions aimed at Jewish targets in our neighboring country, then we can be concerned that this will also happen in Denmark.' In Stockholm, the operative of Sweden's domestic security agency SAPO, Fredrik Hallstrom, said, 'The latest incident at the Israeli Embassy is not classified as a terrorist crime at the moment.' His counterpart at the Swedish police's National Operations Department, Johan Olsson, told the same press conference that the charges were of 'aggravated weapons offenses, causing danger or other serious illegal threats and damage.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/denmark-jails-2-swedish-teens-over-blasts-near-israeli-embassy/7809092.html	2024-10-03T07:48:40-07:00	
Georgian parliament speaker signs anti-LGBTQ+ law after president refuses to	Tbilisi, Georgia — The speaker of the Georgian parliament signed into a law Thursday a bill that severely curtails LGBTQ+ rights in the country and mirrors legislation adopted in neighboring Russia. Shalva Papuashvili, the parliament speaker, said on social media that the legislation does 'not reflect current, temporary, changing ideas and ideologies, but is based on common sense, historical experience and centuries-old Christian, Georgian and European values.' Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili had refused to sign the bill and returned it to parliament on Wednesday. It was introduced by the governing Georgian Dream party and approved by lawmakers last month. The bill includes bans on same-sex marriages, adoptions by same-sex couples and public endorsement and depictions of LGBTQ+ relations and people in the media. It also bans gender-affirming care and changing gender designations in official documents. 'This law protects the rights of all citizens, including freedom of expression, so that the rights of others are not violated, which is the essence and idea of true democracy,' Papuashvili wrote. Parliament gave the legislation its final approval as Georgia, a largely conservative country where the Orthodox Church wields significant influence, prepares to vote in a parliamentary election. The law has been widely seen as an effort by the governing party to shore up support among conservative groups. It was decried by human rights advocates and LGBTQ+ activists, who said it further marginalized an already vulnerable community. By signing the law, Georgian Dream 'have taken homophobia to a new level, and that is political and institutional homophobia,' said Ana Tavadze, an activist with Tbilisi Pride, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group. Georgian Dream's aim is to 'fabricate' problems ahead of the election to distract people from 'their failure' to solve issues involving unemployment, education and healthcare, Tavadze told The Associated Press. The law has drawn comparisons with Russia, where the Kremlin has been highlighting what it calls traditional family values. Russian authorities in the last decade have banned public endorsement of 'nontraditional sexual relations' and introduced laws against gender-affirming care, among other measures. Its Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism by labeling what the authorities called the LGBTQ+ 'movement' operating in Russia as an extremist organization and banning it. In Georgia, the LGBTQ+ community has struggled even before the legislation was introduced. Demonstrations and violent outbursts against LGBTQ+ people have been common, and last year hundreds of opponents of gay rights stormed an LGBTQ+ festival in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, forcing the event's cancellation. This year, tens of thousands marched in Tbilisi to promote 'traditional family values.' A day after parliament gave its final approval to the anti-LGBTQ+ bill, transgender actor and model Kesaria Avramidze was stabbed to death in her apartment in Tbilisi. Rights advocates had worried that the bill would stoke more violence. Papuashvili, the parliament speaker, said that by not signing the bill, President Zourabichvili and the Georgian opposition 'did not have enough courage to openly express their opinion regarding this law.' Some analysts say parts of the Georgian opposition are walking a fine line ahead of the Oct. 26 election between condemning the move to curtail LGBTQ+ rights and not wanting to alienate some voters. Zourabichvili has long been at odds with the governing party and vetoed a 'foreign influence' law adopted by parliament earlier this year. She was overridden by parliament, where Georgian Dream dominates. The measure requires media and nongovernmental organizations to register as 'pursuing the interests of a foreign power' if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad. It ignited weeks of protests and was widely criticized as threatening democratic freedoms. Those opposing the law compared it to similar legislation in Russia which is routinely used to suppress dissent, and accused the governing party of acting in concert with Moscow, jeopardizing Georgia's chances of joining the European Union. The South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million formally applied to join the EU in 2022, after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but the bloc halted its accession in response to the 'foreign influence' law and froze some of its financial support. The United States imposed sanctions on dozens of Georgian officials in response to the law. Georgian Dream was set up by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia's prime minister in 2012. It promised to restore civil rights and 'reset' relations with Moscow, which fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008 over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Russia then recognized the independence of South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian province, Abkhazia, and established military bases there. Many Georgians backed Ukraine as Kyiv battled Russia's invasion in 2022. But the Georgian government abstained from joining sanctions against Moscow, barred dozens of Kremlin critics from entering the country, and accused the West of trying to drag Georgia into open conflict with Russia. The opposition has accused the governing party of steering the country into Russia's orbit to the detriment of its European aspirations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-parliament-speaker-signs-anti-lgbtq-law-after-president-refuses-to/7808951.html	2024-10-03T07:16:29-07:00	
Russia to try American accused of being Ukrainian mercenary in secret	MOSCOW — The trial of a 72-year-old American man whom Russia accuses of working as a mercenary for Ukraine will take place behind closed doors, and the verdict will be announced Monday, Russian state media reported. Stephen Hubbard is accused of signing a $1,000-per-month contract with a Ukrainian territorial defense unit in the city of Izyum in February 2022. He was captured by Russian forces in April that year, and he faces a sentence of seven to 15 years if convicted. The RIA news agency said the judge on Thursday accepted a prosecutor's request to hold the proceedings in secret to ensure the safety of the participants. It was not clear why the prosecutor believed an open trial would have placed them at risk. RIA said Hubbard himself supported the move, saying he did not want outsiders to be present. RIA reported earlier that he had pleaded guilty to the charges. Another state agency, TASS, said the verdict would come on October 7. A U.S. embassy spokesperson said: 'We are aware of reports of the arrest of an American citizen. Due to privacy restrictions, we are unable to comment any further.' Prosecutors have said Hubbard was provided with training, weapons and ammunition when he allegedly signed up. Hubbard's sister Patricia Fox and another relative have cast doubt on his reported confession, saying he held pro-Russian views and was unlikely to have taken up arms at his age. 'He never had a gun, owned a gun, done any of that. ... He's more of a pacifist,' Fox told Reuters last month. Hubbard is one of at least 10 U.S. nationals behind bars in Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-to-try-american-accused-of-being-ukrainian-mercenary-in-secret/7809004.html	2024-10-03T07:11:41-07:00

Kazakhstan seeks clarity from Russia over grain transit halt	ASTANA, Kazakhstan — Kazakhstan has halted grain exports to Russia, Kazakh officials said on Thursday, adding it has asked Moscow to prove claims it has breached rules on plant health, the reason cited by Moscow for an effective ban of imports and transit of Kazakh grain. Both Russia and Kazakhstan are net grain exporters, but Kazakhstan relies on transit through Russian territory to sell its grain in Europe and the Mediterranean. The two countries also tranship each others' oil to foreign markets. The Russian state agricultural watchdog said this week that from Sept. 23, its systems would automatically block the issuance of phytosanitary certificates for grain, grain products, sunflower seeds, tomatoes, and peppers from Kazakhstan. In the absence of such certificates, the goods cannot legally cross the border, and the Kazakh state railway company confirmed on Thursday that grain shipments to Russia have been halted. Kazakh deputy agriculture minister Yermek Kenzhekhanuly said the Astana government has requested more detailed information on the alleged violations, had not heard back from Moscow and therefore could not comment further on what some industry players have described as a potential trade war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kazakhstan-seeks-clarity-from-russia-over-grain-transit-halt/7808775.html	2024-10-03T02:35:45-07:00	
Vietnam protests Chinese attack on fishing vessels in South China Sea	WASHINGTON — Vietnam Wednesday protested China's reported behavior toward fishermen near the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea after Vietnamese state media said Chinese personnel boarded a Vietnamese fishing boat and beat crew members. The Vietnamese reporting said Chinese government personnel Sunday attacked the boat, leaving 10 fishermen with injuries, some serious. Vietnam’s state-run Tien Phong newspaper reported Tuesday that the fishermen said around 40 people from the foreign vessels beat them with iron pipes and took away their fishing equipment. Four Vietnamese fishermen from the central Vietnamese city of Quang Ngai were hospitalized with serious injuries, VietnamNet reported Tuesday. The newspaper cited Nguyen Thanh Bien, the vessel's captain, describing the two vessels as having the numbers '101' and '301.' 'On the morning of September 29, while operating in the waters, they spotted a foreign ship identified as number 301 pursuing them. Sensing danger, Bien ordered the crew to head back to Sa Ky port [on the seashore of Quang Ngai]. However, an additional foreign vessel with number 101 joined the pursuit, deploying three smaller boats to encircle them,' VietnamNet reported. 'They were beating us mercilessly. I raised my hands to defend myself, knowing we couldn’t fight back. After their attack, they forced us to the front of the ship and covered us with a tarp,' said Nguyen Thuong, 34, one the hospitalized fishermen, who suffered injuries to his left arm, according to VietnamNet. Vietnamese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokeswoman Pham Thu Hang said in her statement that Chinese law enforcement forces 'suppressed, injured, and confiscated property' of Vietnamese fishermen aboard the QNg 95739 TS fishing vessel of Quang Ngai province. 'Việt Nam is extremely concerned about, discontented with, and resolutely opposes the Chinese law enforcement force’s brutal behaviors towards the Vietnamese fishermen,' Hang said. 'The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sternly communicated with the Chinese Embassy in Hanoi, strongly opposed the abovementioned acts by the Chinese law enforcement force and demanded China to fully respect Vietnam’s sovereignty over the Hoàng Sa archipelago, quickly investigate and announce results to the Vietnamese side, and not repeat similar acts,' Hang added, using the Vietnamese name for the Paracel Islands. Two Chinese government vessels, the Sansha Zhifa 101 and Sansha Zhifa 301, have been identified as the ships that allegedly attacked a Vietnamese fishing crew on September 29, according to the geoint.asia and South China Sea expert Duan Dang. 'Two Chinese coast guard ships, Sansha Zhifa 101 and Sansha Zhifa 301, unprovokedly attacked Vietnamese fishermen and ships,' Hoang Viet, a lecturer with the University of Law of Ho Chi Minh City, told VOA by phone Wednesday. 'This clearly shows China's plot to monopolize the East Sea,' Hoang Viet said, using the Vietnamese name of the South China Sea. China's Foreign Affairs Ministry said Tuesday that Vietnamese fishing boats were fishing without Beijing’s permission, so Chinese authorities took measures to stop them, according to Reuters. 'The on-site operations were professional and restrained, and no injuries were found,' the ministry said, in response to a Reuters request for comment, without specifically referring to the attack. 'China’s assertion of its maritime claims are growing increasingly violent. Its law enforcement ships have been effectively turned into a paramilitary force, with authorization to use all available means to coerce its neighbors into submission,' Raymond Powell, founder and director of SeaLight, a project that monitors activities in the South China Sea, told VOA by text message Wednesday. 'It seems only a matter of time before someone is killed during one of these encounters,' Powell wrote. 'Vietnam government responded rather fast to the incident,' Hoang Viet, the law lecturer, said by phone. 'Vietnam always prioritizes its relationship with China, and it also puts its territorial sovereignty at a more important level.' 'China has never stopped its ambition to occupy the East Sea. Vietnam, as well as other Southeast Asian countries, are always in China's sights. When will it act? It's just a matter of time,' Hoang Viet said.

VOA Interview: Muhammad Yunus on restoring order in Bangladesh	New York — After a series of student-led protests resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties, former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stepped down and fled the country on August 5. Days later, Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel laureate who pioneered the global microcredit movement, was sworn in as the nation’s interim leader. He spoke with Voice of America Bangla Service reporter Anis Ahmed on Friday in New York, where he explained his decision to grant temporary magistracy powers to the army to restore law and order after the police lost public trust. He also stressed the critical role of youth leadership in shaping the country's future. Yunus, who took office amid widespread unrest, highlighted key priorities such as strengthening relations with neighboring countries, holding elections, reforming the constitution and addressing the Rohingya refugee crisis. He confirmed that reforms and elections remained essential before power could be handed over to elected representatives. The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity: VOA: First, we would like to know that after nearly one and a half months of assuming this responsibility on August 8, you have now delegated magistracy power to army officers. Why do you feel it was necessary? Muhammad Yunus, chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh: To bring law and order to the country. We were trying to work it out through the police, which is normal. But the police have lost their moral courage because when they face people, they hear bitter words. Just a few days ago they killed some students, so they are distancing themselves — they don’t want to be out front. So, as they lost morale, we lost the strength of law and order. But as we’ve said before, not everyone in the police is responsible for wrongdoing. We will identify those who have done wrong. They will be brought to justice. But this is a long process; it’s not happening all of a sudden. And in the meantime, law and order is being violated — different types of violations are happening. We thought that if we allowed this to continue, then conditions would deteriorate, so the issue of giving powers to our army came up. We asked the army, and they agreed. They said, 'We're here, but no one is heeding us because we do not have any power. If we had some power, the people would be cautious.' We then gave them the magistracy power but for a limited period, for two months. That’s how it happened. VOA: So, you’re hopeful that the police service will return in two months? Yunus: Yes, I hope so. They’re not able to use their power; the army has come in and that’s not very pleasing for them that their duties are being performed by someone else. VOA: We know students took the role of leadership amid the unrest, and that there are student representatives in your government as well. But is it also true that we are seeing students trying to establish their authority in different sectors and institutions of the country? Are these students running the country? What role are they playing? Yunus: Yes, they should. The youth should assume authority. So far, the old people have made mistakes, so let there be an effort for youth to come forward and take responsibility. They might also make mistakes and then correct those, but their leadership ushered in big changes. So, I don’t find any reasons to doubt their capacity for leadership. VOA: So, can we say that the students are running your administration? Yunus: No, I didn’t say they are running the administration, I said they should. Let the youth take it. I have always said, even before I took this responsibility, that it should be in the hands of the youth because they will build their future. If we try to write the future for them, that would not be right. So, I’ll say again that not only in Bangladesh but in the entire world, youth should be given this responsibility. VOA: We haven’t heard anything from you regarding the duration of this interim government, but General Waqar-Uz-Zaman recently said an election would occur within the next 18 months. Are we safe to assume the interim government would dissolve at that time? Yunus: Well, if you want to presume, you may, but that’s not the decision of the government. The government has not given any opinion so far. The government needs to say when they would take a decision about their duration. VOA: The Advisory Committee to the interim government has yet to make any decisions? Yunus: We have discussed but no decisions have been taken yet. VOA: What are the plans of your government to improve relations with India? Yunus: We are telling them clearly that we want good relations with them. Because that is needed for India and for us, too. We are neighbors. If relations between neighbors are bad, it’s not good for any nation. It’s not good for them, nor for us. It’s in the interest of our two countries that our relations should be close and cordial. VOA: Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is in India. What steps are you taking to extradite her to Bangladesh? Yunus: This is a legal matter. Definitely we will want her back, wherever she might be, whenever we can legally implement the decision. VOA: After August 5, Bangabandhu Memorial Museum, once home to Hasina’s father but turned into a museum after his assasination there, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was destroyed. Your government subsequently canceled the national day of mourning. Obviously, some look on Rahman, in their words, as a fascist icon. But Rahman has long been recognized as the father of the nation. What’s the viewpoint of your interim government? Yunus: You’re talking about the past. Apparently, you don’t remember that a mass uprising has since taken place. You’re speaking as if it never happened. You need to see what’s happening in this new situation. You do not seem to have any questions about how many students have sacrificed their lives, why they sacrificed their lives. First, we must admit that they, the students, said that we have pushed a reset button. The past is gone for sure. Now we will build up in new way. People also want that. And this new way means we must bring reforms. VOA: We’ve paid respect to those killed during the student-led uprisings, and you have said that their killers will be brought to justice. But at the same time, after August 5, many others were killed. A short while ago we were talking about many police being killed. What steps are being taken by your government to bring the perpetrators to justice? Yunus: Whoever has committed a crime and wherever that might be, they will be brought to justice. If that’s not done, justice won’t be complete. To judge one type of crime and not another, that’s not acceptable. That would be a form of partisan justice. So, if we return to that kind of partisanship, the mass movement would have been meaningless. So, if crime is committed, the criminal will face the law. VOA: There are more than a million Rohingya currently displaced in Bangladesh. Will your government grant them refugee status? Yunus: International institutions have given them this status. The United Nations refugee agency [UNHCR] has been working there for a long time. So, they are refugees. They are not citizens of our country. VOA: But officially they are not recognized as refugees. Yunus: If they were not refugees, UNHCR couldn’t reach them. VOA: Thousands of Rohingya recently arrived in Bangladesh, and it is assumed that more are on the way. So, if more Rohingya enter Bangladesh, then what would be your decision? Yunus: According to international law, if they want to come, we will let them. We will accept them. And then we’ll do whatever is necessary. It’s not our problem alone. It is the responsibility of the entire world. When one’s life is at stake, one seeks refuge. We cannot close doors on them. You know, it’s been going on for ages. They have been here for the last seven years. Questions are being raised about their future and the future of their children. Nearly 32,000 Rohingya children are born here every year, so the Rohingya community is growing, even independently of new arrivals. When they came, they brought infant children with them. They, too, have grown up. What are you going to do about them? They can’t even see their future. Because of high-tech media they can see the entire world, but they’re confined like in a prison. They may grow angry; they may grow rebellious. This is not a good thing. We don’t know how it’s going to spread, where it will go. We really don’t know, so the whole world should focus on how to help them have a satisfying life. We are looking for a solution. VOA: There are discussions about constitutional amendments. You've even established a committee about it. Is it going to happen during your interim government’s time and what kind of changes or amendments are you expecting? Yunus: As I said before, we must begin everything anew. The previous government destroyed everything. So, from that destruction we need to rise afresh. That’s why we are establishing commissions for all fields. We have made six commissions; more commissions will come soon. Of those, one commission is on the constitution. The whole country wants the constitution to be amended. However, the topic may be subject to debate. That’s why the commission will create guidelines for those debates. That will give the country an opportunity to debate on it so that the political parties can give their opinion and can decide whether they are going to amend right now or later, and what exactly they would do. The constitution that we have now will not be helpful. If the country runs according to the present constitution, the same situation will happen again. VOA: Some people are talking about changing the constitution, others are talking about amending it. Whatever happens, how is it going to be implemented? Yunus: It is a matter of law. What we are now doing is not on the process of implementation, we are focusing on why we need it. When they sit for discussion, they will decide those matters from a legal perspective. We are trying to reach a unanimous opinion on what exactly we need. Then there will be another round of discussion on the legal process. VOA: What are your main objectives as interim leader? Yunus: My main objectives are to bring in reforms, to arrange an election and hand over the power to the elected representatives. VOA: The chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh, Dr. Muhammad Yunus, thank you so much on behalf of Voice of America. Yunus: Thanks to you, too.

EU to vote on tariff hike for Chinese EVs as Germany fears retaliation	Vienna — The European Union is set to vote Friday on a massive tariff increase on Chinese electric vehicles that Germany fears could spark a trade war with Beijing. Reuters reported Wednesday that the measure already has enough votes to pass, with support from France, Greece, Italy and Poland, whose populations make up 39% of the EU. At least 65% of the EU's population must vote against the tariff plan to stop it. Regardless, analysts say, continued negotiations will be needed on China's subsidies to its EV industry. On Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin called Chinese subsidies 'unbearable.' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday said talks with China must continue, and he indicated Germany might abstain from the vote. 'More trade with more partners from more countries — that's what sensible risk management looks like in an uncertain world,' Scholz said, as reported by Reuters. 'That's why negotiations with China on electric vehicles must continue and why we must finally tackle the areas where cheap Chinese imports are harming our economy, for example steel,' he said. Bloomberg reported that Germany expected a significant number of EU states to abstain from voting on the tariffs. German automakers are against tariffs, fearing that retaliation from Beijing could impact access to China, their largest market. German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said Wednesday 'A trade war with China would do us more harm than good for a key European industry and a crucial sector in Germany.' If the vote passes, it could see tariffs on Chinese EVs as high as 45%. Beijing has hinted that it could retaliate with tariffs on German and Italian vehicles and on European agricultural products such as dairy, pork and French brandy. Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao visited Europe in late September and met with officials and businesspeople in charge of foreign trade and commerce in the EU, Belgium, Germany, Italy and other auto-manufacturing countries to lobby the EU to abandon the tariffs. During the negotiations, the Chinese side proposed to set a minimum import price, but the European side refused. The vote was pushed from September 25 to Friday to allow time for more consultation between the two sides. Analysts believe the EU may make some compromises due to the complex interests within the EU. Ja Ian Chong, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, told VOA, 'Because the EU is made up of many national entities with cross-cutting interests, these may lead to the vetoing of tougher action, much the same way ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is ineffective in the face of PRC (People's Republic of China) pressure.' Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said during a visit to Beijing in early September that he would urge the European Commission to reconsider raising tariffs on China's EVs. Francesco Sisci, an Italian Sinologist, told VOA that the centrifugal forces of member states and political parties within the EU are too strong to make difficult decisions. In the past, the EU 'was ruled by a solid majority centered around People's parties and Social-Democratic parties and a triangle made of Germany, France and Italy, Sisci said. 'Both these two architectures are now partially shattered.' 'The People's parties and Social-Democratic parties have still a majority but a thin one,' he said. 'Italy, with a right leaning government, didn't vote for the present President of the commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and it is dragging its feet on many EU policies.' 'Germany and France have governments at home that are under siege from new rightist parties,' he added. Sisci told VOA Mandarin that Germany's car industry 'is dependent on the sales in the Chinese market and yet risks being squeezed out of all markets because of the Chinese EV competition. There are no good or clear alternatives.' Although China's EVs have a price advantage in the European market, Chinese businesspeople working in the automotive industry there are more cautious. Yang is a Chinese businessman in Austria who does automobile maintenance, annual inspection and second-hand car trading. He did not give his full name because of privacy concerns. Yang said that because of Europe’s economic downturn, consumers there are careful with their money and will not easily replace their gasoline-powered vehicles with all-electric vehicles. 'Many European consumers choose hybrid electric vehicles,' Yang said, talking about his own business. 'This year's data report shows that the sales of all-electric vehicles have decreased by one-third, while hybrid electric vehicles have increased.' He said tariffs will certainly affect the price of Chinese electric vehicles in Europe, but European consumers are more concerned about other factors such as the life and endurance of the car. 'All-electric vehicles may not be a big market in Europe,' he said. The EU's vote comes after a probe into China's subsidies for the industry and 100% tariff hikes on Chinese EV imports to the U.S. and Canada.

In India, pride in Harris’s run for US presidency, but excitement missing	NEW DELHI — In the small South Indian village of Thulasendrapuram, where U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris’s maternal grandfather once lived, locals and priests have prayed to the local deity at a Hindu temple for her victory as she runs for the U.S. presidency. In the capital, New Delhi, many express pride that one of the candidates for the world’s most powerful office has Indian roots – she is the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father. But Harris has failed to enthuse others who feel she never built on her Indian connection during her vice presidency. 'It’s quite exciting for someone like me who is a common girl around town,' said New Delhi resident, Simran Singh. Another city resident, Nandita Soni, and her husband watched Harris debate her opponent, former U.S. President Donald Trump, last month. 'I think she won hands down. Of course, there is a sense of pride for us. That she is, firstly, a woman and then of Indian heritage, feels really good,' Soni said. Harris is not the only Indian connection to the American presidential race. Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance, is also the daughter of Indian immigrants. Not many in India have heard of Usha Vance. Those who have, see it as a tribute to a country where immigrants can make a mark. 'I think both of them having a role in the elections is a very good thing for our Indian heritage and diaspora, but I think it is much more important for the American system,' said Shyam Bajpai, a retired professional. He praises Harris for 'reviving the Democrat Party’s energy after a very difficult moment with Mr. Biden.' However, the euphoria witnessed in India four years ago when Harris became vice president is missing. She hosted a luncheon for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year during his state visit to Washington, where she spoke of her deep personal connection to India. In interviews she has said that her introduction to the concepts of equality, freedom and democracy came from her Indian grandfather during her visits to her maternal family’s hometown, Chennai, when she was young. But some point out that she neither visited India during her tenure as vice president nor emphasized her Indian identity much while in office. 'To be honest we did not hear much of her in India, because as vice president, her connections with India were not all that great,' said Pradeep Bhargava, a New Delhi resident. 'We were not getting much news about her.' That may be why many young Indians ask: Who is Kamala Harris? 'I think she is not on social media,' said Simar Kaur, an undergraduate student in Delhi University. 'I get most of the news from social media only.' But IT professionals who have long eyed the United States for career opportunities are excited about the possibility of an American president with roots in India. 'I am sure this will help in more job opportunities for Indians in the future,' said software engineer Vishal Chabra. 'It will be good for India as well.' Those who are tracking the U.S. race see Harris’s bid as another huge milestone for its diaspora in Western countries -- Rishi Sunak, who became British Prime Minister in 2022 but lost in July, was also of Indian origin. They also point to the success of Indian Americans who have risen to the top of the corporate ladder in the U.S., heading companies like Google. 'With UK also and now America, Indians are all the way, and it is the way to go from them,' said Soni.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-india-pride-in-harris-s-run-for-us-presidency-but-excitement-missing/7808740.html	2024-10-03T00:07:33-07:00

Singapore's disgraced former transport minister jailed for 12 months in landmark case	SINGAPORE — A Singapore court on Thursday sentenced a former minister to 12 months in prison for obstructing justice and receiving more than $300,000 worth of gifts, in the first jailing of an ex-cabinet member in a city-state famous for its clean governance. S. Iswaran, who was a cabinet member for 13 years and has held the trade, communications and transport portfolios, pleaded guilty last week to four counts of improperly receiving gifts and one of obstructing justice. The sentence handed down was more severe than the six to seven months sought by the prosecution, which presiding judge Vincent Hoong said was 'manifestly inadequate' given the gravity of Iswaran's offenses and their impact on public trust. 'Trust and confidence in public institutions were the bedrock of effective governance, which could all too easily be undermined by the appearance that an individual public servant had fallen below the standards of integrity and accountability,' he said in sentencing Iswaran. The case has shocked Singapore, which prides itself on having a well-paid and efficient bureaucracy as well as strong and squeaky clean governance. It was among the world's top five least corrupt countries last year, according to Transparency International's corruption perception index. The last corruption case involving a Singaporean minister was in 1986, when its national development minister was investigated for alleged bribery but died before any charges were filed in court. The investigation caused a stir in the Asian financial hub and centered on allegations Iswaran while transport minister accepted expensive gifts from businessmen that included tickets to English Premier League soccer matches, the Singapore Formula 1 Grand Prix, London musicals and a ride on a private jet. Iswaran, 62, faced a huge media scrum as he arrived in court and declined to answer questions. He showed no emotion during the court session. The judge allowed him to remain on bail for the next few days and begin his jail term on Monday. Iswaran had initially said he was innocent and would fight to clear his name but pleaded guilty last week to the five charges put before the court. The former minister faced a total of 35 charges, two of which were corruption-related but were later amended to charges of receiving gifts while a public servant. The attorney-general's chambers last week said they made amendments because of litigation risks involved in proving the corruption charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Iswaran was arrested in July last year and was accused of taking kickbacks from businessmen including property tycoon Ong Beng Seng. Iswaran was an adviser to the Singapore Grand Prix's steering committee, while Ong owns the rights to the race. Ong has not been charged with any offense and has issued no public comment on the allegations. The attorney-general's chambers last week said it would decide whether to take action against Ong soon. Judge Hoong in his ruling said there was a higher level of culpability when a public servant holds high office that wield greater influence over business transactions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/singapore-s-disgraced-former-transport-minister-jailed-for-12-months-in-landmark-case/7808732.html	2024-10-02T23:10:52-07:00

Supporters demand release of highly regarded Cambodian journalist	Bangkok — Cambodia this week has seen an outpouring of support from journalists, media groups and embassies for Mech Dara, one of the country’s last remaining independent journalists, who recently was taken into custody and charged with incitement. The U.S. Embassy in Cambodia posted on social media platform X that it was deeply troubled by Monday’s arrest and called for Dara’s release. 'He is a leading voice against human trafficking & online scams,' the embassy posted on X, noting that he was presented with an award by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken last year for his work to combat human trafficking. Describing Dara as an advocate for the freedom of expression that is guaranteed in Cambodia’s constitution, the embassy added, 'We encourage authorities to engage [with] diverse voices & foster a free, independent press.' Cambodian-state media confirmed that Dara, 36, was charged with incitement related to social media posts he made at the end of September. He is now in pre-trial detention and could face up to two years in prison for his alleged offenses. Local media quoted a family member saying Dara’s car was stopped while he was traveling from Sihanoukville to Phnom Penh and that police arrived in a military vehicle and five other cars. The relative said police cited an arrest warrant, seized Dara’s phone and asked his family members to stay in their car. He has since been taken to a prison in Kandal Province, outside Phnom Penh, where he will remain until his trial. The Phnom Penh provincial court issued a statement saying Dara has been charged under two articles of Cambodia’s criminal code for incitement to provoke serious social disorder. It said Dara has admitted his guilt. His arrest came a day after authorities in Prey Veng accused Dara of posting 'fake news.' The journalist had posted a photo on Facebook showing destroyed concrete stairs leading to a pagoda that serves as a religious site and tourist destination in the province. Neil Loughlin, an assistant professor in comparative politics at City University of London who specializes in Southeast Asia, described Dara as one of Cambodia’s most respected journalists. 'His posts related to alleged damage to a temple site cut through, because there is a lot of this kind of thing in the country, where resource extraction and wealth concentration in the hands of the country’s elite is a central part of its elite political settlement,' Loughlin told VOA. But a spokesman for Cambodia’s Ministry of Information said in a statement that Dara was charged for incitement intended to cause serious unrest impacting social security. The statement said the actions Dara is charged with are not a 'journalism related affair.' It added that 'falsifying information and posting incident messages that distort the truth, slander, fabricate false information that is done with malicious intent to ignite anger among the public with confusions and misconceptions are not considered as freedom of expression.' Over the years, Dara’s investigative reporting has focused on human trafficking and its connection to illegal scam operations in Cambodia. Dara was once detained by police while reporting on the activities of a scam center in Sihanoukville. One of his best-known stories saw him link Cambodian tycoon and senator Ly Yong Phat to scam compounds. The U.S. imposed sanctions on the businessman in September. Cambodia is home to scam centers that have operated in several cities, towns and provinces throughout the country. These include 'pig butchering,' in which victims generally are contacted via the internet and enticed to gradually invest in fake and fraudulent schemes over a period of time. According to a report by the United States Institute of Peace, 100,000 scammers have been involved in pig butchering in Cambodia, generating income estimated at $12.8 billion in 2023. But Chou Bun Eng, the permanent vice chair of Cambodia’s National Committee for Counter Trafficking, told the pro-government newspaper Khmer Times in March that 80% of human trafficking cases they’ve investigated are 'false.' Journalists like Dara have long faced security risks when covering the illegal scam centers in Cambodia or reporting on other matters that show the government in a bad light. In 2020, journalist Sok Oudom was convicted and sentenced to 20 months in prison for broadcasting false news with the intent to cause incitement. In 2021, reporter Khou Piseth was charged with incitement for criticizing officials on Facebook over COVID-19 measures. The same year saw Youn Chhiv sentenced to one year in prison for incitement to cause a felony after he made a Facebook post criticizing a provincial court prosecutor. 'The vague charge of incitement has often been used by Cambodian authorities to target critics, including journalists,' Beh Lih Yi, Asia program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, told VOA via email. 'Arresting one of Cambodia's best-known journalists on vague charges like incitement is a clear attempt to muzzle any remaining independent reporting left in the country,' she wrote. Loughlin said incitement charges are typical of the government’s tactics against dissenting voices. 'The charge of incitement to social unrest is telling. Over the past decade, as part of the broader crackdown on dissent, the CPP government has promoted a narrative of stability to legitimate its use of coercion to silence those who criticise it or shine a light on corruption etc.,' he wrote to VOA. 'It uses this narrative to legitimize its repressive control over the country in perpetuity, with anybody who the government doesn’t like targeted for repression, justified in the name of that stability,' he added. Cambodia has been ruled by the same political party, the Cambodia People Party (CPP), since 1979 and has maintained its grip on power by banning opposition parties and cracking down on dissidents. The CPP shared power with co-prime ministers from 1993-97 with a royalist party. Hun Manet came into power in 2023, taking over as prime minister from his father Hun Sen, who led Cambodia for nearly 40 years. Reporters without Borders, a media watchdog that ranks 180 countries and territories worldwide for their level of press freedom, has ranked Cambodia at 151, a lowly position in its World Press Freedom Index for 2024. Cambodia's Ministry of Information says the country has taken a firm stand to promote the freedom of the press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supporters-demand-release-of-highly-regarded-cambodian-journalist-/7808721.html	2024-10-02T22:15:29-07:00

Israel’s threat to retaliate against Iran triggers panic buying at Iranian gas stations	WASHINGTON — Israel’s vow to make Iran pay a price for carrying out a large-scale missile strike on the Jewish state has prompted panic buying of gasoline in major Iranian cities and the temporary closure of Iranian airspace to all commercial flights. Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel after nightfall on Tuesday, in a major escalation of a yearlong conflict between Israel and Iran’s regional proxy forces. The Israeli military intercepted most of the missiles with help from allied U.S. naval forces. Speaking late Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran’s Islamist rulers had made a 'big mistake' by attacking his nation. Other Israeli officials warned those rulers to expect a powerful and painful response. Israel’s threats sparked long lines of cars outside gas stations in major Iranian cities as drivers rushed to fill their vehicles’ tanks. One video posted to social media and vetted by VOA Persian showed dozens of cars waiting to fill up at a gas station in Tehran, apparently on Wednesday. Other social media clips reviewed by VOA Persian appeared to show similar long lines of vehicles outside gas stations late Tuesday in the Tehran provincial city of Eslamshahr and in the central city of Isfahan. VOA could not independently confirm the panic buying at the gas stations seen in the videos because it is barred from operating inside Iran. In another apparent reaction to Israel’s threat of a retaliatory strike, Iran shut its airspace to all domestic and international flights after completing its missile attack. The Iranian Civil Aviation Organization’s Aerospace Committee said in a Wednesday statement that flights would remain suspended until at least 5 a.m. local time on Thursday to 'maintain the safety of passengers.' Western media reported on Wednesday that Israel may target Iran’s oil and other energy facilities in its threatened retaliation. There was no confirmation from Israel. Any Israeli strike on Iranian oil or gas infrastructure would have a big economic impact on the country, according to Kpler’s Homayoun Falakshahi, a senior oil analyst for the Belgium-based global trade data firm. In a message to VOA, Falakshahi said Iran sources most of its gasoline from domestically produced oil that it refines into petroleum products. Iran’s Islamist rulers also rely heavily on revenue from energy exports to major customers such as China, a practice they have maintained for years in defiance of U.S. sanctions. Tehran has shipped an average of 1.54 million barrels of crude oil and gas condensate per day for the year to date, according to Falakshahi. Iran does not publish official data on its energy exports as part of its efforts to circumvent sanctions. Kpler uses a variety of sources to estimate those Iranian exports, such as location data from oil tankers' Automatic Identification System transponders, satellite imagery, and information provided by personnel at ports. The impact of an Israeli attack on Iran's energy exports would depend on whether Israel targets export infrastructure, Falakshahi said. 'For now, I don’t think such an attack will be the case, because China would get quite upset,' he added. This story was produced in collaboration with VOA’s Persian Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-threat-to-retaliate-against-iran-triggers-panic-buying-at-iranian-gas-stations/7808689.html	2024-10-02T20:35:04-07:00	
Conservative think tank pushes US to continue engagement in Pacific	washington — U.S. engagement with a string of Pacific Island nations must continue, regardless of which party wins the White House, the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation said in a newly published report. The islands, situated between Hawaii and Australia, are the latest front of competition between Washington and Beijing. In the 45-page report, Andrew Harding, a research assistant in the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, argues that it's time to make the case to taxpayers and Washington policymakers that investing in the Pacific Islands is money well-spent because it 'counters Chinese ambitions' and denies Beijing a foothold 'that can threaten U.S. national security interests and complicate possible future military operations in Asia.' That argument appears convincing to some China hawks in the Republican Party. Alexander Velez-Green, former national security adviser to Republican Senator Josh Hawley, called the report 'a compelling vision,' telling VOA in a statement, 'The Pacific Islands are key terrain in America's efforts to balance power against China.' Likewise, former Asia adviser in the Trump administration Alexander Gray said the Heritage report would benefit 'whoever is president in January 2025.' 'I expect a Trump 2.0 would only expand on this important work,' Gray wrote in response to VOA's emailed questions. The Heritage Foundation now employs many former Trump administration officials. Last year it released Project 2025, a controversial series of proposals to staff and shape policy for a second Trump White House. Former President Donald Trump has sought to distance himself from the effort, even as his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, claims it defines his policies. John Hennessey-Niland, who served as U.S. ambassador to Palau from 2020 to 2022, argues that Harding's message may convince policymakers in Washington but addresses only one of the region's problems. 'The Pacific Islands are concerned about PRC interference and coercion, but it is not the only threat they face. Other concerns include climate and their own capacity to provide for their people,' Hennessey-Niland told VOA via a statement, using the abbreviation for the People's Republic of China. Kathryn Paik agrees. She served as director for the Pacific and Southeast Asia at the National Security Council under President Joe Biden and now works as a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 'Making U.S. Pacific engagement 'all about China' neglects precisely what can enable the U.S.-Pacific relationship to grow deeper than anything China could ever hope to have — our history, our culture and our shared values,' she told VOA in response to emailed questions. Harding said he is just saying the quiet part out loud. 'America's primary driver is U.S.-China competition and the threats that it poses to America's national interests and the security of its people,' he told VOA Tuesday in an interview. Chinese President Xi Jinping has traveled to the Pacific Islands to meet one on one with the leaders of Fiji and Papua New Guinea. He also has hosted numerous other Pacific Islands heads of state in Beijing. In contrast, the White House has only held joint meetings with Pacific Islands leaders, and Biden has not traveled to the nations. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA's request for comment. While analysts differ over the report's rationale for deeper engagement in the Pacific, they say many of the 31 policy recommendations have bipartisan appeal, including appointing a special envoy for the Pacific Islands, creating more positions at key departments to oversee outreach and planning a presidential visit to a Pacific Islands state. Greg Brown, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the appointment of a special envoy is vital to sustained U.S. engagement. He said the real challenge is convincing the 535 members of the U.S. Congress to increase foreign assistance to the Pacific Islands when few American voters even know where they are, much less why they're important to U.S. national security. 'Anything requiring funding from Congress will be a chore — not because the demands are large or fiscal-burden heavy, but because members and staffs need constant reminders why securing U.S. interests in this region are imperative,' Brown told VOA in an interview. He added that the special envoy should be a 'heavyweight appointment ... with the ear of the president' and the 'diplomatic skill to navigate and drive changes' across Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/conservative-think-tank-pushes-us-to-continue-engagement-in-pacific-/7808642.html	2024-10-02T18:54:33-07:00	
Israel-Iran escalation heightens fears of widening war, direct US involvement	For months, U.S. President Joe Biden has warned Israel against allowing its war with Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza to spread against Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran itself. But with Israel fighting in Lebanon and vowing retaliation for Tehran’s missile attacks, many fear that moment has come. VOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara looks at the potential for further escalation and the possibility of U.S. direct involvement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-iran-escalation-heightens-fears-of-widening-war-direct-us-involvement-/7808646.html	2024-10-02T18:44:43-07:00	
Chinese gangs revive scam hubs in Myanmar as Beijing eases pressure on junta	WASHINGTON — A recent report by the U.S. Institute of Peace highlights the resurgence of scam hubs, particularly in Myanmar's Karen State, due to China's softened stance toward the country's military regime. China's posture has shifted, said Jason Tower, co-author of the report and the country director for Burma at the institute. 'They're now much more focused on regime survival, looking at how they can prevent the [Myanmar] regime from toppling,' Tower told VOA Burmese. 'As a result, China has shown much less interest in taking forceful action to pressure the Myanmar military to address these problems.' According to the report, these criminal networks benefit from the complex dynamics between Myanmar's military and Chinese interests. China's focus has shifted from cracking down on scams to supporting the Myanmar military. This change in strategy has allowed the criminal organizations to flourish, using Myanmar as a base of operations. After contacting the Chinese Embassy in Washington about the issue, VOA received a statement that did not directly address cyber scam operations. Instead, it emphasized China's focus on peace and stability in Myanmar. 'China and Myanmar are close neighbors with a deep bond of friendship,' wrote embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu. 'As a friendly neighbor, China has always paid close attention to the development and evolution of the situation in Myanmar and northern Myanmar. We do not hope to see conflict or chaos in Myanmar and sincerely hope for an early restoration of stability.' China's Ministry of Public Security portrayed the situation differently, according to a report published Monday by China's state-run Xinhua news agency. In a recent statement on its crackdown on cyber scams, the report said, the ministry highlighted joint efforts with Myanmar authorities, noting that 'a total of 870 suspects, including 313 Chinese and 557 Myanmar nationals, were arrested during a crackdown on telecom and online fraud in northern Myanmar.' Myanmar's state-controlled media Global New Light of Myanmar also focused on crackdowns, noting that Myanmar's police had worked closely with China in extraditing 20 Chinese nationals in September. Shift in China's priorities China's view on the conflict constantly evolves based on events inside Myanmar, said Thomas Kean, a senior consultant at the International Crisis Group, a nongovernmental think tank. 'Since 2021, we've seen different phases, but ultimately, China wants stability in Myanmar to pursue its strategic objectives, keep its borders safe, and ensure that Chinese nationals and the economy aren't affected,' Kean said. Tower described how China's priorities have shifted from addressing scams to focusing on maintaining its strategic interests in Myanmar. 'The Chinese government began prioritizing the advancement of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, which includes infrastructure and trade routes, giving China access to the Indian Ocean,' he said. Tower said some Chinese strategists had suggested that China had perhaps gone too far in its crackdown on the scam syndicates, losing sight of its broader strategic goals. As a result, Chinese authorities pushed hard to broker cease-fire agreements between Myanmar's military and ethnic armed groups to stabilize the region. 'Pig butchering' scams The Chinese scams emanating from Myanmar have grown in sophistication, the U.S. Institute of Peace report noted. The United States has become one of the primary targets, losing billions of dollars annually to 'pig butchering' scams. 'Pig butchering' is a type of investment fraud where scammers lure victims on social media only to defraud them for significant amounts of money, often in cryptocurrency. Many Americans have fallen victim to scams originating from Myanmar, said Erin West, a deputy district attorney with California's REACT Task Force to combat high-tech crime. 'They've liquidated retirement accounts, children's college funds, only to find out that the entire thing is fictitious, and they've lost everything,' West told VOA. Victims are lured into fraudulent online relationships, believing they are investing in cryptocurrency, she said. While some criminals are deported back to China, Tower said, broader networks remain primarily untouched and continue to operate with the protection of local warlords and military elites. He is concerned that these scams will increasingly become a threat to U.S. national security. 'These scams are currently causing estimated losses in the range of $5.5 billion per year for the U.S., but other estimates place the numbers as high as $15 billion,' Tower said. These actors are often under the protection of the Myanmar military or other corrupt regional elites, he added, making it difficult for law enforcement to intervene. 'This is a serious crisis,' Tower said. 'We're seeing a massive transfer of wealth from the United States to bad actors in Southeast Asia — actors that are undermining democracy, highly corrupt and often under the protection of the Myanmar military or other corrupt elites. This is bad news for the U.S. on many fronts.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-gangs-revive-scam-hubs-in-myanmar-as-beijing-eases-pressure-on-junta/7808652.html	2024-10-02T18:42:12-07:00

Cybersecurity head says there's no chance a foreign adversary can change US election results	WASHINGTON — Nearly a month out from Election Day, the head of the nation's cybersecurity agency is forcefully reassuring Americans who have been swept into the chaotic churn of election disinformation and distrust that they will be able to feel confident in the outcome. State and local election officials have made so much progress in securing voting, ballot-counting and other election infrastructure that the system is more robust than it has ever been, said Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. As a result, she said, there is no way Russia, Iran or any other foreign adversary will be able to alter the results. 'Malicious actors, even if they tried, could not have an impact at scale such that there would be a material effect on the outcome of the election,' Easterly told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday. Easterly's trust in the election process comes as intelligence officials have warned of escalating efforts by foreign adversaries to influence voters, deepen partisan divides and undermine faith in U.S. elections. Her comments stand in contrast to the doubts millions of Americans, especially Republicans, have held since the 2020 election when former President Donald Trump refused to accept his loss. He has built on his false claims of vote rigging since then, setting the stage to claim the election has been stolen if he loses again this November. Easterly touched on a range of election-related concerns — including misinformation, her agency's role in interacting with social media companies and ongoing threats to election workers — during the 40-minute interview, which came as mail ballots are being sent out and some states have started early in-person voting. She also said her agency is in touch with election officials throughout the regions of the Southeast that have been ravaged by Hurricane Helene and praised those workers for 'displaying enormous and admirable resilience' as they try to ensure that voters are able to cast their ballots despite the devastation. Recognizing that many Americans' confidence in elections 'has been shaken,' Easterly emphasized how prepared election officials are for emergencies, simple mistakes and attacks — and how motivated they are to protect Americans' votes. Election officials have worked in recent years to boost cybersecurity defenses around the nation's voting systems, implementing procedures ranging from access controls to regular testing to identify potential vulnerabilities. Officials also test voting equipment before every election to ensure it works properly. Easterly pointed to layers of security and transparency — such as the paper record of votes in more than 97% of voting jurisdictions — as protections that will help verify the results. 'Things will go wrong. There could be another storm. There could be a ransomware attack, a distributed denial of service attack,' she said. 'These disruptions will create effects, but they will not impact the ability and the votes being cast or those votes being counted.' U.S. officials have spent recent months warning through criminal charges, sanctions and public advisories that foreign adversaries are ramping up their efforts to influence voters in the race for the White House. The Biden administration last month seized more than two dozen Kremlin-run fake websites and charged two Russian state media employees in a scheme to covertly fund right-wing influencers. Last week, three Iranian operatives were charged with hacking the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Intelligence agencies and tech companies have tracked both Russian and Iranian actors using fake websites and social media profiles to spread misinformation, stoke division and potentially sway American voters. Iran and Russia have sought to influence past U.S. elections through online disinformation and hacking. Easterly noted that China also was 'very interested' in influencing the 2024 election. Beyond the influence campaigns, she said her agency had not detected any activity targeting election systems. 'We have not seen specific cyber activity designed to interfere with actual election infrastructure or processes,' Easterly said. The prevalence of election misinformation has become a widespread concern. One consequence is what Easterly described as a troubling uptick in physical threats against election officials of both parties and, in some cases, their families, often based on false claims about the 2020 election. She called it 'corrosive' to democracy and said it's something the public needs to collectively fight. 'Those election officials, they are not faceless bureaucrats,' Easterly said. 'They're folks we see in the community every single day. And they're not doing this for pay. They're not doing it for glory. They are doing it because they believe in the process of democracy.' Many secretaries of state and some larger local election offices have established specific efforts to combat the misinformation. U.S. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, a Democrat who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee, last week wrote a letter to Easterly that urged the agency to take further steps against election misinformation and disinformation, including coordinating with social media platforms to combat false claims. In the interview, Easterly acknowledged 'a very convoluted, very confusing information environment,' and said her agency works with election officials to promote accurate information. However, she also made it clear that her agency does not monitor social media sites or attempt to moderate their content. 'That is not our role,' she said. On the heels of Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance, accusing the federal government of 'censorship' in Tuesday night's debate between the vice presidential candidates, Easterly strongly defended her agency, known as CISA. 'CISA does not censor, has never censored,' she said. 'And allegations against CISA are riddled with factual inaccuracies.' CISA, along with other federal agencies, was part of a lawsuit filed by Republican-led states claiming the federal government had applied 'unrelenting pressure' to coerce changes in online content on social media platforms. In a 6-3 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court said the states did not have a legal right to sue. Easterly encouraged voters who question how elections are run to contact their local election office and even volunteer to serve as poll workers so they understand the process and the safeguards already in place. She also warned that foreign adversaries almost certainly will seek to take advantage of the vote-counting process after Election Day as a way to undermine confidence in the results. She urged voters to be patient, emphasizing that it could take several days for a presidential winner to be determined. 'We need to come together as Americans to protect and preserve what is most precious,' she said. 'And that is the foundation of our democracy — fair, free, safe and secure elections.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/cybersecurity-head-says-there-s-no-chance-a-foreign-adversary-can-change-us-election-results/7808641.html	2024-10-02T18:16:12-07:00	
US bans new types of goods from China over allegations of forced labor	washington — The Department of Homeland Security announced Wednesday that it would ban the import of goods from a Chinese steel manufacturer and a Chinese maker of artificial sweetener, accusing both of being involved in the use of forced labor from China's far-west region of Xinjiang. The action broadens the scope of the U.S. effort to stop products from entering the country that the government says are tied to human rights abuses. The additions to the entity list under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act marked the first time a China-based steel company or aspartame sweetener business had been targeted by U.S. law enforcement, DHS said. 'Today's actions reaffirm our commitment to eliminating forced labor from U.S. supply chains and upholding our values of human rights for all,' said Robert Silvers, undersecretary of homeland security for policy. 'No sector is off-limits. We will continue to identify entities across industries and hold accountable those who seek to profit from exploitation and abuse.' The federal law that President Joe Biden signed at the end of 2021 followed allegations of human rights abuses by Beijing against members of the ethnic Uyghur group and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. The Chinese government has rejected the claims as lies and has defended its practice and policy in Xinjiang as fighting terror and ensuring stability. The new approach marked a shift in the U.S. trade relationship with China to increasingly take into account national security and human rights. Beijing has accused the U.S. of using human rights as a pretext to suppress China's economic growth. Enforcement of the law initially targeted solar products, tomatoes, cotton and apparel, but over the last several months, the U.S. government has identified new sectors for enforcement, including aluminum and seafood. 'That's just a reflection of the fact that, sadly, forced labor continues to taint all too many supply chains,' Silvers told a trade group in June when marking the two-year anniversary of the creation of the entity list. 'So our enforcement net has actually been quite wide from an industry-sector perspective.' He said the law 'changed the dynamic in terms of putting the onus on importers to know their own supply chains' and that its enforcement had shown that the U.S. could 'do the right thing' without halting normal trade. Since June 2022, the entity list has grown to 75 companies accused of using forced labor in Xinjiang or sourcing materials tied to that forced labor, Homeland Security said. Baowu Group Xinjiang Bayi Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. and Changzhou Guanghui Food Ingredients Co. Ltd. were the Chinese companies newly added to the list.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-bans-new-types-of-goods-from-china-over-allegations-of-forced-labor-/7808643.html	2024-10-02T18:12:18-07:00	
Army returns remains of 9 Indigenous children who died at boarding school over a century ago	Carlisle, Pa. — The remains of nine more Native American children who died at a notorious government-run boarding school in Pennsylvania over a century ago were disinterred from a small Army cemetery and returned to families, authorities said Wednesday. The remains were buried on the grounds of the Carlisle Barracks, home of the U.S. Army War College. The children attended the former Carlisle Indian Industrial School, where thousands of Indigenous children were taken from their families and forced to assimilate to white society as a matter of U.S. policy. The Office of Army Cemeteries said it concluded the remains of nine children found in the graves were 'biologically consistent' with information contained in their student and burial records. The remains were transferred to the children's families. Most have already been reburied on Native lands, Army officials said Wednesday. Workers also disinterred a grave thought to have belonged to a Wichita tribe child named Alfred Charko, but the remains weren't consistent with those of a 15-year-old boy, the Army said. The remains were reburied in the same grave, and the grave was marked unknown. Army officials said they would try to locate Alfred's gravesite. 'The Army team extends our deepest condolences to the Wichita and Affiliated Tribe,' Karen Durham-Aguilera, executive director of the Office of Army Cemeteries, said in a statement. 'The Army is committed to seeking all resources that could lead us to more information on where Alfred may be located and to help us identify and return the unknown children in the Carlisle Barracks Post Cemetery.' The nine children whose remains were returned were identified Wednesday as Fanny Chargingshield, James Cornman and Samuel Flying Horse, from the Oglala Sioux Tribe; Almeda Heavy Hair, Bishop L. Shield and John Bull, from the Gros Ventre Tribe of the Fort Belknap Indian Community; Kati Rosskidwits, from the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes; Albert Mekko, from the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma; and William Norkok, from the Eastern Shoshone Tribe. The Army declined to release details on one grave disinterment, saying the tribe asked for privacy. More than 10,000 children from more than 140 tribes passed through the school between 1879 and 1918, including Olympian Jim Thorpe. Founded by an Army officer, the school cut their braids, dressed them in military-style uniforms, punished them for speaking their native languages and gave them European names. The children — often taken against the will of their parents — endured harsh conditions that sometimes led to death from tuberculosis and other diseases. The remains of some of those who died were returned to their tribes. The rest are buried in Carlisle.	https://www.voanews.com/a/army-returns-remains-of-9-indigenous-children-who-died-at-boarding-school-over-a-century-ago/7808636.html	2024-10-02T17:55:36-07:00	
Candidates clash over immigration, TPS at vice presidential debate	washington — It came as no surprise that one of the tensest moments in Tuesday night's vice presidential debate between Democratic Governor Tim Walz and Republican Senator JD Vance was over immigration, one of the most divisive issues in America. Debate moderators muted Vance's microphone after he claimed that 'millions of illegal immigrants' had overwhelmed American cities, including Springfield, Ohio, where many Haitians have been encouraged to find jobs. When Walz joined in, both candidates' microphones were muted, and the moderators reminded them the audience couldn't hear them. Hundreds of thousands of Haitian immigrants, including those who live in Springfield, hold Temporary Protected Status, known as TPS, or other forms of legal protection, such as humanitarian parole. 'These are people who have a lawful status. They have a lawful presence. They have work authorization,' Sarang Sekhavat, chief of staff at the Massachusetts Immigrant & Refugee Advocacy Coalition, told VOA. What is TPS? Congress established TPS in 1990 when it said migrants whose home countries were considered unsafe could live and work in the U.S. temporarily if they met certain requirements established by the U.S. government. The secretary of homeland security is responsible for designating a foreign country for Temporary Protected Status. Currently, 16 countries have TPS designations: Afghanistan, Cameroon, El Salvador, Haiti, Ethiopia, Honduras, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela and Yemen. 'Usually what happens is the administration will designate a country for TPS because of some kind of catastrophe. It could be a natural disaster ... very often it's used in times of war,' Sekhavat said. 'Basically, the idea is recognizing that, 'OK, this individual here perhaps doesn't have permission to be here, but it would be inhumane of us to actually send them back home to their home country under the conditions their country is suffering right now.' ' TPS and legal immigration Tom Jawetz, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, told VOA that people covered by TPS should not be confused with undocumented immigrants. 'It's an immigration status that people can have the statutory right to travel on,' he said. 'In order to get TPS, people file an application. That application is reviewed individually. It's adjudicated. They get identification materials attesting to their TPS. Get work authorization by statute. So, these are not individuals who are undocumented by any means.' Haitian immigrants and TPS Haitian nationals were first given TPS in 2010 after a devastating earthquake struck Haiti, killing more than 100,000 people and overwhelming the government. This protection was renewed several times during the administration of former President Barack Obama and was extended for six months under former President Donald Trump. Trump decided to end TPS for Haitians in 2019, but this decision faced several legal challenges that lasted until the end of his administration. Who can apply for TPS? Protections under TPS are reserved for people who are already in the United States at the time of the designation. To be eligible, a person must be a national of a designated TPS country and have been continuously physically present in the United States since the date specified by the U.S. government. For Haitian immigrants, this date was August 4, 2024. People must apply during the registration period. For Haitians applying for the first time, this period began July 1, 2024, and runs through February 3, 2026. For those renewing their TPS status, the re-registration period began July 1, 2024, and ran through August 30, 2024. 'For example, when we had the earthquake in Haiti, there were many Haitians who came to the U.S. on valid transit or tourist visas, intending for their stay to be temporary. But due to the situation in Haiti, they couldn't return, making them eligible to apply for TPS,' Sekhavat said. Filing for TPS can cost about $545. TPS and US citizenship TPS alone does not lead to U.S. permanent residence or citizenship unless the applicant seeks to change status through other immigration processes. 'If you don't have some other means through which to get permanent residence — whether that's because you qualify for asylum or you have a family member or an employer who is petitioning for you to get a permanent residence — TPS is not going to get you there,' Jawetz said. But TPS allows a person to legally work, and it can open a pathway to an employment-based green card — a process immigration experts say can be long and complicated. TPS ineligibility An applicant is ineligible for TPS if convicted of a felony or two or more misdemeanors in the United States, or if subject to mandatory restrictions for asylum, such as having taken part in the persecution of someone else or having engaged in terrorist activities. People are also ineligible if they do not meet the requirements for continuous physical presence and residency in the United States, fail to register for TPS on time, or do not re-register for TPS when required without a good reason. Travel authorization for TPS holders TPS holders must request travel authorization to leave the U.S. Applicants must show U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services that they need to travel for urgent humanitarian reasons, such as a sick relative. If permission for the TPS holder to travel is requested by a nonprofit organization, it must prove the travel will further social and cultural interests of the United States. The current filing fee is $575. If a TPS holder leaves the United States without first obtaining travel authorization, the person may lose the TPS status and will not be able to reenter the United States. Can an administration end TPS at any time? The secretary of homeland security has to review conditions and decide whether conditions on the ground in a country continue to merit TPS. Only if the secretary concludes that conditions do not merit a continuation of TPS can the secretary issue a determination ending temporary protected status at that point.	https://www.voanews.com/a/walz-and-vance-clash-over-tps-immigration-issues-at-vp-presidential-debate-/7808328.html	2024-10-02T17:50:10-07:00	
Israel-Iran escalation heightens fears of widening war, direct US involvement	WASHINGTON — Since the start of Israel's war with Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza in October 2023, President Joe Biden has warned the U.S. ally against widening the conflict with Tehran's other proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, and with Iran itself. Many fear that moment has come. In the past 10 days, Israel has unleashed an air campaign on Lebanon, striking over 3,600 Hezbollah-linked targets, according to Israel Defense Forces statements. On Tuesday, Israel launched what it called a limited ground offensive into southern Lebanon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also vowed retaliation for Tehran's launching of 180 missiles toward Israel on Tuesday, an attack that damaged a school in the Israeli city of Hod Hasharon and killed at least one person in the West Bank. Meanwhile, in Damascus, Syrian state media said that three civilians had been killed in Israeli strikes Tuesday. More strikes were reported in the Syrian capital on Wednesday. Biden said his administration was giving Israel 'advice' and urging it to respond proportionally. He told reporters Wednesday that he had discussed the matter with leaders of the Group of Seven and that he might speak with Netanyahu 'relatively soon.' 'We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, but they — every — all seven of us [G7 leaders] agree that they have a right to respond, but they should respond in proportion,' he told reporters. Netanyahu has threatened retaliation beyond Iran, to countries where Tehran's proxies are located. 'We fight the axis of evil everywhere,' he said Tuesday. 'This is true for Judea and Samaria [West Bank]. It is true for Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria. And it is also true for Iran.' Iran has for years used its proxies — Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Houthis in Yemen — to attack Israel. It launched its first direct attack with a barrage of missiles and drones on Israeli soil in April, two weeks after Israel's deadly strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria. At that time, Israel's retaliatory attack against Tehran was measured, and as many analysts point out, calibrated to stop the escalation. They predict Israel will respond more strongly this time, possibly targeting Iranian nuclear or oil facilities. When asked, Biden said he would not support any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites. He said more G7 sanctions would be imposed on Tehran. Tehran said its barrage of missiles Tuesday was in retaliation for Israel's recent killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and an Iranian military commander. Fears US will be dragged into war Washington fears further escalation could drag the United States directly into war should Iran retaliate again against Israel, especially if it hits American interests. 'That could mean attacking oil-producing facilities in Saudi Arabia,' said Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. negotiator for the Middle East who is now with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'That could mean empowering pro-Iranian groups in Iraq and Syria to attack American forces.' 'And yes, it could provide an avenue, a pathway, for the United States to get into this war,' he told VOA. With the largest military presence in the region compared with other external actors, the U.S. is already indirectly involved. Two U.S. Navy destroyers deployed to the eastern Mediterranean, the USS Bulkeley and USS Cole, joined Israeli air defense units Tuesday in firing about a dozen interceptors to shoot down inbound Iranian missiles, said Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei blamed the U.S. and European countries for the wars in the Middle East. 'If they rid the region of their presence, no doubt these conflicts, wars and clashes will completely go away,' he said. The White House has not responded to VOA's requests for comment on Khamenei's remarks. Containing the conflict It is unclear whether Biden will use offensive capabilities to strike Iran directly. What's clear is that despite calls for a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon, Washington has not succeeded in containing the conflict. 'The key drivers of events in the Middle East today are the players that are engaged in these combat operations,' said Brian Katulis, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. 'It's Israel, it's Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and it's Iran and its networks across the region, including the Houthis in Yemen.' Washington has been largely operating 'as a bystander,' trying to prevent the worst outcomes, Katulis said. The administration's approach has been 'largely reactive, tactical crisis management,' he added. Biden has so far refused to condition military aid to Israel — his biggest leverage in pressuring the country to agree to a cease-fire. He and others in his administration frequently underscore that they support Israel's right to defend itself. It's 'almost inconceivable now' that Biden would restrict military assistance to Israel, Miller said. In any case, he said, U.S. pressure is unlikely to have an impact. Over the past weeks, Hezbollah's capacity as an organized military force has been degraded. And having been pummeled for almost a year by Israel's campaign, Hamas no longer stands as an organized military structure. 'The Israelis are determined with this momentum to break with what the Iranians and the axis of resistance called the ring of fire,' Miller said, referring to Tehran's strategy of surrounding Israel with its proxies. Even if Israel succeeds, Miller said he is skeptical that it can turn its military victories into political agreements that would lead to peace. Miller grimly predicted that the three wars of attrition between Israel and Hamas, Israel and Hezbollah, and Israel and Iran will continue, albeit with less intensity.

Far-right gains in Europe drive debate on migration, Ukraine aid	London — A surge in support for far-right parties in Europe is driving calls for a toughening of migration laws, while also raising questions over the future of military aid to Ukraine. Austria's Freedom Party, which was founded by former Nazis after World War II, is the latest European far-right party to score a shocking win, taking just under 29% of the vote in Sunday’s parliamentary election, ahead of the second-place People’s Party with 26.3%. ‘Fortress Austria’ The Freedom Party, led by Herbert Kickl, campaigned on a platform of ending migration by creating what it called 'Fortress Austria,' carrying out the 'remigration of uninvited foreigners' and suspending the right to asylum. The party also opposes military aid for Ukraine and wants to end sanctions on Russia. Kickl successfully appealed to voters’ frustrations over recent years, said Austrian pollster and political analyst, Peter Hajek. 'Elections are won in those four and a half years before, by taking a position which is clearly distinguishable and good from the point of view of the target audiences,' Hajek told The Associated Press. 'And quite simply that’s what the Freedom Party managed to do with two big topics: on the one hand migration, and on the other — still — the coronavirus.' Far-right success Far-right, anti-immigration parties have won parliamentary elections in the Netherlands in 2023, Italy and Hungary in 2022, a state election in Germany in last month and the European parliamentary elections in France in June. Hans Kundnani, an adjunct professor at New York University and the author of the book Eurowhiteness, said centrist parties in Europe are alarmed by the rise of the far right. 'Another election in Europe, another far right success. The response of the center-right in Europe to that has been to say we have to get even tougher on immigration. The center right has increasingly been mimicking far right parties, especially far right ideas on these questions around identity and immigration and Islam,' Kundnani told VOA. EU summit Immigration is likely to top the agenda at an EU summit on October 17, as European leaders from across the political spectrum have called for a toughening of asylum laws amid growing domestic political pressures. 'A shift in the EU towards thinking much more in terms of a ‘Fortress Europe’ — that's building a wall essentially around the EU,' Kundnani said. The hardening of attitudes marks a sharp turnaround from 2015 when more than 1 million irregular migrants entered the EU, many of them destined for Germany. In 2023, the number had fallen by 75%, to 280,000 people. The 27-member bloc has agreed to a new pact on asylum and migration, due to come into force in 2026. It’s unlikely to calm Europe’s debate on immigration any time soon, according to Raphael Bossong, a migration expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. 'This package that has been agreed upon is about 10 laws. Multiple investments are needed across 27 member states, and an implementation plan with 10 sectors of implementation,' he told VOA. 'So it’s a lot of stuff. And to get that into place to really work as a system, as it's intended, is — even in two years — highly ambitious.' Ukraine While strong opposition to immigration unites Europe’s far-right parties, they are divided over support for Ukraine following Russia’s 2022 invasion. Austria’s Freedom Party, the Alternative for Germany party and Hungary’s Fidesz party under Viktor Orban all oppose military aid for Kyiv and want to end sanctions on Moscow. Yet other European far-right parties, such as the ruling Brothers of Italy party under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Poland’s Law and Justice party — which was in power until last year — are strongly pro-Ukrainian. The issue is clouding European politics, argues analyst Hans Kundnani of New York University. 'Precisely what divides these two groups of far-right parties to a large extent is the question of Russia and Ukraine,' Kundnani said. 'If you're on the far right but you're pro-Ukrainian, then I think a lot of European centrists have no problem with that. And they're willing to turn a blind eye to almost anything else that these far-right parties do, especially on questions like immigration.' Much of European Union foreign policy, including aid for Ukraine, requires a unanimous vote from all 27 members, making it easy for individual governments to veto EU decisions. Hungary’s Viktor Orban has repeatedly blocked EU aid packages for Ukraine. Coalition talks Despite its shocking victory, Austria’s Freedom Party is still well short of a majority. Rival parties are refusing to join them in government and could form their own coalition. The tactic has been used by other more centrist parties in Europe to keep the far-right from power — with mixed results, said Kundnani. 'They form these incoherent coalitions in response to the rise of the far right,' he told VOA. 'Those coalitions then aren't really able to do very much or offer citizens very much, which further empowers the far right. So it just gets worse and worse.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/far-right-gains-in-europe-drive-debate-on-migration-ukraine-aid-/7808290.html	2024-10-02T15:45:56-07:00	
Far-right gains in Europe drive debate on migration, Ukraine aid	Europe looks set to toughen migration laws amid a surge in support for far-right parties across the continent.

US prosecutors show new details of Trump's bid to overturn election loss	WASHINGTON — U.S. prosecutors said Donald Trump was acting outside the scope of his duties as president when he pressured state officials and then-Vice President Mike Pence to try to overturn his 2020 election defeat, in a court filing made public on Wednesday. The 165-page filing is likely the last opportunity for prosecutors to detail their case against Trump before the Nov. 5 election given there will not be a trial before Trump faces Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. The filing is meant to keep the federal criminal election subversion case against the Republican presidential candidate moving forward following a July U.S. Supreme Court ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for their official actions in office. Prosecutors working with Special Counsel Jack Smith laid out a sweeping account of Trump's conduct following the 2020 election, much of which has already been made public through news reports, findings from the House committee that investigated the Capitol riot or the indictment obtained by Smith in the case. It includes an allegation that a White House staffer heard Trump tell family members that 'it doesn't matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell.' Trump has pleaded not guilty to four criminal charges accusing him of a conspiracy to obstruct the congressional certification of the election, defraud the U.S. out of accurate results and interfere with Americans’ voting rights. Much of the filing focuses on Trump's dealings with then-vice president and running mate Mike Pence, who Trump tried to pressure into using his official role overseeing Congress's Jan. 6, 2021, certification of the election results to overturn his defeat. Trump gave a fiery speech that day before his supporters stormed the Capitol, battling police, sending lawmakers running for their lives and chanting 'hang Mike Pence.' Prosecutors allege that when a White House aide told Trump, who was watching news coverage of the riot on TV, that Pence had been taken to a secure location, Trump responded, 'So what?' Prosecutors said they did not plan to use that interaction at trial given the Supreme Court's immunity ruling. A warning to Pence It also alleges that on Jan. 1, 2021, Trump warned Pence that people 'are gonna hate your guts' and 'think you're stupid' if he didn't block certification of Democratic President Joe Biden's win. Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung blasted the disclosures, saying, 'This entire case is a partisan, unconstitutional witch hunt that should be dismissed entirely, together with all of the remaining Democrat hoaxes.' Trump has rejected this case and multiple other criminal prosecutions he faced this year as politically motivated attempts to prevent him from returning to power. The filing presents a detailed narrative of the evidence prosecutors intend to use if the case goes to trial, accusing Trump of plotting even before the election to declare victory prematurely, replacing his campaign legal team when they allegedly would not support allegations of voter fraud and attempting to 'manipulate' Pence into aiding his effort to hold onto power. The filing provides details of conversations with senior officials in Trump’s administration including Pence and White House chief-of-staff Mark Meadows, who appeared before the grand jury during the investigation. Prosecutors submitted the court filing on Thursday, but U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan had to approve proposed redactions before it was made public. Pence was identified by name throughout. The names of many other members of Trump's administration and state officials he targeted are blacked out in the filing, though details of their locations and actions make their likely identities clear. Trump’s lawyers opposed allowing Smith to issue a sweeping court filing laying out their evidence, arguing it would be inappropriate to do so weeks before the election. They have argued the entire case should be tossed out based on the Supreme Court’s ruling. If Trump wins the election, he is likely to direct the Justice Department to drop the charges. Prosecutors also highlighted a Twitter post that Trump sent during the Capitol riot saying Pence 'didn't have the courage to do what should have been done' during the congressional certification of the election. Prosecutors said that post 'was not a message sent to address a matter of public concern and ease unrest; it was the message of an angry candidate upon the realization that he would lose power.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-prosecutors-show-new-details-of-trump-s-bid-to-overturn-election-loss/7808283.html	2024-10-02T15:31:34-07:00	
CIA makes it easier for potential informants to share tips	washington — The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) wants to make it easier — and safer — for people in Iran, China and North Korea to share information with America's premier spy agency. The agency on Wednesday posted online instructions in Korean, Mandarin and Farsi detailing steps that potential informants can take to contact U.S. intelligence officials without putting themselves in danger. The instructions include ways to reach the CIA on its public website or on the darknet, a part of the internet that can only be accessed using special tools designed to hide the user's identity. The CIA posted similar instructions in Russian two years ago following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 'People are trying to reach out to us from around the world and we are offering them instructions for how to do that safely,' the agency said in a statement. 'Our efforts on this front have been successful in Russia, and we want to make sure individuals in other authoritarian regimes know that we're open for business.' The tips, presented in text-only videos and infographics, include using a virtual private network, or VPN, to circumvent internet restrictions and surveillance, and the use of a device that can't easily be traced back to the user. The CIA also urged any potential informants to use private web browsers and to delete their internet history to cover their tracks. The messages in the three languages were posted on Telegram, YouTube, X, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn. Several of those platforms are blocked in China, Iran and Russia but can still be accessed using a VPN. Authoritarian leaders around the world have used the internet as a tool of mass surveillance and as a way to deliver propaganda and disinformation while blocking sites and views deemed unfavorable to the government. China, Russia, North Korea and Iran all block access to American platforms like Facebook, for example, and use web access to control which sources of information users can access. VPNs and other tools offer ways around this censorship and surveillance, but that ability has made them a target. In its instructions to potential sources, the CIA warned its audience to be selective, as their well-being could depend on choosing the right program. 'Use a VPN provider not headquartered in Russia, Iran, or China, or any other country that is considered unfriendly to the United States,' the agency wrote in its instructions for Mandarin users.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cia-makes-it-easier-for-potential-informants-to-share-tips/7808261.html	2024-10-02T14:45:27-07:00

Turnout for local assembly elections in Indian Kashmir sets record	Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir — Election officials in Indian-administered Kashmir are hailing a historically high turnout in elections completed this week as evidence of a commitment to democracy that bodes well for the region’s future. More than 69% of people in Indian-controlled Jammu and Kashmir, or J&K, cast their ballots in Tuesday’s third round of legislative elections, the first local electoral battle in a decade. Round one took place September 18 with a voter turnout of 61.38%, and phase two was September 25 with a voter turnout of 57.31%, according to election officials. Conducted in the three phases, the polling for 40 assembly constituencies — 24 in the Jammu division and 16 in the Kashmir valley — resulted in an overall voter turnout of over 63% in the disputed Himalayan region, organizers said. Wire news reports say results are expected next week. 'These elections have witnessed a significant increase in voter turnout in areas infamous for militancy and boycotting democratic processes,' read a statement issued by the Election Commission of India. 'J&K assembly elections have marked a significant deepening of democracy, which will echo in the pages of history and continue to inspire a democratic spirit of the region for years to come,' said the prepared statement quoting Rajiv Kumar, India’s top elections official. Northern Kashmir’s electoral landscape has traditionally been dominated by two rival political groups, the National Conference, or NC, and Peoples Democratic Party, or PDP. But the 2013 founding of the Awami Ittehad Party, or AIP, which is led by Indian parliamentarian Sheikh Abdul Rashid, popularly known as 'Engineer Rashid,' could alter the electoral battlefield. 'It appears the contest will be between the NC and PDP. However, the situation may change as Engineer Rashid has attracted a massive crowd since his release from Tihar Jail,' Pattan resident Tanveer Najar told VOA. 'It’s possible that the AIP could upset the NC and PDP.' University of Kashmir political scientist Noor Ahmad Baba told VOA all phases of the 2024 local elections saw the largest voter turnout since 1989’s regional armed insurgency against Indian rule. 'People came out in relatively large numbers due to changing political dynamics after special status revocation,' said Baba, referring to India’s 2019 decision to strip the Himalayan region of its semiautonomous status. 'Moreover, there has been no representation for the people during the last six years, so they voted.' Umer Nazir, a resident of the Sumbal area of Bandipora district in northern Kashmir, said he thought the central government had discriminated against the Muslim majority region because of an anti-Muslim agenda. 'We want our own people to lead us,' Nazir told VOA. 'Our properties, our children and much more have been taken from us,' he added. 'To put an end to this torture and seek some relief, I and my family decided to vote.' Political analyst and podcaster Muzamil Maqbool told VOA that election campaigning in recent weeks focused on topics such as the restoration of special status for the area, possible statehood and the release of political prisoners held by India. No 'kingmaker' But, he warned, voting results may not yield major changes. These 'local assembly elections differ from parliamentary elections,' he said, noting that candidates such as Engineer Rashid may not fare as well regionally as their supporters hoped, even though they campaigned impressively. 'Engineer Rashid may win a few seats but he won’t be a kingmaker or a king as he has claimed in several recent interviews,' Maqbool said. 'The support for Engineer Rashid in the recent parliamentary elections was largely based on emotional factors. Many voters believed that their votes would help secure his release from Tihar Jail after spending nearly six years.' Maqbool also said residents were typically thinking about improving their communities when they cast ballots in the local elections. 'People here have understood the importance of voting [now] in these [local assembly] elections, where they could choose a genuine representative, so their rights, especially land rights, and jobs will be safeguarded,' Maqbool said. Meanwhile, regional political parties, along with the main Indian opposition political group, the Indian National Congress, or INC, have said they will continue to lobby the government led by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, to restore statehood for J&K. 'If statehood is not restored, we have no choice but to approach the Supreme Court. We are confident we will win this battle,' said former J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah while revealing the manifesto of his party days before the election. Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi also vowed to protest inside and outside Parliament to pressure the BJP to improve governance in J&K. 'If they don’t restore statehood, we will storm the well of both houses and take to the streets,' Gandhi said during a recent rally in Srinagar. 'This is the first time in Indian history that a state has been downgraded to a union territory. This was done to allow governance by outsiders.'

Investigators in Haiti accuse 3 members of transitional presidential council of corruption	San Juan, Puerto Rico — An anti-corruption agency in Haiti on Wednesday accused three members of the country's transitional presidential council of bribery in a scathing report that threatens to destabilize the country’s fragile political stability. Smith Augustin, Emmanuel Vertilaire and Louis Gerald Gilles are accused of demanding more than $750,000 from the director of the government-owned National Bank of Credit to secure his job, the Unit for Combating Corruption said in its report. Gilles organized a meeting among the council members, the former bank director, Raoul Pascal Pierre-Louis, and Haitian consul Lonick Leandre at the Royal Oasis Hotel in the capital of Port-au-Prince, where the demand was made, the agency said. Leandre also is accused of accepting bribes. After the meeting, Pierre-Louis mentioned the demand to several officials, including Prime Minister Garry Conille and a judge. Unable to come with the more than $750,000, Pierre-Louis proposed instead to arrange loans or lines of credit, according to the report. Authorities said that four lines of credit were soon arranged, three of them up to $20,000 each for the council members accused, and a fourth up to $13,500 for Leandre. The three council members and the bank manager all face criminal charges of bribery and corruption, the anti-corruption unit said. Leandre faces charges of instigating bribe payments. None of them could be reached for comment. The agency also called on the U.S. government to extradite Pierre-Louis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/investigators-in-haiti-accuse-3-members-of-transitional-presidential-council-of-corruption/7808168.html	2024-10-02T13:07:09-07:00	
US, China plan Biden-Xi call in the coming days	WASHINGTON — The United States and China are planning a call between President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping in the coming days, according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity. This call would follow their last conversation in April 2024 and their face-to-face meeting in Woodside, California, in November 2023. After his talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi last Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that both sides 'emphasized the need to maintain open lines of communication' between the Chinese and American leaders. 'We also agreed on the importance of the leaders communicating. And so, I fully anticipate that we’ll see that in the week and months ahead,' said Blinken in New York last week. Ukraine U.S. officials have said that they seek opportunities, whenever possible, to find common ground with China, whether on issues such as fentanyl or discussions on artificial intelligence risks and safety. China's material support for Russia in the war on Ukraine is expected to be a key topic on the U.S. agenda. On Wednesday, Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said the U.S. does not seek to 'contain or constrain China' but wants to ensure an ongoing dialogue and that the competition between the two countries remains 'stable and [does] not trend to conflict.' He also reiterated the U.S. and its allies' growing concern over Chinese firms supplying drones to Moscow, which have significantly bolstered Russia's battlefield capabilities in its war against Ukraine. 'What we've seen over the course of last two years is a reconstitution of the Russian military with a rapidity and determination that frankly surprises us. The level of Russian militarization, its ability to rebuild its tanks, its missiles, UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles], with the assistance of China, support from North Korea, also from Iran. That has been a topic of real anxiety,' said Campbell during an online moderated conversation at the Washington-based think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'Now we're in a situation where Russia is seeking to change the territorial lines of Europe, and the fact that China is backing this so substantially is a topic of real concern,' he said. 75th anniversary This week, China marks 75 years of Communist Party rule. In Beijing, Xi reiterated his party’s plans to 'reunite' China with Taiwan. 'The wheel of history will not be stopped by any individual or any force,' Xi said during a recent reception, without naming specific individuals or governments. He added that it is 'where the greater national interest lies' and 'what the people desire.' Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong's communists took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, or KMT, in a civil war, prompting Chiang and his followers to relocate to the island. In 2000, following Taiwan’s second democratic presidential election, the KMT peacefully transferred power for the first time to the Democratic Progressive Party. While the Chinese Communist Party has never governed Taiwan, it consistently insists that Taiwan must be brought under its rule, by force if necessary. For decades, however, the U.S. has made it clear that its decision to switch diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China — Taiwan’s formal name — to Beijing or the People's Republic of China in 1979 was based on the expectation that 'the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means,' as outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act. Under this act, the U.S. has provided arms to support Taiwan's defense. On Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden approved $567 million in defense assistance for Taiwan, as China intensifies its political and military pressure on the self-ruled democracy. In a statement, Biden announced that he has authorized Blinken 'to direct the drawdown of up to $567 million in defense articles and services of the Department of Defense, and military education and training, to provide assistance to Taiwan.' In Beijing, Chinese officials urged the U.S. to 'stop arming Taiwan in any way.' Lin Jian, spokesperson for the PRC’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters during a Monday briefing that 'no matter how many weapons the United States provides to Taiwan,' it will not shake the Beijing government’s firm determination 'to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-china-plan-biden-xi-call-in-the-coming-days/7808130.html	2024-10-02T12:37:53-07:00

State-run media in Latin America criticize US government, candidates	Madrid — In their coverage of the U.S. presidential election, countries with repressive media such as Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela have taken aim at the American system of government and, to some degree, the candidates themselves. Following the two assassination attempts targeting Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Cuban state-run newspaper Granma ran a headline, 'The guns speak again in the U.S. elections,' an apparent reference to gun violence in the United States. But the newspaper made no mention on its front pages Wednesday of the previous night’s vice presidential debate between Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz in which the two candidates clashed on issues that included gun control. The paper did cover the face-to-face debate last month between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, saying they traded 'low blows.' Overall, Cuban press coverage of the U.S. has not favored either candidate during this election cycle, said William LeoGrande, professor of government at American University in Washington. 'The Cuban press has been very even-handed in coverage of the U.S. elections, mostly offering simple factual accounts of the campaign — no doubt because they will have to deal with whoever wins,' said LeoGrande. 'To the extent that they have offered any critical commentary, it can be summed up as a ‘plague on both your houses,’' he said. LeoGrande noted that one Granma report said, 'There is only one certainty: Whoever wins will be the face invested with the arrogance of the empire with a desire for power.' Cuba has long referred to the U.S. as the 'empire.' To understand how Granma views the U.S. election, VOA emailed its editor, Yailin Orta Rivera, for comment but did not receive a reply before publication. In Nicaragua, ‘hate and criticism’ In Nicaragua, state-controlled media have used reports about the U.S. election as a chance to repeat traditional criticisms of Washington, independent media monitoring groups say. Abigail Hernandez, director of Galeria News and a member of the Independent Journalists and Communications of Nicaragua, said state media such as La Nueva Radio Ya have run reports critical of the American political system. 'These analysis reports concentrate on the judicial and electoral system of the U.S. and criticize the candidacy of Trump,' she told VOA. 'I say ‘analysis’ because in reality, these articles are the traditional line of hate and criticism toward the U.S. empire.' Hernandez added, 'They try to say that the U.S. is a sham democracy and that the elections are a reflection of this.' The government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega did not respond to an emailed request for comment before publication. In Nicaragua, state media are controlled by Ortega or members of his family, independent media monitoring groups said. In 2010, Canal 8, which had been an independent television network, had a new chief executive — Juan Carlos Ortega Murillo — the president’s son. Until then, the channel had been known for scrutinizing governments of the left or right, the Reuters news agency reported. Its new owner is the wife of Rafael Ortega Murillo, another of the president’s sons. Media analysts say that in Nicaragua and Venezuela, reports on the U.S. election criticized the U.S. political system in relation to key issues of interest to their core audiences, especially migration. Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans desperate to escape the Ortega government have headed north, seeking to cross into the United States. Earlier this year, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Nicaragua over issues related to migrant smuggling and human rights. Venezuela, US in tense relationship Venezuela’s government has also had a tense relationship with the United States over human rights and the conduct of elections. Driven by political turmoil, 7.7 million people have left Venezuela since 2014, according to a United Nations report published earlier this year. Most have headed for other Latin American countries or Spain. Others have ended up in the United States illegally, although there have been efforts to allow some Venezuelans into the U.S. lawfully, the U.N. report said. Marivi Marin Vazquez, founder and director of ProboxVE, a nongovernmental organization that studies disinformation in Latin America, said state media in Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela all used reports about the U.S. elections to criticize the American political system. 'They all look at problems in the political system so they can justify their own systems,' she said in an interview with VOA from Washington, where she has lived in exile since leaving Venezuela four years ago. 'They pick holes in things like contradictions, inequality and the power of corporate interests.' The Venezuelan government did not respond to emailed requests for comment on coverage of the U.S. election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/state-run-media-in-latin-america-criticize-us-government-candidates/7807974.html	2024-10-02T11:22:30-07:00

Israel strike on Syria capital kills three, war monitor says	Beirut, Lebanon — An Israeli airstrike killed three people Wednesday in Damascus, a monitor said, in the second strike in as many days on a neighborhood that is home to security headquarters and embassies. 'An Israeli airstrike targeted a flat in a residential building in the Mazzeh neighborhood frequented by Hezbollah leaders and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards,' the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It killed at least three people, two of them foreigners, the monitor said. State news agency SANA quoted a military source as saying that 'the Israeli enemy launched an air strike... targeting one of the residential buildings in the Mazzeh neighborhood.' That source said three civilians were killed and three wounded. Wednesday's strike hit around 500 meters from Tuesday's strike. The Observatory said the earlier strike killed six people — three civilians, including a television anchor, and three Iran-backed fighters, one of them from Hezbollah. Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria since the country's civil war erupted in 2011, mainly targeting army positions and Iran-backed fighters, including those of Hezbollah. Israeli authorities rarely comment on individual strikes but have said repeatedly they will not allow archenemy Iran to expand its presence in Syria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-strike-on-syria-capital-kills-three-war-monitor-says/7807887.html	2024-10-02T10:08:18-07:00

4 Russian journalists accused of working for Navalny group go on trial	TALLINN, Estonia — Four Russian journalists went on trial in Moscow on Wednesday after being accused of working for an anti-corruption group founded by the late Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny, which was designated by authorities as an extremist organization in 2021. Antonina Favorskaya, Artyom Kriger, Sergey Karelin and Konstantin Gabov were arrested earlier this year and charged with involvement with an extremist group, a criminal offense punishable by up to six years in prison. All four have rejected the charges. The trial, which is being held behind closed doors, is the latest step in the Kremlin's unrelenting crackdown on dissent that has reached unprecedented levels after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. The authorities have targeted opposition figures, independent journalists, rights activists and ordinary Russians critical of the Kremlin with criminal and misdemeanor charges, jailing hundreds and prompting thousands to leave the country, fearing prosecution. The four journalists were accused of working with Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption, which was designated as extremist and outlawed by the Russian authorities in 2021. That designation has been widely seen as politically motivated. Navalny was President Vladimir Putin's fiercest and most prominent foe and relentlessly campaigned against official corruption in Russia. In February, Navalny died in a remote Arctic prison while serving a 19-year sentence on a number of charges, including running an extremist group, which he had rejected as politically driven. Favorskaya and Kriger worked with SotaVision, an independent Russian news outlet that covers protests and political trials. Gabov is a freelance producer who has worked for multiple organizations, including Reuters. Karelin is a freelance video journalist who has done work for Western media outlets, including The Associated Press. As they were led into the courtroom on Wednesday, a crowd of supporters greeted them with applause. In the courtroom, the four smiled at their loved ones from a glass defendant's cage. Addressing reporters from behind the glass, Kriger cast the case against him and his fellow journalists as a cautionary tale and urged journalists still in Russia to leave the country: 'It is not a joke. Any person can be charged with anything.' Favorskaya, in turn, spoke about hope: 'Everything that is happening now, the darkness that surrounds us, it is not forever, and we will definitely see the country that Alexei [Navalny] dreamed of, we will definitely live in a country where rights and freedoms will be [respected] and journalists and other people will not be jailed for their views.' Shortly after the hearing began, the judge ordered that the proceedings be held behind closed doors upon a request from the prosecution, even though the defense objected to it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-journalists-accused-of-working-for-navalny-group-go-on-trial/7807809.html	2024-10-02T09:06:02-07:00	
Russian authorities systematically torture Ukrainian POWs, UN says	Geneva — Russian authorities have subjected hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war to 'widespread and systematic torture' while supervisors in detention facilities aware of that treatment did nothing to stop the abuse, according to a report published by the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. 'We have interviewed 174 Ukrainian prisoners of war, and this includes five medics since March of last year, and almost every single one provided credible and reliable and detailed accounts of torture and severe ill-treatment,' Danielle Bell, head of the U.N. human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, told journalists in Geneva. Speaking Tuesday via video link from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, Bell said the POWs described 'severe beatings, electric shocks, sleep deprivation, dog bites, mock executions' and other threatening and degrading treatment. She said 68% of the POWs reported that 'sexual violence, torture and ill treatment occurs at all stages of captivity under appalling internment conditions' across multiple facilities in the occupied territory and the Russian Federation. She said the routine nature of the abuse, which occurred on a daily or weekly basis and continued throughout the period of internment — sometimes as long as up to three years — 'indicated knowledge of faculty supervisors.' 'When external officials of the Russian Federation visited internment sites, in many instances, the torture and ill treatment temporarily ceased and conditions improved, indicating that those responsible for these facilities were aware of the mistreatment,' she said. 'Russian public figures have openly called for the inhumane treatment and execution of Ukrainian POWs,' she said, adding that 'these factors, combined with the adoption of broad amnesty laws for Russian service persons, have contributed to a climate of impunity.' The United Nations report, which describes conditions of detention as poor, 'with most POWs reporting food shortages, lack of medical care, overcrowding and poor hygienic conditions,' says 10 Ukrainian POWs have died due to 'torture, lack of medical care and dire health conditions.' Of the 205 Russian POWs interviewed since March 2023, the report says 104 were subjected to torture or ill-treatment by Ukrainian authorities 'during the initial stages of their captivity,' including severe beatings, threats of death and physical violence. 'However, in nearly all cases, torture and ill-treatment stopped when prisoners arrived at official places of internment, where conditions appeared generally compliant with international standards,' it says. Bell underlined differences in the scope and scale of the treatment meted out to Ukrainian and Russian POWs by their captors. She observed that the torture or ill treatment of the Russian POWs by Ukrainian authorities takes place during their initial capture, in the early days. She said these practices stop and the captives 'are safe once they are inside the internment facilities,' whereas the abusive treatment of Ukrainian POWs in Russian detention centers 'happens throughout the duration of their internment.' Bell attributes the better treatment of Russian POWs in large part to the monitors having unrestricted access to Ukrainian sites where they are held, noting that U.N. officials are 'able to carry out a very open dialogue with Ukrainian authorities on where to make improvements.' She added, however, that the mission cannot look out for the welfare of Ukrainian POWs because it does not have access to them in the Russian Federation, 'though we have been asking for access for a long time.' Other human rights developments Besides delving into the torture experienced by POWs since Russian armed forces’ full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the 30-page U.N. report also covers key human rights developments in the country from June 1 to August 31, 2024. The report finds civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure have increased significantly during that period, noting that 589 civilians have been killed and 2,685 injured. That represents 'a 45% increase in casualties on the previous three months' and brings the total number of civilians killed since the start of the war to 11,743, with 24,614 injuries. 'During the reporting period, Russian armed forces continued to target energy infrastructure across Ukraine, affecting essential services and deepening concerns about the plight of the civilian population with winter approaching,' Liz Throssel, spokesperson for the U.N. human rights office, said at the release of the report. She also said intensive military attacks by Russian armed forces against cities across Ukraine such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia 'have damaged and destroyed civilian property and infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and even a geriatric care home.' 'And we have documented even more attacks against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure,' said Throssel. Bell said the Russian Federation has launched nine waves of large-scale, coordinated attacks between March and August targeting Ukraine’s energy generation facilities, primarily thermal, hydroelectric and heating plants. 'The cascading damage from these attacks has affected essential services like electricity, water, heating, sewage and public education,' she said. 'Vulnerable populations — for example, older persons, persons with disabilities, lower income households and children — have been disproportionately affected. 'Rolling blackouts are expected to resume this winter,' she said. 'But let me emphasize, significant efforts are underway to restore Ukraine’s generation capacity and to mitigate the risks of a harsh winter. But this situation is exacerbated by ongoing attacks.' The High Commissioner’s report will be submitted to the U.N. human rights council next week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-authorities-systematically-torture-ukrainian-pows-un-says/7807761.html	2024-10-02T08:46:33-07:00	
Long water, power outages from Helene test patience in Carolinas, Georgia	SWANNANOA, North Carolina — Many residents of the Carolinas still lacked running water, cellphone service and electricity Wednesday as rescuers searched for people unaccounted for after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage across the Southeast and killed at least 166 people. President Joe Biden will survey the devastation in the two states as floodwaters receded and revealed more of the death and destruction left in Helene's path. More than 1.2 million customers still had no power Wednesday in the Carolinas and Georgia, where Helene tore far inland after initial landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast. Some residents cooked food on charcoal grills or hiked to high ground in the hopes of finding a signal to let loved ones know they are alive. 'We have to jump-start this recovery process,' Biden said Tuesday, estimating it will cost billions. 'People are scared to death. This is urgent.' While Biden is in the Carolinas, Vice President Kamala Harris will be in neighboring Georgia. Cadaver dogs and search crews trudged through knee-deep muck and debris in the mountains of western North Carolina looking for more victims. At least 57 people were killed in Buncombe County alone, home to the city of Asheville, a tourism haven known for its art galleries, breweries and outdoor activities. In small Swannanoa, outside Asheville, receding floodwaters revealed cars stacked on top of others and mobile homes that had floated away. Sinkholes pockmarked roads caked with mud and debris. Cliff Stewart survived 2 feet of water that poured into his home, topping the wheels on his wheelchair and sending his medicine bottles floating. Left without electricity and reliant on food drop-offs from friends, he has refused offers to help him leave. 'Where am I going to go?' the Marine Corps veteran said. 'This is all I've got. I just don't want to give it up, because what am I going to do? Be homeless? I'd rather die right here than live homeless.' Across the border in east Tennessee, a caravan including Gov. Bill Lee surveying damage outside the town of Erwin drove by a crew pulling two bodies from the wreckage, a grim reminder that the rescue and recovery operations are still very much ongoing and the death toll is likely to rise. In Augusta, Georgia, Sherry Brown converted power from her car's alternator to keep her refrigerator running. She has been taking 'bird baths' with water collected in coolers. In another part of the city, people waited in line for more than three hours to get water from one of five centers set up to serve more than 200,000 people. What is being done to help? More than 150,000 households have registered for assistance with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and that number is expected to rise rapidly in the coming days, said Frank Matranga, an agency representative. Nearly 2 million ready-to-eat meals and more than a million liters of water have been sent to the hardest-hit areas, he said. The storm unleashed the worst flooding in a century in North Carolina, dumping more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) of rain in places. The administration of Gov. Roy Cooper said Tuesday that more than two dozen water plants remained closed. Active-duty U.S. military units may be needed to assist the long-term recovery, he said, adding that Biden had given 'the green light' to mobilizing military assets soon. A section of one of the region's main arteries, Interstate 40, reopened Tuesday after a mudslide was cleared, but a collapsed stretch near North Carolina's border with Tennessee remained closed. How some of the hardest-hit areas are coping Residents and business owners wore masks and gloves while clearing debris Tuesday in Hot Springs, North Carolina, where almost every building along the main street was heavily damaged. Sarah Calloway, who owns the deli and gourmet grocery Vaste Riviere Provisions, said the storm arrived frighteningly quickly. She helped fill sandbags the night before, but they turned out to be useless. The water rose so rapidly that even though she and others were in an apartment on an upper floor, she feared they would not be safe. They called to request a rescue from a swift water team. 'It was really challenging to watch how quickly it rose up and then just to watch whole buildings floating down the river. It was something I can't even describe,' she said. In the Black Mountain Mobile Home Park in Swannanoa, Carina Ramos and Ezekiel Bianchi were overwhelmed by the damage. The couple, their children and dog fled in the predawn darkness on Friday as the Swannanoa River's rapidly rising waters began flooding the bottom end of the park. By then, trees blocked the roads and the couple abandoned their three vehicles, all of which flooded. 'We left everything because we were panicking,' Ramos said. Mobile service knocked out The widespread damage and outages affecting communications infrastructure left many people without stable access to the internet and cell service. 'People are walking the streets of Canton with their phones up in the air trying to catch a cellphone signal like it's a butterfly,' said Mayor Zeb Smathers, of Canton, North Carolina. 'Every single aspect of this response has been extremely crippled by lack of cellphone communication. The one time we absolutely needed our cellphones to work they failed.' Teams from Verizon worked to repair toppled cell towers and damaged cables and to provide alternative forms of connectivity, the company said in a statement. AT&T said it launched 'one of the largest mobilizations of our disaster recovery assets for emergency connectivity support.' The efforts to restore service were made more challenging by the region's terrain and spread-out population, said David Zumwalt, president and CEO of the Association for Broadband Without Boundaries. Destruction from Florida to Virginia Helene blew ashore in Florida late Thursday as a Category 4 hurricane and upended life throughout the Southeast, with deaths reported in six states: Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, in addition to the Carolinas. With at least 36 killed in South Carolina, Helene passed the 35 people who were killed in the state after Hurricane Hugo made landfall north of Charleston in 1989. When Lee, the Tennessee governor, flew to the eastern part of the state to survey damage Tuesday, residents said the governor and his entourage were the first help they had seen since the storm hit. 'Where has everyone been?' one frustrated local asked. 'We have been here alone.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/long-water-power-outages-from-helene-test-patience-in-carolinas-georgia-/7807699.html	2024-10-02T08:03:51-07:00	
US group helps resettle LGBTQ+ refugees fleeing violence, crackdowns	SAN FRANCISCO, California — Cabrel Ngounou's life in Cameroon quickly unraveled after neighbors caught the teenager with his boyfriend. A crowd surrounded his boyfriend's house and beat him. Ngounou's family learned of the relationship and kicked him out. So Ngounou fled — alone and with little money — on a dangerous, four-year journey through at least five countries. He was sexually assaulted in a Libyan prison, harassed in Tunisia and tried unsuccessfully to take a boat to Europe. 'The worst thing was that they caught us. So, it was not easy for my family,' Ngounou said. 'My sisters told me I need to get out of the house because my place is not there. So that's what really pushed me to leave my country.' Ngounou's troubles drew attention after he joined a protest outside the U.N. refugee agency's Tunisia office. Eventually, he arrived in the United States, landing in San Francisco in March. Ngounou joined a growing number of LGBTQ+ people accepted into the Welcome Corps, which launched last year and pairs groups of Americans with newly arrived refugees. So far, the resettlement program has connected 3,500 sponsors with 1,800 refugees, and many more want to help: 100,000 people have applied to become sponsors. President Joe Biden has sought to rebuild the refugee programs Donald Trump largely dismantled as president, working to streamline the process of screening and placing people in America. New refugee resettlement sites have opened across the country, and on Tuesday, the Biden administration announced that it resettled 100,000 refugees in fiscal year 2024, the largest number in more than three decades. In contrast, Trump has pledged to bar refugees from Gaza, reinstate his Muslim ban and impose 'ideological screening' for all immigrants if he regains the presidency. He and running mate JD Vance are laying groundwork for their goal of deporting millions of illegal immigrants by amplifying false claims, such as the accusation that Haitians given temporary protected status to remain in the U.S. legally are eating pets in Ohio. Under Biden, meanwhile, two human rights officials in the State Department were tasked last year with identifying refugees who face persecution either due to their sexual orientation or human rights advocacy. 'LGBTQ refugees are forced to flee their homes due to persecution and violence, not unlike other people,' said Jeremy Haldeman, deputy executive director of the Community Sponsorship Hub, which implements the Welcome Corps on behalf of the State Department. But they are particularly vulnerable because they're coming from places 'where their identities are criminalized, and they are at risk of imprisonment or even death.' More than 60 countries have passed anti-LGBTQ laws and thousands of people have fled the Middle East and Africa seeking asylum in Europe. In April, Uganda's constitutional court on Wednesday upheld an anti-gay law that allows the death penalty for 'aggravated homosexuality.' 'There are just a lot of people who are really at risk and are not safe in their country, and they're usually not safe in the neighboring or regional countries either,' Kathryn Hampton, senior adviser for U.S. Strategy at Rainbow Railroad, which helps LGBTQ+ people facing persecution. The demand far outstrips capacity: Of more than 15,000 requests for help in 2023, the nonprofit group helped resettle 23 refugees through the Welcome Corps program in cities as large as Houston and towns as small as Arlington, Vermont. It has a goal of resettling 50 this year. 'So, we have a lot of urgency as an organization to find and create new pathways that LGBTQI+ people can access to find safety,' Hampton said. Another refugee in the program, Julieth Luna Garcia, is a transgender woman from El Salvador who settled in Chicago. Speaking through a translator, the 31-year-old Garcia said she suffered abuse from her family because of her trans identity and couldn't legally access gender-affirming care until she arrived in the United States. 'I lived with constant fear, even more so at night. I didn't like to go out. I was really scared that somebody would find me alone and do something,' Garcia said. Since arriving in February, Garcia has found a place to live and a job as a home health aide and hopes to study to become a lawyer. 'Here, I'm not scared to say who I am. I'm not scared to tell anyone,' she said. Maybe the biggest change was starting hormone treatments, she said: 'To see yourself in the mirror and see these changes, I can't really explain it, but it's really big. It's an emotional and exciting thing and something I thought I would never experience.' Welcome Corps sponsors are expected to help refugees adjust for at least three months after they arrive. Garcia said the five volunteers helped her 'adapt to a new life with a little less difficulty,' by accessing benefits, getting a work permit and enrolling in English classes. Ngounou recalled how his sponsors, a team of seven that included a lesbian couple, Anne Raeff and Lori Ostlund, hosted him and connected him with LGBTQ+ resources and a work training program. They also served as his tour guides to gay life, taking him to the historically gay Castro district, where Ngounou got his first glimpse of the huge rainbow Pride flag and stopped to read every plaque honoring famous gay people. 'Cabrel was just very, very moved by that. Just kind of started crying. We all did,' Raeff recalled. 'I know that feeling like when we were young, when you'd go into a gay bar and you'd feel like this sense of kind of freedom, like this community,' she said. 'That was the only place where you could go and actually be open. And that ... this is this community of people, and we all have this in common.' Now the 19-year-old Ngounou works in a coffee shop and takes college courses, with the goal of becoming a social worker. He hopes the boyfriend he met in Tunisia can visit him in San Francisco — and he still finds it hard to believe that they can share their love openly. 'Here I'm really me ... I feel free,' he said. 'I feel free to have my boyfriend and walk with him in the street. I feel free, you know, to enjoy myself with him wherever we want to enjoy ourselves. But in Tunisia or anywhere else, in Cameroon, you have to hide such things.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-group-helps-resettle-lgbtq-refugees-fleeing-violence-crackdowns/7807681.html	2024-10-02T07:37:02-07:00	
Blasts, shooting happen near Israeli embassies in Nordic capitals	Copenhagen — Police in Denmark and Sweden said on Wednesday they were probing explosions and gunfire around Israeli embassies in their capitals that took place amid spiraling Middle East tensions. In Denmark, police said three Swedish nationals had been arrested after two blasts were reported in the 'immediate proximity' of the Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen early Wednesday. Swedish police said the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm had been targeted in a shooting on Tuesday just before 6 p.m. No injuries were reported from the incidents, but both came amid heightened international fears as Iran fired missiles at Israel, which has vowed to respond to the attack. 'Two explosions occurred at 3:20 a.m. at the Israeli Embassy. It is our preliminary assessment that it was due to two hand grenades,' Jens Jespersen of the Copenhagen police said at a press conference. He added that three Swedes between the ages of 15 and 20 had been arrested. The police officer explained that one suspect was arrested shortly after the incident near the crime scene and that the other two had been arrested later. Police said in an earlier statement that two suspects had been arrested on a train at Copenhagen Central Station. 'It's too early to say if there is a link' between the blasts and the Israeli Embassy, Danish police spokesperson Jakob Hansen said of the Copenhagen incidents. By midmorning, the area in Copenhagen was cordoned off and police were working at the scene, an AFP correspondent observed. Denmark's intelligence service, PET, said it was monitoring events 'closely' and assisting the police investigation. 'We are also in dialogue with the Israeli embassy about security, and are constantly assessing the scale of the security measures already implemented in relation to a number of Jewish locations,' PET said in a statement to AFP. Writing on X, Israeli Ambassador to Denmark David Akov said he was 'shocked by the appalling incident near the embassy a few hours ago.' Swedish police said in a statement that information indicated the Israeli Embassy building had been hit by shots on Tuesday evening. 'We've made finds that indicate a shooting at Israel's Embassy, but we don't want to disclose exactly what finds have been made since there is an ongoing investigation,' Rebecca Landberg, Stockholm police press officer, told AFP. Landberg added that an investigation had been opened into an aggravated weapons offense, endangerment of others and unlawful threats. Police had made no arrests, but Landberg said police were actively gathering and analyzing material from the many surveillance cameras in the area. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023, several incidents apparently targeting Israeli interests in Sweden have been reported. In February, police found a grenade in the Israeli Embassy compound grounds, which the ambassador said was an attempted attack. In May, gunshots were fired outside the Israeli Embassy, which prompted Sweden to boost security around Israeli interests and Jewish community institutions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blasts-shooting-happen-around-israeli-embassies-in-nordic-capitals/7807603.html	2024-10-02T06:49:34-07:00	
Unlike past Arab-Israeli conflicts, Arab governments pursue diplomacy while Iran proxies' fight	Amman, Jordan — Arab states like Egypt, Qatar, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have engaged in diplomacy and humanitarian efforts during the year-long Gaza conflict, but those doing the actual fighting against Israel are in fact Iran's Arab proxies or non-state actors, Hamas and Hezbollah. This signals not just a big switch from past Arab-Israeli conflicts, but a growing threat of a wider regional war. Arab governments have struggled to respond to the Gaza crisis. Rami G. Khouri, a non-resident fellow of Washington’s Arab Center writes they have been trying to balance support for Palestinians 'without strengthening Hamas and other Islamist militant allies that most Arab governments see as radicalizing threats.' This, while providing humanitarian aid for suffering Gaza civilians. Lebanese analyst Dania Koleilat Khatib explained the conundrum to VOA. 'Most Arab states, either have formal relations or they have taken the decision not to engage in any fight with Israel. Now the resistance movements have no sponsor. That’s why they go to Iran, why Hamas went to Iran,' she said. Khatib, president of the Research Center for Cooperation and Peace Building in Beirut, said the unresolved Israeli-Palestinian conflict has given non-Arab Iran a way to influence regional politics for its own purposes. 'They’re engaged, and they use the Palestinian issue as an entry door to the Arab community. If you take the Palestine issue aside, what do we have with the Iranians in common? Nothing. Of course, this creates friction. The Arab states are going on one course and these resistance movements are going on another course. The PLO was not Islamist, it was secular. But unless you solve the problem, you will have a problem that hasn’t been solved,' said Khatib. Analyst Nicholas Heras of the New Lines Institute in Washington told VOA that Iran spent years building 'committed proxies' like Hezbollah, Hamas, and others, most of which, he says, are of 'Arab origin,' and that see defeating Israel 'as the culmination of their ideological mission.' This allows Iran not to take on Israel directly. That changed on October 1 with Iran’s biggest missile attack on Israel. Despite Israel’s downgrading of Hezbollah, once considered Iran’s chief defense line, Heras said Hezbollah may be down, but not out. 'On the longer term what Iran most likely will try to do is create a Hezbollah organization that’s younger, more extreme, and transnational in character so as to truly link all the different battlefronts in the region to force the Israelis to have to play a broader regional conflict and to continue to signal to the Americans that if the Americans get involved, it would require them to go to war with Iran,' he said. Heras said that ultimately Iran wants missiles and drones capable of threatening 'Israel in a manner that has never been done before by any Arab state actor in the course of Arab-Israeli conflicts.' 'The Iranians view themselves as the flag bearers of a revolutionary cause that is not Arab. It’s Islamic. The Iranians are hoping that the current conflict in Gaza, with all the difficult images of human suffering and destruction, will inspire a future generation of the Arab and the broader Islamic world, to take up arms against Israel,' he said. Former Mideast Pentagon adviser Yasmine El Gamal told the BBC that Arab and Muslim states have now provided a 'diplomatic offramp' to Israel: their recognition of Israel in exchange for 'the end of the occupation and a two-state solution' to end the Arab Israeli conflict. She and other analysts say the West needs to bring Israel back from the brink of a possible widening conflict. But will that be enough to settle the decades-long animosity between Israel and Iran?	https://www.voanews.com/a/unlike-past-arab-israeli-conflicts-arab-governments-pursue-diplomacy-while-iran-proxies-fight/7807615.html	2024-10-02T06:44:57-07:00

Pope opens new debates on Catholic Church future	Vatican City, Holy See — Pope Francis launched new consultations Wednesday on the future of the Roman Catholic Church, as it faces pressure over the role of women and the ongoing scourge of clerical child abuse. The General Assembly of the Synod, comprising 368 religious and lay people — including women — from around 100 countries, will hold closed-door debates on potential reforms at the Vatican until October 27. The synod had already gathered for a month-long assembly in October 2023, after a three-year worldwide consultation among Catholics organized by Francis to confront challenges facing the 2,000-year-old Church. The 87-year-old Argentine pontiff will have the final say on any doctrinal changes they recommend. Last year, the assembly addressed themes as varied as attitudes to LGBTQ people, polygamy, the ordination of married men and the fight against the sexual abuse of children by priests. Although the body resisted pressure to allow the ordination of female priests, calls continue for more visibility and space for women in an institution still run by men. No decisions are expected any time soon, with the most sensitive issues entrusted to working groups that will deliver their conclusions in June 2025. Francis launched the Assembly with a mass in St Peter's Square, where he urged participants to enter the discussions with an open mind. 'Let us be careful not to see our contributions as points to defend at all costs or agendas to be imposed,' he said. He added that the meeting was 'not a parliamentary assembly, but rather a place of listening in communion.' On Tuesday evening, Francis held a 'penitential' vigil attended by around 2,5000 people in St Peter's Basilica, during which he again asked forgiveness and expressed his 'shame' for the abuse by priests that has overshadowed the Church's work across the world. People at the vigil heard from a South African former choirboy who was assaulted by a priest when he was just 11, and who denounced a lack of transparency and responsibility in and by the Church that he said had shaken the faith of millions of people. 'We are here as beggars of the Father's mercy, asking for forgiveness,' Francis said. 'How could we be credible in our mission if we do not acknowledge our mistakes and stoop to heal the wounds we have caused by our sins?' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-opens-new-debates-on-catholic-church-future-/7807474.html	2024-10-02T04:58:18-07:00	
Weakening Krathon expected to hit land early on Thursday	KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan — Taiwan shut down on Wednesday, grounding hundreds of flights and closing schools, offices and financial markets ahead of the arrival of a weakening Typhoon Krathon with one person reported dead and torrential rain lashing the island's south. Officials in the key port city of Kaohsiung, set to be in the eye of the storm, told people to stay home and avoid the sea, rivers and mountains, warning of a repeat of 1977's Typhoon Thelma that killed 37 and devastated the city of 2.7 million. Although the typhoon has weakened, the threats from a storm surge, strong winds and rain remain as it slowly makes its way towards Taiwan's coast, weather forecasters said. The typhoon would lose power once it hits land, said Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai, but would still bring intense winds and rain. 'But if it moves north, the winds will strengthen again, so the threat to Kaohsiung will continue to exist, and people cannot take this lightly,' he told reporters. Once it hits land, the typhoon could be downgraded into a tropical depression and dissipate, which has happened only once before in Taiwan, in 2001, forecasters said. That storm, called Trami, dumped vast amounts of rain leading to massive flooding. The fire department reported one person dead, an elderly man in the eastern county of Hualien who fell from a tree, with two others missing and 70 injuries. On Wednesday, all the island's cities and counties declared a day off, shutting financial markets .TWII and cancelling domestic flights, along with 246 international ones, while more than 10,000 people were evacuated, mostly in the south and east. Typhoons often hit Taiwan's mountainous and sparsely populated east coast facing the Pacific, but Krathon is set to make landfall on its flat western plain. It is forecast to hit between Kaohsiung and its neighboring city of Tainan in the early hours of Thursday, before heading northeast up towards Taipei, the capital, the Central Weather Administration (CWA) said. 'Because of Typhoon Gaemi being quite severe earlier this year, everyone is more cautious and prepared this time around,' said sales representative Yu Ren-yu, 35, picking up sandbags at a government office, referring to July's storm that killed 11. 'First be prepared, then we can face this typhoon.' The typhoon has revived the older generation's bad memories of Thelma, prompting extra precautions, said Chou Yi-tang, a government official working in the Siaogang district home to the airport. 'We were hit directly by the eyewall,' he added, describing events almost five decades ago. 'Power was out for two weeks and no water for almost a month. It was disastrous.' More than 700 sandbags have been distributed in his district, a record for a typhoon, while authorities are making more to meet demand, Chou said.

VOA EXCUSIVE: AFRICOM Chief on threats, way forward for US military in Africa	Pentagon — U.S. Africa Command chief Gen. Michael Langley is starting to reshape the U.S. military presence on the continent following the U.S. military withdrawal from Niger. Uncertainty about the next phase of the counter-terror fight in West Africa stems from America’s lost access to two critical counter-terror bases in Niger. In the east, international participants and troop numbers for the new African Union Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM) have yet to be finalized less than three months before the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) ends on December 31. In an exclusive interview at the VOA on Thursday, Langley said the Islamic State in Somalia had grown about twofold and explained how al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabab had taken advantage of tensions between Ethiopia and Somalia to increase recruitment. Below are highlights from his discussion with VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb, edited for brevity and clarity: On the growing U.S. partnership with Angola: AFRICOM Chief General Michael Langley: Angola has displayed their leadership across southern Africa … I’m very encouraged by the actions of Angola. With Angola and all the countries across the periphery, you have over 38 countries in Africa that have a shoreline. Economic viability is heavily dependent upon their economic exclusive zones … In the maritime and maritime awareness of some of these countries, we have a number of engagements, whether it be Exercise Obangame Express in Gabon this past summer … We have shared type objectives. They want to be able to stabilize and grow their economy through their fishing industries, but it's hampered by other countries that are going across their economic exclusive economic zones. On Chinese aspirations for a second military base in Africa: Langley: I think they do have, in my best military opinion, aspirations for another military base… We're actively watching. On Russia’s Africa Corps: Langley: As you can see, they're already in Mali. They're already in Burkina Faso and, to some degree, in Niger. They've been in CAR for a while, Central African Republic, and also in Libya. … (Wagner) has transitioned to the Russian MOD and the introduction of the Africa Corps, trying to replicate what we do best in partnering with these countries and trying to say that their security construct is better. It has proven not to be … I don't have particular numbers that they've introduced to Mali, limited numbers in Burkina Faso and also in Libya. It's in the hundreds. I'll just put it that way. It's not extensive just yet. On how the disputes between Ethiopia, Somalia and others in east Africa are affecting the war against al-Shabab: Langley: Well, it comes down to troop-contributing countries: who's going to play and who's going to be a troop contributing country in the transition from ATMIS to AUSSOM, and that starts at the end of the year. The sunset of ATMIS is 31 December, and then AUSSOM is supposed to take effect. The unknowns are who are going to be the troop-contributing countries to the AUSSOM construct…It is not finalized yet. That's the UN, that's the AU and that's the government of Somalia doing that. We're not in those discussions, but it's going to be revealed soon. I hope so. So, in the ATMIS construct, one of the anchor and frontline countries was Ethiopia. So that's what has me concerned. Ethiopia, especially in the South West State and their contributions to the liberation and stabilization, has been valuable … So time will tell if they can settle their differences and coalesce into a force that's very effective, because when they do work together, they're very, very effective at clearing out al-Shabab … There’re limited operations with the Ethiopians at this time.…Al-Shabaab leadership will try to exploit those disagreements and use that as a recruiting mechanism. VOA: We’ve heard that they've had a stronger recruitment because of that situation. Would you agree with that? Langley: Yes, I will agree with that. They have used that to their advantage. On whether U.S. forces may be needed during that transition from ATMIS to AUSSOM to try to supplement security: Langley: That's not what we're there for. We're there … helping President Hassan Mohamud be able to build his army. He's going through the force generation … all of our initiatives and our approach on the African continent, with our African partners, will be Africa-led and U.S.-enabled. So our piece of enabling is not our boots on the ground. We're there to advise and assist, and assist in the training, but the fight is theirs… That's not my mission… President Sheik Mohammed does not ask for our boots on the ground. On June comments from senior U.S. defense officials who told VOA that al-Shabab had reversed Somali National Army gains in central Somalia: Langley: I will say it ebbs and flows…They're still building the Somali National Army. So as they go on offensive operations, it is stress on the force. As they clear and liberate a region, you have to have a credible holding force there so stabilization activities and efforts can initiate and turn the populace and faith in the federal government of Somalia with the services they provide. So that's a very, that's a very fragile period. And if they can't sustain that, because they're moving to the next region or next district, it ebbs. VOA: So that was what was happening in this instance. They couldn't hold the territory that they had gained? Langley: Right. VOA: And that's where your training is coming in, to try to get them ready to be able to hold that territory? Langley: Exactly. It takes time. It’s an investment to build an army … so they have staying power, and they can also close the military and civilian divide, where the local populace will have faith in the federal government of Somalia and the national army that is there trying to hold. On why he’s 'cautiously optimistic' the Somali forces will be successful against al-Shabab: Langley: We are at an inflection point. This is unknown territory … However, when I say I'm consciously optimistic, I'm looking at the whole-of-government effort. ... Every time I go there, stabilization activities are increasing…Yes, we need a credible holding force because sometimes the shadow governments of al-Shabab try to re-insert themselves back in that region and try to influence some of the local leaders … So it goes back and forth to some of these regions, but they're being overridden by some of the stabilization activities that USAID, the biggest contributor, has put forth. On the collaboration between Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militants and al-Shabab: Langley: There’s probably aspirations. That’s something that we're watching closely but, you know, I will stay tight lipped on … We're concerned, and we're closely watching that, because this can turn into a bad neighborhood real quick. This is a strategic choke point on the globe…That's where a lot of our commerce goes through. It could affect our global economy if those waters don't have free flow of commerce… With the Houthis and their actions, and al-Shabab and their actions and (Somali President) HSM trying to keep them from coalescing, that can interdict the free flow of commerce across those waters of the Gulf of Aden, Bab-el-Mandeb, the Red Sea, and through the Suez Canal. On reports Islamic State in Somalia leader Abdulqadir Mumin is now the leader of Islamic State: Langley: We have to take it as credible … As far as who is the overall leader--and ISIS professes that--sometimes you’ve got to take that seriously, because that person may have an act or aspirations or put forth operations that can affect our homeland. So yes, we’ve got to take that seriously. On Islamic State in Somalia’s growth: Langley: I am concerned about the northern part of Somalia and ISIS growing in numbers, and also the possibility of foreign fighters growing there. Oh, wow ... In the past year, it's probably grown, probably twofold. Now, I won't give numbers, but I'd say it's probably, it's more than what it was last year. On whether France, the U.S. and Germany have failed the Sahel: Langley: If we look at the numbers of the global index for terrorism across the Sahel … 40% of those killed across the globe came from the Sahel. So that's concerning. It emanated from, the ideology, I would say, emanated down through Syria, through the Maghreb. Arab Spring contributed to it. The fall of Libya contributed to it. That's how that has grown and metastasized to the numbers you have today…that jihad-type ideology is preying upon the civil society, preying upon the military-aged males. We are engaging with coastal West African countries because as we look at what direction it’s metastasized, it’s on the northern regions of Cote D'Ivoire, Ghana and Togo and Benin. …They understand the enduring solution for terrorism …. it's not about kinetics. So that's why I don't just go see the militaries. I get with USAID, and we sit down with these, with these administrators that go out in the field. On the possibility of southern Libya providing a solution to the U.S. bases challenge in the fight against terror in the Sahel: Langley: We've affected the conversation… I went in and talked to both sides, the GNU and the LNA leadership, but also I want to say that this is very much in the diplomatic realm. …We need to affect unity to move forward. They are at an impasse, a political impasse, because, for us to fully be able to support building their capacity to fight terrorism, anything emanating from the Sahel, we do need them in agreement, in concert, working together as a joint force. But I will tell you, you know, there is another elephant in the room--elephant in that country--and it's the Russian Federation. And so their activities are irrespective of the law of armed conflict, irrespective of rules-based order, irrespective to human rights. So we want to be the preferred partner. We don't tell them to choose. We don't give them ultimatums, but through our actions and whatever we offer in a value proposition that protects human rights, that's mindful of the laws of armed conflict, protects the civil society … both the GNU and LNA understand that, and they have made overtures that they do want to work with us. So we're in the nascent stages, but they need to address the political impasse that they have between the east and the west. And so our State Department is working that effort.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voa-excusive-africom-chief-on-threats-way-forward-for-us-military-in-africa/7807419.html	2024-10-02T04:15:38-07:00	
South Korea's Yoon, Japan's Ishiba agree united response needed against North Korea	SEOUL — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held his first telephone call with Japan's new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Wednesday and agreed a united response together with the United States is needed to counter North Korea's threats, his office said. South Korea last week welcomed Ishiba's election as the head of Japan's ruling party, saying it looked forward to the two countries continuing to improve ties and working together on security and economic issues under his leadership. Yoon told Ishiba during their call the neighbors are important partners who share values and interests and invited him to continue to communicate closely and enhance cooperation, Yoon's office said. 'The two leaders agreed that South Korea and Japan, South Korea, the United States and Japan need to unite to respond to North Korea's continued provocations,' it said. Ishiba, who was confirmed as prime minister on Tuesday, pledged to seek deeper ties with friendly nations to counter the gravest security threats his country has faced since World War Two. Yoon has made it a diplomatic priority to improve ties with Tokyo and build trilateral security cooperation together with the United States by putting years of animosity stemming from Japan's wartime history behind. Ishiba's predecessor Fumio Kishida and Yoon oversaw a newfound partnership after orchestrating an about-face in ties that had sunk to their lowest level in decades before Yoon came to office, prodded by U.S. President Joe Biden.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-yoon-japan-s-ishiba-agree-united-response-needed-against-north-korea-/7807399.html	2024-10-02T03:19:40-07:00

OPEC+ unlikely to change output policy	LONDON/DUBAI — An OPEC+ panel is unlikely this week to recommend any changes to its current deal to reduce production and to start unwinding some cuts from December, despite recent sharp declines in oil prices, five sources from the producer group told Reuters. Top ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, or OPEC+ as the group is known, will hold an online joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting on Wednesday. 'Although the oil market situation is a bit complicated, I do not expect a new decision or any change to the OPEC+ agreement in Wednesday's meeting,' one of the sources said, declining to be identified. Oil prices have fallen in 2024 with Brent crude last month slipping below $70 a barrel for the first time since 2021, pressured by concern about global demand and rising supply outside OPEC+. Brent was trading near $71 on Tuesday. OPEC+ is currently cutting output by a total of 5.86 million barrels per day (bpd), or about 5.7% of global demand, in a series of steps agreed since late 2022. Its latest agreement calls for OPEC+ to raise output by 180,000 bpd in December, part of a plan to gradually unwind its most recent layer of voluntary cuts during 2025. The hike was delayed from October after prices slid. Compliance by countries with cuts will also be in focus at the meeting and in coming weeks, particularly that of Iraq and Kazakhstan which have promised so called compensation cuts of 123,000 bpd in September and more in later months to make up for past over-production. An OPEC+ source told Reuters last week that when it becomes clearer that the compensation cuts are being made in September, this will allow the December increase to go ahead as the net supply addition to the market will be minimal. However, a lack of compliance could prompt Saudi Arabia and others to unwind their cuts faster from December, analysts said. 'If they fail to comply, we can envision a swifter sunsetting of the voluntary cuts,' Helima Croft of RBC Capital said in a report. The JMMC, which groups the oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Russia and other leading producers, usually meets every two months and can make recommendations to change policy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/opec-unlikely-to-change-output-policy/7807381.html	2024-10-02T02:46:42-07:00	
Japan's foreign minister says 'Asian NATO' is an idea for the future	TOKYO — The idea of an 'Asian NATO' floated by Japan's new prime minister is one to consider in the mid- to long-term but not imminent, the new foreign minister, Takeshi Iwaya, said on Wednesday. Asian nations have expressed skepticism and reticence in response to the call from Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took up his post on Tuesday. 'I think it's one idea for the future,' among efforts to create a multi-layered network of like-minded countries and boost regional deterrence, Iwaya told a news conference in Tokyo. 'It's difficult to immediately set up a mechanism that would impose mutual defense obligations in Asia, so it's more of a vision for the future.' In a paper to the Hudson Institute thinktank in September, Ishiba had argued for locking Washington into an 'Asian NATO' as a way to deter China from using military force in Asia. On Tuesday, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar countered that the South Asian country did not share the vision for an 'Asian NATO,' saying it had never been an ally of another country and took a different approach. The United States has also quietly brushed off the idea. It was too early for such talk, Daniel Kritenbrink, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific, said last month. Such a framework would not be aimed at any specific country, Iwaya said when asked at Wednesday's press conference whether it was targeting China. 'The best way would be for a defense and security co-operation relationship that spans the Indo-Pacific without excluding any specific nation,' Iwaya said. The new defense minister, Gen Nakatani, told a separate press conference that Ishiba had not asked his ministry to pursue a proposal to set up an Asian equivalent of NATO.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-foreign-minister-says-asian-nato-is-an-idea-for-the-future/7807372.html	2024-10-02T02:34:42-07:00	
Japan airport shut after likely WWII-era bomb explodes near runway, 87 flights canceled	TOKYO — A regional airport in southwest Japan was closed on Wednesday after a U.S. bombshell, likely dropped during World War Two to stem 'kamikaze' attacks, exploded near its runway, causing nearly 90 flight cancellations. Miyazaki Airport shut its runway after the explosion caused a crater seven meters wide and one meter deep in the middle of the taxiway next to the runway, according to a Japanese transport ministry official. A bomb disposal team from the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force later found that the cause of the explosion was an American bomb that had been buried beneath the land surface, probably dating to a wartime air raid, the official said. No injuries were reported but live cam footage showed an airplane had been taxiing nearby just two minutes before the explosion, according to local broadcaster MRT. The runway shutdown has led to the grounding of 87 flights but there is no danger of any further explosions and repair works to fill the hole should be completed by Thursday morning, said Japan's top government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi. The affected flights were operated by JAL, ANA and other airlines connecting Miyazaki with cities such as Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka, according to the airport website. Located at the southeast end of Kyushu island, Miyazaki airport was formerly a Japanese navy base until the end of World War II, from where hundreds of young 'kamikaze' pilots set off on their final missions, according to the Miyazaki city website. Multiple unexploded bombs previously have been found at Miyazaki airport, the transport ministry official said. More than 79 years since the end of the war, unexploded bombs from the intense airstrikes are still found across Japan today. A total of 2,348 bombs weighing 37.5 tons were disposed of during fiscal year 2023, the Self-Defense Forces have said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-airport-shut-after-likely-wwii-era-bomb-explodes-near-runway-87-flights-canceled/7807370.html	2024-10-02T02:27:58-07:00

Thai police arrest driver, try to identify victims of school bus fire that killed 23	Bangkok — Thai police have arrested the driver of a bus carrying young students and teachers that caught fire and killed 23 in suburban Bangkok, as families arrived in the capital Wednesday to help identify their loved ones. The bus carrying six teachers and 39 students in elementary and junior high school was traveling from Uthai Thani province, about 300 kilometers north of Bangkok, for a school trip in Ayutthaya and Nonthaburi provinces Tuesday. The fire started while the bus was on a highway north of the capital and spread so quickly many were unable to escape. Trairong Phiwpan, head of the police forensic department, said 23 bodies were recovered from the bus. The recovery work and confirmation of the total dead had been delayed earlier because the burned vehicle, which was fueled with natural gas, remained too hot to enter for hours. The families were driven from Uthai Thani in vans to the the forensic department at the Police General Hospital in Bangkok on Wednesday to provide their DNA samples for the identification process. Kornchai Klaiklung, assistant to the Royal Thai Police chief, told reporters the forensics team was working as fast as it could to identify the victims. The driver, identified by the police as Saman Chanput, surrendered Tuesday evening several hours after the fire. Police said they have charged him with reckless driving causing deaths and injuries, failing to stop to help others and failing to report the accident. The driver told investigators he was driving normally until the bus lost balance at its front right tire, hit another car and scraped a concrete highway barrier, causing the sparks that ignited the blaze, Chayanont Meesati, deputy regional police chief, told reporters. The driver said he ran to grab a fire extinguisher from another bus that was traveling for the same trip but he could not put out the fire, and ran away because he panicked, Chayanont said. Police said they are also investigating whether the bus company followed all safety standards. In an interview with public broadcaster Thai PBS, bus company owner Songwit Chinnaboot said the bus was inspected for safety twice a year as required and that the gas cylinders had passed the safety standards. He also said he would compensate the victims’ families as best as he could. Three students are hospitalized, and the hospital said two of them were in serious condition. A 7-year-old girl suffered burns on her face, and a surgeon said doctors were doing their best to try to save her eyesight.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-police-arrest-driver-try-to-identify-victims-of-school-bus-fire-that-killed-23-/7807333.html	2024-10-02T00:07:16-07:00

Danish police investigate two blasts near Israel's embassy in Copenhagen	COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Danish police said on Wednesday they were investigating two blasts in the vicinity of Israel's embassy in the northern outskirts of Copenhagen. 'No one has been injured, and we are carrying out initial investigations at the scene,' Copenhagen police said on social media platform X. 'A possible connection to the Israeli embassy, located in the area, is being investigated,' they said. A large area was cordoned off amid heavy police presence, according to local media reports. Investigators were seen wearing coverall suits as they combed the scene for evidence, tabloid B.T. reported. The Israeli embassy was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters. Police said they will give an update on the investigation in the hours ahead.	https://www.voanews.com/a/danish-police-investigate-two-blasts-near-israel-s-embassy-in-copenhagen/7807329.html	2024-10-01T23:42:10-07:00	
Thousands march in India as doctors resume strike	Kolkata, India — Tens of thousands of people packed the streets of one of India's biggest cities after doctors resumed a strike and called fresh rallies over the rape and murder of a colleague. The discovery of the 31-year-old's bloodied body at a state-run hospital in Kolkata two months ago rekindled nationwide anger at the chronic issue of violence against women. Doctors in the eastern city went on strike for weeks in response and walked off the job again on Tuesday, saying pledges by the West Bengal state government to improve safety and security at hospitals had been unmet. They were joined on Tuesday evening by thousands of people from all walks of life for a huge protest march, with many carrying the Indian tri-color flag and some staying out until dawn on Wednesday. ‘’We want to send out the message that our protests will not end until we get justice,' rally organizer Rimjhim Sinha, 29, told AFP at the march. Kolkata is days away from the start of a festival held in honor of the Hindu warrior goddess Durga, the city's biggest annual religious celebration. Sinha said that the dozens of civil society groups backing doctors' calls for public protests would use the occasion to demand an end to violence against women. 'The festival of worshipping Goddess Durga epitomizes the victory of good over evil,' she said. 'This year it will turn into the festival of protests.' With further demonstrations called over the coming days, a senior police official told AFP on condition of anonymity that more than 2,500 extra officers had been put on active duty around Kolkata. The victim of the August attack is not being identified in keeping with Indian laws on media reporting of sexual violence cases. Her father attended Tuesday's march and told AFP that his family was still 'devastated' two months after her death. 'My daughter's soul will not rest in peace until she gets justice,' he said. Doctors had briefly returned to limited duties in emergency departments last month, only to strike again in defiance of a September order from India's top court to fully return to work. They say that the state government's promises to upgrade lighting, CCTV cameras and other security measures in hospitals have not been fulfilled. Tens of thousands of ordinary Indians took part in the protests that followed the August attack. One man has been detained over the murder but the West Bengal government has faced public criticism for its handling of the investigation. Authorities sacked the city's police chief and top health ministry officials. The gruesome nature of the attack drew comparisons with the 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus, which also sparked weeks of nationwide protests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-march-in-india-as-doctors-resume-strike/7807323.html	2024-10-01T23:28:03-07:00

New Japan PM wants bank to be careful when raising rates	TOKYO — Japan's newly appointed economy minister, Ryosei Akazawa, said on Wednesday that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expects the Bank of Japan to make careful economic assessments when raising interest rates again. 'Our top priority is to ensure that Japan completely exit from deflation,' said Akazawa in his first news conference as the economy minister. 'It will take some time to achieve the full exit.' 'Ishiba's (previous) comments on the need for monetary policy normalization have conditions attached,' said Akazawa, a close ally of Ishiba. The government wants the BOJ to share its view that the exit from deflation is Japan's top priority and to make careful decisions on whether to raise interest rates further, he said. The minister also stressed the administration would closely communicate and coordinate with the BOJ to decisively beat deflation. The BOJ raised rates in July, but kept policy steady at the September meeting, saying it could afford to spend time eyeing the fallout from global economic uncertainties.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-japan-pm-wants-bank-to-be-careful-when-raising-rates/7807294.html	2024-10-01T22:02:43-07:00	
China files appeal to WTO on Canada's tariffs on EVs, metal products	SINGAPORE — China's commerce ministry said on Wednesday it has asked the World Trade Organization to rule on Canada's imposition of steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles as well as steel and aluminum products. Following the lead of the United States and European Union, Canada began imposing on Tuesday a 100% levy on EVs shipped from China, having also announced in late August a 25% tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum products. 'China has raised a litigation to the WTO over Canada's unilateral and trade protectionist measures, and will conduct anti-discriminatory probe into these restrictive measures,' the ministry said in a statement. The ministry repeated its strong opposition to the tariffs, which it says will 'disrupt and distort global industrial and supply chain.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-files-appeal-to-wto-on-canada-s-tariffs-on-evs-metal-products/7807260.html	2024-10-01T21:03:57-07:00	
Swiss glaciers are receding again after 2 punishing years	GENEVA — The volume of Switzerland's glaciers shrank again this summer, compounding the negative impact of climate change after a devastating two-year run that depleted the ice by more than 10%, scientific experts reported Tuesday. The cryosphere observation team at the Swiss Academy of Sciences reported that high temperatures in July and August, combined with the heat-absorbing impact of reddish-yellow dust blown northward from the Sahara Desert onto Swiss glaciers, led to a loss of 2.5% of their volume this year. The shrinkage came despite 'extremely favorable' conditions through June, the academy said, thanks to 30% more snowfall in the preceding winter compared to average levels, meaning that the glaciers had an extra layer of protective covering of snow — before temperatures rose. 'August saw the greatest loss of ice recorded since measurements began,' the academy said in a statement summarizing the findings. 'The retreat of the glacier tongues and their disintegration continue unabated as a result of climate change,' it said, adding that the 2.5% loss of volume was higher than the average levels over the last decade. Experts at the Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland network, known as GLAMOS, said that more than half of the glaciers it monitored completely lost their snow coverage throughout the summer. Several topmost measurement points on glaciers, such as Plaine Morte and Gries in the south and Silvretta in the east, recorded melt rates of a meter or more, the network said in a report for the Swiss Academy of Sciences. GLAMOS cited three factors: 'very high' average air temperatures in July and August; good weather in those months in which there was no fresh snow; and southwesterly winds in the winter and spring that dumped the Saharan dust onto the Alps, causing a warming effect on the ice. Switzerland is home to the most glaciers of any country in Europe, and saw 4% of its total glacier volume disappear last year. That was the second-biggest decline in a single year on top of a 6% drop in 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swiss-glaciers-are-receding-again-after-2-punishing-years-/7807258.html	2024-10-01T20:56:15-07:00

Analysts expect strong Israel reaction to Iran attack, uncertain of wider conflict	Washington — Iran's brazen missile attack on Israel has heightened tensions across the Middle East, with some analysts predicting a powerful Israeli response. What is less certain is whether this will be a one-off exchange or ignite a series of tit-for-tat strikes that could engulf the entire Middle East in conflict. 'It could go either way,' said Shaan Shaikh, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'At every exchange, the actors – Iran and Israel – have options to escalate or de-escalate. There is no predetermined path that they must choose.' James Jeffrey, a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey and Iraq, said Iran's military capabilities are more limited than Israel's. 'At the end of the day, military strength can be decisive,' Jeffrey, who served as a special envoy for Syria engagement, told VOA. In a statement released Tuesday, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it crried out the attack in retaliation for the Israeli killings of three key figures: Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and an Iranian commander. Involving nearly 200 ballistic missiles, this was Iran's second and largest direct attack on Israel from its own territory. In April, Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in response to an Israeli attack on an Iranian diplomatic base in Syria. But unlike its measured response in April, Israel is expected to respond more forcefully to the latest strike. In a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iranian leaders made a 'big mistake' and warned that they will 'pay for it.' Why now? Prior to the latest attack, Iran's muted response to a series of Israeli strikes on Iranian officials and proxies in recent months had raised doubts about Tehran's willingness to confront a stronger adversary. That may be so, but Iranian officials could not sit back and watch one of their key allies, Hezbollah, decapitated by Israel, Shaikh said. 'They need(ed) to push back both to protect Lebanese Hezbollah and also to show to their other proxy groups and allies across the region that they will defend their interests,' Shaikh said in an interview with VOA. The Iranian strike follows Israel's ground incursion into southern Lebanon on Monday, after weeks of airstrikes that have killed more than 1,000 people in Lebanon and crippled Hezbollah's leadership. Israel has described the operation as 'limited, localized and targeted,' aimed at pushing Hezbollah forces away from the border area and eliminating its military infrastructure. Following Iran's attack in April, the Biden administration reportedly persuaded Israel to respond with restraint. Whether a similar diplomatic effort will be mounted or is desired remains uncertain. The stakes appear higher this time. President Joe Biden said he directed the U.S. military to help Israel shoot down the Iranian missiles, adding, 'Make no mistake: the United States is fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel.' Jeffrey, the former envoy, said that following the April attack, the understanding between Israel, the U.S. and Iran was: 'This is the last time, Bubba. If you do this again, there will be a serious retaliation.' The question now is how far each side will test the limit of the other's tolerance. Shaikh, the CSIS analyst, warned that the longer the conflict drags on, the more political pressure each side will face to 'engage with more firepower, and that's a concern.' Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said the attack gives Netanyahu 'an opportunity to deal really quite a big blow to Iran.' 'Whether he will be restrained by the United States or not, we just don't know,' Landis said in an interview with VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-expect-strong-israel-reaction-to-iran-attack-uncertain-of-wider-conflict-/7807226.html	2024-10-01T20:08:36-07:00	
Justice Department launches first federal review of 1921 Tulsa race massacre	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Justice has launched a review and evaluation of the 1921 race massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said. The massacre started on May 31, 1921, when white attackers killed as many as 300 people, most of them Black, in Tulsa's prosperous Greenwood neighborhood, which had gained the nickname 'Black Wall Street.' In announcing the review on Monday, Clarke said the department aims to have it finalized by the end of the year. 'When we have finished our federal review, we will issue a report analyzing the massacre in light of both modern and then-existing civil rights law,' said Clarke, who oversees the Justice Department's civil rights enforcement efforts. The review will be conducted under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, which allows the Department of Justice to investigate death-resulting civil rights crimes that occurred on or before Dec. 31, 1979. The massacre started after a Black man was accused of assaulting a white woman. 'We have no expectation that there are living perpetrators who could be criminally prosecuted by us or by the state,' Clarke said. 'Although a commission, historians, lawyers and others have conducted prior examinations of the Tulsa Massacre, we, the Justice Department, never have.' Clarke said the department is examining available documents, witness accounts, scholarly and historical research and other information related to the massacre.	https://www.voanews.com/a/justice-department-launches-first-federal-review-of-1921-tulsa-race-massacre/7807200.html	2024-10-01T18:58:00-07:00	
Firefighters battle forest fire raging in southern Greece	ATHENS, Greece — Hundreds of firefighters and volunteers in southern Greece battled a wildfire for a third day that has killed two people and devastated a large forested area, prompting pledges of assistance from other European Union countries. Two waterbombing aircraft from Italy joined the firefighting effort late Tuesday after Greece requested help through the 27-country bloc's emergency civil protection mechanism. A third plane from Croatia was also expected. The Greek fire service said more than 400 firefighters, assisted by 22 aircraft, were engaged against the blaze in the rugged mountains of Corinthia in the Peloponnese region. The authorities were optimistic that progress had been made as the main front of the blaze was out, leaving a large number of scattered fires. However, it remained unclear whether that success could be expanded on before winds whipped up and spread the blaze again. Greece's minister for climate change and civil protection, Vassilis Kikilias, said so far up to 5,000 hectares (12,300 acres) had been affected by the blaze. 'The situation is very difficult,' he told a press conference. 'We didn't expect that at this time of year ... there would be so many wildfires and that they would be so difficult to handle.' While wildfires are common in the summer, this year the season started much earlier than usual, in April, and has extended well into the fall. The fire service said a total of 41 wildfires broke out all over the country over the past 24 hours. Government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis said firefighters had been hampered in their initial response Sunday by the difficult terrain and poor road network. 'During the first, crucial stage of the fire, firetrucks had great difficulty approaching (the blaze) because of the narrow roads,' he said. 'The many ravines and the gale-force winds blowing that day greatly impeded' the firefighting effort, Marinakis added. Officials ordered another village be evacuated as a precaution Tuesday, a day after half a dozen similar orders were issued. A major highway that was closed overnight as flames swept close by was reopened on Tuesday. The blaze destroyed a historic church in the mountains and reportedly damaged buildings outside the threatened villages, but the fire service was not immediately able to provide further details. The two victims were identified as local residents who got trapped late Sunday by the fast-advancing blaze. Greece, like other southern European countries, is plagued every summer by destructive wildfires that have been exacerbated by global warming. Over the past few months, the fire service has had to cope with more than 4,500 wildfires — which Kikilias said was the highest number ever recorded in a single fire season. This year's had been flagged as the most dangerous season in two decades after the countryside was left parched by a protracted drought and early summer heat waves. Still, Greece's big investments in extra waterbombing aircraft, warning drones and other equipment have led to most blazes being extinguished shortly after they broke out.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-of-firefighters-battle-a-deadly-forest-fire-raging-in-southern-greece/7807195.html	2024-10-01T18:50:24-07:00

Two boats carrying migrants sink in the Red Sea off Djibouti's coast killing 45, UN says	Djibouti — Two vessels carrying migrants from Africa sank in the Red Sea off the coast of Djibouti, killing 45 people, the U.N. migration agency said Tuesday. The boats had departed from Yemen carrying 310 people, the International Organization for Migration said. Thousands of migrants from African, Middle Eastern and South Asian countries seeking a better life in Europe attempt irregular migration every year. Smugglers pack vessels full of desperate people willing to risk their lives to reach continental Europe. The U.N. agency, which was assisting search and rescue efforts, said on the social media platform X that 32 survivors were rescued. Djibouti's coast guard said the tragedy struck some 150 meters off a beach near the northwest Khor Angar region. It said a joint rescue effort was under way, which began early Monday. It said 115 survivors were rescued. 'We remain committed to finding the missing persons and ensuring the safety of the survivors,' the agency said in a statement posted on social media, with images of white body bags.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-boats-carrying-migrants-sink-in-the-red-sea-off-djibouti-s-coast-killing-45-un-says/7807190.html	2024-10-01T18:38:49-07:00	
Trump declines to be interviewed for '60 Minutes' election special	NEW YORK — CBS News said Tuesday that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has declined to participate in an interview with '60 Minutes' for its election special, which will go forward next Monday with Democratic opponent Kamala Harris alone. Television's top-rated news program regularly invites the two presidential contenders for separate interviews that air back-to-back on a show near the election. This year, it is scheduled for Monday instead of its usual Sunday time slot. Asked for comment, the former president's campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said, 'Fake news,' adding that there were discussions, but nothing was ever locked in. '60 Minutes' said Trump's campaign had initially agreed to an interview before telling CBS that the former president would not appear. The network said its invitation to sit for an interview still stands, and correspondent Scott Pelley will explain Trump's absence to viewers. Vice President Harris will appear in a pretaped interviewed with Bill Whitaker. There are currently no other scheduled opportunities for voters to compare the two candidates together. Harris and Trump previously debated on Sept. 10. Although Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN for a second debate later this month, Trump has not accepted. The interview special is scheduled to air Monday instead of the usual '60 Minutes' time slot because CBS is showing the American Music Awards on Sunday. Trump's interview with '60 Minutes' correspondent Lesley Stahl prior to the 2020 election proved contentious, with the former president ending the session early and his campaign posting an unedited transcript of the session. CBS News was hosting Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Tim Walz, Minnesota's Democratic governor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-declines-to-be-interviewed-for-60-minutes-election-special/7807173.html	2024-10-01T18:21:33-07:00	
Political parties in Kurdistan Region seek female, minority candidates	washington — With a parliamentary election in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq scheduled for October 20, interest is growing among major political parties for candidates who are women or members of ethnic and religious minorities. Whatever the outcome of the election, the region's quota system has guaranteed 30 seats for women and five for Turkmen, Christians and Armenians out of a total of 100 seats in parliament. The quota system has provided an incentive for political parties, especially the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), to reach out to active members of those minority communities and women who are popular among voters. Roshna Jamil, a female candidate in Halabja city, told VOA that the quota system might secure some representation for women in parliament, but it comes at a cost of increased intervention from established political parties. 'Women should not rely on the quota system forever, because if it continues like this, political parties will nominate women as a strategy to win more seats,' Jamil told VOA. According to United Nations Women, the U.N. entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women, women's voices are missing from decision-making 'in every region of the world.' The organization said that in 2024, women held only 27% of seats in national parliaments and 35.5% of seats in local governments. In Iraq, women were largely absent from the political arena until 2004, when the country's constitution required female representation in the parliament to be not less than a quarter. But in the north of the country, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has boasted of taking bolder steps to bring women to power, such as appointing a female speaker of the parliament in 2019. Despite the progress, women would be unlikely to achieve significant representation in the parliament without the quota system. In the region's most recent election in 2018, only 13 of the 35 women who were elected received enough votes to have entered the parliament without it. According to the Irbil-based Middle East Research Institute, the lack of support for female candidates is related to 'the progress of gender equality in Kurdistan overall.' Haider Nimat, head of the PUK electoral department in Sharazoor, told VOA the nomination of more capable women to run for political positions will help narrow the gender gap in the region, adding, 'We want to provide an opportunity to them … and we are giving more importance to those who can win a seat on their own.' According to data provided by Iraq's Independent High Electoral Commission, nearly 2.9 million people from the region's four provinces are eligible to vote in the election. The total number of candidates is 1,191 people — 368 of them women. For Jamil in Halabja, the campaign period is a good time to raise awareness of women's rights. She said her message for voters was to trust female candidates because 'there are dozens of women who are more capable than men to govern.' She told VOA, 'As a woman, I have come to compete with all candidates regardless of their gender. I'm not settling for the quota system which, I think, is only a temporary solution.' Sazgin Muslih, a Turkmen minority candidate running to win a seat in Kifri town for the Iraqi Turkmen Front, shared Jamil's frustration about political involvement from the PUK and the KDP, which he said have more resources to help their preferred candidates win. 'We want the Kurdish parties not to interfere in the affairs of the [minority] communities, although these parties support their own candidates,' he said. 'If the Kurdish parties do not interfere, 80% of the Turkmen of Kifri are with us.' In its first election in 1992, the Kurdistan Regional Parliament allocated five quota seats for Christians. In 2005, that quota increased to 11 seats for Christians, Turkmen and Assyrians. However, the Iraqi Federal Court in a surprise move in February abolished all the seats following a complaint by the PUK, which had argued that the KDP controlled minority parties in the parliament. The Iraqi high court decision prompted a political boycott from the minority parties and the KDP that lasted until late May when the court decision was reversed, and five seats were returned to the system. This story originated in VOA's Kurdish Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/political-parties-in-kurdistan-region-seek-female-minority-candidates/7807125.html	2024-10-01T17:54:29-07:00	
Australia's online dating industry agrees to code of conduct to protect users	MELBOURNE, Australia — A code of conduct will be enforced on the online dating industry to better protect Australian users after research found that three-in-four people suffer some form of sexual violence through the platforms, Australia's government said on Tuesday. Bumble, Grindr and Match Group Inc., a Texas-based company that owns platforms including Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid and Plenty of Fish, have agreed to the code that took effect on Tuesday, Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said. The platforms, which account for 75% of the industry in Australia, have until April 1 to implement the changes before they are strictly enforced, Rowland said. The code requires the platforms' systems to detect potential incidents of online-enabled harm and demands that the accounts of some offenders are terminated. Complaint and reporting mechanisms are to be made prominent and transparent. A new rating system will show users how well platforms are meeting their obligations under the code. The government called for a code of conduct last year after the Australian Institute of Criminology research found that three-in-four users of dating apps or websites had experienced some form of sexual violence through these platforms in the five years through 2021. 'There needs to be a complaint-handling process. This is a pretty basic feature that Australians would have expected in the first place,' Rowland said on Tuesday. 'If there are grounds to ban a particular individual from utilizing one of those platforms, if they're banned on one platform, they're blocked on all platforms,' she added. Match Group said it had already introduced new safety features on Tinder, including photo and identification verification to prevent bad actors from accessing the platform while giving users more confidence in the authenticity of their connections. The platform used artificial intelligence to issue real-time warnings about potentially offensive language in an opening line and advising users to pause before sending. 'This is a pervasive issue, and we take our responsibility to help keep users safe on our platform very seriously,' Match Group said in a statement on Wednesday. Match Group said it would continue to collaborate with the government and the industry to 'help make dating safer for all Australians.' Bumble said it shared the government's hope of eliminating gender-based violence and was grateful for the opportunity to work with the government and industry on what the platform described as a 'world-first dating code of practice.' 'We know that domestic and sexual violence is an enormous problem in Australia, and that women, members of LGBTQ+ communities, and First Nations are the most at risk,' a Bumble statement said. 'Bumble puts women's experiences at the center of our mission to create a world where all relationships are healthy and equitable, and safety has been central to our mission from day one,' Bumble added. Grindr said in a statement it was 'honored to participate in the development of the code and shares the Australian government's commitment to online safety.' All the platforms helped design the code. Platforms that have not signed up include Happn, Coffee Meets Bagel and Feeld. The government expects the code will enable Australians to make better informed choices about which dating apps are best equipped to provide a safe dating experience. The government has also warned the online dating industry that it will legislate if the operators fail to keep Australians safe on their platforms.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-s-online-dating-industry-agrees-to-code-of-conduct-to-protect-users/7807134.html	2024-10-01T17:26:27-07:00	
Wildfires in California have burned 1 million hectares so far this year	LOS ANGELES — The total hectares burned in California this year surpassed 1 million as spiking temperatures Tuesday added to the challenges facing firefighters struggling to contain a stubborn blaze in the mountains northeast of Los Angeles that flared up over the weekend. Evacuation orders were expanded again Monday for remote communities northeast of Los Angeles as the Line Fire that has been burning for nearly a month spread over nearly 176 square kilometers (68 square miles) of the San Bernardino Mountains, and containment dropped from 83% to 76%. 'The dry vegetation, steep slopes and wind aligned ... to create conditions for the rapid fire spread,' according to a statement late Monday from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. The risk of wildfires increased across California as an autumn heat wave scorched much of the state. Some inland areas could see temperatures up to 20 degrees above average for this time of year, according to the National Weather Service. San Francisco, where residents typically break out the sweaters in October, could hit 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit), while triple digits 38 C were predicted for Sacramento. The weather service office in the state's capital urged residents to stay indoors during the heat of the day on Tuesday. Dry, hot winds in the northern part of the state prompted Pacific Gas & Electric to preemptively cut power to small clusters of customers in high-risk areas. The utility routinely stops electricity service in counties where weather conditions increase the probability of fires. In Southern California, the Line Fire's surge pushed the total hectares burned across the state in 2024 to 405,492 (1,001,993 acres) as of Tuesday morning, according to Cal Fire. The milestone surpasses the total scorched during the same time last year — 118,719 hectares (293,362 acres) — but is roughly on par with the five-year average for the period, the Los Angeles Times reported. A 34-year-old man has pleaded not guilty to starting the Line Fire on September 5. Justin Wayne Halstenberg of Norco, California, was charged with 11 arson-related crimes, according to court records. At its height, the blaze threatened more than 65,000 homes in and around the Big Bear Lake area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wildfires-in-california-have-burned-1-million-hectares-so-far-this-year/7807130.html	2024-10-01T17:17:16-07:00	
Guatemala arrests police officers implicated in migrant smuggling ring	GUATEMALA CITY — Guatemalan security agents arrested 25 mostly active police officers implicated in a human trafficking network that operated along a route used by mostly U.S.-bound migrants, Interior Minister Francisco Jimenez said on Tuesday. Guatemala has been a major transit country for decades for migrants from Latin America and beyond as they travel north to Mexico's border with the United States. The minister said two of the detained police officers were retired, and an additional 11 civilians were also arrested on charges including money laundering on behalf of an organization known as 'Los Rs.' Guatemalan authorities have said the group has operated for several years while accumulating millions of quetzals, the local currency. 'This organization made use of police agents, corrupting them in order to guarantee the trajectory of the people who they were trafficking across the country,' Jimenez said in a video message. The Interior Ministry noted that a prior arrest of two people who were illegally transporting 10 migrants from Uzbekistan through Guatemala had led to the operation that ultimately dismantled the network. Four vehicles, a firearm and cash were seized, the ministry added in a statement. It did not disclose where the migrants who were being smuggled came from, or where they would be sent. The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security collaborated in the investigation, Jimenez added. The U.S. Embassy said on X the human-trafficking network had exploited nearly 10,000 migrants. In August, Panama launched U.S.-funded migrant deportation flights as Washington seeks to stem the flow of people traveling to its southern border, many seeking better economic conditions and security. The same month, Guatemalan and U.S. authorities announced the joint dismantling of another human-smuggling network with ties to the 2022 deaths of 53 migrants trapped in a sweltering truck in Texas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/guatemala-arrests-police-officers-implicated-in-migrant-smuggling-ring/7807123.html	2024-10-01T17:11:06-07:00

US special envoy for Taliban-ruled Afghanistan moved to different role	ISLAMABAD — The United States has reassigned its special representative for Afghanistan, leaving vacant a key position in its efforts to engage with the Taliban-ruled country. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the decision Tuesday to reassign Tom West, while emphasizing that Washington's commitment to the South Asian nation 'remains an enduring priority.' Blinken said West would serve in a new role as the acting head of the Office of Sanctions Coordination at the U.S. State Department and commended him for working 'tirelessly to ensure [that] both our national interests and the welfare of the Afghan people guided our policy in Afghanistan.' West was appointed as the special representative to Afghanistan in October 2021, two months after the Taliban regained power and all U.S.-led NATO troops withdrew from the country, ending 20 years of involvement in the war. 'Tom has skillfully led diplomacy on Afghanistan during a complex period,' Blinken said. 'Today's global challenges are equally as complex, and I look forward to working with him on coordinating economic sanctions strategies across the U.S. government with our partners and stakeholders to achieve U.S. foreign policy priorities,' he said without elaborating. The Taliban takeover compelled Washington and other Western capitals to relocate their diplomatic missions from Kabul to Doha, Qatar, where Karen Decker serves as the chief of the U.S. Embassy. Blinken said Decker has been asked to lead Afghan diplomacy. The de facto Afghan leaders have imposed their strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as Shariah, banning girls' education beyond the sixth grade, prohibiting women from most workplaces and access to public life at large across the impoverished country. Taliban leaders reject international criticism and calls for reversing bans on Afghan women's rights to work and education as interference in the country's internal matters. Blinken said that Rina Amiri, the U.S. special envoy for Afghan women's and girls' rights, would continue to lead her mission to ensure that 'human rights, and particularly women's rights, are prioritized.' Asif Durrani, who served as Pakistan's special representative to Afghanistan until last month, said that many countries, including the U.S., are frustrated with the Taliban due to their treatment of women and their lack of an inclusive government in Kabul. 'Issues such as inclusivity or human rights, particularly girls' right to education and women's right to work, are issues that the American administration cannot afford to overlook and engage the Taliban in a meaningful way,' Durrani said. But he suggested the wars in Ukraine and Gaza have diverted Washington's attention from the Afghan situation. 'It's quite obvious that Afghanistan is not on the United States' priority list, at least for the time being,' Durrani said. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller rejected that view when asked by reporters Tuesday whether Afghanistan is still a U.S. foreign policy priority. 'Of course it is,' he said. 'And we will continue to stay engaged in Afghanistan. It remains an enduring priority.' Durrani said the U.S. cannot be blamed alone for the lack of improvement in Afghanistan. 'The Taliban's rigid attitude towards women's education and their ban on women's work is not winning them any friends or sympathy.' No country has officially recognized the men-only Taliban government in Kabul, mainly due to human rights issues and their sweeping restrictions on women's freedoms. The United States and allied nations have imposed financial and banking sector sanctions on Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover. Donors have cut economic development assistance, citing terrorism-related sanctions on several key leaders of the de facto government. State Department Bureau Chief Nike Ching contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-special-envoy-for-taliban-ruled-afghanistan-moved-to-different-role/7806849.html	2024-10-01T17:00:24-07:00	
Dockworkers may have negotiating advantage in their strike against US ports	philadelphia — The 45,000 dockworkers who went on strike Tuesday for the first time in decades at 36 U.S. ports from Maine to Texas may wield the upper hand in their standoff with port operators over wages and the use of automation. Organized labor enjoys rising public support and has had a string of recent victories in other industries, in addition to the backing of the pro-union administration of President Joe Biden. The dockworkers' negotiating stand is likely further strengthened by the nation's supply chain of goods being under pressure in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which has coincided with the peak shipping season for holiday goods. The union is also pointing to shipping companies' record profits, which have come in part because of shortages resulting from the pandemic, and to a more generous contract that West Coast dockworkers achieved last year. The longshoremen's workloads also have increased, and the effects of inflation have eroded their pay in recent years. The dockworkers' strike, their first since 1977, could snarl supply chains and cause shortages and higher prices if it stretches on for more than a few weeks. Beginning after midnight, the workers walked picket lines Tuesday and carried signs calling for more money and a ban on automation that could cost workers their jobs. Major retailers prepared Experts say consumers won't likely notice shortages for at least a few weeks, if the strike lasts that long, though some perishable items such as bananas could disappear from grocery stores — although at this time of year, most other fruits and vegetables are domestically grown and not processed at ports, according to Alan Siger, president of the Produce Distributors Association. In anticipation of a strike, most major retailers also stocked up on goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items. The strike, coming weeks before a tight presidential election, could also become a factor in the race if shortages begin to affect many voters. Pressure could eventually grow for the Biden administration to intervene to force a temporary suspension of the strike. Little progress was reported in the talks until just hours before the strike began at 12:01 a.m. The U.S. Maritime Alliance, the group negotiating for the ports, said both sides did budge from their initial positions. The alliance offered 50% raises over the six-year life of the contract. Comments from the union's leadership had briefly suggested a move to 61.5%, but the union has since signaled that it's sticking with its initial demand for a 77% pay increase over six years. In early picketing, workers outside the Port of Philadelphia walked in a circle, chanting, 'No work without a fair contract.' The union posted message boards on the side of a truck reading: 'Automation Hurts Families: ILA Stands for Job Protection.' Boise Butler, president of the union local, asserted that the workers want a contract that doesn't allow for the automation of their jobs. The shipping companies, he argued, made billions during the pandemic by charging high prices. 'Now,' Butler said, 'we want them to pay back. They're going to pay back.' And in New Orleans, Henry Glover Jr., a fourth-generation dockworker who is president of the union local, says he can recall the days when longshoremen unloaded 150-pound sacks of sugar by hand. He acknowledges that machinery has made the job easier, but he worries that the ports need fewer people to handle the equipment. 'Automation could be good, but they're using it to kill jobs,' Glover said. 'We don't want them to implement anything that would take our jobs out.' William Brucher, an assistant professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University, noted that 'this is a very opportune time' for striking workers. The contract agreement reached last year with West Coast dockworkers, who are represented by a different union, shows that 'higher wages are definitely possible' for the longshoremen and has enhanced their bargaining power, Brucher said. Biden's options Under the Taft-Hartley Act, Biden could seek a court order for an 80-day cooling-off period that would end the strike at least temporarily, but he has told reporters that he wouldn't take that step. The administration could risk losing union support if it exercised such power, which experts say could be particularly detrimental for Democrats ahead of next month's election. On Tuesday, the White House continued to ask the alliance to negotiate a fair contract that reflects the longshoremen's contribution to the economy. 'As our nation climbs out of the aftermath of Hurricane Helene,' Biden said in a statement, 'dockworkers will play an essential role in getting communities the resources they need. Now is not the time for ocean carriers to refuse to negotiate a fair wage for these essential workers while raking in record profits.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dockworkers-may-have-negotiating-advantage-in-their-strike-against-us-ports-/7806846.html	2024-10-01T16:53:12-07:00	
Trump rallies in battleground state of Wisconsin before VP debate	WAUNAKEE, Wisconsin — Former President Donald Trump spent more than an hour ahead of Tuesday night's vice presidential debate campaigning in a Democratic county crucial to Kamala Harris' hopes for winning the key battleground state of Wisconsin. Republican Trump appeared at a manufacturing facility in Waunakee, a suburb of Wisconsin's capital city of Madison in the Democratic stronghold of Dane County. Trump had never campaigned in Dane County nor visited as president. In an event advertised as economic-themed, Trump bounced from subject to subject, also taking on Democratic nominee Harris on issues, including foreign policy, crime and immigration, while intermittently pivoting to criticism of outgoing President Joe Biden. 'I'm asking every citizen to join me in launching sort of a new golden age for America,' Trump told hundreds inside Dane Manufacturing, a metal fabricator that has a long history of hosting Republican candidates and officeholders. Trump also could not pass up a jab at former President Jimmy Carter on the Georgia Democrat's 100th birthday. With hollow praise, Trump declared the one-term Carter 'the happiest man' because he 'is considered a brilliant president' compared with Biden. Trump did not note Carter's birthday, nor his status as the longest-living former president. Later Tuesday, Trump was to hold an event at a museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin's largest city and home to the state's largest number of Democratic voters and second-largest number of Republicans. His appearance there was also meant to give him reach into the city's conservative suburbs, a part of Wisconsin where his support has softened but where he must do well to win. In Milwaukee, Trump was slated to speak in a small auditorium at Discovery World, a science museum along Lake Michigan's lakefront. His event was not open to the public and his audience was to consist only of news media. Last Saturday, he held a rally in western Wisconsin where he blamed Harris for crimes committed by people in the country illegally. Both of his planned stops were ahead of Tuesday's debate in New York between Trump's running mate JD Vance, a senator from Ohio, and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota. Dane County, the location of Trump's first stop, is Wisconsin's fastest-growing county and an economic engine for the state, fueled by jobs in the health care and tech industries. It is also home to the University of Wisconsin. Dane County's population grew by about 30,000 people between 2016 and 2020. It has gone up by an additional 13,000 since then, based on the most recent U.S. Census Bureau estimate. That presents a challenge for Republicans, especially given that nearly 90% of registered voters in the county cast ballots in 2020. Biden won 75% of the vote that year in Dane County, beating Trump by 181,000 votes in the county while carrying the state by fewer than 21,000. Hillary Clinton beat Trump in Dane County in 2016 by 47 points, and Trump won the state by less than one point. It's a point former Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson said he made to Trump. In remarks to the crowd before Trump arrived, Thompson said the former president should 'go where the opposition is.' 'And, the retort was, 'Isn't Madison very liberal?'' Thompson said. 'Yes, but Dane County has the third-most Republican votes in the state of Wisconsin, and all we have to do is increase them.' Democratic presidential candidates have long come to Dane County to hold massive rallies to fire up the base. Harris campaigned there on September 20, holding a rally in Madison that attracted more than 10,000 people. Waunakee, which bills itself as the 'only Waunakee in the world,' is slightly more Republican than the county as a whole. In 2020, Trump got 36% of the vote there compared to less than 23% countywide.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-rallies-in-battleground-state-of-wisconsin-before-vp-debate-/7806823.html	2024-10-01T16:32:35-07:00	
Hurricane damage creates uncertainty about how voters will cast ballots in swing state	ASHEVILLE, North Carolina — North Carolina election officials say they will do everything in their power to ensure that voters in the crucial presidential swing state will be able to cast their ballots despite the devastation of Hurricane Helene and the destruction of basic infrastructure only about a month before the November election. Karen Brinson Bell, the executive director of the state's election board, said Tuesday that 12 county election offices in the hard-hit western part of the state remain closed after the storm unleashed 'unprecedented' damage. Absentee ballots, some of which already have been mailed to voters who requested them, also face obstacles, from U.S. Postal Service delays to road and residential damage that could render them undeliverable. The viability of early and Election Day voting sites remains unknown, she said. She described the storm as causing a 'daunting' level of uncertainty, with early in-person voting scheduled to start in just over two weeks, on October 17. Still, she said the state is prepared to help voters navigate the emergency. 'We've battled through hurricanes and tropical storms and still held safe and secure elections, and we will do everything in our power to do so again,' Brinson Bell told reporters during a media call. 'Mountain people are strong, and the election people who serve them are resilient and tough, too.' Helene, which battered large swaths of the Southeast late last week with torrential rain and strong winds and massive storm surges along the Gulf Coast, caused devastation 'beyond belief' in the popular mountain city of Asheville and other parts of western North Carolina, Governor Roy Cooper said during a media briefing Tuesday. 'This disaster is unlike anything our state has ever experienced,' he said. The level of destruction could have far-reaching implications beyond the immediate damage to the flooded communities, especially if it has any impact on voting. North Carolina is among seven swing states being hotly contested by Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Trump barely defeated Democrat Joe Biden in the state four years ago, winning by about 74,500 votes out of 5.5 million cast. Asheville is the most populous city in the 25-county region under a disaster declaration and sits in the one county — Buncombe — where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans. Michael Bitzer, a politics professor at Catawba College in Salisbury, North Carolina, said the disaster area includes 'significant blue dots in a very red sea,' making it difficult to predict how the storm might affect voter turnout and election results. On Tuesday, emergency workers were still engaged in rescue efforts across the broad swath of the Southeastern U.S. that bore the brunt of the storm. Election officials in Florida, Tennessee and Georgia were assessing the damage and the potential impacts to mail balloting, early voting and Election Day operations. Georgia election workers have returned to work even as some offices face power outages, limited internet and infrastructure damage. Absentee ballots are scheduled to go out on October 7 as planned, said Robert Sinners, communications director for Georgia's secretary of state. In Tennessee, two county election offices had water damage, and at least six polling locations in the northeastern part of the state have been damaged or are inaccessible, said Doug Kufner, spokesman for the secretary of state's office. North Carolina officials said they are considering moving or combining voting locations if some are unusable or inaccessible. More urgently, state officials are offering guidance and some special accommodations for absentee voters, who may not receive their ballots because of evacuations, suspended Postal Service operations or residential mailboxes swept away in the storm. Paul Cox, general counsel for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said displaced voters can contact their county election office to request that their absentee ballot be spoiled and sent to a different location. Those voters also have the option of waiting to cast a ballot in person, either during the early voting period of October 17 to November 2 or on Election Day, November 5, Cox said. State law requires all voters to show voter ID, but those who are from a county under a disaster declaration and have lost their ID can fill out an exception form so they can cast a ballot. Officials are still weighing whether to take further steps to accommodate voters, such as extending the absentee ballot deadline or allowing more people to cast ballots through an online portal already used by military, overseas and visually impaired voters, Brinson Bell said. Some of the county boards whose offices remain closed or are dealing with outages have been given special emergency kits from the state, which were initially intended for use in case of a ransomware attack, Brinson Bell said. The kits are equipped with laptops, cellphones, Wi-Fi hotspots and other essentials to allow election operations to continue even without power, phone or internet service. Kelly Godfrey, who has lived in Asheville for more than three years, is one of the few voters who returned their absentee ballot before the storm hit. In Buncombe County, which includes Asheville, nearly 9,990 voters had requested absentee ballots as of Tuesday — 85% of them Democrats or voters who are not affiliated with any party, according to Associated Press election research. Only about 170 had been returned. Godfrey said she hopes rules and procedures will be adjusted to make it easier for voters who were displaced by the storm. But she also worries that any changes could lead to misinformation and false claims of voter fraud after the election. 'It's going to be spun a lot of different ways,' she said. For now, though, voting feels 'so far out in the distance,' Godfrey said. 'Right now, people are thinking food and water.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-damage-creates-uncertainty-about-how-voters-will-cast-ballots-in-swing-state/7806790.html	2024-10-01T16:30:09-07:00	
Amid struggling economy, Nigeria downplays anniversary festivities	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigeria Tuesday marked the 64th anniversary of its independence in a generally somber mood. Persistent inflation, widespread insecurity, and unpopular economic reforms have left many Nigerians feeling frustrated and pessimistic. In comments Tuesday, President Bola Tinubu acknowledged these challenges but said that ongoing reforms will lead to prosperity. 'As your president, I assure you that we are committed to finding sustainable solutions to alleviate the suffering of our citizens,' said Tinubu. 'Once again, I plead for your patience as the reforms we are implementing show positive signs, and we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel.' This year's Independence Day comes amid widespread frustration. Inflation is at a record high, and the naira's devaluation has eroded purchasing power. Citizens such as Felix Chukwuemeka and Kenneth Ugwu question whether it is appropriate for the country to celebrate. 'I feel like it is not worth celebrating because of the hardship of the economy, of the country, because everybody, most of us businessmen, we are not finding it easy,' said Chukwuemeka. 'Sixty-fourth independence means that we are supposed to have been full grown, but as it stands today, we are just crawling,' said Ugwu. 'What a shame.' Many Nigerians see the economic hardships as a result of reforms championed by Tinubu, including the removal of fuel subsidies and the floating of the naira. Tinubu said Tuesday that the reforms are essential for Nigeria's long-term economic stability. Amid frayed nerves, the government toned down the usual holiday parades and displays in Abuja, holding only a small ceremony that was closed to the public. Economist Isaac Botti said a low-key celebration is justified. 'What would be the basis for celebrating independence?' asked Botti. 'I think in the best interest of the president is to even shelve any form of celebration completely because Nigerians are angry, and if it continues with this, there's going to be a public outburst that he may not be able to control.' Nigerians are also anxious about general insecurity in many parts of the country, especially in the northeast, where suspected Boko Haram militants opened fire at a market in the town of Yobe in September and killed close to 40 people. The president said his government is making progress against extremists. 'We have restored peace to hundreds of communities in the North, and thousands of our people have been able to return home,' said Tinubu. 'It is an unfinished business, which our security agencies are committed to ending as quickly as possible. As soon as we can restore peace to many communities in the troubled parts of the North, our farmers can return to their farms.' The president maintained that stability is on the horizon, and despite the current challenges, he said, the government believes Nigeria can still forge a path to a better future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-opts-for-muted-independence-day-celebrations-amid-insecurity-struggling-economy/7806761.html	2024-10-01T15:38:02-07:00

British justice at Hong Kong's top court declines to renew term	London — Another overseas, nonpermanent judge at Hong Kong's top court, 86-year-old Briton Nicholas Phillips, has chosen not to renew his term after it ended on Sept. 30, becoming the fifth foreign judge to step down from the Court of Final Appeal this year. Phillips told VOA through his chamber, Brick Court Chambers, in an email Monday, 'I have declined the invitation to serve for a further 3 year term on the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong for personal and not political reasons.' According to the chamber, he would not comment further. The Hong Kong Judiciary thanked him in a statement sent to online media The Witness for his contribution to the work of the Court of Final Appeal and his support for the rule of law in Hong Kong during his tenure over the past 12 years. It added that 'the recent changes in court personnel will not affect the operation of the Court of Final Appeal.' It went on to say despite the departure of the judges this year, the majority of serving and outgoing nonpermanent judges have publicly reaffirmed their continued confidence in Hong Kong's independent judicial system and the courts' commitment to upholding the rule of law. The Court of Final Appeal is formed by the chief justice, three local permanent judges, and 10 nonpermanent judges. The nonpermanent judges include four local judges and six overseas judges. Anthony Gleeson, an 85-year-old former chief justice from Australia, did not renew his term in March, citing his advanced age. Canadian judge Beverley McLachlin also said she would not renew her term after July because she was 80 and hoped to spend more time with family. In June, two British judges, Lawrence Collins, 83, and Jonathan Sumption, 75, resigned from the court, saying it was because of the city's worsening political situation and 'profoundly compromised' rule of law. Rights activists say Hong Kong's government is using the foreign judges to lend credibility to its crackdown on rights and freedoms since Britain returned the financial hub to China in 1997. The Washington-based Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong (CFHK) Foundation issued a report in May criticizing overseas judges in Hong Kong for undermining its freedoms and called for them to quit. The foundation said it was shocked that it took Phillips so long to quit despite a series of high-profile cases targeting Hong Kong's pro-democracy groups, which prompted at least two judges to resign. Alyssa Fong, public affairs and advocacy manager for CFHK Foundation, said the more foreign judges that resign, the less the Hong Kong government can use them to justify rights abuses. 'I urge Phillips' fellow common law judges from the U.K. and Australia to immediately follow suit. It is dumbfounding that some judges continue to choose to ruin their reputations and their integrity for the Hong Kong authorities and Chinese Communist Party,' she told VOA. After Phillips' departure, six overseas judges remain in the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal — Leonard Hoffmann and David Neuberger from Britain and William Gummow, Robert French, Patrick Keane, and James Allsop from Australia. Hoffmann, 90, has been a nonpermanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal since 1998, and his term will end in mid-January next year. Gummow's term will expire next July, while the terms of the other three Australian judges will expire in 2026 or 2027. At the end of June, Neuberger heard Hong Kong's case accusing Apple Daily newspaper founder Jimmy Lai of unauthorized assembly and agreed with the controversial verdict. Neuberger came under criticism, then resigned as chairman of an expert panel of the Media Freedom Coalition. Kevin Yam, a Hong Kong activist-lawyer now based in Australia, pointed out on social media X that Phillips could have left office on the grounds of age, but he chose to use personal reasons, which he notes would invite some speculation. 'When even Phillips does this, the four remaining Australian judges on the HKCFA stick out even more like sore thumbs,' Yam said on X. The Hong Kong government awarded Phillips the Gold Bauhinia Star in July last year and described him as 'a strong supporter of the rule of law in Hong Kong and very much a friend of Hong Kong.' Beijing agreed to uphold Hong Kong's 'one country, two systems' political structure when colonial ruler Britain transferred the city back to China in 1997. Critics say Beijing has violated that deal by forcing harsh security laws on Hong Kong that have seen independent media shut down or leave the city and dissidents face arrest or flee abroad. Beijing says Hong Kong's 2020 National Security Law was needed to maintain stability after a series of pro-democracy protests in the past decade, but has used it to arrest, jail and try hundreds of activists, stifling Hong Kong's once vibrant civil society. In March, Hong Kong lawmakers unanimously and quickly approved their own sweeping national security law known as Basic Law Article 23, strengthening the government's ability to silence dissent.

US press freedom under unprecedented pressure, report finds	washington — As a tight presidential election looms in the United States, journalist safety in the home of the First Amendment is no longer guaranteed, according to a report published Tuesday. Journalists in the United States are facing a slew of threats, including attacks by police, online harassment, violence and legal challenges, according to the report by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). The report primarily analyzes developments since 2020. 'There was a hope at the beginning of the Biden administration that things would get better for journalists. And what we've seen, actually, is that things haven't really gotten better. They've stayed the same or worsened in some situations,' Katherine Jacobsen, CPJ's U.S., Canada and Caribbean program coordinator, told VOA. The numbers paint a concerning picture. As of September 2024, assaults on journalists in the United States in relation to their work have risen by more than 50% compared to last year — from 45 to 68 assaults — according to data from the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. 'Enemies of the people' Even though former President Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, the report points to his legacy as a driving factor behind the hostile environment continuing to face journalists around the country. During Trump's presidency, he regularly referred to journalists as 'corrupt,' 'dishonest' and 'enemies of the people.' Those kinds of attacks took place — and continue to take place — within the context of record-low trust in the media in the United States, according to a 2023 Gallup poll. 'Donald Trump's treatment of the media still matters because it's very much still an issue,' said Jacobsen, who authored the report. 'It's a really effective political tactic for changing the narrative and undermining the credibility of the media.' Trump's administration also escalated prosecution of news sources, interfered in the business of media owners, and harassed journalists crossing U.S. borders, according to a 2020 CPJ report. Trump's office and presidential campaign did not immediately reply to VOA's emails requesting comment for this story. Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's national press secretary, also did not immediately reply to VOA's request for comment. Meanwhile, CPJ reached out to both the Trump and Kamala Harris campaigns, asking them to sign the organization's pledge to affirm their support for press freedom. Trump's campaign did not reply, and Harris' campaign acknowledged receipt but did not sign the pledge. Consequences continue Trump hasn't been in office for nearly four years, but his tenure in the White House continues to have consequences for journalists in the United States, according to Jacobsen. 'If Donald Trump's anti-media rhetoric did not find resonance among the broader American public, then we wouldn't even be talking about it,' Jacobsen said. President Joe Biden's administration has been markedly friendlier to the press, according to the report, but Jacobsen said that hasn't translated to an improved media environment around the country. A top threat facing journalists is violence, which has steadily increased against the media over the past decade in the United States, the report said. Among the most prominent recent cases is the 2022 killing of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German, who was found stabbed to death outside his home. Robert Telles, a former local Nevada official, was found guilty of murdering German in late August. Although journalist killings are rare in the United States, they can have a chilling effect on the media community, according to Jacobsen. Reporters told CPJ that hostility toward journalists makes them feel less safe working in their home environments. 'The killing of journalists, especially local journalists where the reporters are working in the community, going to the same grocery stores as the people that they're writing about, creates this sense that nowhere is safe,' Jacobsen said. Incidents involving police are another issue for journalists. In a recent case, Chicago police arrested three photojournalists while they covered a pro-Palestinian protest during the Democratic National Convention in August. And four years ago, at least 459 journalists were assaulted while covering the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, including at least 273 cases in which police targeted journalists, according to the Tracker. 'The press serves as the public's eyes and ears, and if the press is removed completely from the scene, the public's blind to what's happening on the ground,' Gabe Rottman, a senior attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said in the CPJ report. Physical threats against journalists are exacerbated by online harassment against them, according to the report. A 2022 survey by Pew Research Center found that one-third of journalists surveyed reported being harassed on social media in the previous year. With the election just over a month away, Jacobsen said it's also important to remember the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection on the Capitol in Washington. Journalists were among the targets during the riots, with at least 18 journalists assaulted that day, according to the Tracker. But there hasn't been much accountability in those cases, according to Jacobsen, and large swaths of the American public still don't agree on what happened that day. Some journalists who were present during the insurrection say grappling with the subsequent trauma has been difficult, according to the report. 'I really do think that January 6th was a warning shot,' Amanda Andrade-Rhoades, a freelance photojournalist who was on assignment at the Capitol during the riots, said in the CPJ report. 'It was a wake-up call to the fragility of our democracy and trust in institutions — like journalism, like the government — that's been eroding for a very long time.' Jacobsen said she's worried about ramifications for the media landscape if the results of the presidential election are contested. Trump has previously said that Democrats will cheat in the election and suggested that any election in which he does not win is likely to be fraudulent. 'It's really important for journalists across the country to prepare themselves for the worst-case scenario and hope for the best,' Jacobsen said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-press-freedom-under-unprecedented-pressure-report-finds/7806682.html	2024-10-01T15:01:44-07:00	
Former US ‘China House’ official: Taiwan conflict not inevitable	Washington — China has been one of the most-discussed international topics during the U.S. presidential campaign. VOA spoke with Rick Waters, former head of the Office of China Coordination at the State Department and deputy assistant secretary of state for China and Taiwan, about the Biden administration's China policy. Waters spoke about his experience dealing with his Chinese counterparts, and how he thinks Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump would handle China, if elected. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. VOA: How do you evaluate the progress made in U.S.-China relations after U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in California last year, and do you see real, meaningful results coming from the meeting? Rick Waters: I think we have to look at this Woodside summit as the culmination of a number of things that happened in the administration. The first is that for the first period, Biden was focused on rebuilding the U.S. domestic strength and reinvigorating partnerships and alliances globally, and then from that position, dealing with China from a position of relative strength. So during that first two-year period, the U.S. China relationship was, in some ways, arguably, not the priority. It was important, but it was managed largely through leader level diplomacy, which, in China's current political configuration is the most important channel. And then we know what happened in 2022 circumstances around the visit of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi [to Taiwan] led to a downward spiral, and Biden and Xi made an initial effort to stabilize relations that fall at their summit in Bali, but it only made it a few months, and then the surveillance balloon knocked things sideways again. So, I think what we have now is a little bit more stable floor built around the leader level channels, a few modest areas where there is some common work underway, and a web of senior, empowered channels at the Cabinet level, including Jake Sullivan, who try to manage conflict and competition rather within bounds, within guardrails, to avoid the scenario of unmitigated downward spiral we saw in 2022. VOA: Do you think a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is inevitable, or what should the U.S. do to deter that invasion? Waters: I don't think that conflict is inevitable, and I think at its core the U.S.’s interest is peace and stability. That's what's anchored the prosperity in the Indo-Pacific over the past couple of decades. The ability for commerce, for trade, for people-to-people flows regionally to thrive in an environment where there is no war. And so, I think if we take that as our starting point, I don't think that conflict is inevitable, but I do think that the U.S. and Taiwan are focused very much on the question of how to ensure that the leadership in Beijing never believe they have a viable military option and an acceptable cost. And if that condition holds, then I think it will fall to the diplomats and to the channels that exist between the parties to manage this issue carefully. VOA: During your career as a U.S. diplomat, what’s your experience dealing with your Chinese counterparts? What are some striking and most challenging aspects or moments that left an impression on you? Waters: I've been fortunate to deal with Chinese diplomats for the better part of 30 years. And what I will say is irrespective of what you think of China's policy or political system, they do have a very professional diplomatic corps. They've got very talented people in the system. What I think has changed over the past few decades is it's a much more disciplined system. So, it's very difficult, especially in official meetings, for Chinese diplomats to move too far off of the established line. So, I don't think that we should misunderstand the level of talent in the system when we look at it through its structural constraints. But I do think that as China's overall foreign policy has become more assertive, as you know, the leadership has talked about China playing a greater role on the international stage. It has gone through periods where the wolf warriorism, the change in tone from the podium, has characterized a different era of Chinese diplomacy than what we saw before. But I actually think, in some ways, there are plenty in the system who understand the counterproductive nature of those tactics, and I've seen a little bit of a tactical recalibration over recent years in how they express their foreign policy views publicly. VOA: In this election season, the Biden administration's China policy has often been criticized by the Republican campaign for being too weak. What is your take on that? Waters: We're in an election campaign, so obviously you're never going to hear anyone say that someone's policy is too tough. I think that the honest reality is that this election is not really, in my view, about China. It's about other issues. China is present, but if you look at how much it’s featured in the speeches at the Republican and Democratic conventions, there are issues related to China that are important, but I think we have to maintain that perspective. Second, I think that the issues that, in my view, matter most to voters center around trade and a perception of unfairness, a lack of reciprocity, and fentanyl, which for a number of years is a problem that has had a direct relationship to the producers of these precursor chemicals in China, and so I think those types of issues do matter on the margins, but they're not central to U.S. voters, particularly in the swing states that will decide this election. VOA: For the observers in China who are looking at this election, how is Harris' China policy going to be different than President Biden's, and what awaits China if Trump regains power? Waters: I think how this is playing in China is a very different story. But I think what we have to say at this point is that we're in the midst of a campaign. So, to be fair to both candidates, what we should judge is, once they form their Cabinets next spring, how will they translate political positions into new policy? I think Harris's team has expressed a general view that her policy will be consistent with Biden's. The Trump team and President Trump himself have talked about aspects of the relationship, particularly trade, where they feel that things are out of balance. VOA: Biden and Xi are likely to meet and sit down again later this year. So, what are the prospects and expectations for this meeting? Waters: It'll be a critical moment, because this meeting — which will be either on the margins of the G20 [Group of 20 largest economies] summit in Brazil [November 18-19], or the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] summit in Lima, Peru [November 10-16], depending on where it takes place — these meetings on the margins of summits are consequential during a presidential transition. I think they can use it as a chance to help bridge between the two administrations. That will be easier if it's a Biden-to-Harris transition, because Democrat-to-Democrat is more likely to be able to talk about how the bridging will work. But if it's, you know, Biden-to-Trump, I still think it's consequential. President Biden can give his advice about how to avoid returning to the events of 2022 [and] how they can reflect on the lessons of what has been achieved since the Woodside [California] Summit [in November 2023]. And I think you probably go into it with fairly modest expectations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-us-china-house-official-taiwan-conflict-not-inevitable/7806723.html	2024-10-01T14:48:56-07:00

John Amos, patriarch on 'Good Times' and Emmy nominee for blockbuster 'Roots,' dies at 84	LOS ANGELES — American actor John Amos, who starred as the family patriarch on the hit 1970’s sitcom Good Times and earned an Emmy nomination for his role in the seminal 1977 miniseries Roots, has died. He was 84. Amos' publicist, Belinda Foster, confirmed the news of his death Tuesday. No other details were immediately available. He played James Evans Sr. on Good Times, which featured one of television's first Black two-parent families. Produced by Norman Lear and co-created by actor Mike Evans, who co-starred on All in the Family and The Jeffersons, it ran from 1974-79 on CBS. 'That show was the closest depiction in reality to life as an African American family living in those circumstances as it could be,' Amos told Time magazine in 2021. His character, along with wife Florida, played by Esther Rolle, originated on another Lear show, Maude. James Evans often worked two manual labor jobs to support his family that included three children, with Jimmie Walker becoming a breakout star as oldest son J.J. Such was the show's impact that Alicia Keys, Rick Ross, the Wu-Tang Clan are among the musicians who name-checked Amos or his character in their lyrics. Amos and Rolle were eager to portray a positive image of a Black family, struggling against the odds in a public housing project in Chicago. But they grew frustrated at seeing Walker's character being made foolish and his role expanded. 'The fact is that Esther's criticism, and also that of John and others — some of it very pointed and personal — seriously damaged my appeal in the Black community,' Walker wrote in his 2012 memoir Dyn-O-Mite! Good Times, Bad Times, Our Times. After three seasons of critical acclaim and high ratings, Amos was fired. He had become critical of the show's white writing staff creating storylines that he felt were inauthentic to the Black characters. 'There were several examples where I said, 'No, you don't do these things. It's anathema to Black society. I'll be the expert on that, if you don't mind,'' he told Time magazine. 'And it got confrontational and heated enough that ultimately my being killed off the show was the best solution for everybody concerned, myself included.' Amos' character was killed in a car accident. Walker lamented the situation. 'If the decision had been up to me, I would have preferred that John stay and the show remain more of an ensemble,' he wrote in his memoir. 'Nobody wanted me up front all the time, including me.' Amos and Lear later reconciled and they shared a hug at a Good Times live TV reunion special in 2019. Amos quickly bounced back, landing the role of an adult Kunta Kinte, the centerpiece of Roots, based on Alex Haley's novel set during and after the era of slavery in the U.S. The miniseries was a critical and ratings blockbuster, and Amos earned one of its 37 Emmy nominations. 'I knew that it was a life-changing role for me, as an actor and just from a humanistic standpoint,' he told Time magazine. 'It was the culmination of all of the misconceptions and stereotypical roles that I had lived and seen being offered to me. It was like a reward for having suffered those indignities.' Early years Born John Allen Amos Jr. on Dec. 27, 1939, in Newark, New Jersey, he was the son of an auto mechanic. He graduated from Colorado State University with a sociology degree and played on the school's football team. Before pursuing acting, he moved to New York and was a social worker at the Vera Institute of Justice, working with defendants at the Brooklyn House of Detention. He had a brief professional football career, playing in various minor leagues. He signed a free-agent contract in 1967 with the Kansas City Chiefs, but coach Hank Stram encouraged Amos to pursue his interest in writing instead. He had jobs as an advertising and comedy writer before moving in front of the camera. Amos' first major TV role was as Gordy Howard, the weatherman on The Mary Tyler Moore Show from 1970-73. As the show's only Black character, he played straight man to bombastic anchor Ted Baxter. Among Amos' film credits were Let's Do It Again with Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier, Coming to America with Eddie Murphy and its 2021 sequel, Die Hard 2, Madea's Witness Protection and Uncut Gems with Adam Sandler. He was in Ice Cube and Dr. Dre's 1994 video 'Natural Born Killaz.' He was a frequent guest star on The West Wing, and his other TV appearances included Hunter, The District, Men in Trees, All About the Andersons, Two and a Half Men, and The Ranch. In 2020, Amos was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. He served in the New Jersey National Guard.	https://www.voanews.com/a/john-amos-patriarch-on-good-times-and-emmy-nominee-for-blockbuster-roots-dies-at-84/7806557.html	2024-10-01T12:50:12-07:00	
Shooting, stabbing attack in Tel Aviv kills at least 6, Israeli police say	JERUSALEM — At least six people were killed and nine wounded in a suspected shooting and stabbing terror attack in the Tel Aviv area on Tuesday, Israeli police said. They said that two 'terrorists' started a killing spree on the Tel Aviv light rail and continued on foot before being killed by civilians and inspectors using personal pistols. The attack took place minutes before Iran launched a barrage of missiles at Israel. TV footage showed gunmen getting off at a light rail station and opening fire. Israel's MDA ambulance service said it received a report at 7:01 p.m. of people injured by gunfire. Medics and paramedics provided on-site medical treatment to a number of wounded people with varying degrees of injuries, including some who were unconscious, MDA said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shooting-stabbing-attack-in-tel-aviv-kills-at-least-6-israeli-police-say/7806485.html	2024-10-01T11:26:04-07:00	
Dispute over Spain's past domination of Mexico reveals domestic divisions	Madrid — Among those not present at Tuesday's inauguration of Mexico's first female president, Claudia Sheinbaum, was the Spanish monarch. Sheinbaum did not invite King Felipe VI of Spain to the ceremony after the monarch did not respond to a letter demanding that he apologize for Spain's 16th century defeat of Mexico's powerful Aztec rulers. Today, a diplomatic dispute between Mexico and Spain over the event half a millennium ago is motivated more by domestic political tensions in both countries, analysts said. The issue of Spain’s colonial past has also revealed political splits within Spain’s own left-wing coalition government, observers noted. In 2019, Mexican President Andres Lopez Obrador, who is known as AMLO and is an ally of Sheinbaum, wrote to King Felipe and Pope Francis to ask them to apologize for the abuses during and after the 1519-1521 conquest. Sheinbaum said that when King Felipe failed to respond, he was not invited to the ceremony, Reuters reported. The snub to King Felipe prompted the Spanish government to say it would not participate 'at any level.' During a visit to New York last week for the United Nations General Assembly, Reuters reported that Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez ruled out participating in Tuesday's ceremony in Mexico City. 'Spain and Mexico are brotherly peoples. We cannot therefore accept being excluded like this,' he said. 'That’s why we have made it known to the Mexican government that there will be no diplomatic representative from the Spanish government, as a sign of protest.' Historic wounds Historians agree that Spain's conquest of Mexico was marked by violence. However, accounts from that time, including The True History of the Conquest of Mexico by Captain Bernal Diaz del Castillo, counter claims of cruelty while also being critical of the campaign by Hernan Cortes. Spain's government has rejected Mexico's demand for an apology for the conquest, saying the events of the past cannot be judged by the standards of today. Observers suggest that Sheinbaum’s decision not to invite the Spanish king was motivated by a current of anti-Spanish thought she shares with AMLO. Commentators said both Mexican leaders have sought to appropriate a version of history which blames the Spanish conquest for ills which afflict modern Mexico. Jos Maria Ortega, a Mexico-based analyst who has co-written The Dispute of the Past: Spain, Mexico, and the Black Legend, said: 'AMLO and Sheinbaum share the idyllic view that Mexico had existed for thousands of years when this was not the case. Mexico as it exists today won independence from Spain in 1821 after a war that spanned 11 years. 'AMLO will blame corruption, which is a problem for Mexico, on the time of conquest. This plays well with some Mexicans who are anti-Spanish but not those who are pro-Spanish,' Ortega told VOA. Analysts suggest Mexico’s first female president was interested in provoking a diplomatic row with Spain for domestic political gain. Tomas Perez Vejo, a professor at the National School for Anthropology and History in Mexico, said Sheinbaum sought to exploit anti-Spanish feelings among supporters. 'Sheinbaum is a supporter of what is known in America as woke, or the politically correct, and defends the Indigenous people. There is also a populist element in which Spain is seen as the enemy by [Mexican] nationalists,' he told VOA. 'Relations between Mexico and Spain have been complicated since AMLO came to power in 2018. But this relationship is too important in terms of trade, tourism, which have carried on as if nothing happened despite the political ill feelings,' he said. 'This latest row is not going to cause lasting damage.' European roots Both Lopez Obrador and Sheinbaum are descendants of more recent immigrants from Europe. AMLO's maternal grandfather was born in Spain and Sheinbaum's grandparents were Jews from Lithuania and Bulgaria. On the other side of the Atlantic, the dispute has revealed divisions within Spain’s minority coalition government. The Socialist-led government will not attend the inauguration but representatives of Sumar, the far-left Spanish party, which is the junior partner in Spain’s coalition, have accepted an invitation to travel to Mexico. 'Sumar is more about examining the context of history. But the Socialists do not want to do that. The polarization between parties is seen over the colonization of America,' Oriol Bartomeus, a professor of politics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, told VOA. Some historians argue that Mexico, for three centuries known as New Spain, was not formally a colony, but an overseas territory of Spain and that its inhabitants held full rights as subjects of the Spanish crown. That argument has not dampened the drive by some Spanish politicians to call for atonement for the nation’s imperial past. Ernest Urtasun, the minister of culture who is a member of Sumar, this year announced museums would review their collections to 'overcome a colonial framework,' El Pais reported. Mexico and other nations formerly dominated by Spain have demanded the return of pre-Hispanic artifacts currently owned by museums in Europe. Ana Maria Carmona, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Seville, noted that divisions over the conquest of Mexico between the Socialists and Sumar were the latest in a series of tensions in the government. The two parties fell out over laws on sexual protection, animal rights and housing, she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dispute-over-spain-s-past-domination-of-mexico-reveals-domestic-divisions/7806480.html	2024-10-01T11:22:56-07:00	
UN appeals for aid for Lebanon as regional conflict looms	GENEVA — Responding to the growing humanitarian crisis in Lebanon, the United Nations and the Lebanese government launched a $426 million flash appeal Tuesday to provide emergency assistance to support 1 million people directly affected by the rapidly escalating conflict in Lebanon. 'In just the past two weeks, more than 1,000 people have lost their lives, over 6,000 have been injured, and an estimated 1 million people have been directly affected or displaced since October 2023,' Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, told journalists in Geneva. 'I want to add that you will have seen in recent hours the reports of the beginning of an Israeli ground offensive in southern Lebanon,' he said. 'We are deeply concerned about this development. We urge all parties to prioritize the protection of civilians, adhere to international humanitarian law and engage in immediate de-escalation to prevent further loss of life and to prevent further suffering.' He said the U.N. and nongovernmental organizations already are providing food, nutrition for children, water and other basic supplies needed for 'peoples’ survival and well-being,' but the humanitarian response is insufficient to deal with the overwhelming and growing humanitarian needs. 'This appeal aims to rapidly reinforce and scale up these essential services in support of the government-led response,' Laerke said, adding that there was little time to lose. Israel launched its ground invasion against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon Tuesday morning, describing it as a 'limited, localized and targeted' operation. The action follows the detonation by Israel two weeks ago of thousands of pagers that killed many people, injured thousands and decimated Hezbollah’s leadership — raising the low simmering conflict in Lebanon to a higher, more dangerous level. 'We are gravely concerned by the widening hostilities in the Middle East and their potential to engulf the entire region in a humanitarian and human rights catastrophe,' said Liz Throssell, spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. She warned that further deterioration of the situation 'could rapidly expand to embroil other states in the region. 'With armed violence between Israel and Hezbollah boiling over, the consequences for civilians have already been terrible,' she said. 'We fear a large-scale ground invasion by Israel into Lebanon would only result in greater suffering.' Throssell underscored the dangers of further escalation, noting that the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah 'has sent shock waves reverberating around the region.' 'I think what we have seen unfolding in recent days has added to our concerns,' especially on the impact 'of innocent children, women and men from hostilities,' she said. 'All parties to these conflicts must clearly distinguish between military targets and civilians and civilian objects in the way they conduct hostilities,' she said, adding that the warring parties must do all they can 'to protect the lives of civilians,' as well as their homes and essential infrastructure. Israel has said the offensive will continue until Hezbollah stops firing rockets at Israel and it is safe for families to return to the homes they abandoned near the Lebanon border. For Christian Cortez, head of delegation of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies for Lebanon, the war raging in his country is not just a matter of statistics. It is personal. 'Just a few days ago, my wife’s brother was killed in the line of duty while rescuing others. He served with dedication in the Lebanese Civil Defense. … He leaves behind his wife and three young children, and like thousands of other Lebanese, they now face the hardships of the displacement,' he said. Speaking from the Lebanese capital, Beirut, he told journalists that his brother-in-law’s death was not just a personal loss for his family but one of 'a heartbreaking list of Lebanese humanitarian workers and civilians who have tragically lost their lives in the recent escalation.' 'His is just one of millions of stories of fear and trauma,' Cortez said. He spelled out the immense challenges facing the Lebanese Red Cross, 'which has been at the front line of the emergency response from the first day.' He said the Lebanese Red Cross is facing shortages of medical supplies, ambulances and fuel, noting that the IFRCs $65 million appeal is only 12% covered.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-appeals-for-aid-for-lebanon-as-regional-conflict-looms/7806438.html	2024-10-01T11:12:08-07:00	
Europe hardens cease-fire calls as October 7 anniversary of Hamas attack nears	London — As the anniversary of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel approaches, many European countries are strengthening their calls for Israel to end its assault on Hamas targets in Gaza amid growing horror at the civilian death toll. The militant attack killed 1,200 people, including Israelis and people of several other nationalities. Around 250 people were taken hostage by Hamas. The assault prompted outrage from Israel’s allies in Europe. 'This Hamas attack is terrible, and it is barbaric. In these dark hours for the Jewish state, we … stand firmly by Israel's side,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in the hours following the attack. Then-British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak echoed those words of support. 'I want to express my absolute solidarity for the people of Israel. Now is not a time for equivocation, and I'm unequivocal,' Sunak said on the day following the attack. Israel’s Western allies, most prominently the United States, said the country had the right to defend itself. Israel responded with waves of airstrikes on Hamas targets and a ground invasion of Gaza. Israel officials defended targeting schools and hospitals in Gaza, saying Hamas fighters were using them as bases and to store weapons. 'Miscalculation' But soon, Western concern grew over the mounting civilian death toll, which reached 22,000 by the end of 2023, and has since climbed to over 41,000. 'I think there was a miscalculation on behalf of most Western governments — that they went all in in support for Israel early on, making it very, very difficult to find some sort of off-ramp to also tell Israel when it was wrong, when it acted excessively,' said Andreas Krieg, a Middle East analyst at Kings College London. 'As this became clearer in late 2023 and early 2024, most Western governments found it very hard to backtrack from the initial unequivocal support that they gave to Israel.' There was also global concern over the lack of aid reaching Gaza amid the devastation. South Africa brought an ongoing case of genocide against Israel at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, supported, among others, by Spain, Ireland and Belgium. An interim ruling by the court ordered Israel to 'take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.' Israel insisted it operates according to international law. Negotiations to secure a truce, brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, have so far failed. 'Europeans don't have the leverage that the U.S. has to actually do anything about it apart from, obviously, potentially a diplomatic statement or trying to sponsor diplomatic efforts. But if there was no coercion exercised on the Netanyahu government, nothing was going to change,' Krieg said. In Britain, a change of government in July brought a change of approach to Israel. Newly elected Labour leader Keir Starmer dropped the previous government’s plan to challenge an arrest warrant requested by the International Criminal Court against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes. In September, Britain announced it was suspending some arms sales to Israel. 'No contest' Bronwen Maddox, director of London-based Chatham House, said the changing British approach was felt in Israel. 'There's no question that some of these moves, for example, Britain taking more steps to express its disapproval of aspects of what Israel is doing — those are stinging in Israel. I heard a lot — I was there just really just days ago — a lot of people saying, ‘Well, if it's a competition between security and international support, we'll take security anytime. There's no contest,’' Maddox told Agence France-Presse. Germany, Israel’s second-biggest arms supplier after the United States, has been among the strongest of Israel’s allies in Europe. 'I would say the messages coming out of Germany up till now are probably the most pro-Israel of any major country in the world, even in comparison to the United States,' Krieg told VOA. However, Berlin has also suspended several arms exports licenses to Israel in recent months. 'That's likely not because there's a change of policy,' Krieg said. 'I think the German government is still unequivocally standing with Israel. But there is a concern over legal action being taken against the German government in Germany by lawyers who are saying Germany is no longer compliant with international law, by being complicit in this war,' he added. After facing missile attacks from Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and Houthi rebels in Yemen, Israel has widened its military operations in recent days, launching air strikes against both militant groups and a limited ground invasion across the Lebanese border. The United Nations says over 1 million people in Lebanon have been forced to flee the fighting. European nations offered Israel unequivocal support in the wake of October 7. After a year of brutal, escalating conflict, most are demanding an end to the fighting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-hardens-cease-fire-calls-as-october-7-anniversary-of-hamas-attack-nears/7806434.html	2024-10-01T10:58:28-07:00

US sanctions West Bank settler group for violence against Palestinians	WASHINGTON — The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on Hilltop Youth, a group of extremist settlers in the Israeli -occupied West Bank who attack Palestinians and their property. In addition, the State Department placed diplomatic sanctions on two men — Israeli settler Eitan Yardeni, for his connection to violence targeting West Bank civilians, and Avichai Suissa, the leader of Hashomer Yosh, a sanctioned group that brings young volunteers to settler farms across the territory, including small farming outposts that rights groups say are the primary drivers of settler violence across the territory. The sanctions, which expose people to asset freezes and travel and visa bans, come as violence against Palestinians in the West Bank has exploded since the start of the Israel-Hamas war following the deadly terrorist attacks of October 7. Palestinians report verbal and physical harassment and restriction of movement, and they face intimidation by settlers circling their properties on motorbikes, cars or horses and spying via drones. The Treasury Department said Hilltop Youth has carried out killings and mass arson, while rights groups and Palestinians say the group is behind 'price tag' attacks — attacks on Palestinian villages in retaliation for perceived efforts to hamper settlement construction. The group may prove difficult to effectively sanction, as it is loosely organized and decentralized. In addition, Israel's finance minister has previously vowed to intervene on sanctioned settlers' behalf. In the past, sanctioned settlers said that the measures had little impact on their finances. Hilltop Youth has already faced sanctions from the EU and U.K. The Biden administration has been criticized for imposing relatively few sanctions on Israeli extremists. According to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, 27 extremists and entities have been sanctioned by the U.S. under President Joe Biden 's February 2024 Executive Order related to maintaining West Bank stability. Treasury Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith said that the U.S. 'will continue to hold accountable the individuals, groups and organizations that facilitate these hateful and destabilizing acts.' State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, 'The actions of these individuals have contributed to creating an environment where violence and instability thrive. Their actions, collectively and individually, undermine peace, security and stability in the West Bank.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sanctions-west-bank-settler-group-for-violence-against-palestinians/7806212.html	2024-10-01T08:55:18-07:00

New leader of Japan says security environment 'most severe since end of WWII'	Tokyo — Japan's new prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, said Tuesday that his nation faces its 'most severe' regional security situation in the post-WWII era, without naming any specific threats. 'The security environment surrounding our country is the most severe since the end of World War II,' he said in his first press conference after being approved as prime minister by parliament earlier in the day. Ishiba, 67, is a former defense minister who has previously called for the creation of an Asian NATO to counter China's rapid military build-up, North Korean missile launches and other security threats. 'With the Japan-US alliance as a foundation, we will expand the circle of friendly and like-minded countries, using diplomacy and defense to realize the peace of Japan and the region,' he told reporters on Tuesday. He also said he would focus on cybersecurity and the safety of Japanese people abroad and would work to fix a shortage of new troops for Japan's military. On the economy, Ishiba — who backs the Bank of Japan's exit from its maverick ultra-loose policies — said he would broadly continue the work of his predecessor, Fumio Kishida. 'The Japanese economy stands on the brink of whether to emerge from deflation. I will navigate our economy and fiscal policies by prioritizing ending deflation,' he said. Ishiba, who won a ruling party leadership vote last week, has said he intends to call a general election for October 27 to shore up his mandate. On Tuesday, he said the public and private sectors will have a shared goal for 'female participation in all decision-making scenarios at all organizations.' However, his own 20-strong cabinet announced earlier in the day includes just two women.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-leader-of-japan-says-security-environment-most-severe-since-end-of-wwii-/7806004.html	2024-10-01T06:30:57-07:00	
NATO's new chief makes Ukraine support a top priority, says he'll work with any US president	Brussels — The new head of NATO vowed on Tuesday to help shore up Western support for war-ravaged Ukraine and expressed confidence that he can work with whoever is elected president of the United States, the alliance's most powerful member, in November. 'There can be no lasting security in Europe without a strong, independent Ukraine,' new NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said in his first speech on taking office, and he affirmed a commitment made by the organization's leaders in 2008 that 'Ukraine's rightful place is in NATO.' Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces are making advances in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's army has a shaky hold on part of the Kursk region in Russia, which has provided a temporary morale boost, but as casualties mount it remains outmanned and outgunned. 'The cost of supporting Ukraine is far, far lower than the cost we would face if we allow Putin to get his way,' Rutte told reporters, a few hours after his predecessor Jens Stoltenberg handed the reins to him, along with a Viking gavel with which to chair future meetings. But Ukraine's NATO membership remains a distant prospect. Several member countries, led by the U.S. and Germany, believe that Ukraine should not join while it's fighting a war. Rutte declined to speculate about what must happen before it can stand among NATO's ranks. Rutte did single out China, and particularly Beijing's support for Putin. 'China has become a decisive enabler of Russia's war in Ukraine. China cannot continue to fuel the largest conflict in Europe since the Second World War without this impacting its interests and reputation,' he said. NATO's new top civilian official also underlined the importance of keeping the trans-Atlantic bond between the United States, Canada and Europe strong, with U.S. elections just a month away. Surveys suggest the election will be a close race. It could see the return of Donald Trump, whose bluster during his last term of office about low defense spending among European allies and Canada undermined the trust of NATO member countries. It became an existential challenge, as smaller members feared that the U.S. under Trump would renege on NATO's security pledge that all countries must come to the rescue of any ally in trouble, the foundation stone the alliance is built on. But Rutte said: 'I know both candidates very well.' He praised Trump for pushing NATO allies to spend more and for toughening their approach toward China. He also hailed the 'fantastic record' of Vice President Kamala Harris and described her as 'a highly respected leader.' 'I will be able to work with both. Whatever is the outcome of the election,' Rutte said. When pressed about Trump's commitment to the other allies, he deflected, saying only that both candidates 'understand that, in the end, the trans-Atlantic relationship is crucial, not just for Europe.' Asked whether the Netherlands, which has only just reached NATO's spending of 2% of gross domestic product on its defense budget, has set a good example to other allies, Rutte shook his head and said 'No. We should have done this earlier.' Earlier, Stoltenberg had welcomed Rutte to NATO headquarters in Brussels for the change of leadership. The two men, who first sat together at NATO's table 14 years ago as the leaders of Norway and the Netherlands, greeted each other warmly, before laying a wreath to fallen military personnel, surrounded by the flags of the 32 member countries. 'Mark has the perfect background to become a great secretary general,' a visibly emotional Stoltenberg said as he ended a decade in office. 'He has served as prime minister for 14 years and led four different coalition governments, so therefore he knows how to make compromises, create consensus, and these are skills which are very much valued here at NATO,' Stoltenberg said. Rutte said that he 'cannot wait to get to work.' Among his other priorities, he said, are to increase defense spending and strengthen partnerships that the alliance has established with other countries around the world, notably in Asia and the Middle East. After hundreds of NATO staffers applauded the two men as they moved inside to the great hall where North Atlantic Council meetings are held at the level of ambassadors, ministers or leaders, Stoltenberg helped his successor to get started by presenting him with a Viking gavel to use when chairing meetings. Stoltenberg, NATO's 13th secretary-general, took over in 2014, the year that 'little green men' from Russia infiltrated Ukraine. Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula, sparking a defense spending buildup at the world's biggest security alliance that gathered pace over his term. His tenure was surpassed only by Dutch diplomat Joseph Luns, who spent 12 years in charge of NATO. NATO secretaries-general run the HQ, drive the alliance's working agenda and speak on behalf of the 32-nation organization with one unifying voice. Continuity is usually the key word when they take up office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-s-new-chief-makes-ukraine-support-a-top-priority-says-he-ll-work-with-any-us-president/7805996.html	2024-10-01T06:24:01-07:00

Nigerians gather to mobilize hope amid growing burden of childhood cancers	Abuja — Hundreds gathered in Abuja, Nigeria for the 2024 Childhood Cancer Awareness Walk, raising awareness and support for pediatric cancer. Despite progress in cancer care, Nigerian children face high costs and delayed diagnoses, which the walk aims to address. Titilayo Adewumi joined the walk with her 13-year-old son Shittu, diagnosed with leukemia at age 5. With support from the Okapi Children Cancer Foundation, Shittu is now cancer-free. Adewumi recounts the toll her son's cancer diagnosis took on her family. 'I had to stop working for like 4 - 5 years so I could concentrate on him,' she said. 'We went out of cash, we didn't have money, that is when the Okapi visited us ... I was so excited when the doctor told me that he was free of cancer, I felt like jumping into the roof and back I was so happy because it was not easy.' Among the walkers was Izuyor Tobi. He brought his daughter Hope, who battled neuroblastoma. Treatment costs nearly drained the family’s finances until Okapi intervened. Today, Hope is healthy. Tobi believes that spreading awareness about pediatric cancer will save lives. 'If not for Okapi Children Cancer Foundation, I don't think my daughter will be alive today... What I do is to create more awareness by telling people what Okapi Children Cancer Foundation has done for my daughter,' he said. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80% of childhood cancers occur in low-income countries like Nigeria, where many cases go undiagnosed or are detected late. Pediatric oncologist Ifeoma Ezeukwu from the Federal Medical Center explained barriers to care. 'Ignorance is also another barrier,' she said. 'I have come across so many people who will tell you, I never knew children could have cancer. ... Early detection is key to survival in childhood cancer unlike the adult cancers; children, the prognosis are better in them when they are seen early, once you capture cancer early, you know that cure is what is expected.' Kemi Adekanye founded the Okapi Children Cancer Foundation in 2017 and has been mobilizing community awareness and support. Funded by friends and family, the foundation has helped over 200 children access treatment, despite costs starting at $180. Adekanye says they’re focused on influencing government action for pediatric cancer. 'As of today, there's currently no supports being provided to children battling cancer, so we expect the government to intervene in terms of subsidizing treatment costs for children battling cancer, as well as equipping our hospitals more so people don't have to travel far and wide to access oncology centers,' she said. Health policy analyst Ejike Oji called for systemic reforms across Nigeria to ease the burden on families. 'The government should establish dedicated pediatric oncology wards across the country to provide grounds for training health care professionals to ensure their skills are good in diagnosing and treating childhood cancer,' he said. 'If you look at the cancer from diagnosis to treatment, it's a lot of money. Radiotherapy is one of the most expensive; most families cannot afford.' The large turnout at the 8th Childhood Cancer Awareness Walk — 'Bridge The Gap' —showed the power of community mobilization. Nigerians are advocating for better health care, early diagnosis and family support, ensuring no child faces cancer alone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerians-gather-to-mobilize-hope-amid-growing-burden-of-childhood-cancers-/7805884.html	2024-10-01T04:54:58-07:00	
North Korean defector in South stole bus in bid to return home, media reports say	SEOUL — A North Korean defector living in South Korea was detained on Tuesday after ramming a stolen bus into a barricade on a bridge near the heavily militarized border, in an apparent attempt to get back to the North, Yonhap news agency reported. The incident took place at around 1:30 a.m. (16:30 GMT on Monday) at the Tongil Bridge in Paju, northwest of the capital Seoul, after the man ignored warnings from soldiers guarding the bridge and attempted to drive through, Yonhap said, citing city police. Paju police referred queries on the incident to provincial police authorities. The northern Gyeonggi police agency could not be reached for comment. The man aged in his 30s who had defected more than a decade ago told police that he was trying to return to North Korea after struggling to settle in the South, the report said. It is highly unusual for North Koreans who have fled their isolated country to try to return, though many struggle to adapt to life in their democratic, capitalist neighbor. As of June, around 34,200 North Koreans had resettled in South Korea, mostly after arduous, sometimes life-threatening journeys, usually via China, to escape poverty and oppression at home, according to Seoul's unification ministry. The ministry, which handles cross-border affairs and provides resettlement support for defectors, said in 2022 that about 30 defectors were confirmed to have returned to the North since 2012, but defectors and activists say there could be many more unreported cases. In early 2022, a defector in his 30s made a rare, risky return to North Korea across the heavily fortified border after struggling to cope in the South, igniting fresh debate over how such escapees are treated in their new home country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korean-defector-in-south-stole-bus-in-bid-to-return-home-media-reports-say-/7805880.html	2024-10-01T04:40:19-07:00	
School bus catches fire outside Bangkok and more than 20 are feared dead, officials say	BANGKOK — A bus carrying young students with their teachers caught fire in suburban Bangkok on Tuesday, with more than 20 of those on board feared dead, officials and rescuers said. The bus was carrying 44 passengers from central Uthai Thani province for a school trip in Ayutthaya and Nonthaburi provinces, Transport Minister Suriya Jungrungruengkit told reporters at the scene. Videos posted on social media showed the entire bus engulfed in fire with huge plumes of black smoke pouring out as it stood on the side of the road. Bodies were still inside the bus hours after the fire. The students on the bus were reported to be in elementary and junior high school. Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said officials could not yet confirm the number of fatalities because they had not finished investigating the scene. He said the driver survived but appeared to have fled and could not yet be found. Anutin had earlier said 25 were feared dead, but Piyalak Thinkaew, a rescuer of the Ruamkatanyu Foundation told reporters later that two more survivors had been found, reducing the number of those still missing to 23 — three teachers and 20 students. Rescuers and officials were able to access the bus hours after the fire was put out. Piyalak said they were still unable to identify the bodies, most of which were found in the middle and back seats, leading them to assume that the fire started at the front of the bus. Thai media reports and rescuers said the bus was heading to Nonthaburi when the fire started around noon in Pathum Thani province, a northern suburb of the capital. A rescuer at the scene told Suriya that the fire likely started after one of the tires exploded and the vehicle scraped against a road barrier. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra offered her condolences in a post on social media platform X, saying the government would take care of medical expenses and compensate the victims’ families. The Patrangsit Hospital, which is located near the scene, said in a news conference that it admitted three young girls, one of whom suffered burns to the face, mouth and eye.	https://www.voanews.com/a/school-bus-catches-fire-outside-bangkok-and-more-than-20-are-feared-dead-officials-say-/7805873.html	2024-10-01T04:32:54-07:00	
Lawyer: Tunisia presidential candidate jailed for 12 years	Tunis — Tunisian politician Ayachi Zammel, a candidate in the north African country's October 6 presidential election, has been jailed for 12 years, his lawyer said on Tuesday. 'The court in Tunis sentenced Ayachi Zammel to 12 years in prison in four cases' related to voter endorsements, lawyer Abdessater Messoudi told AFP. Messoudi said Zammel 'remains a candidate in the election' on Sunday. The frontrunner is incumbent President Kais Saied, who was elected in 2019 but later orchestrated a sweeping power grab that included dissolving parliament and replacing it with a legislature with limited powers. Former lawmaker Zammel heads a small liberal party, and had been one of just two candidates approved by Tunisia's electoral authority ISIE to challenge Saied for the top post. Ahead of the vote, ISIE had rejected the bids of some 14 hopefuls. It eventually presented a final list of just three candidates — Saied, former parliamentarian Zouhair Maghzaoui and businessman Zammel. On September 18, his lawyer said Zammel had been handed a 20-month prison term for charges related to forging voter endorsements.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lawyer-tunisia-presidential-candidate-jailed-for-12-years/7805859.html	2024-10-01T04:26:05-07:00	
Chinese woman arrested in Germany on suspicion of espionage, prosecutor says	Berlin — A Chinese woman has been arrested in the German city of Leipzig on suspicion of foreign agent activities and passing on information regarding arms deliveries, the prosecutor general said in a statement on Tuesday. The suspect, named only as Yaqi X, is accused of passing on information obtained while working for a logistics company at Leipzig/Halle airport to a member of the Chinese secret service, who is being prosecuted separately, the statement said. The second Chinese national, named as Jian G, was working as an aide to Maximilian Krah, a member of the European Parliament for the far-right Alternative for Germany, when he was arrested this year on suspicion of 'especially severe' espionage on behalf of Beijing. The information passed along by Yaqi X in 2023 and 2024 included flight, cargo and passenger data as well as details on the transportation of military equipment and people with ties to a German arms company, the prosecutor general said. The Chinese Embassy in Berlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Anxiety about alleged Chinese spying has risen across Western Europe recently. Beijing has denied the accusations, saying these stem from a 'Cold War mindset' and are designed to poison the atmosphere for cooperation between China and Europe. Tensions have also been simmering between Berlin and Beijing over the past year after Chancellor Olaf Scholz unveiled a strategy to de-risk Germany's economic relationship with China, calling Beijing a 'partner, competitor and systemic rival.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-woman-arrested-in-germany-on-suspicion-of-espionage-prosecutor-says-/7805844.html	2024-10-01T04:09:32-07:00	
China marks 75 years of Communist Party rule as economic challenges and security threats linger	BEIJING — China is marking the 75th year of Communist Party rule as economic challenges and security threats linger over the massive state. No festivities have been announced for the occasion Tuesday, save for a flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square, with an honor guard marching from the entrance of the sprawling palace that in past centuries was the home of Chinese emperors. The entirely state-controlled media ran constant reports on China's economic progress and social stability, with no mention of challenges ranging from a declining birth rate to the disruption in supply chains that has harmed the largely export-driven economy. Commemorations were also held in the former British colony of Hong Kong and Portugal's former territory of Macao, both of which returned to Chinese sovereignty in the late 1990s in a key indication of Beijing's determination to overcome what it has called a 'Century of Humiliation.' In recent decades, China has mounted military parades and displays of the country's economic might only at the turn of decades, such as for the 60th and 70th anniversaries. The world’s second largest economy has struggled to regain momentum after the COVID-19 pandemic. A prolonged property slump led to a spillover effect on other parts of the economy, from construction to sales of home appliances. Last week, China announced a slew of measures to boost the economy, including lower interest rates and smaller down payment requirements for mortgages. Party leader and head of state Xi Jinping has largely avoided overseas travel since the pandemic, while continuing with his purges at home of top officials considered insufficiently loyal or being suspected of corruption or personal indiscretions. 'The road ahead will not be smooth, there will definitely be difficulties and obstacles, and we may encounter major tests such as high winds and rough seas, or even stormy waves' Xi warned during a banquet on the eve of the anniversary. 'We must be vigilant in times of peace, plan ahead, and rely closely on the entire Party, the entire army, and people of all ethnic groups across the country,' he said, adding 'no difficulties can stop the Chinese people from moving forward.' The anniversary also comes as China is facing growing frictions with neighbors including Japan, South Korea and the Philippines over territorial claims and their close relationships with Beijing’s chief rival, the United States. The Communists under Mao Zedong seized power in 1949 amid a civil war with the Nationalists, also known as the KMT, led by Chiang Kai-shek, who shifted their political, economic and military power to the now self-governing island democracy of Taiwan. Beijing continues to insist Taiwan must be annexed under Communist Party rule, by force if necessary, while the U.S. has provided arms to ensure its defense. China, meanwhile, has involved itself in disputes over its claims to most of the South China Sea and uninhabited islands held by Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and other neighboring nations. China's military buildup and its recent launch of a nuclear capable ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean have raised concerns about a possible conflict. At home, Xi has made himself effectively leader for life by ending term limits and extending his power over key government and party bodies. China allows no competitive elections and the party retains near total control over the media that informs its 1.4 billion people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-marks-75-years-of-communist-party-rule-as-economic-challenges-and-security-threats-linger-/7805834.html	2024-10-01T04:00:39-07:00

Taiwan warns of storm surge from Typhoon Krathon, mobilizes troops	KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan — Taiwan mobilized nearly 40,000 troops on Tuesday to be on standby for rescue efforts as powerful Typhoon Krathon approached its populous southwest coast, which is bracing for a storm surge. As the typhoon approached, helicopters lifted to safety 19 sailors forced to abandon ship when it took on water. Some flights were canceled, a rail line was closed and in the major port city of Kaohsiung, shops and restaurants shut and streets were mostly deserted. Taiwan regularly gets hit by typhoons, but they generally land along the mountainous and sparsely populated east coast facing the Pacific. This one will make landfall on the island's flat western plain. Krathon is forecast to hit Kaohsiung early on Wednesday afternoon, then work its way across the center of Taiwan heading northeast and cross out into the East China Sea, the Central Weather Administration said. Kaohsiung, home to some 2.7 million people, declared a holiday and told people to stay at home as Krathon - labeled a super typhoon by the U.S. military's Joint Typhoon Warning Center - approached. Li Meng-hsiang, a forecaster for Taiwan's Central Weather Administration, said the storm has reached its maximum intensity and could weaken slightly as it moves closer to Taiwan, warning of gusts of more than 150 kph for the southwest. 'The storm surge might bring tides inland,' Li said. 'If it's raining heavily, it will make it difficult to discharge waters and as a result coastal areas will be subject to flooding.' Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai, speaking to reporters after a disaster management meeting, said the strength and path of the storm were both on par with 1977's Typhoon Thelma which killed 37 people and devastated the city. 'After the typhoon, the whole of Kaohsiung was without water and electricity, just like a war,' Chen said, recalling the decades-ago destruction. 'As much as possible, limit going out.' Taiwan's defense ministry said it had put more than 38,000 troops on standby, as Kaohsiung residents made their own preparations. 'It's going to strike us directly. We must be fully prepared,' said fisherman Chen Ming-huang, as he tightened ropes on his boat in Kaohsiung harbor. 'In the worst-case scenario the ropes might snap and my boat could drift away.' TSMC, the world's largest contract chip maker and a major supplier to Apple and Nvidia and which has a large factory in neighboring Tainan, said it had activated routine typhoon preparations and did not expect a significant impact to its operations. Search for sailors Off the southeast coast, Taiwan rescue helicopters lifted to safety 19 sailors from a listing cargo vessel traveling from China to Singapore, the government said. The sailors were taken to shelter on Taiwan's remote Orchid Island. The transport ministry said 88 domestic flights and 24 international ones had been canceled, with boats to outlying islands also stopped. It added that all domestic flights - 234 in total - would stop on Wednesday. The rail line connecting southern to eastern Taiwan was closed, though the north-south high-speed line was operating as normal, albeit with enhanced safety checks for wind and debris. In Kaohsiung, most shops and restaurants pulled down their shutters, and traditional wet markets shut with streets mostly deserted. At a building in Siaogang district, home to the city's airport, residents practiced how to rapidly set up metal barriers to stop water flooding into the underground parking lot. 'We will have only a few minutes to react if the flooding is coming,' said Chiu Yun-ping, deputy head of the building's residents' committee. Chen Mei-ling, who lives near the harbor, said in past typhoons high tides reached just a few meters from her house's main door and she had made preparations. 'We've got torches and emergency food supplies,' Chen said. 'It's a strong typhoon and we are worried.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-warns-of-storm-surge-from-typhoon-krathon-mobilizes-troops/7805768.html	2024-10-01T01:58:43-07:00	
India police detain 600 workers, union members as Samsung protests escalate	CHENNAI, India — Indian police on Tuesday said they have detained around 600 Samsung Electronics workers and union members for organizing a street protest, as a strike at the South Korean firm's home appliances plant in Tamil Nadu state entered its fourth week. More than 1,000 workers have disrupted operations and protested in a makeshift tent close to the factory near the city of Chennai since Sept. 9. They have demanded higher wages and union recognition at the plant, which accounts for roughly a third of Samsung's annual Indian revenue of $12 billion. Charles Sam Rajadurai, a senior state police official, said Samsung employees and workers linked to labor group CITU, which is leading the protest, were detained as their protest march near Chennai was inconveniencing the public. 'They are being detained in four wedding halls,' he said. On Sept. 16, police detained 104 striking Samsung workers for almost a day. The protests cast a shadow over Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive for foreign investors to 'Make in India' and is India's biggest such strike in recent years. Samsung has said the striking workers risk losing their jobs. Samsung did not respond to a request for comment. It previously said the average monthly salary of full-time manufacturing workers at the plant is nearly double that of similar workers in the region, and that it was open to engaging with workers and to resolve the matter. Samsung workers at the factory currently earn $300-$375 on average each month, CITU said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-police-detain-600-workers-union-members-as-samsung-protests-escalate/7805751.html	2024-10-01T01:05:18-07:00	
Factories reopen amid garment sector unrest in Bangladesh	DHAKA, Bangladesh — Most garment factories in Bangladesh reopened on Tuesday, a day after violent protests over a pay hike left one worker dead and several others injured, officials said. Bangladesh, one of the world’s largest garment producers and a supplier to western brands such as H&M, Zara and Carrefour, has been facing widespread protests in recent weeks, leading to the closure of dozens of factories. The protests have worsened an already significant production backlog caused by recent political turmoil and devastating floods, industry insiders said. 'Most of the factories are open today, and everything is going well so far,' said Abdullah Hil Rakib, senior vice president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. He added that only five or six small factories remain closed, as they were unable to clear payments. Rakib said that unrest persists in the sector, largely due to certain groups spreading rumors and taking advantage of the worsening law and order situation. He urged the government to enhance security measures, as some factory owners are unable to operate due to vandalism and ongoing disruptions. 'Stronger security is essential to keep production running smoothly and protect our industry,' Rakib said. A labor ministry official said that a separate review committee is currently assessing the industry's capacity to revise the wage structure and is expected to submit a report soon. The government is also reviewing police cases filed against workers to ensure they are not subjected to harassment, the official added. Garment factory owners have called on the government to take immediate steps to restore order and ensure the safety of their operations, as the unrest threatens to disrupt an industry that accounts for more than 80% of the country’s export earnings. Last year, Bangladesh was ranked the third-largest exporter of clothing globally, after China and the European Union, exporting $38.4 billion worth of garments in 2023, according to the World Trade Organization. The ongoing unrest comes at a critical moment for Bangladesh, as the country’s interim government, led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, has taken control following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The former prime minister fled to India in early August after the deadliest violence in Bangladesh since its independence in 1971, which claimed over 700 lives. Industry leaders have warned that if the unrest continues, global brands may shift production to other countries, such as Indonesia, India, and Pakistan. 'Workers should think: if the industry doesn't survive, will they?' said a garment factory owner.	https://www.voanews.com/a/factories-reopen-amid-garment-sector-unrest-in-bangladesh/7805750.html	2024-10-01T00:57:28-07:00

Biden plans survey of devastation in North Carolina as Helene's death toll tops 130	ASHEVILLE, N.C. — President Joe Biden was set to survey the devastation in the mountains of Western North Carolina on Wednesday, where exhausted emergency workers continued to work around-the-clock to clear roads, restore power and cellphone service, and reach people left stranded by Hurricane Helene. The storm killed at least 133 people and hundreds more were still unaccounted for on Monday night, four days after Helene initially made landfall. Meanwhile, election officials across the South were making emergency preparations to ensure displaced residents would be able to vote in the upcoming presidential election. Officials in the hard-hit tourism hub of Asheville said their water system suffered 'catastrophic' damage that could take weeks to fully repair. Government officials, aid groups and volunteers were working to deliver supplies by air, truck and even mule to the town and surrounding mountain communities. At least 40 people died in the county that includes Asheville. The North Carolina death toll included one horrific story after another of people who were trapped by floodwaters in their homes and vehicles or were killed by falling trees. A courthouse security officer died after being submerged inside his truck. A couple and a 6-year-old boy waiting to be rescued on a rooftop drowned when part of their home collapsed. Rescuers did manage to save dozens, including an infant and two others stuck on the top of a car in Atlanta. More than 50 hospital patients and staff in Tennessee were plucked by helicopter from the hospital rooftop in a daring rescue operation. How some of the worst-hit areas are coping The storm unleashed the worst flooding in a century in North Carolina. Rainfall estimates in some areas topped more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) since Wednesday, and several main routes into Asheville were washed away or blocked by mudslides. That includes a 6.4-kilometer section of Interstate 40 that was heavily damaged. Joey Hopkins, North Carolina’s secretary of transportation, asked people on Monday to stay off the roads. 'The damage is severe, and we’re continuing to tell folks if you don’t have a reason to be in North Carolina, do not travel on the roads of western North Carolina,' Hopkins said at a news conference. 'We do not want you here if you don’t live here and you’re not helping with the storm.' At an Ingles grocery store in Asheville, Elizabeth Teall-Fleming was standing in line with dozens of others waiting to get inside and hoping to find some non-perishable food, since they have no power. She planned to heat up some canned food over a camping stove for her family. 'I’m just glad that they’re open and that they’re able to let us in,' she said. Teall-Fleming said she was surprised by the ferocity of the storm. 'Just seeing the little bit of news that we’ve been able to see has been shocking and really sad.' In one neighborhood, residents were collecting creek water in buckets to flush their toilets. Others waited in a line for more than a block at Mountain Valley Water to fill up milk jugs and whatever other containers they could find with drinking water. Derek Farmer, who brought three gallon-sized apple juice containers, said he had been prepared for the storm but now was nervous after three days without water. 'I just didn’t know how bad it was going to be,' Farmer said. Helene roared ashore in northern Florida late Thursday as a Category 4 hurricane and quickly moved north. The storm upended life throughout the Southeast, where deaths were also reported in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Virginia. Officials warned that rebuilding would be lengthy and difficult. Federal Emergency Management Agency officials said Monday that shelters were housing more than 1,000 people. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper took an aerial tour of the Asheville area and later met with workers distributing meals. 'This has been an unprecedented storm that has hit western North Carolina,' he said afterward. 'It’s requiring an unprecedented response.' Worries about the presidential election Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said during an emergency board meeting on Monday that they are looking at options for voters in the hardest-hit counties. She planned to provide more information at a Tuesday news conference, including how someone could declare 'natural disaster' as their reason for not being able to provide a photo ID. Election employees across Georgia returned to work even as some offices faced power outages, limited internet and infrastructure damage. In Lowndes County, staff at the local board of elections were working off of two computers instead of the usual eight, said election supervisor Deb Cox. The office is also without wifi. 'We’re fully up and running as of this morning,' said Cox. 'It’s just slower than normal because we have less resources.' In Columbia County, poll worker training will still begin this week, said Nancy Gay, the county’s elections director, but she may have to change the location because of the power outage. 'Our poll workers are being affected,' Gay said. 'They don’t have power. They don’t have gas. You’ve got to allow the workers time to process everything and try and get a plan in place before I can really expect them to come and show up for training.' Mark Ard at the Florida Secretary of State’s office said the Division of Elections is recommending that local elections supervisors reach out to U.S. Post Office officials to discuss a mitigation plan for ballot mailing, delivery, and return. Why western North Carolina was hit so hard Western North Carolina suffered relatively more devastation because that’s where the remnants of Helene encountered the higher elevations and cooler air of the Appalachian Mountains, causing even more rain to fall. Asheville and many surrounding mountain towns were built in valleys, leaving them especially vulnerable to devastating rain and flooding. Plus, the ground already was saturated before Helene arrived, said Christiaan Patterson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. 'By the time Helene came into the Carolinas, we already had that rain on top of more rain,' Patterson said. Climate change has exacerbated conditions that allow such storms to thrive, rapidly intensifying in warming waters and turning into powerful cyclones, sometimes within hours. Destruction from Florida to Virginia Along Florida's Gulf Coast, several feet of water swamped the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, forcing workers to move two manatees and sea turtles. All of the animals were safe but much of the aquarium’s vital equipment was damaged or destroyed, said James Powell, the aquarium’s executive director. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said the storm 'literally spared no one.' Most people in and around Augusta, a city of about 200,000 near the South Carolina border, were still without power Monday. With at least 30 killed in South Carolina, Helene was the deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the state since Hurricane Hugo made landfall north of Charleston in 1989, killing 35 people. Tropical Storm Kirk forms and could become a powerful hurricane Tropical Storm Kirk formed Monday in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to become a 'large and powerful hurricane' by Tuesday night or Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The storm was located about 1,285 kilometers west of the Cabo Verde Islands with maximum sustained winds of 95 kph. There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect, and the storm system was not a threat to land.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-plans-survey-of-devastation-in-north-carolina-as-helene-s-death-toll-tops-130-/7805733.html	2024-09-30T23:56:26-07:00	
Claudia Sheinbaum to be sworn in as 1st female president of Mexico	MEXICO CITY — Claudia Sheinbaum will take the oath of office Tuesday as Mexico’s first female president in more than 200 years of independence, promising to protect an expanded social safety net and fight for the poor like her predecessor, but facing pressing problems. The 62-year-old scientist-turned-politician will receive a country with a number of immediate challenges, foremost among them stubbornly high levels of violence, a sluggish economy and hurricane-battered Acapulco. Sheinbaum romped to victory in June with nearly 60% of the vote, propelled largely by the sustained popularity of her political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. He took office six years ago declaring 'For the good of all, first the poor,' and promising historical change from the neoliberal economic policies of his predecessors. Sheinbaum promised continuity from his popular social policies to controversial constitutional reforms to the judiciary and National Guard rammed through during his final days in office. Despite her pledge of continuity, she is a very different personality. 'López Obrador was a tremendously charismatic president and many times that charisma allowed him to cover up some political errors that Claudia Sheinbaum will not have that possibility of doing,' said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political analyst at Mexico’s Center for Economic Research and Teaching. 'So, where López Obrador was charismatic, Claudia Sheinbaum will have to be effective.' He is not leaving her an easy situation. Her first trip as president will be to the flood-stricken Pacific coast resort of Acapulco. Hurricane John, which struck as a Category 3 hurricane last week and then reemerged into the ocean and struck again as a tropical storm, caused four days of incredibly heavy rain that killed at least 17 people along the coast around Acapulco. Acapulco was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, and had not recovered from that blow when John hit. Sheinbaum must also deal with raging violence in the cartel-dominated northern city of Culiacan, where factional fighting within the Sinaloa cartel broke out after drug lords Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after they flew there in a small plane on July 25. López Obrador has long sought to avoid confronting Mexico’s drug cartels and has openly appealed to the gangs to keep the peace among themselves, but the limitations of that strategy have become glaringly apparent in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, where gun battles have raged on the city’s streets. Local authorities and even the army — which López Obrador has relied on for everything — have essentially admitted that the fighting will only end when the cartel bosses decide to end it. But that’s only the latest hotspot. Drug-related violence is surging from Tijuana in the north to Chiapas in the south, displacing thousands. While Sheinbaum inherits a huge budget deficit, unfinished construction projects and a burgeoning bill for her party’s cash hand-out programs — all of which could send financial markets tumbling — perhaps her biggest looming concern is the possibility of a victory for Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election. Trump has already vowed to slap 100% tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico. Though that would likely violate the current U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, there are other things Trump could do to make life difficult for Sheinbaum, including his pledge of massive deportations. Things with its northern neighbor were already tense after López Obrador said he was putting relations with the U.S. embassy 'on pause' after public criticism of the proposed judicial overhaul. First lady Jill Biden struck an optimistic tone for relations with the incoming Sheinbaum administration saying at a reception Monday that, 'Under Dr. Sheinbaum’s presidency I know we will continue to build a more prosperous, safe and democratic region — and take the steps in our U.S.-Mexico partnership.' There are areas where Sheinbaum could try to take Mexico in a new direction. For example, she has a Ph.D. in energy engineering and has spoken of the need to address climate change. López Obrador built a massive new oil refinery and poured money into the state-owned oil company. But his budget commitments do not leave her much room to maneuver. Jennifer Piscopo, professor of gender and politics at the Royal Holloway University of London who has studied Latin America for decades, said Mexico electing its first female leader is important because it will show girls they can do it too, but it can also create unrealistic expectations. 'Woman firsts are powerful symbols, but they do not gain magic power,' she said. 'Especially when the governance challenges are so large, expecting magic solutions overnight can also generate outsized disappointment.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/claudia-sheinbaum-to-be-sworn-in-as-1st-female-president-of-mexico/7805717.html	2024-09-30T22:56:09-07:00	
Dockworkers from Maine to Texas go on strike, risking new shortages	PHILADELPHIA — Dockworkers at ports from Maine to Texas began walking picket lines early Tuesday in a strike over wages and automation that could reignite inflation and cause shortages of goods if it goes on more than a few weeks. The contract between the ports and about 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen’s Association expired at midnight, and even though progress was reported in talks on Monday, the workers went on strike. The strike affecting 36 ports is the first by the union since 1977. Workers began picketing at the Port of Philadelphia shortly after midnight, walking in a circle at a rail crossing outside the port and chanting 'No work without a fair contract.' The union had message boards on the side of a truck reading: 'Automation Hurts Families: ILA Stands For Job Protection.' At Port Houston, which is in the Central time zone an hour behind the East Coast, at least 50 workers gathered outside the port with signs saying 'No Work Without a Fair Contract.' They appeared poised to begin picketing. Workers showed a statement from the ILA on the strike saying that employers have refused to compensate workers fairly. 'The ILA is fighting for respect, appreciation and fairness in a world in which corporations are dead set on replacing hard-working people with automation,' the statement said. 'Robots do not pay taxes and they do not spend money in their communities.' The U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports, said Monday evening that both sides had moved off of their previous wage offers, but when picket lines went up just after midnight, it was apparent that no deal had been reached. The union’s opening offer in the talks was for a 77% pay raise over the six-year life of the contract, with President Harold Daggett saying it’s necessary to make up for inflation and years of small raises. ILA members make a base salary of about $81,000 per year, but some can pull in over $200,000 annually with large amounts of overtime. But Monday evening, the alliance said it had increased its offer to 50% raises over six years, and it pledged to keep limits on automation in place from the old contract. The union wants a complete ban on automation. It wasn’t clear just how far apart both sides are. 'We are hopeful that this could allow us to fully resume collective bargaining around the other outstanding issues in an effort to reach an agreement,' the alliance statement said. The union didn’t answer requests for comment on the talks Monday night, but said earlier in the day that the ports had refused demands for a fair contract and the alliance seemed intent on a strike. The two sides had not held formal negotiations since June. The alliance said its offer tripled employer contributions to retirement plans and strengthened health care options. During the day Monday, some ports already were preparing for a strike. The Port of Virginia, for instance, was in the process of ceasing operations. It accepted the last inbound train for delivery at 8 a.m., closed its gates to inbound trucks at noon and required ships to leave by 1 p.m. Cargo operations halted at 6 p.m. 'We are handling this just like we would during the ramp up to a possible hurricane,' Joe Harris, the port’s spokesperson, told The Associated Press. 'And we will bring it back online just as we would recovering from a hurricane. We have an experienced team. We’ve done this in the past.' Supply chain experts say consumers won’t see an immediate impact from the strike because most retailers stocked up on goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items. But if it goes more than a few weeks, a work stoppage would significantly snarl the nation’s supply chain, potentially leading to higher prices and delays in goods reaching households and businesses. If drawn out, the strike will force businesses to pay shippers for delays and cause some goods to arrive late for peak holiday shopping season — potentially impacting delivery of anything from toys or artificial Christmas trees to cars, coffee and fruit. The strike will likely have an almost immediate impact on supplies of perishable imports like bananas, for example. The ports affected by the strike handle 3.8 million metric tons of bananas each year, or 75% of the nation’s supply, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. It also could snarl exports from East Coast ports and create traffic jams at ports on the West Coast, where workers are represented by a different union. Railroads say they can ramp up to carry more freight from the West Coast, but analysts say they can’t make up the cargo handled to the east. 'If the strikes go ahead, they will cause enormous delays across the supply chain, a ripple effect which will no doubt roll into 2025 and cause chaos across the industry,' noted Jay Dhokia, founder of supply chain management and logistics firm Pro3PL. J.P. Morgan estimated that a strike that shuts down East and Gulf coast ports could cost the economy $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion per day, with some of that recovered over time after normal operations resume. The strike comes just weeks before the presidential election and could become a factor if there are shortages. Retailers, auto parts suppliers and produce importers had hoped for a settlement or that President Joe Biden would intervene and end the strike using the Taft-Hartley Act, which allows him to seek an 80-day cooling off period. But during an exchange with reporters on Sunday, Biden, who has worked to court union votes for Democrats, said 'no' when asked if he planned to intervene in the potential work stoppage. A White House official said Monday that at Biden’s direction, the administration has been in regular communication with the ILA and the alliance to keep the negotiations moving forward. The president directed Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard to convene the alliance’s board members Monday afternoon and urge them to resolve the dispute fairly and quickly — in a way that accounts for the success of shipping companies in recent years and contributions of union workers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dockworkers-from-maine-to-texas-go-on-strike-risking-new-shortages-/7805712.html	2024-09-30T22:46:46-07:00	
Exclusive: AFRICOM Chief says Islamic State doubles size in north Somalia	PENTAGON — Islamic State in Somalia has approximately doubled in size over the past year, the chief of U.S. Africa Command told VOA. 'I am concerned about the northern part of Somalia and ISIS growing in numbers,' AFRICOM commander Gen. Michael Langley said in an exclusive interview, using an acronym for the terror group. Langley declined to provide the United States’ estimate of how many Islamic State fighters are in Somalia, other than to say that the group’s had grown about 'twofold' in the past year. Previous estimates have put the number of Islamic State fighters in north Somalia at about 200 fighters. The AFRICOM commander also warned about the possibility of Islamic State increasing its foreign fighter presence in Somalia. Somali Brigadier General Abdi Hassan Hussein, the former intelligence and police commander of Puntland, where Islamic State is located in the north, told VOA earlier this year that the number of Islamic State foreign fighters there alone is estimated in the hundreds. This figure has yet to be confirmed by local authorities. A U.S. official told VOA in June that Abdulqadir Mumin, the leader of Islamic State in Somalia, had been targeted in an American airstrike in May. Mumin appears to have survived the strike. Asked whether Mumin was now the global leader of IS, Langley said the U.S. must take those reports as 'credible.' 'ISIS professes that. Sometimes you’ve got to take that seriously,' he said. Al-Shabab The increase in Islamic State fighters in northern Somalia comes as the al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabab has exploited diplomatic disagreements between Somalia and Ethiopia to raise its recruitment numbers. Landlocked Ethiopia and Somalia’s breakaway Somaliland region signed a memorandum of understanding earlier this year to use its Red Sea port of Berbera, a deal that Somalia has rejected. Somali Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre on Friday accused Ethiopia, before the U.N. General Assembly, of actions that 'flagrantly violate' Somalia's territorial integrity. 'The have used that (dispute) to their advantage,' Langley told VOA. Al-Shabab has been back at high numbers of between 12,000 to 13,000 fighters due to strong financing and heavy recruitment efforts, senior defense officials told VOA in June. The political rift has bled into counter-terror cooperation between Addis Ababa and Mogadishu, with Langley telling VOA that Somali operations with Ethiopia have been 'limited.' 'Time will tell if they can settle their differences and coalesce into a force that's very effective, because when they do work together, they're very, very effective at clearing out al-Shabab.’’ Al-Shabab has continued attacks on civilians, including in the Mogadishu area. The terror group claimed responsibility for a gun attack and suicide bombing that killed at least 32 people in August on a popular beach in the Somalia’s capital. The group is also suspected to have carried out two deadly bombings on Saturday, one in Middle Shabelle region and another about one kilometer from the president’s office. Al-Shabab has suffered defeats from the South West State of Somalia down to the Juba River Valley and has sought to reset and counter-attack in those areas. However, in central Somalia, al-Shabab has reversed gains made by Somali forces over the last two years as government forces failed to hold the terrain they had retaken, according to senior U.S. defense officials. 'We need a credible holding force, because sometimes shadow governments of al-Shabaab try to re-insert themselves back in that region and try to influence some of the local leaders,' Langley said. He said the time following the clearing and liberating of a region is a 'very fragile period' where Somalia and partners like the U.S. Agency for International Development can initiate local services that will increase the population’s faith in the federal government. 'If they can’t sustain that because they’re moving to the next region or next district, it ebbs,' he said, adding that U.S. training was currently focused on helping Somali forces hold liberated terrain. The Somali government has pointed to the El Dheer and Harardhere areas as evidence that some liberated terrain in central Somalia remains under government control. ATMIS transition Later this year, the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia will leave the country after nearly two years of helping Somalia fight al-Shabab terrorists and will be replaced in 2025 by a new African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia. Which forces will be comprised in the mission is still being worked out by the African Union and the United Nations. Langley ruled out any U.S. role in the transition, saying American forces would maintain only their advise-and-assist mission. 'Our piece of enabling is not our boots on the ground. We’re there to advise and assist, and assist in their training, but the fight is theirs,' he told VOA. Houthis In addition to Islamic State and al-Shabab, Somalia also must worry about Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, just north of Somalia across the Gulf of Aden, whom Langley says have 'aspirations' to collaborate with al-Shabab. 'We're concerned, and we're closely watching that, because this can turn into a bad neighborhood real quick,' he said. Should the Houthis and al-Shabab put pressure on the Gulf of Aden from opposite sides, Langley worries that squeezing this strategic choke point could further hinder the free flow of commerce and affect the global economy. And analysts fear that Houthis could insert more sophisticated weapons into the fight for Somalia. Houthi militants have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October, seizing one, sinking two and killing at least four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets. The Houthi militant campaign began after Israel launched a retaliatory attack against Hamas in Gaza following Hamas' October 7 terror attack, and the Houthis claim they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians during the war.

FBI to pay $22M to settle claims of sexual discrimination at training academy	WASHINGTON — The FBI agreed Monday to pay more than $22 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging female recruits were singled out for dismissal in training and routinely harassed by instructors with sexually charged comments about their breast size, false allegations of infidelity and the need to take contraception 'to control their moods.' The payout to 34 women dismissed from the FBI's training academy in Quantico, Virginia — still subject to approval by a federal judge — would rank among the biggest lawsuit settlements in the history of the bureau. 'These problems are pervasive within the FBI and the attitudes that created them were learned at the academy,' said David J. Shaffer, the lawyer for the women. 'This case will make important major changes in these attitudes.' Filed in 2019, the lawsuit contends that female recruits had been subjected to a hostile working environment in which they were judged more harshly than their male peers and 'excessively targeted for correction and dismissal in tactical situations for perceived lack of judgment' and subjective 'suitability.' One of the women said she was admonished to 'smile more' and subjected to repeated sexual advances. Another said an instructor leered at her and stared at her chest, 'sometimes while licking his lips.' 'Through passive tolerance,' the lawsuit said, 'the FBI has intentionally allowed the Good Old Boy Network to flourish unrestrained at the FBI Academy.' The FBI said in a statement Monday that the bureau has 'taken significant steps over the past five years to further ensure gender equity in the training and development of all our trainees.' Many of the allegations in the lawsuit were confirmed in a 2022 internal watchdog report. Men still make up some three-quarters of the bureau's special agents despite efforts to diversify in recent years. Among the provisions of the settlement was that the FBI would offer the plaintiffs a chance to continue training toward becoming agents, with 'guaranteed placement' for those who pass in one of their top three preferred field offices. The bureau also has agreed to a review by outside experts who will work to ensure that female recruits face a fair evaluation process. Some of the women have moved on to other careers, Shaffer said, adding 'the FBI has deprived itself of some genuinely exceptional talent.' Paula Bird, a lead plaintiff in the case who is now a lawyer, said that while the experience has been 'disillusioning,' she was 'pleased that this settlement will bring a measure of justice to the women who were unfairly dismissed.' The lawsuit came amid a flurry of sexual misconduct claims within the bureau that included several against senior FBI officials identified in an Associated Press investigation who quietly left the bureau with full benefits even after allegations against them were substantiated. Those claims ranged from unwanted touching and advances to coercion. In one case, an FBI assistant director retired after the inspector general's office concluded he harassed a female subordinate and sought an improper relationship with her. In response to AP's reporting, the FBI announced a series of reforms, including a 24/7 tip line, intended to take a tougher stand against agents found to have committed misconduct and help accusers. The latest settlement comes less than six months after the Justice Department announced a $138.7 million settlement with more than 100 people who accused the FBI of grossly mishandling allegations of sexual assault against the sports doctor Larry Nassar.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-to-pay-22m-to-settle-claims-of-sexual-discrimination-at-training-academy/7805680.html	2024-09-30T20:24:47-07:00	
Shanghai knife attack kills three, wounds 15 others, Xinhua reports	BEIJING — Three people were killed and 15 others injured in a knife attack at a supermarket in Shanghai on Monday, state-run Xinhua news agency reported, extending a series of stabbing incidents across China this year. The victims were immediately rushed to hospital for treatment, according to Xinhua on Tuesday, but three died. The assailant, a 37-year-old man surnamed Lin, was detained by the police who received a report of the incident at 9:47 p.m. local time (1447 GMT), Xinhua said. An investigation is underway. Public stabbing incidents have risen over the years in China, with authorities often putting the blame on mental illness. Children at schools are a common target. In September, a 10-year-old Japanese student was fatally stabbed by an attacker meters from his school in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. That incident along with a June knife attack on two Japanese nationals in Suzhou, a major city in eastern China, have stoked security concerns among members of the Japanese community in China. Stabbing incidents are rare in Shanghai but not unprecedented. In 2022, a man went on a stabbing spree at a major hospital in the Chinese financial hub, injuring 15 people. The man, whom authorities said was 'resentful of society' after an investment fell through, was sentenced to death a year later.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shanghai-knife-attack-kills-three-wounds-15-others-xinhua-reports/7805678.html	2024-09-30T20:14:35-07:00	
North Korea criticizes US deployment of nuclear assets in South Korea	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea's Defense Ministry denounced the United States' deployment of nuclear strategic assets in South Korea, state media KCNA reported on Tuesday, as Seoul was gearing up for a rare military parade marking Armed Forces Day. Kim Kang Il, North Korea's vice defense minister, accused Washington of running a 'reckless military bluff' and stoking tension by sending a nuclear-powered submarine recently to South Korea and again flying a B-1B bomber for the planned parade. South Korean media reported a B-1B bomber would join the parade set for Tuesday afternoon, flying over Seoul alongside allied fighter jets and other aircraft. South Korea's military and U.S. Forces Korea have not confirmed the bomber's participation, but Seoul's Defense Ministry said the parade was partly intended to show off its military might as a deterrent to the North. Kim said the U.S. show of force highlighted its strategic disadvantage on the Korean peninsula over North Korea, as well as South Korea's 'chronic nuclear phobia.' He called for fresh measures in response. 'We can examine such fresh action plans any time and carry them out,' he said, vowing to continue improving the country's 'powerful war deterrent,' according to KCNA. Last week, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, criticized the presence of a U.S. nuclear submarine in South Korea, which docked at the port city of Busan to get supplies and allow crew members to rest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-criticizes-us-deployment-of-nuclear-assets-in-south-korea/7805641.html	2024-09-30T18:13:14-07:00	
Pete Rose, baseball's banned hits leader, has died at age 83	NEW YORK — Pete Rose, baseball's career hits leader and fallen idol who undermined his historic achievements and Hall of Fame dreams by gambling on the game he loved and once embodied, has died. He was 83. Stephanie Wheatley, a spokesperson for Clark County in Nevada, confirmed on behalf of the medical examiner that Rose died Monday. Wheatley said the cause and manner of death had not yet been determined. For fans who came of age in the 1960s and '70s, no player was more exciting than the Cincinnati Reds' No. 14, 'Charlie Hustle,' the brash superstar with the shaggy hair, puggish nose and muscular forearms. At the dawn of artificial surfaces, divisional play and free agency, Rose was old school, a conscious throwback to baseball's early days. Millions could never forget him crouched and scowling at the plate, running full speed to first even after drawing a walk, or sprinting for the next base and diving headfirst into the bag. A 17-time All-Star, the switch-hitting Rose played on three World Series winners. He was the National League MVP in 1973 and World Series MVP two years later. He holds the major league record for games played (3,562) and plate appearances (15,890) and the NL record for the longest hitting streak (44). He was the leadoff man for one of baseball's most formidable lineups with the Reds' championship teams of 1975 and 1976, with teammates that included Hall of Famers Johnny Bench, Tony Perez and Joe Morgan. But no milestone approached his 4,256 hits, breaking his hero Ty Cobb's 4,191 and signifying his excellence no matter the notoriety that followed. It was a total so extraordinary that you could average 200 hits for 20 years and still come up short. Rose's secret was consistency, and longevity. Over 24 seasons, all but six played entirely with the Reds, Rose had 200 hits or more 10 times, and more than 180 four other times. He batted .303 overall, even while switching from second base to outfield to third to first, and he led the league in hits seven times. 'Every summer, three things are going to happen,' Rose liked to say, 'the grass is going to get green, the weather is going to get hot, and Pete Rose is going to get 200 hits and bat .300.' Rose was Rookie of the Year in 1963, but he started off 0 for 12 with three walks and a hit by pitch before getting his first major league hit, an eighth-inning triple off Pittsburgh's Bob Friend. It came in Cincinnati on April 13, 1963, the day before Rose's 22nd birthday. He reached 1,000 in 1968, 2,000 just five years later and 3,000 just five years after that. He moved into second place, ahead of Hank Aaron, with hit No. 3,772, in 1982. No. 4,000 was off the Phillies' Jerry Koosman in 1984, exactly 21 years to the day after his first hit. He caught up with Cobb on Sept. 8, 1985, and surpassed him three days later, in Cincinnati, with Rose's mother and teenage son, Pete Jr., among those in attendance. Rose was 44 and the team's player-manager. Batting left-handed against the San Diego Padres' Eric Show in the first inning, he smacked a 2-1 slider into left field, a clean single. The crowd of 47,000-plus stood and yelled. The game was halted to celebrate. Rose was given the ball and the first base bag, then wept openly on the shoulder of first base coach and former teammate, Tommy Helms. Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, watching from New York, declared that Rose had 'reserved a prominent spot in Cooperstown.' After the game, a 2-0 win for the Reds in which Rose scored both runs, he received a phone call from President Ronald Reagan. 'Your reputation and legacy are secure,' Reagan told him. 'It will be a long time before anyone is standing in the spot where you're standing now.' Four years later, he was gone. On March 20, 1989, Ueberroth (who would soon be succeeded by A. Bartlett Giamatti) announced that his office was conducting a 'full inquiry into serious allegations' about Rose. Reports emerged that he had been relying on a network of bookies and friends and others in the gambling world to place bets on baseball games, including some with the Reds. Rose denied any wrongdoing, but the investigation found that the 'accumulated testimony of witnesses, together with the documentary evidence and telephone records reveal extensive betting activity by Pete Rose in connection with professional baseball and, in particular, Cincinnati Reds games, during the 1985, 1986, and 1987 baseball seasons.' Betting on baseball had been a primal sin since 1920, when several members of the Chicago White Sox were expelled for throwing the 1919 World Series — to the Cincinnati Reds. Baseball's Rule 21, posted in every professional clubhouse, proclaims that 'Any player, umpire or club or league official or employee who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible.'' As far back as the 1970s, Bench and others had worried about Rose. By all accounts, he never bet against his own team, but even betting on the Reds left himself open to blackmail and raised questions about whether a given managerial decision was based on his own financial interest. In August 1989, at a New York press conference, Giamatti spoke some of the saddest words in baseball history: 'One of the game's greatest players has engaged in a variety of acts which have stained the game, and he must now live with the consequences of those acts.' Giamatti announced that Rose had agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball, a decision that in 1991 the Hall of Fame would rule left him ineligible for induction. Rose attempted to downplay the news, insisting that he had never bet on baseball and that he would eventually be reinstated. Within weeks of his announcement, Giamatti was dead from a heart attack. But the ban remained in place and Rose never made it to the Hall in his lifetime, although he did receive 41 votes in 1992 (when 323 votes were needed), around the time the Hall formally ruled that those banned from the game could never be elected. His status was long debated. Rose's supporters including Donald Trump, who in 2015, the year before he was elected president, tweeted: 'Can't believe Major League Baseball just rejected @PeteRose_14 for the Hall of Fame. He's paid the price. So ridiculous — let him in!' Meanwhile, his story changed. In a November 1989 memoir, written with 'The Boys of Summer' author Roger Kahn, Rose again claimed innocence, only to reverse himself in 2004. He desperately wanted to come back, and effectively destroyed his chances. He would continue to spend time at casinos, insisting he was there for promotion, not gambling. He believed he had 'messed up' and that his father would have been ashamed, but he still bet on baseball, albeit legally. 'I don't think betting is morally wrong. I don't even think betting on baseball is morally wrong,' he wrote in 'Play Hungry,' a memoir released in 2019. 'There are legal ways, and there are illegal ways, and betting on baseball the way I did was against the rules of baseball.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pete-rose-baseball-s-banned-hits-leader-has-died-at-age-83/7805631.html	2024-09-30T17:42:03-07:00

Cambodian reporter who investigated online scam centers has been arrested	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Cambodian freelance reporter Mech Dara, noted for investigative reporting in a country with limited press freedom, was arrested Monday, a leading local human rights organization and a journalists association said. Known especially for investigating online scam centers, Mech Dara's arrest followed posts he made about a rock quarry — that local officials denounced Monday as an attempt to foment dissent. Mech Dara managed to send an SMS message to the rights group Licadho saying he was being arrested by military police before his phone was seized, said Am Sam Ath, a Licadho spokesperson. The Associated Press was not immediately able to confirm the arrest, news of which circulated Monday night after government offices were closed. However, CamboJA News, a project run by the independent Cambodian Journalists Alliance Association, published details of the incident, citing unnamed members of Mech Dara’s family. CamboJA on its Facebook page also reported that military police spokesperson Eng Hy confirmed the arrest, saying it had been carried out with a warrant, but did not give the cause or say where Mech Dara had been taken. A family member whom CamboJA did not name said Mech Dara’s car was stopped at a toll booth at the entrance to the expressway to Phnom Penh when police arrived in a military vehicle and five other cars. The relative said the authorities cited an arrest warrant, but did not show the document. The relative said Mech Dara’s phone was seized and that his family members were asked to stay in their car and remain silent. The police action may have been related to two images Mech Dara posted on his Facebook page of a quarry operation and of the revered mountain Ba Phnom, which has a Buddhist pagoda, in the southeastern province of Prey Veng. His post may have implied that the sacred mountain is being destroyed, which appears not to be the case. On Monday, the Prey Veng provincial administration issued a statement rejecting his post and accused him of 'wanting to cause social disorder or confusion,' which can be prosecuted as a criminal offense. The province also called on the Information Ministry to take legal action against him. Mech Dara previously worked as a journalist for the Cambodia Daily and the Phnom Penh Post, two once-vibrant English-language newspapers forced to shut down under government pressure, and the Voice of Democracy radio and website, which was closed by the government last year. Mech Dara is best known for his reports in the past few years about human trafficking connected to online scam operations. The activity involves tricking people into signing up for what they believe are legitimate jobs in Cambodia, only to then keep them in virtual slavery in compounds often housing casinos as well, where they go online to target people around the world. In a scam known as 'pig butchering,' scam operators slowly build up a relationship of trust with their targets, often involving romance, before convincing them to hand over large amounts of money for fake investments. The practice has been going on for several years, based mostly in Cambodia and Myanmar, and recently has drawn heightened law enforcement attention in the United States, where people have been cheated out of millions of dollars. The U.S. State Department honored Mech Dara as a 2023 Trafficking in Persons Report Hero for his work exposing the problem. The Paris-based group Reporters Without Borders in its latest report ranked Cambodia 151st out of 180 in its international press freedom index. 'The main broadcasters and the few remaining newspapers generally toe the government line. Many subjects are impossible to cover, such as political opposition, corruption and deforestation,' said the group. 'Despite the growing number of online media outlets, few provide balanced reporting. Only a few independent Cambodian media, broadcasting from abroad, provide quality news coverage.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodian-reporter-who-investigated-online-scam-centers-has-been-arrested-/7805610.html	2024-09-30T17:03:10-07:00	
Man gets life in Russian prison for car bombing that wounded writer	moscow — A Russian court Monday gave a life sentence to a man convicted in a car bombing that seriously wounded nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin. Prosecutors said the May 2023 bombing in the Nizhny Novogorod region was conducted at the direction of Ukraine's security services. Prilepin was seriously injured, and his driver died in the bombing. The convicted defendant, Alexander Permyakov, is from Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region and once fought with the Russian-backed separatists there, news reports said. Prilepin was known for his vehement defense of both the Russia-backed eastern Ukraine rebels who rose up in 2014, and of Russia's fighting in Ukraine that began in February 2022. Since Russia sent troops into Ukraine, two prominent nationalist figures have been killed. Darya Dugina, a commentator on Russian TV channels and the daughter of Kremlin-linked ideologue Alexander Dugin, died in an August 2022 car bombing that investigators suspected was aimed at her father. Vladlen Tatarsky, a well-known military blogger, died in April 2023, when a statue given to him at a party in St. Petersburg exploded. Russian political activist Darya Trepova was convicted in the case and sentenced to 27 years behind bars. She said she was following orders from a contact in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-gets-life-in-russian-prison-for-car-bombing-that-wounded-writer-/7805339.html	2024-09-30T16:43:47-07:00	
Thailand's latest reform party voices optimism, but questions remain	Bangkok — Thailand’s newest pro-democracy party says it is determined to continue the fight for human rights and democracy despite facing a number of legal and political obstacles. The People’s Party was formed in August after the dissolution of the reformist Move Forward Party and is already looking ahead to the 2027 general elections. But some observers and analysts are concerned whether the opposition party will survive and whether its controversial promises will ever be fulfilled. 'In the next the three years it’s a matter of how we can beat the battle for the majority seats in parliament. I have to accept it’s not an easy task to do, but I truly believe it’s possible to achieve,' Natthaphong Reungpanyawut, leader of the People’s Party, told the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Thailand on Sept. 26. 'Our main priorities and policies will be still the same … to protect human rights and to bring full democracy to Thailand. We want to bring power back to the people, and no one can stop that. For the next election, I believe we have to get at least 20 million votes to get the majority seats in parliament,' he added. The party’s predecessors – the Future Forward Party and the Move Forward Party – received 8 million and 14 million votes, respectively, in the past two national elections. Thitinan Pondsudhirak, a renowned political scientist in Thailand, says the new party’s ambitious goal isn’t that far-fetched, given the trajectory of recent elections. 'They have good prospects at the polls,' he told VOA. 'They’re being deliberately ambitious, but at the same time, it's not unrealistic, given the jump [from] the popular votes from Future Forward to Move Forward. 'The brick wall that they're against is not the polling booth. The brick wall is against the royalist establishment,' he said. The People's Party has maintained it will continue with one of the Move Forward Party's main pledges, which is amending Thailand’s 'lese majeste' law, which prohibits criticism of the Thai royals. This is despite Thailand’s Constitutional Court dissolving the Move Forward Party on August 7 after ruling the group’s pledges threatened to overthrow the monarchy. The party’s leaders were also banned from politics for 10 years. Prior to that, Move Forward had won the most votes in the 2023 general election, before the Thai Senate blocked the party from forming a government, also because of its campaign pledges. The Future Forward Party was also dissolved in 2020 by Thailand's Constitutional Court, which ruled the party accepted a donation from its leader, violating election law. The party said it had received the money as a loan, not a donation. Natthaphong says one of his party's policy aims is to limit the powers of the judiciary. 'The article-by-article constitution amendment, to limit the power of the Constitutional Court, to not overrule the government that is elected by the people, that is a very practical thing we can do as an opposition party over the next three years,' he said. But two months into its existence, the future of the People’s Party is already in doubt after Thailand’s National Anti-Corruption Commission said it was investigating 44 lawmakers who formerly belonged to the Move Forward Party. Twenty-five of those lawmakers are current MPs for the People’s Party. The probe alleges the lawmakers broke ethics rules for supporting a bill that was to amend the lese majeste law. Sirikanya Tansakun, deputy leader of the People’s Party, is one of the lawmakers being investigated. She told the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand on Sept. 26 that the case doesn’t make sense. 'We are the members of the House of Representatives, and our duty is to pass the laws,' she said. 'As we endorsed the law to amendment of Article 112 of the Criminal Code, I don’t think it’s considered a violation of ethics at all, but in this country, anything is possible and totally unpredictable and they don’t think in rational, logical sense.' Some analysts believe the People’s Party is fighting an almost impossible cause for continuing to achieve these controversial policies. 'The future of the People’s Party is, I think, very murky,' Tita Sanglee, an independent analyst, told VOA. 'There are definitely many voters willing to give it a chance, including many conservatives, who’ve become disillusioned by the whole Thaksin-joining-forces-with conservative-parties saga and are desperate for a ‘fresh’ option.' On the other hand, she added, the party will almost definitely face legal challenges. And even if they stop trying to amend the constitution, many of their proposals remain sensitive. 'Even if The People’s Party wins by a landslide and takes office in the next election, I doubt it can achieve half of what it promises,' Sanglee said. The party wants to implement more than 300 policy goals, including ending military conscription, promoting labor protections and making it legal to criticize the royal family. The party labels this as the three 'D’s' – demonopolization, demilitarization and decentralization – which began under Move Forward’s leadership. Pravit Rojanaphruk, a veteran journalist for Khaosod English in Thailand, says both voters and conservatives may not see the People’s Party as anything different to their predecessors, and that may work against the group. '[The Move Forward Party] have failed to form a government despite having won most seats in 2023 and some voters may doubt if they are really capable of forming a government after the next general election, since all major parties have basically vowed to not join a coalition with them due to their stance on the lese majeste law and the monarchy,' he said. 'The not so obvious obstacle is how they can shake off the image of being branded as the new main threat to national security by conservative people and how to keep their members motivated if they fail to form the government again in 2027,' he added. But Sirikanya remained confident that change will happen. 'Every time that the system tries to beat us, they have used up their own political capital from those funny rulings or verdicts,' he said. 'If we keep fighting this fight, and people back us more and more, someday, maybe in my next generation or the next one, if we keep fighting, we will win.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-s-latest-reform-party-voices-optimism-but-questions-remain-/7805300.html	2024-09-30T15:50:12-07:00	
US port strike by 45,000 dockworkers is all but certain to begin at midnight	New York — The union representing U.S. dockworkers has signaled that 45,000 of its members will walk off the job at midnight, kicking off a strike likely to shut down ports across the East and Gulf coasts. The coming work stoppage threatens to significantly snarl the nation's supply chain, potentially leading to higher prices and delays in goods reaching households and businesses if it drags on for weeks. That's because the strike by members of the International Longshoremen's Association could cause 36 ports — which handle roughly half of the goods shipped into and out of the U.S. — to shutter operations. ILA confirmed over the weekend that its members would hit the picket lines at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. In a Monday update, the union blamed the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports, for continuing to 'to block the path' toward an agreement before the contract deadline. 'The Ocean Carriers represented by USMX want to enjoy rich billion-dollar profits that they are making in 2024, while they offer ILA Longshore Workers an unacceptable wage package that we reject,' ILA said in a prepared statement. 'ILA longshore workers deserve to be compensated for the important work they do keeping American commerce moving and growing.' ILA also accused the shippers of 'gouging their customers' with sizeable price increases for containers over recent weeks. The union said that this will result in increased costs for American consumers. The Associated Press reached out to a USMX spokesperson for comment. If drawn out, the strike would force businesses to pay shippers for delays and cause some goods to arrive late for peak holiday shopping season — potentially impacting delivery of anything from toys or artificial Christmas trees, to cars, coffee and fruit. A strike could have an almost immediate impact on supplies of perishable imports like bananas, for example. The ports that could be affected by the strike handle 3.8 million metric tons of bananas each year, or 75% of the nation’s supply, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. Americans could also face higher prices as retailers feel the supply squeeze. 'If the strikes go ahead, they will cause enormous delays across the supply chain, a ripple effect which will no doubt roll into 2025 and cause chaos across the industry,' noted Jay Dhokia, founder of supply chain management and logistics firm Pro3PL. Dhokia added that East Coast ports aren't the only ones at risk for disruption, as concern leading up to the strike has already diverted many shipments out West, adding to route congestion and more pressure on demand. Impacts will also be felt internationally — particularly in places like the United Kingdom, he said, where the U.S. is its largest trading partner. ILA members are demanding higher wages and a total ban on the automation of cranes, gates and container-moving trucks used in the loading or unloading of freight. The coming strike by the ILA workers — set to impact ports from Maine to Texas — will be the first by the union since 1977. West Coast dockworkers belong to a different union and aren’t involved in the strike. If a strike were deemed a danger to U.S. economic health, President Joe Biden could, under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, seek a court order for an 80-day cooling-off period. That would suspend the strike. All eyes are on what, if any, action the administration might take — particularly just weeks ahead of a tight presidential election. But Biden has signaled that he will not exercise this power. During an exchange with reporters on Sunday, Biden said 'no' when asked if he planned to intervene in the potential work stoppage. 'Because it’s collective bargaining, I don’t believe in Taft-Hartley,' he said. At a briefing Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated that the administration had never invoked Taft-Hartley 'to break a strike and are not considering doing so now.' She added that top officials were still urging both parties to return to the bargaining table and negotiate in good faith.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-port-strike-by-45-000-dockworkers-is-all-but-certain-to-begin-at-midnight/7805288.html	2024-09-30T15:33:46-07:00	
Arkansas sues YouTube over claims it's fueling mental health crisis	little rock, arkansas — Arkansas sued YouTube and parent company Alphabet on Monday, saying the video-sharing platform is made deliberately addictive and fueling a mental health crisis among youth in the state. Attorney General Tim Griffin's office filed the lawsuit in state court, accusing them of violating the state's deceptive trade practices and public nuisance laws. The lawsuit claims the site is addictive and has resulted in the state spending millions on expanded mental health and other services for young people. 'YouTube amplifies harmful material, doses users with dopamine hits, and drives youth engagement and advertising revenue,' the lawsuit said. 'As a result, youth mental health problems have advanced in lockstep with the growth of social media, and in particular, YouTube.' Alphabet's Google, which owns the video service and is also named as a defendant in the case, denied the lawsuit's claims. 'Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work. In collaboration with youth, mental health and parenting experts, we built services and policies to provide young people with age-appropriate experiences, and parents with robust controls,' Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said in a statement. 'The allegations in this complaint are simply not true.' YouTube requires users under 17 to get their parent’s permission before using the site, while accounts for users younger than 13 must be linked to a parental account. But it is possible to watch YouTube without an account, and kids can easily lie about their age. The lawsuit is the latest in an ongoing push by state and federal lawmakers to highlight the impact that social media sites have on younger users. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy in June called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on young people’s lives, like those now mandatory on cigarette boxes. Arkansas last year filed similar lawsuits against TikTok and Facebook parent company Meta, claiming the social media companies were misleading consumers about the safety of children on their platforms and protections of users’ private data. Those lawsuits are still pending in state court. Arkansas also enacted a law requiring parental consent for minors to create new social media accounts, though that measure has been blocked by a federal judge. Along with TikTok, YouTube is one of the most popular sites for children and teens. Both sites have been questioned in the past for hosting, and in some cases promoting, videos that encourage gun violence, eating disorders and self-harm. YouTube in June changed its policies about firearm videos, prohibiting any videos demonstrating how to remove firearm safety devices. Under the new policies, videos showing homemade guns, automatic weapons and certain firearm accessories like silencers will be restricted to users 18 and older. Arkansas' lawsuit claims that YouTube's algorithms steer youth to harmful adult content, and that it facilitates the spread of child sexual abuse material. The lawsuit doesn't seek specific damages, but asks that YouTube be ordered to fund prevention, education and treatment for 'excessive and problematic use of social media.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/arkansas-sues-youtube-over-claims-it-s-fueling-mental-health-crisis-/7805257.html	2024-09-30T15:12:49-07:00	
3 policemen killed in attacks in southeastern Iran	Tehran — At least three policemen were killed in separate attacks by jihadists and gunmen in Iran's southeastern Sistan-Baluchistan province, state media reported Monday. One of Iran's poorest regions, Sistan-Baluchistan on the border with Pakistan has long been plagued by unrest involving drug-smuggling gangs, rebels from the Baluchi minority and Sunni extremists. 'A border guard was killed a few hours ago in a clash with gunmen in Hirmand in Sistan-Baluchistan province,' the official IRNA news agency reported. A separate attack on law enforcement in the same region Monday left another border guard killed and two others wounded, IRNA said. The news agency also reported that a member of the police special force was killed in the town of Khash, also in Sistan-Baluchistan. The Pakistan-based Sunni jihadist group Jaish al-Adl, or Army of Justice in Arabic, claimed responsibility for the last two attacks in a message on Telegram. The group has claimed responsibility for several attacks in recent months, including a Sunday raid that killed a policeman in the same region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/three-policemen-killed-in-attacks-in-southeastern-iran-/7805278.html	2024-09-30T15:08:41-07:00	
Hunger in Haiti reaches famine levels	PORT-AU-PRINCE — Nearly 6,000 people in Haiti are starving, with nearly half the country's population of more than 11 million people experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse as gang violence smothers life in the capital of Port-au-Prince and beyond, according to a new report released Monday. The number of Haitians facing crisis, emergency and famine levels of hunger increased by 1.2 million in the past year for a total of 5.4 million as gang violence disrupts the transportation of goods and prevents people from venturing out of their homes to buy food, according to the report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. 'This is one of the highest proportions of acutely food insecure people in any crisis around the world,' said U.N. spokesman Stéphane Dujarric. The 5,636 people who are facing starvation, the worst level, live in makeshift shelters across the metropolitan area, according to the report, which noted that another 2 million Haitians face severe hunger. 'This is shocking,' said Martine Villeneuve, Haiti director for the nonprofit Action Against Hunger. 'We were not expecting that level. Two million … is massive.' Villeneuve told The Associated Press that she also was surprised that some of the 2 million people hit by hunger don't even live in places directly affected by gang violence. While much of the hunger is directly tied to gang violence, double-digit inflation also has limited what many Haitians can afford to buy, with food now representing 70% of total household expenditures. The cost of a food basket increased more than 11% in the past year, with inflation hitting 30% in July. In addition, parts of Haiti are still struggling to recover from the August 2021 earthquake, various drought episodes, and Hurricane Matthew, which struck Haiti as a Category 4 storm in 2016. Gang violence, however, accounts for most of the hunger, with gangs controlling 80% of Port-au-Prince and the roads that lead to and from northern and southern Haiti, preventing farmers from delivering goods and nonprofits from delivering aid. From April to June, at least 1,379 people were reported killed or injured, and another 428 kidnapped. In addition, gang violence has left more than 700,000 people homeless in recent years. A U.N.-backed mission led by Kenya that began in late June and is aimed at quelling gang violence in Haiti has liberated some communities. But officials say much work remains to be done as the U.S., Haiti and others call for a U.N. peacekeeping mission to secure funding and personnel that the current mission lacks. 'Haiti continues to face a worsening humanitarian crisis, with alarming rates of armed gang violence disrupting daily life, forcing more people to flee their homes and levels of acute food insecurity to rise,' the report stated. In 2014, only 2% of Haiti's population was food insecure, a number that has soared to nearly 50%, according to Mercy Corps, one of several nonprofits that called for an increase in funding Monday. Dujarric said humanitarian food agencies and nonprofits in Haiti need an additional $230 million until year's end. Seventy percent of people living in makeshift shelters are experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse, the report found. Among those experiencing hunger is Joceline St-Louis, a 28-year-old mother of two boys, 5 and 1. 'Food doesn’t come around very often,' she said, adding that she depends on others to feed her children. 'When an organization does provide food, there’s a major fight,' she said. St-Louis said she must take her 1-year-old to a clinic so he can receive a peanut butter mix 'so that his body doesn’t collapse in my arms.' 'I’m sometimes so depressed that I sometimes want to kill the kids and myself,' she said in a soft voice as she cradled the 1-year-old in her arms while the 5-year-old played with his friends. In another shelter nearby, Judeline Auguste, 39, said she depends solely on remittances to feed herself and her 8-year-old boy, but the money barely lasts a week. 'It’s very rare that I can get a meal a day,' she said. 'My situation is hard not because of me, but because of my son. He looks at other people eating all the time, and he starts crying, ‘Mommy, I’m hungry.’' Meanwhile, those facing urgent levels of hunger live in Haiti’s northern, central and southern regions, as well as in the capital. Jean Yonel, who fled his home with his family after gangs raided their neighborhood, said there are days that he, his wife and their seven children eat only white rice or spaghetti. 'I can’t provide every day for these children,' Yonel said. 'Sometimes we take just a spoonful of food and leave the rest of the food for the kids so they don’t die.' Yonel used to work as a mason, but with construction jobs drying up, he is now forced to search for wood to make charcoal. His wife sells second-hand clothes. On days when they can’t afford a proper meal for their children, she mixes flour with spinach to keep their stomachs from rumbling.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hunger-in-haiti-reaches-famine-levels-/7805270.html	2024-09-30T15:07:02-07:00	
Iran says it will not send forces to confront Israel	tehran, iran — Iran will not deploy forces to Lebanon or Gaza to confront Israel, its foreign ministry said Monday, as Israeli strikes target its allies in the region. 'There is no need to send extra or volunteer forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran,' said foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani, adding that Lebanon and fighters in the Palestinian territories 'have the capability and strength to defend themselves against the aggression.' Israel has in recent days been launching heavy airstrikes in Lebanon against the so-called 'axis of resistance,' a network of Iran-aligned militant groups in the region, including in Syria, Yemen and Iraq. An Israeli strike Friday on Beirut killed Hassan Nasrallah, the head of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah that Iran has armed and financed for years. 'We have not received any request in this regard from any side. On the contrary, we are informed and are sure that they do not need the help of our forces,' Kanani told reporters in Tehran. Kanani nonetheless vowed that Israel 'will not remain without reprimand and punishment for the crimes it has committed against the Iranian people, military personnel and the resistance forces.' Also Monday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian visited Hezbollah's office in Tehran 'to pay tribute' to Nasrallah, according to the government's website. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in all matters of the state, has vowed that Nasrallah's death 'will not be in vain,' and First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref said it would bring about Israel's 'destruction.' Iran has also vowed to avenge the killing of Abbas Nilforushan, a top commander of the Quds Force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' foreign operations arm, who died alongside the Hezbollah leader.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-it-will-not-send-forces-to-confront-israel/7805280.html	2024-09-30T15:06:03-07:00

Flash floods kill six in Iran, state news agency reports	Tehran, Iran — At least six people have been killed and eight others are missing after flash floods swept through southern Iran, a region usually parched, state media reported Monday. 'Five foreigners and one Iranian died due to flooding of Halil River in Jiroft and eight people are missing,' the official IRNA news agency said. It did not specify the nationality of those who died. Jiroft is a city located in the normally dry southern province of Kerman. Scientists say climate change amplifies extreme weather, including droughts as well as the potential for an increased intensity of rainstorms. Iran has endured repeated droughts in the past decade, but also regular floods, a phenomenon made worse when torrential rain falls on the sun-baked earth. In 2022, heavy rains in Iran's south left at least 80 people dead and caused damage estimated at about $200 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/flash-floods-kill-six-in-iran-state-news-agency-reports/7805265.html	2024-09-30T14:54:30-07:00

Flooding deaths in Nepal reach 193 as recovery work ramps up	Kathmandu, Nepal — The number of people killed in Nepal by flooding and landslides triggered by heavy rainfall over the weekend reached 193 while recovery and rescue work increased Monday. Many of the deaths were in the capital, Kathmandu, which got heavy rainfall, and much of the southern part of the city was flooded. Police said in a statement that 31 people were still reported missing and 96 people were injured across the Himalayan nation. A landslide killed three dozen people on a blocked highway about 16 kilometers (10 miles) from Kathmandu. The landslide buried at least three buses and other vehicles where people were sleeping because the highway was blocked. Kathmandu had remained cut off all weekend as the three highways out of the city were blocked by landslides. Workers were able to temporarily open the key Prithvi highway, removing rocks, mud and trees that had been washed from the mountains. The home minister announced temporary shelters would be built for people who lost their homes and monetary help would be available for the families of those killed and to the people who were injured by the flooding and landslides. Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli was returning home Monday from attending the U.N. General Assembly meeting and has called an emergency meeting, his office said. Improved weather has allowed rescue and recovery work to be stepped up. Residents in the southern part of Kathmandu, which was inundated Saturday, were cleaning up houses as water levels began to recede. At least 34 people were killed in Kathmandu, which was the hardest hit by flooding. Police and soldiers were assisting with rescue efforts, while heavy equipment was used to clear the landslides from the roads. The government announced it was closing schools and colleges across Nepal for the next three days. The monsoon season began in June and usually ends by mid-September. Meanwhile, in northern Bangladesh, about 60,000 people were affected by flooding in low-lying areas because of rains and rising water from upstream India. People have taken shelter on roads and flood protection embankments in Lalmonirhat and Kurigram districts, the English-language Daily Star reported. The River Teesta that crosses the border was overflowing at some points and the Dharala and Dudhkumar rivers in the Rangpur region were rising but remained below danger levels, the Dhaka-based Flood Forecasting and Warning Center said Monday. Waters could start receding in a day or two, it said. Bangladesh is a low-lying delta nation crisscrossed by about 230 rivers, including more than 50 that cross borders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/flooding-deaths-in-nepal-reach-193-as-recovery-work-ramps-up/7805202.html	2024-09-30T13:37:47-07:00	
Biden acts to keep asylum ban at US-Mexico border in place longer	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration will toughen an asylum ban at the U.S.-Mexico border to keep it in place for longer, U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials said Monday, signaling a desire to further curb illegal crossings. The change, effective just after midnight, will leave asylum restrictions in place until arrests of migrants crossing illegally drop below a daily average of 1,500 over 28 days, lengthened from the current seven-day period, one of the officials said on a call with reporters. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, issued the asylum ban in June to drive down record numbers of migrants caught crossing illegally. Immigration is a top voter issue in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election, which is pitting Vice President Kamala Harris against Republican Donald Trump, an immigration hardliner. Harris backs making the ban even harder to lift, Reuters reported last week, but the Biden administration did not adopt her proposal. U.S. border authorities have apprehended roughly 54,000 migrants in September to date, down steeply from a peak of 250,000 in December, a DHS official said. A daily average of 1,500 over 28 days would represent a total of 42,000 migrants in that period. As part of the changes to the asylum ban, all unaccompanied children caught crossing illegally will be counted in the tally used to decide whether the restrictions can be lifted. Previously, only children from Mexico and Canada were counted. The stricter approach 'ensures that the drop in encounters is a sustained decrease' and not tied to short-term trends, a DHS official said, speaking under condition of anonymity. Immigrant rights groups led by the American Civil Liberties Union have sued over the asylum ban, arguing that it runs counter to U.S. asylum law and closely parallels a Trump ban blocked in court.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-acts-to-keep-asylum-ban-at-us-mexico-border-in-place-longer/7805132.html	2024-09-30T13:04:56-07:00

Analysts: Escalating conflict tests China’s Middle East approach	Taipei, Taiwan — As Israel continues to launch airstrikes against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, China is stepping up its efforts to play the role of peacemaker in the Middle East, issuing statements of condemnation, but Beijing’s actions are also exposing the limits of its ability to de-escalate tensions, analysts say. 'Beijing wants to create an impression that it is pushing for greater peace and stability in the Middle East, but I’m not sure what all the statements amount to,' said Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore. After Hezbollah confirmed Saturday that its long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike that took place in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, China's Foreign Ministry reiterated Beijing's concern over the escalating conflict and urged all sides, especially Israel, to take steps to 'cool down the situation.' 'China opposes the infringement on Lebanon’s sovereignty and security, opposes and condemns any action against innocent civilians, and opposes any move that fuels antagonism and escalates regional tensions,' a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement released Sunday. The ministry statement added that said since the escalating tension between Israel and Hezbollah is 'a spillover of the Gaza conflict,' the priority now is to 'implement relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, end the fighting in Gaza as soon as possible, and earnestly safeguard peace and stability in the Middle East.' Sunday’s statement follows Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s meeting with his Lebanese counterpart last Monday on the sidelines of U.N. meetings in New York. During his meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib, Wang also stressed Beijing’s support for Lebanon’s efforts to safeguard its sovereignty and security and called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. In recent months, China has sought to play a bigger role in the Middle East as its trade and diplomatic ties with the region expand. Earlier in July, Beijing brokered meetings that led to reconciliation between rival Palestinian factions. In March 2023, Beijing helped broker a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran to reestablish diplomatic ties between the long-time rivals. Chong said that while brokering the reestablishment of diplomatic ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia and reconciliation between rival Palestinian factions were low-hanging fruits for China, it remains unclear what Beijing may do to tackle more complicated regional issues, such as escalating tension between Israel and Hezbollah. 'It depends on what Beijing is willing to do [regarding the current conflict], and I suppose they could try to lean on Tehran, which they supposedly have good relations with,' he told VOA by phone, adding that it is unclear how far they can get with Iran on issues related to the Middle East. Leveraging conflict against US As part of the attempt to present itself as a peacemaker in the Middle East, some observers say China is focusing on depicting Israel and the United States as aggressors in the ongoing conflict while portraying themselves as siding with 'the victims.' 'They are painting this narrative that Israel and the U.S. are on the side of injustice and hegemony, and China is on the side of fairness and justice,' Tuvia Gering, a non-resident fellow at Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, told VOA by phone. In comments to Chinese state media, some Chinese analysts have argued that it is the U.S. 'that allows, tolerates, or even instigates the escalation' of the crisis in the Middle East. The United States has been pushing for a cease fire between Israel and Hezbollah to avoid further escalation of the conflict and a wider war in the region. Chong said the ongoing conflict in the Middle East may help to amplify Beijing’s preferred narrative that Washington and its allies are creators of instability, particularly among some developing countries. 'The current situation in the Middle East certainly opens up opportunities for those narratives to perhaps take hold, especially in parts of Africa, Latin America and Asia,' he told VOA. However, he adds, while China may gain some leverage through this tactic, it needs to put forward something more concrete, such as a tangible peace plan to 'capitalize on the sentiment.' While China seeks to leverage the crisis in the Middle East against the U.S., Chong said the continued escalation of the conflict could also mean more economic pressure for Beijing, as well. China is the world’s largest importer of oil and after Russia, the Middle East is a key source of energy imports for Beijing to keep its economy running. 'If there is a wider conflict within the Middle East, at a minimum, it may affect energy prices and supplies, which could add to some of China’s ongoing economic woes,' he told VOA. However, since its primary trading partners in the Middle East are wealthier countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council and Iran, accounting for more than $300 billion in 2023 in exports and imports, some experts say the impact of the ongoing conflict on China’s economic interests is likely to be limited. 'I would imagine the current situation is very worrying for China and many other countries, but so long as the conflict is primarily limited to Israel dealing with different proxies and militias in its immediate surroundings, I don’t necessarily think that it would translate into a direct threat of Chinese interests,' Mohammed Alsudairi, a lecturer in politics and international relations at the Australian National University, told VOA in a phone interview.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-escalating-conflict-tests-china-s-middle-east-approach/7805006.html	2024-09-30T11:46:48-07:00	
Lake Victoria countries working to fight crime, improve community relations	Nairobi — Officials from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are meeting for the fourth time in less than two years to find ways to more effectively fight transnational crimes around the Lake Victoria area. Some of the crimes are nature-related, such as illegal fishing, tree cutting and charcoal production. In other cases, criminals take advantage of porous borders to sell drugs and conduct human trafficking. In 2021, the police organization Interpol rescued 121 people trafficked in and around Lake Victoria. Speaking to reporters at the port city of Mombasa, Kenya's interior ministry principal secretary, Raymond Omollo, said the parties were looking to close gaps in policing and surveillance, while also improving social and economic relations of communities living in the lake region. 'So we are looking at how to coordinate better, how to build capacities, how to have a common understanding with the communities around the lake and also who benefits from the use of the lake on how to manage those resources better while at the same [time] trying to minimize, eradicate a crime that we know is common in the lake,' Omollo said. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) launched the Lake Victoria project in December 2022. The world’s second-largest freshwater lake covers 60,000 square kilometers and is a source of livelihood for at least 40 million people in East Africa. Uganda's assistant commissioner for migration, Marcellino Bwesigye, told conference attendees that keeping Lake Victoria safe is important for his country. 'Lake Victoria is Uganda's ocean. So, we are looking forward to working together, especially to learn about the good practices that you have from the coast,' Bwesigye said. Authorities have documented illegal fishing in the lake, driven by rising demand for Nile perch, as well as charcoal harvesting and timber smuggling. Sharon Dimanche, IOM Kenya's chief of mission, said authorities need to partner with communities to fight organized crime in the region. 'If the border communities are not informed, if they really don't know what … we need to focus on, then it becomes a bit challenging to combat any of these transnational organized crimes because they are there and they know what is happening and they know some strange faces that are coming in their communities. So it's important that we link them up, they have a good relationship with law enforcement agencies,' Dimanche said.

Multinational police force for Haiti renewed for another year	united nations — The U.N. Security Council on Monday approved a one-year renewal for a multinational police force to help Haiti’s embattled national police subdue gangs in the violence-plagued Caribbean nation, and it will now consider turning the mission into a full-fledged U.N. peacekeeping operation. 'In adopting this resolution today, the Council has helped Haiti continue re-establishing security and creating the conditions necessary to holding free and fair elections,' U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. 'So, let us work together to build on the progress of the Haiti MSS [Multinational Security Support] mission. Let us embrace a new approach that sustains it. Let us protect the fragile but inspiring opportunity to build a better future for the Haitian people.' The United States and Ecuador drafted the resolution to extend the mission through October 2, 2025. In the interim, Haiti’s transitional government has requested that the 15-nation Security Council begin discussions for transforming the non-U.N. force into a U.N. peacekeeping operation. 'The transformation of the MSS into a peacekeeping operation under the mandate of the United Nations appears not just to be necessary, but a matter of urgency,' Haitian Ambassador Antonio Rodrigue told the council. He said making it one would guarantee more stable and predictable financing and expand the force’s capacities. Currently the mission has faced a continued shortfall in funds, equipment and logistics capabilities. 'We firmly believe that this is an approach which is crucial to maintain the gains of the MSS to enhance national security and to establish necessary conditions for the conduct of free and fair elections in the near future,' Rodrigue said. He said despite some progress in the three months since the first contingent of about 400 Kenyan police deployed to Haiti, the country still faces significant and complicated challenges. 'Gang violence continues to rend the social fabric and human rights violations are multiplying, plunging thousands of families into distress,' the Haitian envoy said. 'Insecurity is omnipresent, paralyzing the economy, undermining in the institutions and fueling fear among the population.' Kenya is leading the mission and its president, William Ruto, visited Haiti about a week and a half ago to meet with officials and Kenyan and Haitian police forces. Ruto said at the U.N. General Assembly last week that he plans to deploy another Kenyan contingent to Haiti by January. So far only about 500 police have been deployed, the majority from Kenya and the rest from Jamaica and Belize. Diplomats say they expect other countries will also be deploying. Kenya’s U.N. envoy pointed to some initial progress in the capital, Port-au-Prince, including their securing important infrastructure, such as the airport and National Hospital, and several major road intersections. But he noted the mission needs to quickly reach its fully mandated level of 2,500 personnel and the political transition needs to move ahead. 'I must also emphasize that while the MSS mission is a crucial and innovative intervention, it is only a part of the solution,' Ambassador Erastus Ekitela Lokaale said. 'Haiti’s stability will only be accomplished through a multi-pronged approach that addresses the root causes of its challenges.' Haiti has been rocked by instability since 2021, when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated. Prime Minister Ariel Henry then led the country until he announced his resignation in March. A transitional government is now in place with the goal of organizing free and fair elections. Haiti has not held elections since 2016. The country is facing a massive humanitarian crisis as a result of the violence. On Monday, international food monitors said more than half the country’s population – 5.4 million people – are struggling to feed themselves. At least 6,000 displaced persons in shelters in the capital are facing catastrophic levels of hunger, while 2 million people are one step behind them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7805031.html	2024-09-30T11:46:20-07:00	
Russian journalism archive aims to protect independent voices from media suppression	Washington — On a quiet May morning, two months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the homepage of Kremlin-owned news website Lenta.ru was flooded with anti-war and anti-government articles. The articles disappeared from the webpage within the hour, but because of the effort of internet archivists, they can still be viewed separately today. This is one of many examples of the Russian government’s attacks on free media, one that activists and archivists hope to counter. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, almost all independent media has been banned or blocked, and journalists are frequently imprisoned over trumped-up charges, according to Reporters Without Borders. To preserve over two decades of independent Russian journalism, exiled journalists and activists teamed up with PEN’s Freedom to Write Center to create the Russian Independent Media Archive, or RIMA. 'There is no freedom to write if there is no freedom to read,' Liesl Gerntholtz, director of PEN’s Freedom to Write Center, told VOA. Currently, the website houses over 6 million documents from 98 outlets, starting from the year 2000 — when Russian President Vladmir Putin first came to power. Co-founders Anna Nemzer, Ilia Veniavkin and Serob Khachatryan began the project around the time of the Ukraine invasion. The restrictive anti-war censorship laws that followed threatened press freedom and journalist safety in Russia, Nemzer told VOA. More than 1,500 journalists fled the country after the invasion and 22 were imprisoned at the end of last year, according to data from the Committee to Protect Journalists. 'I remember thinking: how can we help these people?' Nemzer told VOA. 'We couldn’t help them relocate; we couldn’t help them avoid prison if they stayed in Russia, but we thought the least we could do was save archives of their work.' At the time of the invasion, Nemzer was on a business trip outside of her home in Moscow, and she remains exiled today. Nemzer hopes the archive will protect work that is or might be 'deliberately erased' by the government. The main audience for the archive is journalists, academics and researchers who may not have access to relevant documents when they write about Russia. Gerntholtz of PEN sees this archive as the 'first draft of history,' she told VOA. But Nemzer also believes she is doing a service for the archived independent journalists, both in and outside Russia, by preserving their work. PEN’s Freedom to Write Center agreed to help develop the project because of these shared views — the organization sees media archiving as a natural extension of protecting the reporters themselves, Gerntholtz told VOA. Gerntholtz added that the organization is concerned about Russia’s 'crackdown on free expression' that has only intensified after 2022. 'Free expression in Russia has been at risk for a really long time,' Gerntholtz told VOA. 'We've seen more writers and artists who've been jailed for anti-war expression. We've seen civilian and professional journalists jailed for their activism journalism.' She cited the April 2024 arrests of journalists Konstantin Gabov and Sergey Karelin as an example of the Russian government silencing anti-corruption reporting. They were arrested on extremism charges for their work for late Russian dissident Alexei Navalny. Even before the invasion, a 'huge attack' on journalists was already underway, Nemzer told VOA. She saw Russia’s government declare many independent media outlets as undesirable organizations and prosecute her peer journalists under foreign agent charges. The Kremlin passed the undesirable-organization law in 2015, giving the government the power to shut down foreign and international organizations. However, critics say this law is a way to target government-critical news outlets. More than 175 organizations have been declared undesirable. Because of these crackdowns, Nemzer faced many hurdles in archiving decades of material. Mastering the technology to construct the archive to the scale it is today was especially challenging, and it is still a work in progress, she told VOA. The co-founders collaborated with the world’s largest internet archive, the Wayback Machine, to use the technology to create a special archived collection. The Wayback Machine archives over a billion URLs a day, according to its director, Mark Graham. RIMA has been able to access their collection efforts to preserve not just written articles, but also video and audio journalism. 'Material published on the web is not permanent or persistent,' Graham told VOA. 'The reliability of the access to that information going into the future is uncertain.' Among the millions of stories archived in RIMA, over 50,000 come from exiled independent news source The Moscow Times. Since the Ukraine invasion, The Moscow Times and its staff have 'faced nothing but challenges,' Alexander Gubsky, longtime publisher of the Times, told VOA. The staff had to relocate from Russia to Amsterdam within two weeks because of the Russian government’s hostile policies toward journalists, according to Gubsky. 'They want to shut us up,' Gubsky said. 'We tell the truth, and they cannot allow the truth.' Preserving the work of targeted individuals and outlets is one of the main reasons why Nemzer of RIMA helped create the archive, she told VOA. However, Gubsky told VOA that the Times has an archive of their own work on their website, and prefers that curious readers turn their attention there. He said that while RIMA is an 'interesting project,' the Times owns the copyright for all their own articles, and their primary source of income is from licensing and syndication. Graham of the Wayback Machine told VOA that the organization responds to legitimate requests from rights holders regarding the distribution of their material. He added that archiving public articles falls under fair use. 'RIMA is set up to facilitate a kind of exploration in a way that you simply can't do if all you have is access to a few individual websites,' Graham said. As RIMA continues to expand, Nemzer already has her sights set on the future. She hopes to take advantage of evolving artificial intelligence to help sort the archive. Nemzer also aims to create similar projects for other countries with leadership that suppresses media and has already talked to journalists from Belarus, Afghanistan and Iran. 'Writers play a particular role in challenging autocracy, in exposing human rights abuses and speaking truth to power,' Gerntholtz said. 'And journalists are crucial to challenging powerful people and governments.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-journalism-archive-aims-to-protect-independent-voices-from-media-suppression/7805039.html	2024-09-30T11:46:09-07:00	
China’s Xi calls for Taiwan reunification on eve of National Day	Washington — As China prepared to mark its National Day holiday, it used the occasion to once again call for 'reunification' with Taiwan and to flex its military might. On the eve of National Day Monday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping reiterated his view that reunification was inevitable and essential for fulfilling goals of national rejuvenation. Just one day earlier, China carried out multiple missile firings that put Taiwan’s military on alert. 'It is an irreversible trend, a matter of justice, and it is in accordance with the popular will. No one can stop the march of history,' Xi said in his remarks. Since its establishment on Oct. 1 in 1949, the People’s Republic of China or PRC has never ruled Taiwan, but it views the democratically governed island as its own territory and has vowed to bring the island under its control, by force if necessary. On Tuesday, China will mark 75 years since the Communist Party defeated Kuomintang Nationalist forces, ending a bloody civil war. The Nationalists fled to Taiwan, which after decades of one-party rule by the Kuomintang eventually became a thriving democracy. According to public opinion polls in Taiwan there is very little support for unification with China, regardless of whether it is as soon as possible or in the future. 'Taiwan is sacred territory for China. People on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have blood ties, and these family ties will always be stronger than others,' Xi said. Xi’s call comes just one day after Taiwan’s Defense Ministry detected multiple waves of missile firings within China’s interior. Earlier last week, Beijing also test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into international waters, a drill the likes of which China has not conducted since the 1980s. On Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden approved $567 million in military support for Taiwan, the largest aid package America has granted the island. The funding will aid Taiwanese 'military education and training' and allow for the speedy delivery of military articles, according to a statement from the White House. Some material for this report was provided by Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-calls-for-taiwan-reunification-on-eve-of-national-day-/7804944.html	2024-09-30T11:09:51-07:00

Man accused of Trump assassination plot in Florida pleads not guilty	west palm beach, florida — Ryan Routh, the 58-year-old man accused of plotting to kill Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at his Florida golf course, pleaded not guilty on Monday to several federal charges. His lawyer Kristy Militello entered the not guilty plea during a brief arraignment in a West Palm Beach federal courthouse and requested a jury trial. Wearing a beige prison uniform and shackles on his wrists and ankles, Routh answered 'yes, your honor,' when the magistrate judge asked him if he was aware of the charges against him. Routh was arrested on September 15 after a Secret Service agent saw the barrel of a rifle poking out from brush on the perimeter of the West Palm Beach golf course where Trump was playing a round. The agent opened fire and Routh, who fled in a vehicle, was arrested shortly later. He has been charged with attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and firearms offenses. A federal judge ruled last week that Routh, identified as a Hawaii resident, should remain in custody. FBI analysis of Routh's phone showed he had been in Florida since August 18, and his devices were located multiple times between that date and September 15 near Trump's golf course and his Mar-a-Lago residence, according to prosecutors. Before being spotted by the Secret Service agent, Routh spent nearly 12 hours in the vicinity of the Trump International Golf Club, according to his phone location data. Court documents said Routh allegedly dropped off a box at an unidentified person's home several months before the attempted assassination containing various letters. One letter, addressed to 'The World,' allegedly said: 'This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I am so sorry I failed you.' 'I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster,' it said. 'It is up to you now to finish the job; and I will offer $150,000 to whomever can complete the job.' It was the second assassination attempt on Trump this summer. The first took place on July 13 at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a gunman opened fire on the former president, killing one person and wounding Trump in the ear. The candidate was otherwise unharmed, and the gunman was killed at the scene. The Routh case has been assigned at random to federal District Judge Aileen Cannon — a Trump appointee who dismissed criminal proceedings against the former president earlier this year over his retention of top-secret documents at his private residence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-accused-of-trump-assassination-plot-in-florida-pleads-not-guilty-/7804973.html	2024-09-30T11:09:27-07:00

Botswana leader, 3 from opposition confirmed as presidential candidates	Gaborone, Botswana — Botswana’s High Court has confirmed four presidential candidates will run in the country’s general elections next month. Among them is incumbent President Mokgweetsi Masisi, who is seeking a second and final term. By law, presidential candidates in Botswana must provide proof to the chief justice that they have the required number of supporters to be eligible to run. The High Court verified four out of five possible candidates had the required support. The presidential candidates will be Masisi; Duma Boko, leader of the opposition coalition Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC); Dumelang Saleshando of the Botswana Congress Party (BCP); and Mephato Reatile from the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF), according to Chief Justice Terrence Rannowane. Biggie Butale, from a smaller opposition group the Botswana Republican Party, failed to meet the requirements. Masisi, addressing party supporters outside the High Court, said Monday that he is confident of victory. 'We have completed the nomination process inside the High Court,' he said. 'We are all equal before the law, but politically we are more superior to them. Let us now go out and show them (the opposition) that we are bigger than them.' Boko told reporters that his party will not stand for a rigged election. In 2019, Boko and his party claimed the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) stole the election. 'If the election is free and fair, we will accept the outcome. But if things do not go well, like what happened in 2019, we will reject the results,' he said. 'We warn those organizing the election that they should not attempt to rig the election. We urge every voter who is committed to a democratic process to be on guard and ensure that there are no irregularities.' The UDC enters the Oct. 30 polls without the BCP party, which quit the coalition last year, citing differences in the opposition alliance. BCP spokesperson Mpho Pheko said her party is well organized heading into the country’s 13th general election. 'For the BCP, 2024 presents the best opportunity to change government in Botswana,' Pheko said. 'So, completing this nomination process presents a lot of excitement and a lot of hope. Hope that Batswana heard our message. We are the first party to complete the manifesto, to complete the primary elections, to complete the nomination process. We hope that Batswana can see that this is a party that is very serious about them as a people.' Pheko used the word 'Batswana,' which collectively refers to all citizens of Botswana. The president is elected indirectly by parliament in Botswana, with recent efforts to introduce direct voting rejected following nationwide consultations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-leader-3-from-opposition-confirmed-as-presidential-candidates-/7804891.html	2024-09-30T10:41:55-07:00

US sends a few thousand more troops to Middle East to boost security	Washington — The U.S. is sending an additional 'few thousand' troops to the Middle East to bolster security and to be prepared to defend Israel if necessary, the Pentagon said Monday. The increased presence will come from multiple fighter jet squadrons, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters. It follows recent strikes in Lebanon and the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a significant escalation in the war in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Hezbollah. The additional force includes squadrons of F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16, A-10 and F-22 fighter jets and the personnel needed to support them. The jets were supposed to rotate in and replace the squadrons already there. Instead, both the existing and new squadrons will remain in place to double the airpower on hand. On Sunday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also announced that he was temporarily extending the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and its associated squadrons in the region. The jets are not there to assist in an evacuation, Singh said, 'they are there for the protection of U.S. forces.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sends-a-few-thousand-more-troops-to-middle-east-to-boost-security/7804836.html	2024-09-30T10:17:04-07:00	
Ukrainian, Hungarian FMs have 'frank' discussion	Budapest — Ukraine's new foreign minister held a 'frank' conversation with his Hungarian counterpart on 'difficult issues' on Monday, against a backdrop of a frosty relationship between the neighboring countries. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been the only EU leader to maintain close ties with the Kremlin since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. He has repeatedly stalled efforts to punish Moscow and to aid war-torn Ukraine in its fight against the invading forces. Budapest refuses to approve the release of more than $7.25 billion to Kyiv, complaining about discriminatory measures against Hungarian companies. 'We had a very frank one-on-one conversation discussing difficult issues, among other things,' Andriy Sybiga told reporters after a meeting with Hungary's top diplomat, Peter Szijjarto, in Budapest. The negotiations between the two ministers 'lasted about an hour, twice as long as planned,' according to a statement from the Ukrainian ministry. Speaking at a press conference, Sybiga welcomed Orban's first visit to Kyiv at the beginning of July and called for 'the development of bilateral relations,' saying he could 'count on Budapest's support' in its EU integration process. 'Our meeting today has convinced me that ... there is a mutual and common will to develop neighborly relations,' Szijjarto added. But Hungary's foreign minister also urged Kyiv to refrain from 'unilateral, sudden steps' that could 'pose a challenge' to the central European country's energy supply. In July, Budapest accused Kyiv of threatening its energy security by barring Russian energy giant Lukoil from using the Ukrainian section of the Druzhba pipeline. Earlier this month, Hungarian energy company MOL made a deal guaranteeing the supply of Russian oil. The two ministers also agreed to accelerate efforts by an intergovernmental working group set up to address a long-running feud over minority rights in Transcarpathia, a western Ukrainian region home to an ethnic Hungarian community.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-hungarian-fms-have-frank-discussion-/7804833.html	2024-09-30T10:16:53-07:00	
Biden spoke with governors after Hurricane Helene, will visit affected areas	washington — U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday he has spoken with the governors of Georgia and North Carolina after the states were affected by Hurricane Helene, which has killed more than 100 people, wiping out communications and leaving millions without power. Biden said he told North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper he would visit the state later this week, and he expects to be there by Wednesday or Thursday. He added he 'may have to request' that Congress returns for a special session to pass a supplemental funding package to help those affected. He said there are reports of 100 dead, with 600 people unaccounted for after the hurricane. 'We will be there with you as long as it takes,' Biden said. 'The Biden-Harris administration will be there until the job is done.' Emergency responders in North Carolina were racing on Monday to try to reach people who remain unaccounted for three days after Hurricane Helene ripped through the southeastern United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-spoke-with-governors-after-hurricane-helene-will-visit-affected-areas-/7804819.html	2024-09-30T09:46:04-07:00	
Thai court approves Vietnam's call for rights activist’s extradition	Bangkok — A Thai court Monday approved the extradition of a human rights activist to his native Vietnam, where rights groups say he faces a high risk of torture and cannot be guaranteed a fair hearing from his country’s courts. Y Quynh Bdap says he fled to Thailand in 2018 to evade arrest for his human rights work on behalf of the Montagnards, a predominantly Christian group of ethnic minorities who live in Vietnam’s central highlands. Thai police arrested him in Bangkok in June at Vietnam’s request. Vietnam wants Bdap back for his alleged role in fomenting a riot last year that left nine people dead, including four police officers, according to state media. Bdap says he had nothing to do with the riot. A Vietnamese court convicted him on related terrorism charges in absentia in January and sentenced him to 10 years in prison. Vietnam’s government has also labeled his group, Montagnards Stand for Justice, a terrorist organization. Bdap’s lawyer, Nadthasiri Bergman, said the judge ignored Thailand’s anti-torture law, which forbids deporting people to countries where they may face torture, claiming it was up to the government — not the courts — to enforce. The government has 90 days to decide whether to carry out the extradition request now that the court has approved it, unless Bdap and his lawyer appeal the verdict. Bergman said they would appeal, and that the 90 days would then begin only after the appeals process is over, should they lose again. If Bdap is ultimately forced back to Vietnam, Bergman said her client would be at serious physical risk, adding that the threat had been corroborated by the United Nations’ refugee agency, the UNHCR. Although Thailand does not legally recognize refugees, the UNHCR’s team in Thailand had granted Bdap one of its own refugee cards after assessing his claims. 'So long as he has [U.N.] refugee status, it means that he cannot go back to his home country, the country that he fled, because there is an existing and imminent threat to his life,' said Bergman. A spokesperson for the Thai government could not be reached for comment. Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch in Thailand, called Monday’s decision by the court 'shocking and disappointing' for ignoring both the country’s international obligations and its own law against refoulement. 'Vietnamese authorities have a long record of mistreating political dissidents, especially those who are on the wanted list like Y Quynh Bdap. So, there are concerns that he will be mistreated in custody of Vietnamese authorities; that includes torture, that includes enforced disappearance,' he told VOA. In May, Human Rights Watch published a detailed report alleging Thailand had made itself increasingly dangerous for foreign asylum-seekers over the past decade by engaging in an informal 'swap mart' with its neighbors, forcibly returning each other’s dissidents regardless of whether they may be arrested, tortured or killed back home. The passage of Thailand’s anti-torture law in 2022 raised hopes that the practice might wane. Sunai, though, said Bdap’s case was the first major test of the law’s refoulement clause, and that Thailand had failed. 'Not only [does] the court decision today put the life of Y Quynh Bdap in danger; it also sets a very dangerous precedent,' he said. 'Now, basically, repressive foreign governments can seek cooperation with Thai authorities to hunt down and extradite dissidents who live in exile in Thailand because Thailand cannot ensure their safety.' He said countries backing Thailand’s current bid for a rotating seat on the U.N.’s Human Rights Council should use their support as leverage to urge the government not to follow through with Bdap’s extradition. Several of the U.N.’s independent rights experts have also urged Thailand to reject Vietnam’s extradition request.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-court-approves-vietnam-s-call-for-rights-activist-s-extradition/7804732.html	2024-09-30T09:00:41-07:00

Taliban asserts new gains against Afghan-based IS offshoot amid skepticism	Islamabad — The Taliban said Monday that their security forces had killed and captured several 'key members' of a regional Islamic State affiliate for plotting recent terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, alleging that the suspects had crossed over from Pakistan. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesperson, listed the claims and so-called successes against Islamic State-Khorasan, or IS-K, locally known as Daesh, in a formal statement without providing evidence to support them. The assertions came after the country’s three immediate neighbors and Russia jointly urged the de facto Kabul government this past Friday to take 'visible and verifiable actions' against transnational terrorist groups, including IS-K, on Afghan soil. Mujahid said the IS-K operatives in question had been involved in several recent attacks in Afghanistan. They included a suicide bombing in the Afghan capital earlier this month and a May gun attack in the central city of Bamiyan, he added. Both attacks resulted in the deaths of at least ten people, including three Spanish tourists, with IS-K claiming credit for them at the time. The Taliban spokesperson said that IS-K insurgents had established 'new operational bases and training camps' in the Pakistani border provinces of Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after fleeing Afghan counterterrorism security operations. 'From these new bases, they continue to orchestrate attacks, both within Afghanistan and in other countries,' he claimed, noting that 'some of the arrested individuals had recently returned to Afghanistan from the Daesh Khorasan training camp' in Balochistan. Islamabad has not immediately responded to the Taliban’s allegations, which came two days after neighboring Pakistan, China, and Iran, along with Russia, at a meeting in New York this past Friday, urged the Taliban to eradicate bases of IS-K and other transnational terrorist groups in Afghanistan. The ministerial meeting warned that these Afghan-based terrorist entities 'continue to pose a serious threat to regional and global security.' According to a joint statement released after the huddle, the participants recognized the Taliban's efforts in combating IS-K. 'They called on de facto authorities to take visible and verifiable actions in fulfilling the international obligations and commitments made by Afghanistan to fight terrorism, dismantle, and eliminate all terrorist groups equally and non-discriminatory and prevent the use of Afghan territory against its neighbors, the region, and beyond,' the statement stressed. It identified the groups in question as IS-K, al-Qaida, Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement, ETIM, which opposes China, anti-Iran Jaish ul-Adl, and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, TTP, as well as the Baloch Liberation Army, BLA, both waging attacks on Pakistani security forces and civilians. The United Nations, in a recent security assessment, also described TTP as 'the largest terrorist group' in Afghanistan, with several thousand operatives, noting that IS-K activities in the country are also turning into a significant regional threat. It noted that the group had intensified cross-border attacks in Pakistan since the Taliban regained power three years ago and is being facilitated by the de facto Afghan rulers. A new report issued Monday documented nearly 1,000 deaths of civilians and security forces in Pakistan during the first nine months of 2024. The Islamabad-based independent Center for Research and Security Studies stated that most of the fatalities resulted from attacks by TTP and BLA-led insurgents. Pakistani authorities have consistently urged Kabul to extradite TTP leaders and militants to Islamabad for trial for instigating deadly violence in the country. The Taliban has rejected Pakistani and U.N. allegations, saying they are not allowing any foreign groups, including TTP, to threaten other countries from Afghanistan. The United States has designated TTP and BLA as global terrorist organizations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-asserts-new-gains-against-afghan-based-is-offshoot-amid-skepticism/7804677.html	2024-09-30T08:49:48-07:00

France's Le Pen denies wrongdoing as she and her party go on trial accused of embezzling EU funds	Paris — French far-right leader Marine Le Pen denied violating any rules as she and her National Rally party and two dozen others went on trial on Monday, accused of embezzling European Parliament funds, in a case that has the potential to derail her political ambitions. Arriving at the court in Paris, Le Pen said she remained confident as 'we have not violated any political and regulatory rules of the European Parliament' and vowed to present the judges with 'extremely serious and extremely solid arguments.' Le Pen and other National Rally members casually greeted each other before sitting down in the first three rows of the packed courtroom. The nine-week trial will be closely watched by Le Pen's political rivals as she is a strong contender in the race to succeed Emmanuel Macron when the next presidential election takes place in 2027. It comes as a new government dominated by centrists and conservatives just came into office in the wake of June-July legislative elections. Some observers expect the trial could prevent National Rally lawmakers, including Le Pen herself, from fully playing their opposition role in Parliament as they would be busy focusing on the party's defense. Since stepping down as party leader three years ago, Le Pen has sought to position herself as a mainstream candidate capable of appealing to a broader electorate. Her efforts have paid off, with the party making significant gains in recent elections at both the European and national levels. But a guilty verdict could seriously undermine her bid to take the Elysee. The National Rally and 27 of its top officials are accused of having used money destined for EU parliamentary aides to pay staff who instead did political work for the party between 2004 and 2016, in violation of the 27-nation bloc's regulations. The National Rally was called National Front at the time. Le Pen, whose party has softened its anti-EU stance in recent years, denies wrongdoing and claims the case is politically driven. 'Parliamentary assistants do not work for the Parliament. They are political assistants to elected officials, political by definition,' she previously said. 'You ask me if I can define the tasks I assigned to my assistants; it depends on each person's skills. Some wrote speeches for me, and some handled logistics and coordination.' If found guilty, Le Pen and her co-defendants could face up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to 1 million euros ($1.1 million) each. Additional penalties, such as the loss of civil rights or ineligibility to run for office, could also be imposed, a scenario that could hamper, or even destroy, Le Pen's goal to mount another presidential bid after Macron's term ends. Le Pen was runner-up to Macron in the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections. She served as party president from 2011 to 2021 and now heads the group of RN lawmakers at the French National Assembly. Despite her denial, her party has already paid back 1 million to the European Parliament, the Parliament's lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve said. Of that amount, 330,000 euros were directly linked to Marine Le Pen's alleged misuse of funds. A longstanding controversy The legal proceedings stem from a 2015 alert raised by Martin Schulz, then-president of the European Parliament, to French authorities about possible fraudulent use of European funds by members of the National Front. Schulz also referred the case to the European Anti-Fraud Office, which launched a separate probe into the matter. The European Parliament's suspicions were further heightened when a 2015 organizational chart showed that 16 European lawmakers and 20 parliamentary assistants held official positions within the party — roles unrelated to their supposed duties as EU parliamentary staff. A subsequent investigation found that some assistants were contractually linked to different MEPs than the ones they were actually working for, suggesting a scheme to divert European funds to pay party employees in France. Misuse of public funds alleged Investigating judges concluded that Le Pen, as party leader, orchestrated the allocation of parliamentary assistance budgets and instructed MEPs to hire individuals holding party positions. These individuals were presented as EU parliamentary assistants, but in reality, were allegedly working for the National Rally in various capacities. The European Parliament's legal team is seeking 2.7 million euros in compensation for financial and reputational damages. This figure corresponds to the 3.7 million euros allegedly defrauded through the scheme, minus the 1 million euros already paid back. During the 2014 European elections, the National Front won a record 24 MEP seats, finishing first with 24.8% of the vote, ahead of the center-right and the Socialists. This surge resulted in a substantial financial windfall for the party, which faced severe financial problems at the time. An audit of the party's accounts between 2013 and 2016 revealed that it was running a deficit of 9.1 million euros by the end of 2016. Yet, the party still had a cash balance of 1.7 million euros and had lent 1 million euros to Le Pen's 2017 presidential campaign, while also holding 87,000 euros in loans to Cotelec, its funding association. At the time, the party was also indebted to a Russian bank for 9.4 million euros, a loan taken out in 2014 for 6 million euros. Suspected systemic practice The investigation uncovered many irregularities involving prominent party members. Thierry Légier, the long-time bodyguard of Le Pen's father Jean-Marie, was listed as his parliamentary assistant. But his resume did not reference this role, and he made no mention of it in his 2012 autobiography. Légier admitted during the investigation that he was not interviewed and signed his employment contract without fully understanding his official role. Jean-Marie Le Pen, who led the National Front from 1972 to 2011, will not appear in court alongside his former colleagues due to health concerns. Now 96, he was deemed unfit to testify by a court in June. He has 11 prior convictions, including for violence against a public official and hate speech. He has denied wrongdoing during his time as party leader, stating that the 'pool' of assistants was common knowledge. 'I did not choose which assistants were assigned to me. That was decided by Marine Le Pen and others. I only signed the contracts,' he said. After hearing a judge read the charges in court on Monday afternoon, Le Pen said she will 'answer all the questions the court may ask.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-le-pen-denies-wrongdoing-as-she-and-her-party-go-on-trial-accused-of-embezzling-eu-funds-/7804507.html	2024-09-30T06:41:17-07:00

Former President Jimmy Carter Reaches Historic 100th Birthday	Atlanta — In a celebration fit for a centenarian, the historic Fox theater in Atlanta recently hosted dozens of musical acts and thousands of guests for a concert celebrating the 100th birthday of Georgia’s one-time governor, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. 'It’s a way to be together and I think that’s who he is fundamentally,' said Jason Carter, who said he believes the concert, featuring some performers that also campaigned for his grandfather in the 1970s, is a unifying – and bipartisan – way to celebrate what one documentary film director calls the 'Rock ‘n Roll President.' 'It’s one of those fundamental human connections that brings people together across geographies, across culture, across any sort of racial dividing lines,' Jason Carter told VOA during a press event ahead of the performances. 'You’ll have both Democrats and Republicans here tonight.' Despite the many speakers, actors, musicians and former presidents who sent video tributes, the one person noticeably absent from the celebration was Jimmy Carter himself. He remains in hospice care at his home 240 kilometers south of Atlanta. 'It’s a 600-person village in the middle of nowhere, and all of his other work at the end of the road in Africa, Mali, South Sudan, has been in those same kinds of 600-person villages,' Jason Carter said. 'He feels a kinship there and he feels a connection and the way that he marks this moment is by being at home.' Jason Carter said his grandfather will watch the concert broadcast on Georgia Public Television, as he celebrates his historic milestone birthday in Plains, Georgia, not far from where his story began, at the Wise Sanitarium, where on October 1, 1924, Lillian Carter, then a nurse at the facility, gave birth to the first U.S. president to have been born in a hospital. The facility is now called the Lillian G. Carter Nursing Center. 'But the only reason he was born in a hospital was because his mother was working that day,' Jill Stuckey, a Carter family friend, told VOA. Stuckey serves as superintendent of the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site in Plains which includes Carter’s preserved Depression-era boyhood farm, the old Plains High School where Carter studied and the railroad depot Carter converted into his campaign headquarters in his successful 1976 White House bid. 'After the hospice announcement nearly a year ago, I didn’t think we’d be at this point,' Stuckey said during an interview with VOA, standing next to a replica of the famous Resolute Desk from the White House Oval Office, now a big draw for tourists who visit Plains High School. Stuckey said Plains celebrates its famous neighbor every day, but this historic birthday is marked by serving others. 'We’re naturalizing 100 new citizens in his honor. Thanks to the secretary of the Navy, we’re having four F-18 jets flyover.' She said another, smaller birthday concert in the Plains High School auditorium is also meant to help the community celebrate the man who rose from being a local peanut farmer to president of the United States. 'He definitely deserves a lot of fanfare, because he’s definitely the greatest person I’ve ever met in my life,' she told VOA. Carter’s milestone is a bittersweet occasion in Plains, though, it’s the first Carter has spent since his wife, Rosalynn, died last November. 'Seventy-seven-and-a-half years of marriage, to be without your partner, your soul mate you know it’s very, very tough times,' said Stuckey, 'It’s tough times on him, but on all of us that knew her, that loved her, the family members.' Carter’s birthday celebration, which began at the Fox theater in September and ends in Plains October 1, brought his large extended family together, including his great-grandson, Charlie Carter, who hinted it may not be the last time such a gathering occurs. 'No… maybe his 101th?' Jimmy Carter also holds the record for the longest post-presidential career. After departing the White House in 1981, he and Rosalynn founded the Atlanta-based global nonprofit Carter Center, which fights neglected tropical diseases, promotes peaceful conflict resolution, and monitors elections around the world, causes which led to Carter winning the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-president-jimmy-carter-reaches-historic-100th-birthday/7804359.html	2024-09-30T04:17:20-07:00	
12 Tunisians dead as boat capsizes off Djerba	Tunis — At least 12 Tunisians including three children were found dead after a migrant boat capsized off the coast of the southeastern island of Djerba on Monday, a judicial official said. The boat went down at dawn and 29 people were rescued, Medenine court spokesman Fethi Baccouche told AFP, adding five men and four women were among the dead, and that the cause of the sinking remained unknown. The Tunisian National Guard said it was alerted by four migrants who swam back ashore. Tunisia and neighboring Libya have become key departure points for migrants seeking better lives in Europe, often risking dangerous Mediterranean crossings. The exodus is fueled by Tunisia's stagnant economy, with only 0.4% of growth in 2023 and unemployment soaring. The North African country has also been shaken by political tensions, after President Kais Saied orchestrated a sweeping power grab in July 2021. Each year, tens of thousands of people attempt to make the crossing, with Italy — whose Lampedusa island is only 150 kilometers (90 miles) away — often their first port of call. Since January 1, at least 103 makeshift boats have capsized and 341 bodies have been recovered off Tunisia's coast, the government says. Last year, more than 1,300 people died or disappeared last year in shipwrecks off Tunisia, according to the FTDES rights group. The International Organization for Migration has said more than 30,309 migrants have died in the Mediterranean in the past decade, including more than 3,000 last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tunisians-dead-as-boat-capsizes-off-djerba/7804350.html	2024-09-30T04:00:57-07:00	
Oil prices set to fall for third month despite Middle East conflict	London — Oil prices were steady on Monday and on track to fall for the third month in a row as a strong supply outlook and questions around demand outweighed fears that Israeli strikes in Lebanon and Yemen could escalate conflict in the Middle East. Brent crude futures LCOc1 for November delivery, expiring on Monday, lost 10 cents to $71.88 a barrel as of 0933 GMT. The more active December contract LCOc2 rose 6 cents to $71.60. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures CLc1 lost 10 cents to $68.08 a barrel. Both benchmarks had earlier gained more than $1. Brent was on track to lose almost 9% month-on-month, which would be its biggest decline since November 2022. WTI was set to decline more than 7% since the end of August. On Monday prices had been supported by the possibility that Iran, a key producer and member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, may be directly drawn into a widening Middle East conflict. Since last week Israel has escalated attacks, conducting strikes which have killed Hezbollah and Hamas leaders in Lebanon and hit Houthi targets in Yemen. The three groups are backed by Iran. 'We suspect that some oil market participants will look past this escalation given that there still has not been a major physical supply disruption and Iran has not demonstrated any appetite to enter this nearly year-long conflict,' said Helima Croft of RBC Capital Markets. Oil prices also had a muted response to Beijing's announcement last week of fiscal stimulus measures in the world's second-biggest economy and top oil importer. Traders question whether the measures would be enough to boost China's weaker-than-expected demand so far this year. Data on Monday was not encouraging for demand, showing China's manufacturing activity shrank for a fifth straight month and the services sector slowed sharply in September. Instead, prices have been depressed by news that half a million barrels of Libyan crude exports may come back online as a central bank dispute is resolved, and a report that Saudi Arabia may stop targeting an oil price of $100 a barrel as OPEC+ begins to unwind voluntary supply cuts from December. Later on Monday, markets will be waiting to hear from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for clues on the central bank's pace of monetary easing. Seven other Fed policymakers are also due to speak this week, ANZ analysts said in a note.	https://www.voanews.com/a/oil-prices-set-to-fall-for-third-month-despite-middle-east-conflict-/7804328.html	2024-09-30T03:36:57-07:00	
Senior UK judge becomes fifth to leave top Hong Kong court	Hong Kong — A British judge on Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal will step down after his term ends on Monday, the city's judiciary said, the fifth foreign justice to leave the bench this year. Judges from common law jurisdictions are invited to sit as non-permanent members in the former British colony's top court. Their presence has long been considered by authorities as a sign of international confidence in Hong Kong's justice system, which is separate from mainland China's opaque, party-controlled legal system. However, the judiciary has seen an unprecedented exodus this year, with Nicholas Addison Phillips being the latest to leave the bench. The 86-year-old has 'indicated recently that he did not wish to have his term of appointment extended upon its expiry on 30 September 2024 due to personal reasons,' the judiciary said in a statement on Monday. Authorities in Hong Kong have enacted two national security laws to quell dissent since huge, and at times violent, pro-democracy protests were quashed in 2019. The latest came into force in March, drawing criticism from Western nations, including Britain and the United States, about the legislation further curbing freedoms in Hong Kong. Two senior British judges resigned from Hong Kong's top court in June. One of them, Jonathan Sumption, 75, wrote an opinion piece in The Financial Times that he had resigned because 'rule of law is profoundly compromised.' The other, Lawrence Collins, 83, cited Hong Kong's 'political situation' as the reason for his resignation. The other two who declined to extend their terms, an Australian judge in March and a Canadian judge in July, cited old age and personal reasons for their resignations. Phillips, a former chief justice of the United Kingdom's Supreme Court, has served for 12 years since he joined the court in 2012. The judiciary thanked him for his 'support for the rule of law in Hong Kong during his tenure.' It said on Monday that 'despite the departure of some (non-permanent judges) in recent years, an overwhelming majority of the serving and departed (judges) have publicly reiterated their continued confidence in judicial independence in Hong Kong.' Six foreign judges will remain on the Court of Final Appeal following Phillips's departure. Hong Kong had five overseas judges sitting in its top court when the city was handed back to China in 1997. The bench gradually expanded to 15 members in 2019 and 2020 before downsizing for four consecutive years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senior-uk-judge-becomes-fifth-to-leave-top-hong-kong-court/7804284.html	2024-09-30T02:30:25-07:00	
Police chief jailed for three years over S. Korea crowd crush: Yonhap	SEOUL, South Korea — A South Korean court handed a three-year jail term Monday to a former Seoul district police chief over a crush that killed more than 150 people, the Yonhap news agency reported. Tens of thousands of people, mostly in their 20s and 30s, had been out on October 29, 2022, to enjoy the first post-pandemic Halloween celebrations in the popular Itaewon nightlife district. But the night turned deadly when people poured into a narrow, sloping alleyway between bars and clubs, the weight of their bodies and a lack of effective crowd control leading to scores of people being crushed to death. Former Yongsan district police chief Lee Im-jae was found guilty of failing to prevent the crush, the first police officer to be convicted for a direct role in the disaster. 'It was foreseeable that there would be a large crowd of people in the sloped alley of Itaewon that would lead to serious danger to life and physical safety on the Halloween weekend in 2022,' the Seoul Western District Court said in the guilty verdict, Yonhap reported. Another former officer in charge of the Yongsan police emergency center was sentenced Monday to two years in jail on the same charges. 'This ruling, which acknowledges the responsibility of police officers in connection to the tragedy, is a rightful outcome in holding those responsible for the disaster accountable,' a group of victims' families said in a statement. The Seoul court, however, found local official Park Hee-young, head of the Yongsan Ward office, not guilty on similar charges. 'The direct cause of the accident in this case was the influx of a large crowd,' the court said, according to the Korean news agency Newsis. 'There are no existing regulations granting administrative authorities the power to control the crowd influx or disperse crowds,' it said in acquitting Park and three former ward officials. Police chief verdict Earlier this year, two former senior police officers were jailed for destroying evidence linked to the crush, making them the first police to be sentenced in connection to the incident. The court found that in the aftermath of the disaster, they had ordered the deletion of four internal police reports that had identified in advance safety concerns over possible overcrowding in the area. Kim Kwang-ho, the former head of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, has also been on trial and is awaiting a verdict on charges of professional negligence resulting in injury or death. Prosecutors are seeking a five-year term for the ex-chief, with a verdict expected next month. Kim has denied wrongdoing, telling the court in April: 'Instead of seeking a scapegoat, real preventive measures should be carried out,' broadcaster JTBC has reported. District-level officials have been prosecuted over the disaster, but no high-ranking members of government have resigned or faced prosecution, despite criticism from victims' families over a lack of accountability. South Korea's rapid transformation from a war-torn country to Asia's fourth-largest economy and a global cultural powerhouse is a source of national pride. But a series of preventable disasters, such as the 2022 crush and the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking that killed 304 people, has shaken public confidence in authorities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-chief-jailed-for-three-years-over-s-korea-crowd-crush-yonhap/7804278.html	2024-09-30T02:23:58-07:00	
Australian treasurer makes landmark visit to China	SYDNEY — Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers has been in China on a landmark visit to stabilize his country’s relationship with its biggest trading partner. The trip, the first by an Australian treasurer to Beijing in seven years, is a sign that bilateral ties are improving after years of mistrust. But frictions persist, including tensions in the South China Sea. Chalmers' two-day trip to China has been aimed at repairing ties with Australia's largest trading partner, damaged by disagreements over trade and geopolitics. In Beijing, Chalmers has discussed boosting economic ties with his Chinese hosts. The Australian treasurer has been upbeat about prospects for the Chinese economy, despite its recent slowdown. He told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Monday that Canberra and Beijing can do more to boost trade. 'There could not have been a more important time for us to restart our strategic economic dialogue with China,' he said. 'The Chinese authorities announced some quite substantial steps when it comes to supporting growth in the Chinese economy.' Last week, China said it carried out a rare test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile into international waters, prompting anger in neighboring countries. Defense officials in Beijing insisted the test firing that involved a dummy warhead was a 'routine' part of its 'annual training.' Chalmers said Friday that he had voiced his concerns about the launch to Chinese government officials. Australia’s shadow foreign affairs minister Simon Birmingham told local media that the Canberra government must continue to urge Beijing to show restraint. The message of regional and global stability, and the role China can play by not undertaking aggressive military postures in the South China Sea, is important for the economy, Birmingham said. Australia's center-left government has made the stabilization of ties with China a priority since it came to power in May 2022. But it must balance its key commercial relationship with China with growing security ties with its traditional allies. The Canberra government says the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine pact is 'on track' and will 'endure for decades' after a meeting of Australian, American and British defense ministers in London last Thursday. The 2021 trilateral accord is considered by analysts to be a response to China’s growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. It will give Australia the technology and hardware to build, run and maintain nuclear-powered submarines. Beijing has insisted the security pact undermines peace and stability.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-treasurer-makes-landmark-visit-to-china/7804265.html	2024-09-30T01:25:20-07:00

Austria's rightward shift puts immigration in crosshairs	VIENNA — Picknicking with friends in the park after prayers at a Vienna mosque, Saima Arab, a 20-year-old pedicurist originally from Afghanistan, is thankful for her freedoms in Austria. 'We could never do this in Afghanistan, never cook, go out, just sit in public like this,' said Arab, who came to Austria in 2017. 'Home is like a prison there.' Many Austrians, however, are worried about their country's ability to integrate migrants, especially Muslims, and their desire for stricter immigration laws was a key issue in Sunday's election which gave victory to the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) for the first time. Both the FPO and the runner-up, the ruling conservative Austrian People's Party (OVP), ran on pledges to tighten asylum laws and crack down on illegal immigration. The FPO victory added to critics' concerns about the rise of the far right in Europe after electoral gains in recent months by the Alternative for Germany and the National Rally in France. 'Whatever the government looks like after the election, I'm certain it'll work towards toughening up asylum and immigration law,' Professor Walter Obwexer, an adviser to the government on migration law, said before the vote. Arab, who also spoke to Reuters in an interview conducted before the election, said she did not like to talk about politics but hoped she too would vote in Austria one day. The number of people in Austria born abroad or whose parents were jumped by more than a third between 2015 and last year, and now account for around 27% of the population of about 9 million. Together the FPO and the OVP won over 55% of the vote and one of the two is almost certain to lead the next government, feeding expectations that Austria, like neighboring Germany and Hungary, and France, will adopt tougher rules. Opinion polls showed immigration and inflation were key voter concerns. Such is the worry that Austria is taking in migrants faster than it can integrate them that even some Austrians of Muslim origin feel Austria is stretched. 'I wonder if the system is close to collapse,' said Mehmet Ozay, a Turkish-born Austrian FPO supporter, arguing there were too many asylum seekers not contributing to state coffers. Taylor Swift concert The FPO has combined its tough talk on immigration with criticism of Islam. The issue took center stage last month when police arrested a teenager with North Macedonian roots on suspicion of masterminding a failed Islamic State-inspired attack on a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna. Running on the campaign slogan 'Fortress Austria,' the FPO promoted 'remigration,' including returning asylum seekers to their countries of origin, especially if they fail to integrate, and limiting asylum rights. That has unsettled some who feel the party, which dropped some of its more polarizing slogans in the campaign, is demonizing foreigners. The FPO, which did not reply to a request for comment, denies this. It says asylum seekers are a drain on state resources, and draws attention to crimes some of them commit. 'The FPO routinely talk about refugees and asylum seekers as rapists and thieves and drug dealers,' said Hedy, a social worker and Austrian citizen who arrived as a refugee from Afghanistan. He declined to give his last name. 'Something very similar happened to the Jews in Vienna before the Second World War,' he said, adding that the FPO, which wants to ban 'political Islam,' would embolden xenophobes. The FPO, whose first leader was a former Nazi lawmaker, has sought to distance itself from its past, and in 2019 helped pass a law allowing foreign descendants of Austrian victims of National Socialism to acquire Austrian citizenship. This month FPO leader Herbert Kickl called Adolf Hitler the 'biggest mass murderer in human history,' as he roundly denounced the Nazi dictator's legacy in a television debate. Still, Alon Ishay, head of the Austrian Association of Jewish Students, said he saw some parallels between targeting of Jews in the early Nazi era and attitudes to Muslims now. 'There are rhetorical similarities when you talk about deportation, when you talk about taking people's citizenship away,' he said, also speaking before Sunday's election. FPO-backer Ozay disagreed, saying that Muslims such as himself were free to do as they liked in Austria. 'If there were daily attacks by FPO voters I would understand the fear that things would get even more extreme if Kickl came to power,' he said. 'But that's not how it is. It's just fear stirred up by the other parties.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/austria-s-rightward-shift-puts-immigration-in-crosshairs/7804238.html	2024-09-29T23:51:08-07:00

Norway mulls building a fence on Russian border, following Finland's example	HELSINKI — Norway may put a fence along part or all the 198-kilometer (123-mile) border it shares with Russia, a minister said, a move inspired by a similar project in its Nordic neighbor Finland. 'A border fence is very interesting, not only because it can act as a deterrent but also because it contains sensors and technology that allow you to detect if people are moving close to the border,' Justice Minister Emilie Enger Mehl said in an interview with the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK published late Saturday. She said the Norwegian government is currently looking at 'several measures' to beef up security on the border with Russia in the Arctic north, such as fencing, increasing the number of border staff or stepping up monitoring. The Storskog border station, which has witnessed only a handful of illegal border crossing attempts in the past few years, is the only official crossing point into Norway from Russia. Should the security situation in the delicate Arctic area worsen, the Norwegian government is ready to close the border on short notice, said Enger Mehl, who visited neighboring Finland this summer to learn about how the entire 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) Finnish-Russian land border was closed. The Finnish government was prompted to close all crossing points from Russia to Finland in late 2023 after more than 1,300 third-country migrants without proper documentation or visas — an unusually high number — entered the country in three months, just months after the nation became a member of NATO. To prevent Moscow using migrants in what the Finnish government calls Russia’s 'hybrid warfare,' Helsinki is currently building fences with a total length of up to 200 kilometers (124 miles) in separate sections along the border zone that makes up part of NATO’s northern flank and serves as the European Union’s external border. Finnish border officials say fences equipped with top-notch surveillance equipment — to be located mostly around crossing points — are needed to better monitor and control any migrants attempting to cross over from Russia and give officials time to react. Inspired by Finland’s project, Enger Mehl said that such a fence could also be a good idea for Norway. According to NRK, her statement was supported by police chief Ellen Katrine Hætta in Norway’s northern Finnmark county. 'It’s a measure that may become relevant on all or part of the border' between Norway and Russia, Enger Mehl said. The Storskog border station is currently surrounded by a 200-meter (660-foot) -long and 3.5-meter (12-foot) -high fence erected in 2016 after some 5,000 migrants and asylum-seekers had crossed over from Russia to Norway a year earlier. Norway, a nation of 5.6 million, is a NATO member but isn't part of the European Union. However, it belongs to the EU's Schengen area, whose participants have abolished border controls at their mutual borders, guaranteeing free movement of citizens.	https://www.voanews.com/a/norway-mulls-building-a-fence-on-russian-border-following-finland-s-example/7804160.html	2024-09-29T17:35:50-07:00	
Kris Kristofferson, singer-songwriter and actor, dies at 88	Los Angeles — Kris Kristofferson, a Rhodes scholar with a deft writing style and rough charisma who became a country music superstar and A-list Hollywood actor, has died. Kristofferson died at his home in Maui, Hawaii on Saturday, family spokesperson Ebie McFarland said in an email. He was 88. McFarland said Kristofferson died peacefully, surrounded by his family. No cause was given. He was 88. Starting in the late 1960s, the Brownsville, Texas native wrote such classics standards as 'Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down,' 'Help Me Make It Through the Night,' 'For the Good Times' and 'Me and Bobby McGee.' Kristofferson was a singer himself, but many of his songs were best known as performed by others, whether Ray Price crooning 'For the Good Times' or Janis Joplin belting out 'Me and Bobby McGee.' Kristofferson, who could recite William Blake from memory, wove intricate folk music lyrics about loneliness and tender romance into popular country music. With his long hair and bell-bottomed slacks and counterculture songs influenced by Bob Dylan, he represented a new breed of country songwriters along with such peers as Willie Nelson, John Prine and Tom T. Hall. 'There's no better songwriter alive than Kris Kristofferson,' Nelson said during a November 2009 award ceremony for Kristofferson held by BMI. 'Everything he writes is a standard and we're all just going to have to live with that.' As an actor, he played the leading man opposite Barbara Streisand and Ellen Burstyn, but also had a fondness for shoot-out Westerns and cowboy dramas. He was a Golden Gloves boxer and football player in college, received a master’s degree in English from Merton College at the University of Oxford in England and turned down an appointment to teach at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, to pursue songwriting in Nashville. Hoping to break into the industry, he worked as a part-time janitor at Columbia Records’ Music Row studio in 1966 when Dylan recorded tracks for the seminal 'Blonde on Blonde' double album. At times, the legend of Kristofferson was larger than real life. Johnny Cash liked to tell a mostly exaggerated story of how Kristofferson, a former U.S. Army pilot, landed a helicopter on Cash’s lawn to give him a tape of 'Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down' with a beer in one hand. Over the years in interviews, Kristofferson said with all respect to Cash, while he did land a helicopter at Cash’s house, the ‘man in black’ wasn’t even home at the time, the demo tape was a song that no one ever actually cut, and he certainly couldn’t fly a helicopter holding a beer. In a 2006 interview with The Associated Press, he said he might not have had a career without Cash. 'Shaking his hand when I was still in the Army backstage at the Grand Ole Opry was the moment I’d decided I’d come back,' Kristofferson said. 'It was electric. He kind of took me under his wing before he cut any of my songs. He cut my first record that was record of the year. He put me on stage the first time.' One of his most recorded songs, 'Me and Bobby McGee,' was written based on a recommendation from Monument Records founder Fred Foster. Foster had a song title in his head called 'Me and Bobby McKee,' named after a female secretary in his building. Kristofferson said in an interview in the magazine, Performing Songwriter, that he was inspired to write the lyrics about a man and woman on the road together after watching the Frederico Fellini film, 'La Strada.' Joplin, who had a close relationship with Kristofferson, changed the lyrics to make Bobby McGee a man and cut her version just days before she died in 1970 from a drug overdose. The recording became a posthumous No. 1 hit for Joplin. Hits that Kristofferson recorded include 'Why Me,' 'Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I’ll Ever Do),' 'Watch Closely Now,' 'Desperados Waiting for a Train,' 'A Song I’d Like to Sing' and 'Jesus Was a Capricorn.' In 1973, he married fellow songwriter Rita Coolidge and together they had a successful duet career that earned them two Grammy awards. They divorced in 1980.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kris-kristofferson-singer-songwriter-and-actor-dies-at-88/7803884.html	2024-09-29T16:42:08-07:00	
Harris to campaign again in swing-state Nevada	Los Angeles — Vice President Kamala Harris is set to rally in Las Vegas on Sunday night as both she and Republican Donald Trump continue to make frequent trips to Nevada, looking to gain momentum in the swing state as Election Day nears. The rally is part of Harris' latest West Coast swing, which included making her first trip to the U.S.-Mexico border since taking over for President Joe Biden atop the Democratic presidential ticket. On Friday, the vice president walked alongside a towering, rust-colored border wall fitted with barbed wire in Douglas, Arizona, and met with federal authorities. She attended a San Francisco fundraiser Saturday and had plans for a Sunday event in Los Angeles before heading to Nevada, with a return to Washington set for Monday night. 'This race is as close as it could possibly be,' she said Saturday to a raucous crowd of donors. 'This is a margin-of-error race.' Harris said even if there is enthusiasm, she's running like an underdog. And she invited people to 'join our team in battleground states' to help get voters to the polls — even if it's Californians making calls from home. On Sunday, former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake became the latest prominent Republican to endorse Harris and Walz. He credited them with a 'fine character and love of country' and said he wants a president who does not treat political adversaries as enemies or try to subvert the will of voters. Flake, a longtime critic of the former president, joins a list of anti-Trump Republicans who have said they will vote for the Democratic ticket, not just refrain from voting for Trump. Among them is Dick Cheney, the deeply conservative former vice president, and his daughter, Liz. On Sunday, Maryland Senate candidate Larry Hogan, a former Republican governor and a sharp critic of Trump, said Harris has yet to earn his vote, though Trump won't get it. In Nevada, all voters automatically receive ballots by mail unless they opt out — a pandemic-era change that was set in state law. That means most ballots could start going out in a matter of weeks, well before Election Day on Nov. 5. Harris plans to be back in Las Vegas on Oct. 10 for a town hall with Hispanic voters. Both she and Republican rival Donald Trump have campaigned frequently in the city, highlighting the critical role that Nevada, and its mere six votes in the Electoral College, could play in deciding an election expected to be exceedingly close. Trump held his own Las Vegas rally on Sept. 13 at the Expo World Market Center, where Harris is speaking Sunday. Her campaign has frequently scheduled events in the same venue where her opponent previously spoke, including in Milwaukee, Atlanta and suburban Phoenix. During his Las Vegas event, the former president singled out people crossing into the U.S. illegally, saying Harris 'would be the president of invasion.' During a campaign stop in the city in June, Trump promised to eliminate taxes on tips received by waiters, hotel workers and thousands of other service industry employees. Harris used her own Las Vegas rally in August to make the same promise. Fully doing away with federal taxes on tips would probably require an act from Congress. Still, Nevada's Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 hospitality workers in Las Vegas and Reno, has endorsed Harris. Ted Pappageorge, the culinary union's secretary-treasurer, said the difference between the dueling no-taxes-on-tips proposals is that Harris has also pledged to tackle what his union calls 'sub-minimum wage,' where employers pay service industry workers small salaries and meet minimum wage thresholds by expecting employees to supplement those with tips. Harris has no public schedule for Tuesday, when her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, squares off against Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance for the first and only vice presidential debate of the campaign. But Harris and Walz will campaign jointly on Wednesday, making a bus tour with various stops through central Pennsylvania. The campaign says that during that swing, both will emphasize plans to energize U.S. manufacturing, including by using tax credits to encourage steel production and overhaul federal permitting systems to increase American construction.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-to-campaign-again-in-swing-state-nevada/7803883.html	2024-09-29T16:33:14-07:00	
China hails 'Queen Wen,' the tennis star who fulfilled a dream	Beijing — Zheng Qinwen's parents sold the family home to fund her tennis dreams and now she is an Olympic champion and China's biggest current sports star. The 21-year-old is playing at home for the first time since becoming the first Chinese player to win an Olympic singles tennis gold when she triumphed in Paris. She did not disappoint in her opening match at the China Open, sweeping aside 71st-ranked Russian Kamilla Rakhimova 6-1, 6-1 in front of an adoring Beijing crowd Saturday. Zheng was taken aback by the atmosphere, calling it 'insane' and saying she had hardly ever seen a crowd so full. 'I was a little bit shocked,' said Zheng, who trains in Barcelona and is at a best-ever ranking of seven in the world but tipped to go higher. Zheng has already earned more than $5 million in prize money and also has numerous endorsements from major global brands including Nike and Rolex. Off court she has also appeared on the front pages of GQ magazine and Harper's Bazaar. Known as 'Queen Wen' in China, Zheng has won three WTA Tour titles, and this year reached her first Grand Slam final at the Australian Open. She was comprehensively beaten 6-3, 6-2 by defending champion Aryna Sabalenka, who beat the Chinese again in straight sets at the recent U.S. Open. The world No. 2 from Belarus, who went on to win the U.S. Open, is the top seed in the Chinese capital this week and the two players are on course to meet in the semi-finals. Zheng says she is a better player now than she was in Melbourne and with the crowd behind her she could take some stopping. She faces Nadia Podoroska of Argentina in the third round. Michelle Zhang, a local fan at the China Open whose two children play tennis, said, 'We admire her for doing a lot for the country.' Friend Adele Xue added, 'she showed people that Chinese people can play tennis.' Never gives up Zheng grew up idolizing Li Na, the Chinese trailblazer who won two Grand Slam titles. Li's French Open triumph in 2011 made her the first player from Asia to win a major singles crown. Li is from Wuhan, where Zheng moved as a child to pursue her tennis ambitions. After the China Open, Wuhan is the next stop on the WTA Tour and Zheng would dearly love to win there. Known as approachable and friendly off court, Zheng is fiercely determined and competitive on it. She was talented in multiple sports as a child and her father Zheng Jianping was a track-and-field athlete. Jianping said Zheng's interest in tennis was sparked by a trip to Beijing to watch the Olympics when she was six years old. After returning from the capital, Zheng began learning tennis and her ability was soon noticed by local talent scouts. Two years later her father took her from their home in Shiyan to the provincial capital Wuhan for professional training. 'One of the best things about this child is that she never gives up,' her Wuhan coach, Yu Liqiao, told local media. After winning Olympic gold in Paris, Zheng revealed that her father had sold the family house to fund her budding tennis career when she was in her teens. Her mother Deng Fang sold train tickets at a railway station but gave up the job to make sure her daughter slept and ate properly during training. Zheng was among the millions of tennis fans glued to their televisions in China to see Li Na win the Australian Open in 2014. Zheng, then 11, was interviewed on television and confidently stated that she was aiming for the top. 'I want to play in the Grand Slams and fight for championships,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-hails-queen-wen-the-tennis-star-who-fulfilled-a-dream/7803878.html	2024-09-29T16:06:07-07:00	
Russian PM to meet with Iranian president in Tehran	Moscow — Russia announced Sunday that Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin will meet Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran on Monday. The announcement came as Russia has condemned Israel's 'political murder' of Iran-backed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Mishustin will hold talks with Pezeshkian and First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref, the government statement said. 'It is planned to discuss the full range of Russian-Iranian cooperation in the trade and economic and cultural and humanitarian spheres,' Russia said. The talks will focus on 'carrying out large joint projects in fields involving transport energy, industry and agriculture,' the statement added. Western governments have accused Iran of supplying both drones and missiles to Moscow for its war on Ukraine, a charge Tehran has repeatedly denied. Pezeshkian is set to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a visit to Russia next month to attend the BRICS summit. After leaving Iran, Russian Prime Minister Mishustin will attend a meeting in Armenia on Tuesday of the Eurasian Economic Forum, the government said Sunday, referring to a body within the framework of a grouping of former Soviet states. The statement said the meeting would discuss digitalization, market operations and cooperation within the Eurasian Economic Union, made up of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia. Russia often presents the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) as an alternative to Western political and economic groupings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-pm-to-meet-with-iranian-president-in-tehran/7803874.html	2024-09-29T15:52:49-07:00	
Iran's president denounces Israeli attacks on Tehran's regional allies	Dubai, UAE — Israel should not be allowed to attack countries in the Iran-aligned 'Axis of Resistance' one after the other, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Sunday. Israel said it had bombed Houthi targets in Yemen on Sunday, expanding its confrontation with Iran's allies in the region after killing the Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on Friday in an escalating conflict in Lebanon. Pezeshkian, in comments carried by state media, said Lebanon should be supported. 'Lebanese fighters should not be left alone in this battle so that the Zionist regime (Israel) does not attack Axis of Resistance countries one after the other,' he said. An Iranian Revolutionary Guards deputy commander, Abbas Nilforoushan, was also killed in the attack that killed the Hezbollah leader in Beirut. 'We cannot accept such actions, and they will not be left unanswered. A decisive reaction is necessary,' Pezeshkian said. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani condemned the Israeli strikes in Yemen, saying in a statement that they had targeted 'civilian infrastructure' such as a power plant and fuel tanks. 'Iran once again warns about the consequences of the Zionist regime's (Israel) warmongering on regional and international peace and security,' spokesperson Nasser Kanaani added. In another Israeli attack on Yemen in July, fighter jets bombed 'dual-use sites such as energy infrastructure' in Hodeidah, with Israel's military spokesperson saying the port was used by the Houthis to receive Iranian weapons shipments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-president-denounces-israeli-attacks-on-tehran-s-regional-allies/7803872.html	2024-09-29T15:43:55-07:00	
Stuck NASA astronauts welcome SpaceX capsule to bring them home next year	Cape Canaveral, Florida — The two astronauts stuck at the International Space Station since June welcomed their new ride home with Sunday's arrival of a SpaceX capsule. SpaceX launched the rescue mission on Saturday with a downsized crew of two astronauts and two empty seats reserved for Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who will return next year. The Dragon capsule docked in darkness high over Botswana as the two craft soared 420 kilometers above Earth. NASA switched Wilmore and Williams to SpaceX following concerns over the safety of their Boeing Starliner capsule. It was the first Starliner test flight with a crew, and NASA decided the thruster failures and helium leaks that cropped up after liftoff were too serious and poorly understood to risk the test pilots' return. So Starliner returned to Earth empty earlier this month. The Dragon carrying NASA's Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency's Alexander Gorbunov will remain at the space station until February, turning what should have been a weeklong trip for Wilmore and Williams into a mission lasting more than eight months. Two NASA astronauts were pulled from the mission to make room for Wilmore and Williams on the return leg. NASA likes to replace its station crews every six months or so. SpaceX has provided the taxi service since the company's first astronaut flight in 2020. NASA also hired Boeing for ferry flights after the space shuttles were retired, but flawed software and other Starliner issues led to years of delays and more than $1 billion in repairs. Starliner inspections are underway at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, with post-flight reviews of data set to begin this week. 'We're a long way from saying, 'Hey, we're writing off Boeing,'' NASA's associate administrator Jim Free said at a pre-launch briefing. The arrival of two fresh astronauts means the four who have been up there since March can now return to Earth in their own SpaceX capsule in just over a week. Their stay was extended a month because of the Starliner turmoil. Although Saturday's liftoff went well, SpaceX said the rocket's spent upper stage ended up outside its targeted impact zone in the Pacific because of a bad engine firing. The company has halted all Falcon launches until it figures out what went wrong.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stuck-nasa-astronauts-welcome-spacex-capsule-to-bring-them-home-next-year/7803866.html	2024-09-29T15:34:31-07:00	
Top Iranian general died in Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah leader	Dubai, UAE — A prominent general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard died in an Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Iranian media reported Saturday. The killing of Gen. Abbas Nilforushan marks the latest casualty suffered by Iran as the nearly yearlong Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip teeters on the edge of becoming a regional conflict. His death ratchets up pressure on Iran to respond, even as Tehran has signaled in recent months that it wants to negotiate with the West over sanctions crushing its economy. Nilforushan, 58, was killed Friday in the strike in Lebanon in which Nasrallah died, the state-owned newspaper Tehran Times reported. Ahmad Reza Pour Khaghan, the deputy head of Iran’s judiciary, also confirmed Nilforushan's death, describing him as a 'guest to the people of Lebanon,' the state-run IRNA news agency said. Khaghan also reportedly said that Iran had the right to retaliate under international law.Nilforushan served as the deputy commander for operations in the Guard, a role overseeing its ground forces. What he was doing in Lebanon on Friday wasn't immediately clear. The Guard's expeditionary Quds Force for decades has armed, trained and relied on Hezbollah as part of its strategy to rely on regional militias as a counterbalance to Israel and the United States. Nilforushan, like other members of the Guard that view Israel as Iran's main enemy, long mocked and criticized the country. 'The Zionist regime has many ethnic, cultural, social and military rifts. It is in vulnerable and in doom status more than before,' Nilforushan said in 2022, according to an IRNA report. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Nilforushan in 2022 and said he had led an organization 'directly in charge of protest suppression.' Those sanctions came amid the monthslong protests in Iran over the death of Mahsa Amini following her arrest for allegedly not wearing her headscarf, or hijab, to the liking of police. At the time, Nilforushan accused Iran's enemies abroad of stoking the demonstrations led by Iranian women that challenged both the mandatory hijab and the country's theocracy. Nilforushan also served in Syria, backing President Bashar Assad in his country’s decades-long war that grew out of the 2011 Arab Spring. Like many of his colleagues, he began his military career in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. In 2020, Iranian state television called him a 'comrade' of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of its expeditionary Quds Force who was killed in a U.S. drone attack in Baghdad that year. Nilforushan's death comes as Iran in recent months has been signaling it wants to change its tack with the West after years of tensions stemming from then-President Donald Trump's unilateral withdrawal of America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. In July, Iranian voters elected reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian following a helicopter crash that killed President Ebrahim Raisi, a hard-line protege to 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. While critical of Israel, Pezeshkian has maintained that Iran is willing to negotiate over its nuclear program, which now enriches uranium to near weapons-grade levels. While Iran has been able to sell oil abroad despite sanctions, it likely was at a steep discount and energy prices have fallen farther in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Iran still threatens to retaliate for Soleimani's killing and the suspected Israeli assassination in Tehran of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in July. Iran hasn't explained why it hasn't struck yet, though an unprecedented direct attack it launched in April on Israel failed to seriously damage any major target.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-iranian-general-died-in-israeli-strike-that-killed-hezbollah-leader/7803864.html	2024-09-29T15:24:07-07:00	
Taiwan on alert over 'multiple waves' of missile firings in inland China	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan's Defense Ministry said Sunday it was on alert after detecting 'multiple waves' of missile firing deep in inland China, days after Beijing said it had carried out a successful test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Democratically governed Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, keeps a close watch on Chinese military drills given Beijing's regular activities around the island, but only rarely releases details of what it sees taking place inside China. The ministry said that starting from 6:50 a.m. (2250 GMT Saturday) it had detected 'multiple waves of firing' by China's Rocket Force and army in the provinces and regions of Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Qinghai and Xinjiang, which all lie at least 2,000 km (1,200 miles) from Taiwan. Taiwan's forces are 'continuously monitoring relevant developments, and air defense forces have maintained a high level of vigilance and strengthened their alert,' the ministry added in a statement. China's Defense Ministry did not answer calls seeking comment outside of office hours. The Rocket Force oversees China's conventional and nuclear missile arsenal. On Thursday, Taiwan's Defense Ministry raised the alarm over a renewed surge of Chinese military activity around the island and live fire drills, accusing Beijing of policy instability. China's military responded by saying its activities around Taiwan were 'legitimate' and its drills would continue. A day earlier, China said it had successfully conducted a rare launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, into the Pacific Ocean. In August 2022, China fired missiles into the waters around Taiwan during war games to express anger at a visit to Taipei by then-Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. Taiwan operates powerful radar stations on some of the peaks of its central mountain range that can look far into China, according to security sources.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-on-alert-over-multiple-waves-of-missile-firings-in-inland-china/7803861.html	2024-09-29T15:14:35-07:00	
China cutting mortgage rates by end-October as cities ease home-buying curbs	Beijing — China's central bank said Sunday it would tell banks to lower mortgage rates for existing home loans before Oct. 31, as part of sweeping policies to support the country's beleaguered property market as the economy slows. Commercial banks should, in batches, reduce interest rates on existing mortgages to no less than 30 basis points (bps) below the Loan Prime Rate (LPR), the central bank's benchmark rate for mortgages, according to a statement released by the People's Bank of China (PBOC). It is expected to cut existing mortgage rates by about 50 bps on average. Across China, a slew of policies including reductions in down-payment ratios and mortgage rates have been introduced this year to support China's crisis-hit property market. But the stimulus measures have struggled to boost sales or increase liquidity in a market shunned by buyers that has remained a big drag on broader economic growth. Adding to such efforts, Guangzhou city announced Sunday the lifting of all restrictions on home purchases, while Shanghai and Shenzhen said they would ease restrictions on housing purchases by non-local buyers and lower the minimum downpayment ratio for first home buyers to no less than 15%. Reuters reported Friday that Shanghai and Shenzhen were planning to lift key remaining restrictions to attract potential buyers. The announcements Sunday come after China unveiled its biggest stimulus plan Tuesday since the COVID pandemic to pull the economy out of its deflationary funk.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-cutting-mortgage-rates-by-end-october-as-cities-ease-home-buying-curbs/7803856.html	2024-09-29T15:02:24-07:00	
California governor vetoes bill to create first-in-nation AI safety measures	Sacramento, California — California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a landmark bill aimed at establishing first-in-the-nation safety measures for large artificial intelligence models Sunday. The decision is a major blow to efforts attempting to rein in the homegrown industry that is rapidly evolving with little oversight. The bill would have established some of the first regulations on large-scale AI models in the nation and paved the way for AI safety regulations across the country, supporters said. Earlier in September, the Democratic governor told an audience at Dreamforce, an annual conference hosted by software giant Salesforce, that California must lead in regulating AI in the face of federal inaction but that the proposal 'can have a chilling effect on the industry.' The proposal, which drew fierce opposition from startups, tech giants and several Democratic House members, could have hurt the homegrown industry by establishing rigid requirements, Newsom said. 'While well-intentioned, SB 1047 does not take into account whether an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data,' Newsom said in a statement. 'Instead, the bill applies stringent standards to even the most basic functions — so long as a large system deploys it. I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public from real threats posed by the technology.' Newsom on Sunday instead announced that the state will partner with several industry experts, including AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, to develop guardrails around powerful AI models. Li opposed the AI safety proposal. The measure, aimed at reducing potential risks created by AI, would have required companies to test their models and publicly disclose their safety protocols to prevent the models from being manipulated to, for example, wipe out the state’s electric grid or help build chemical weapons. Experts say those scenarios could be possible in the future as the industry continues to rapidly advance. It also would have provided whistleblower protections to workers. The legislation is among a host of bills passed by the legislature this year to regulate AI, fight deepfakes and protect workers. State lawmakers said California must take action this year, citing hard lessons they learned from failing to rein in social media companies when they might have had a chance. Proponents of the measure, including Elon Musk and Anthropic, said the proposal could have injected some levels of transparency and accountability around large-scale AI models, as developers and experts say they still don’t have a full understanding of how AI models behave and why. The bill targeted systems that require more than $100 million to build. No current AI models have hit that threshold, but some experts said that could change within the next year. 'This is because of the massive investment scale-up within the industry,' said Daniel Kokotajlo, a former OpenAI researcher who resigned in April over what he saw as the company’s disregard for AI risks. 'This is a crazy amount of power to have any private company control unaccountably, and it’s also incredibly risky.' The United States is already behind Europe in regulating AI to limit risks. The California proposal wasn't as comprehensive as regulations in Europe, but it would have been a good first step to set guardrails around the rapidly growing technology that is raising concerns about job loss, misinformation, invasions of privacy and automation bias, supporters said. A number of leading AI companies last year voluntarily agreed to follow safeguards set by the White House, such as testing and sharing information about their models. The California bill would have mandated that AI developers follow requirements similar to those commitments, said the measure's supporters. But critics, including former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, argued that the bill would 'kill California tech' and stifle innovation. It would have discouraged AI developers from investing in large models or sharing open-source software, they said. Newsom's decision to veto the bill marks another win in California for big tech companies and AI developers, many of whom spent the past year lobbying alongside the California Chamber of Commerce to sway the governor and lawmakers from advancing AI regulations. Two other sweeping AI proposals, which also faced mounting opposition from the tech industry and others, died ahead of a legislative deadline in August. The bills would have required AI developers to label AI-generated content and ban discrimination from AI tools used to make employment decisions. The governor said earlier this summer he wanted to protect California's status as a global leader in AI, noting that 32 of the world’s top 50 AI companies are located in the state. He has promoted California as an early adopter as the state could soon deploy generative AI tools to address highway congestion, provide tax guidance and streamline homelessness programs. The state also announced last month a voluntary partnership with AI giant Nvidia to help train students, college faculty, developers and data scientists. California is also considering new rules against AI discrimination in hiring practices. Earlier in September, Newsom signed some of the toughest laws in the country to crack down on election deepfakes and measures to protect Hollywood workers from unauthorized AI use. But even with Newsom's veto, the California safety proposal is inspiring lawmakers in other states to take up similar measures, said Tatiana Rice, deputy director of the Future of Privacy Forum, a nonprofit that works with lawmakers on technology and privacy proposals. 'They are going to potentially either copy it or do something similar next legislative session,' Rice said. 'So it’s not going away.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-governor-vetoes-bill-to-create-first-in-nation-ai-safety-measures/7803850.html	2024-09-29T14:43:41-07:00

Thousands protest 'uncontrolled immigration' to Portugal	Lisbon — Thousands of protesters waving Portuguese flags and roaring the national anthem rallied in Lisbon on Sunday to express their anger at 'illegal' and 'uncontrolled' immigration. The demonstrators marched behind banners demanding the 'end of mass immigration' and the expulsion of immigrants guilty of crimes, at the protest called by the far-right Chega party, the country's third-largest political force. Immigration is 'very good' but 'rules are needed,' said Cecilia Guimaraes, a 66-year-old teacher whose parents emigrated to Canada. 'We emigrated legally. That's how it should happen in a developed country,' she told AFP, complaining of a rise in insecurity she fears is linked to foreign arrivals. Chega lawmaker Rui Afonso said Portugal and other European countries were unable to control entries, which generated a 'feeling of insecurity' because 'we don't know their past.' Afonso added that European nations were ill-equipped to 'decently' take in immigrants who were sometimes 'forced to live on the street and fall into crime.' Among the protesters was Chega leader Andre Ventura, whose party more than quadrupled its seats at this year's election. Tensions surfaced as the market approached working-class neighborhoods with large immigrant populations. Some protesters engaged in a standoff with pro-immigration activists in favor of a Portugal open to foreigners. Posters reading 'No Portugal without immigrants' also covered walls and bus stops along the route of the march. The number of foreigners living in Portugal jumped by 33.6 percent last year to reach more than one million, about one-tenth of the total population, according to the Agency for Integration, Migration and Asylum. The center-right government toughened migration policy in June. It scrapped a measure allowing immigrants to apply for regularization if they could prove they had been working for at least one year even if they had entered the country illegally.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-protest-uncontrolled-immigration-to-portugal/7803845.html	2024-09-29T13:59:13-07:00	
Supplies, emergency workers rushed to North Carolina while Florida digs out from Helene's damage	PERRY, Fla. — The U.S. Southeast grappled Sunday with rising death tolls, a lack of vital supplies in isolated, flood-stricken areas and the widespread loss of homes and property while the devastating toll of Hurricane Helene became clear to officials who warned of a lengthy and difficult rebuild. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said Sunday that the death toll of 11 in the state was expected to rise from Helene as rescuers and other emergency workers reached areas isolated by collapsed roads, failing infrastructure and widespread flooding. Cooper, speaking at a press conference, said, 'We know there will be more' deaths and he asked residents to avoid traveling on roadways in western North Carolina not only to avoid dangers but to keep roads clear for emergency vehicles. More than 50 search teams have fanned out across the region in search of stranded people. 'Many people are cut off because the roads are impassable,' he said. Supplies were being airlifted to the region around Asheville, a city tucked in the western North Carolina mountains known for its arts, culture and natural beauty. The rescue efforts included saving 41 people in one mission north of Asheville and an infant. The teams were finding people through both 911 calls and messages on social media, North Carolina Adjutant General Todd Hunt said. The storm upended life throughout the Southeast. Authorities were rushing to airlift supplies and restore communications and roads in flooded Asheville on Sunday as residents along the storm-battered Florida coast gathered for church services. Hurricane Helene roared ashore in Florida’s Big Bend region as a Category 4 hurricane late Thursday with winds of 140 mph. From there, it quickly moved through Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp said Saturday that it 'looks like a bomb went off' after viewing splintered homes and debris-covered highways from the air. Weakened, Helene then soaked the Carolinas and Tennessee with torrential rains, sending creeks and rivers over their banks and straining dams. More than 60 people have been killed in total. Several million people were without power as of Sunday afternoon. In Texas, Jessica Drye Turner begged for someone to rescue her family members stranded on their rooftop in Asheville, surrounded by rising flood waters. 'They are watching 18 wheelers and cars floating by,' Turner wrote in an urgent Facebook post on Friday. But in a follow-up message, which became widely circulated on social media on Saturday, Turner said help had not arrived in time to save her parents, both in their 70s, and her six-year-old nephew. The roof had collapsed and the three drowned. 'I cannot convey in words the sorrow, heartbreak and devastation my sisters and I are going through nor imagine the pain before us,' she wrote. Western North Carolina was isolated because of landslides and flooding that forced the closure of Interstate 40 and other roads. There have been hundreds of water rescues, none more dramatic than in rural Unicoi County in East Tennessee, where dozens of patients and staff were plucked by helicopter from a hospital rooftop Friday. The storm hovered over the Tennessee Valley into Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said. It unleashed the worst flooding in a century in North Carolina. One community, Spruce Pine, was doused with more than 0.6 meters of rain from Tuesday through Saturday. The state is sending water supplies and other items toward Buncombe County and Asheville, but mudslides on Interstate 40 and other blocked highways are preventing the supplies from making it. The county’s own supplies of water were on the other side of the Swannanoa River, away from where most of the 270,000 people in Buncombe County live, officials said. Law enforcement was making plans to send officers to places that still had water, food or gas because of reports of arguments and threats of violence, the sheriff said. 'If you will bear with us and be patient one more day — I hate to say that but I know how desperate water is in our community — but we are pushing as hard as we can to get them up the mountain,' Buncombe County Manager Avril Pinder said. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said North Carolina is seeing historic flooding, especially in the western part of the state. 'I don’t know that anybody could be fully prepared for the amount of flooding and landslides that they are experiencing right now,' she said on CBS’ 'Face the Nation.' 'But we have had teams in there for several days. We’re sending more search and rescue teams in there.' She is touring the stricken states and visits North Carolina on Monday. In Florida's Big Bend, some lost nearly everything they own, emerging from the storm without even a pair of shoes. With sanctuaries still darkened in a county whereas of Sunday morning, 97% of customers were without power, some churches canceled regular services while others like Faith Baptist Church in Perry opted to worship outside. Standing water and tree debris still covers the grounds of Faith Baptist Church. The church called on parishioners to come 'pray for our community' in a message posted to the congregation’s Facebook page. 'We have power. We don’t have electricity,' Immaculate Conception Catholic Church parishioner Marie Ruttinger said. 'Our God has power. That’s for sure.' In Atlanta, 28.24 centimeters of rain fell over 48 hours, the most the city has seen over two days since record keeping began in 1878. In Augusta, in eastern Georgia near the border with South Carolina, officials notified residents Sunday morning that water service would be shut off for 24 to 48 hours in the city and surrounding Richmond County. A news release said trash and debris from the storm 'blocked our ability to pump water.' Officials were distributing bottled water at the municipal building and said each household would receive one case. President Joe Biden said Saturday that Helene’s devastation has been 'overwhelming' and pledged to send help. He also approved a disaster declaration for North Carolina, making federal funding available for affected individuals. Dozens of utilities crews from New England states were also headed south to help with recovery. Federal funding will be critically important for rebuilding local communities, Sen. Marco Rubio said during an appearance on NBC's Meet The Press. 'There are some coastal areas, some of which are now facing their third storm in the last 12 months,' Rubio said. With at least 25 killed in South Carolina, Helene is the deadliest tropical cyclone for the state since Hurricane Hugo killed 35 people when it came ashore just north of Charleston in 1989. Deaths also have been reported in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia. Moody’s Analytics said it expects $15 billion to $26 billion in property damage. AccuWeather’s preliminary estimate of the total damage and economic loss from Helene in the U.S. is between $95 billion and $110 billion. Among the 11 confirmed deaths in Florida were nine people who drowned in their homes in a mandatory evacuation area on the Gulf Coast in Pinellas County, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said. Climate change has exacerbated conditions that allow such storms to thrive, rapidly intensifying in warming waters and turning into powerful cyclones sometimes in a matter of hours. Helene was the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supplies-emergency-workers-rushed-to-north-carolina-while-florida-digs-out-from-helene-s-damage/7803842.html	2024-09-29T13:51:19-07:00

Bangladesh at crossroads as it pursues sweeping constitutional reform	Washington — As Bangladesh pursues constitutional reform, international legal experts say a consensus-based process is vital for creating an enduring charter and ensuring political stability in South Asia’s third most populous nation. The ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August pushed her Awami League party out of power, raising concerns that a key player could be excluded from a process shaping Bangladesh's future. In response, the nine-week interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, recently formed a constitutional reform panel, part of a broader effort to strengthen institutions and avert a return to authoritarian rule. The panel, one of six reform commissions, faces a dilemma: amend the country's 52-year-old constitution or begin afresh. A constitutional rewrite could tackle the issues raised by the recent protests that toppled Hasina's government. Amending the document is quicker but might leave key problems unresolved. Complicating matters, key provisions of the constitution are not amendable. Regardless of the path Bangladesh takes, the lesson from other countries that have implemented change is unmistakable: Experts say successful reform requires the involvement of all major stakeholders. 'The main task of constitutions is to channel group decisions away from violence into politics,' said Tarun Khaitan, a professor of public law at the London School of Economics. 'So, what do you do if you're a group which has no share in political power and no hope of sharing political power any time in the future? You will take to violence.' Yet in a country as deeply divided as Bangladesh, building consensus over a new constitution is a tall order. Two parties — the Awami League and the Bangladesh National Party, or BNP — have dominated politics since its founding in 1971. Except for two rare moments of unity in the 1990s, each party has 'tried to game the system and lock the other out of power,' making Bangladesh perennially unstable. 'I think that is the issue that any constitutional settlement has to resolve,' Khaitan said. Three global lessons Richard Albert, an expert on constitution-making and constitutional design at the University of Texas, noted three lessons that Bangladesh can learn from other parts of the world. First, the process matters more than the document itself. This means that citizens must be engaged in every step, from providing input to enacting the Charter, Albert said. 'We know that when people are involved in the constitution-making process… that sets the stage for a stronger, more enduring, more legitimate constitution,' Albert, who sits on Jamaica’s constitutional reform committee, said in an interview with VOA. Second, resist turning the constitution into a wish list. Many countries make the mistake of including too many promises that they cannot deliver. The rules enshrined in a constitution, Albert said, 'must mean something when they're written in the text of the country's higher [or highest] law.' Third, the people are the ultimate source of legitimacy for a constitution, Albert said. The document must embody the values and aspirations of the citizens. 'They don’t have to be involved in the writing, the drafting, the deliberation of the constitution, but the people must feel and believe that the constitution represents them,' Albert said. There are other lessons too. While public participation is important, the consent of major social and political groups is paramount, Khaitan said. Without a 'consensual process,' he said, minority groups can find themselves left out. Case in point: Nepal, where the minority Madhesis were sidelined despite broad public participation in the making of the 2015 constitution. Lesson from Chile Elsewhere, a lack of consensus has led to outright rejection of a constitution. Among legal scholars, Chile is the poster child for how not to do constitutional reform. In recent years, two successive governments — one left-leaning, the other right-wing — tried and failed to replace a Pinochet-era constitution with a new one stacked with ideological priorities. To some constitutional experts, the South American country’s experience suggests that wholesale constitutional overhauls can fail in deeply polarized countries such as Bangladesh. 'Pursuing constitutional replacement processes in such an environment can become an opportunity to fuel intolerance,' Aldo Valle, a Chilean lawyer and former vice chairman of the country’s constitutional council, wrote in a blog post in 2023. Bangladesh’s constitution gives parliament the power to enact amendments. A 2011 amendment, however, bars changes to basic provisions, from citizens’ fundamental rights to Islam’s designation as the state religion. Such 'constitutional unamendability' is increasingly common around the world, with countries like Turkey and France making certain constitutional provisions unchangeable. In Bangladesh, however, the constitution allows 'one to become incredibly powerful and it has some paths for creating autocracy,' making a rewrite necessary, Ali Riaz, the country's constitution panel chief, told The Daily Star newspaper prior to his appointment earlier in September. Waris Husain, an adjunct professor of law at Howard University, said drafting a new constitution is the easier part of constitution-making, and there are many successful models that Bangladesh can draw on. The real challenge, Husain said, is securing the buy-in of all stakeholders. 'One of the things that you wouldn't want to happen is if you quickly pass a constitution and then subsequently there are so many issues that are raised about it and people haven't bought into that constitution,' Husain said in an interview with VOA. If Bangladesh were to draft a new constitution and put it to a referendum, it would likely have a higher success rate than pushing through an amendment. According to a 2019 study, 94% of referendums to approve a constitution succeed, while 40% of referendums to amend an existing document fail. 'If the plan in Bangladesh is to have recourse to a referendum, the data will be important to consider,' Albert said. As it nears its second month in office, the interim government faces growing pressure to deliver results. But experts say constitutional reform cannot be rushed through — it took Nepal seven years to enact a new charter. Yet Bangladesh’s 'constitutional moment,' a period marked by political turmoil and calls for significant change, can prove fleeting, experts say. 'Public appetite for grand, substantial changes typically remains short-lived,' said Khaitan. 'Bread and butter issues tend to come to dominate very quickly.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/bangladesh-at-crossroads-as-it-pursues-sweeping-constitutional-reform-/7803698.html	2024-09-29T09:49:21-07:00	
Suspect arrested after allegedly setting fires, driving into shops in Germany	Berlin — A man has been arrested after allegedly setting two fires in the western German city of Essen that left 30 people injured and driving a van into two shops, authorities said Sunday. Emergency services were alerted to two fires in residential buildings in quick succession shortly after 5 p.m. Saturday, police said. The injured people included eight children who were seriously hurt, and two of them were in a life-threatening condition after inhaling smoke. Shortly after the fires broke out, a van drove into two shops in the city, causing damage to property but no injuries. The suspect then allegedly threatened people with weapons, but several men managed to push him back with shovels and poles and hold him until police arrived. Police said the suspect was a 41-year-old Essen resident with Syrian citizenship. They said the man's motive appeared to be that his wife had left him, and he targeted houses and shops where people who supported her lived. The fire service said that, when it arrived at the scene of the first blaze, smoke was billowing from the entrance of the building and people were calling for help from windows. Neighbors had put up ladders to help people escape, but they weren't long enough to reach the upper floors. The suspect hasn't commented so far on what happened Saturday but was previously known to authorities for threats and damage to property, police said. Prosecutors were seeking to have him kept in custody on suspicion of arson and attempted murder.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspect-arrested-after-allegedly-setting-fires-driving-into-shops-in-germany-/7803692.html	2024-09-29T09:18:23-07:00	
UN: Tougher measures needed to stem gang violence in Haiti	Geneva — Tougher measures are needed to stem the gang violence in Haiti that has brought the economy and government of the Caribbean Island to its knees by spreading fear and subjugating the population through killings, lootings, exploitation and brutal abuse, according to a report by the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Latest figures documented by the OHCHR show that more than 3,660 people have been killed since January. 'No more lives should be lost to this senseless criminality,' Volker Türk, the U.N.’s human rights chief said in a statement to coincide with the release of the report Friday. He welcomed 'recent positive steps,' such as the establishment of the new Transitional Presidential Council and government, and the deployment of the first contingent of the Multinational Security Support Mission, led by Kenyan police. However, Türk observed that the equipment and personnel on the ground clearly were not sufficient 'to counter the criminal gangs effectively and sustainably, and stop them spreading further and wreaking havoc on peoples’ lives.' The report, which covers the period up to June, details extremely serious patterns of human rights violations and abuses taking place across the capital of Port-au-Prince. It documents at least 860 killings and 393 injuries, including at least 36 children during police operations 'in what could constitute use of unnecessary and disproportionate force.' It says the gangs have continued 'to expand their territorial control and increase illegal revenues' outside the capital into new areas of the country 'in which they could obtain further criminal forms of income.' Ravina Shamdasani, the high commissioner’s spokesperson said gang violence has continued to increase and spread to the Artibonite Department, as well as in the southern part of West Department, which until recently had been largely unaffected by violence. 'In Artibonite, the country’s agricultural heartland, increasing gang violence and extortion have forced farmers to abandon more than 3,000 hectares of land, further imperiling Haiti’s food production, at a time when an estimated 1.6 million people in the country face emergency-level acute food insecurity,' she said. She noted that the gangs are trying to maximize territorial gain as well as financial gain through all sorts of illicit methods, including extortion, protection rackets, killings of perceived opponents, and kidnapping people for ransom. 'They are doing everything they can to maintain this control, including raping women, raping children… gangs have continued to use sexual violence to punish, spread fear and subjugate populations,' she said. According to the report, 'human rights violations and abuses have persisted at alarmingly high levels. The brutal forms of gender-based violence, including sexual violence, have reached new heights, leading to irreversible harm for victims and survivors and destroying various generations.' The report underscores the ambition of the criminal gangs to maintain control and power. It notes that gangs who have benefited from the political instability and have worked to destabilize the former government 'are demanding political influence and amnesties, threatening to resort to heightened violence if their demands are not met.' Authors of the report say the gangs are backing up their demands by warning the authorities on social media 'to prepare for an even more intense battle,' and to reassess their action in view of the arrival of the Multinational Security Support Mission. Following the deployment of the Kenyan peacekeeping troops, the report says a gang leader posted a video on social media showing dozens of armed men chanting their readiness 'to take on these foreign soldiers' who they consider to be 'invaders.' Human rights observers agree that Haiti’s gangs are able to operate their criminal enterprises and carry out large-scale attacks using firearms because of the unimpeded flow of weapons into the country. This, despite an international arms embargo imposed on Haiti by the Security Council. High Commissioner Türk is urging the international community to implement the targeted arms embargo, the travel, and asset freeze imposed by the U.N. Security Council, to stem gang violence in Haiti. He also has signed on to numerous other recommendations set forth in the report, which are aimed at strengthening the police and other state institutions 'crippled by endemic corruption, including the judiciary.' Additionally, he is calling on the authorities to protect children from gangs and to redouble efforts to tackle gender and sexual violence and to protect internally displaced people. Haiti has been in turmoil since the July 7, 2021, assassination of President Jovenel Moise at his home in the Port-au-Prince suburb of Petion-Ville. Armed gangs now control much of the capital and have spread to other parts of the country, where they have carried out massacres, kidnappings, human trafficking and sexual violence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-tougher-measures-needed-to-stem-gang-violence-in-haiti/7803677.html	2024-09-29T08:46:07-07:00

US boosts air support and hikes troops' readiness to deploy for Middle East	Washington — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has authorized the military to reinforce its presence in the Middle East with 'defensive' air-support capabilities and put other forces on a heightened readiness status, the Pentagon said on Sunday. '[Austin] increased the readiness of additional U.S. forces to deploy, elevating our preparedness to respond to various contingencies,' Pentagon spokesman Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder said in a statement. The statement did not detail what new aircraft would be deploying to the region. 'Secretary Austin made clear that should Iran, its partners, or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every necessary measure to defend our people,' Ryder added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-boosts-air-support-and-hikes-troops-readiness-to-deploy-for-middle-east-/7803627.html	2024-09-29T07:47:27-07:00	
Search resumes for 48 missing migrants off Spanish Canaries	Puerto de la Estaca, Spain — Rescue teams on Sunday resumed searching for at least 48 migrants who went messing the day before when their boat overturned just as it was being rescued off Spain's Canary Islands, killing at least nine people. Hopes of finding survivors were slim as sea rescue teams searched the waters off El Hierro, an island in the Atlantic archipelago. It is the latest in a series of such disasters off the coast of Africa. 'The search operation is resuming,' Spain's maritime rescue organisation told AFP. The 48 are 'presumed dead,' Canaries regional president Fernando Clavijo told journalists on Saturday night. More bodies will likely appear 'over the next two, three days,' washed up by the current, he added. Twenty-seven migrants were rescued and nine bodies recovered after the boat, which had set out from Nouadhibou in Mauritania, some 800 kilometers (nearly 500 miles) away, overturned off El Hierro. The tragedy hit when rescuers arrived to assist the migrants after they themselves called emergency services, Spanish officials said. Migrants rushed to one side of the precarious boat, causing it to tip. The migrants 'had gone two days without food or water', which may have fueled their panic, Anselmo Pestana, head of the Canary Islands prefecture, told journalists in the port of La Estaca. Spanish government sources said the boat may have been carrying up to 90 people, instead of 84 as originally announced, which could put the number of missing at more than 50. This disaster follows the death of 39 migrants in early September when their boat sank off Senegal while attempting a similar crossing to the Canaries, from where migrants hope to reach mainland Europe. Thousands of migrants have died in recent years setting off from west Africa to reach Europe via the Atlantic aboard overcrowded and often dilapidated boats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/search-resumes-for-48-missing-migrants-off-spanish-canaries-/7803550.html	2024-09-29T06:10:35-07:00

US airstrikes on Syria kill 37 militants affiliated with extremist groups	BEIRUT — In Syria, 37 militants affiliated to the extremist Islamic State group and an al-Qaida-linked group were killed in two strikes, the United States military said Sunday. Two of the dead were senior militants, it said. U.S. Central Command said it struck northwestern Syria on Tuesday, targeting a senior militant from the al-Qaida-linked Hurras al-Deen group and eight others. They say he was responsible for overseeing military operations. They also announced a strike from earlier this month on Sept. 16, where they conducted a 'large-scale airstrike' on an IS training camp in a remote undisclosed location in central Syria. That attack killed 28 militants, including 'at least four Syrian leaders.' 'The airstrike will disrupt ISIS' capability to conduct operations against U.S. interests, as well as our allies and partners,' the statement read. There are some 900 U.S. forces in Syria, along with an undisclosed number of contractors, mostly trying to prevent any comeback by the extremist IS group, which swept through Iraq and Syria in 2014, taking control of large swaths of territory. U.S. forces advise and assist their key allies in northeastern Syria, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, located not far from strategic areas where Iran-backed militant groups are present, including a key border crossing with Iraq.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-airstrikes-on-syria-kill-37-militants-affiliated-with-extremist-groups-/7803514.html	2024-09-29T05:15:47-07:00	
Militants kill 7 workers, kidnap 20 in southwestern Pakistan	Islamabad — Pakistani authorities said Sunday suspected insurgents killed at least seven workers and abducted 20 others at gunpoint in two attacks overnight in the country’s southwestern Balochistan province. The violence occurred in the Panjgur and Musakhail districts of the sparsely populated insurgency-hit province, which is rich in natural resources. Police said that gunmen attacked a home in Panjgur at around midnight Saturday, spraying its occupants before fleeing on motorcycles. They added that the gunfire wounded one person and that the victims were laborers from the eastern Punjab province. The second attack took place early Sunday when a group of armed men stormed a gas and oil exploration company’s site in Musakhail. Dheeraj Kalra, the local assistant police commissioner, told VOA by phone that the assailants opened fire, vandalized equipment, took 20 workers as hostages, and then escaped. 'A search operation is currently underway in the area to locate the abducted individuals,' he said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for either attack. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the violence and instructed provincial authorities to make all possible efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice, his office in Islamabad said. Late last month, insurgents in Musakhail killed 23 passengers from Punjab who were visiting or working in Balochistan after pulling them off trucks and passenger vehicles. The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attack and a series of other raids across the province on the same day, resulting in the deaths of more than 50 people. The violence marked the most widespread insurgent attacks in impoverished Balochistan in years, targeting security posts, railway lines, and passenger vehicles. Several ethnic Baloch groups, including the BLA, accuse the central government of exploiting the province’s natural resources, and claim their violent campaign is seeking an independent Balochistan. Pakistani officials reject the allegations, saying insurgent activities are aimed at halting economic development in the region. The province shares the country's border with Afghanistan and Iran and is the site of major China-funded infrastructure projects. The BLA, designated as a global terrorist organization by the United States, has recently intensified its attacks. It is known as the largest and most lethal group active in the region, repeatedly demanding that China withdraw from Balochistan and even targeting Chinese nationals working there.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militants-kill-7-workers-kidnap-20-in-southwestern-pakistan-/7803500.html	2024-09-29T04:46:08-07:00	
Japan's Ishiba opts for continuity in early Cabinet picks	TOKYO — Japan's incoming prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, signaled continuity this weekend in his early decisions on key posts for his government, suggesting a desire for stability after an unpredictable leadership race. His picks for finance, defense and foreign minister, as well as the pivotal post of chief cabinet secretary, appear to draw on seasoned veterans from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party, as he prepares to form a government on Tuesday. Ishiba, 67, won the LDP leadership race on Friday, clinching a run-off win after a contest among an unprecedentedly large field of nine candidates. He is set to name former Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya as foreign minister and keep Yoshimasa Hayashi as chief Cabinet secretary, a pivotal post that includes the role of top government spokesperson, sources told Reuters. Ishiba will name former Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato as finance minister and bring Gen Nakatani back as defense minister, Japanese media reported. Ryosei Nakasawa, the deputy minister of finance, will be minister of economic revitalization, the Yomiuri newspaper said on Sunday. Ishiba will tap former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga as vice president of the LDP, sources said, while Japanese media said he would name Shinjiro Koizumi, a rival in the LDP race, as LDP election chief. Ishiba did not detail his Cabinet plans in a televised interview on Sunday but suggested he was willing to consider a snap election in the near future, perhaps as early as October. An election must be called within the next 13 months. He said Japan's monetary policy must remain accommodative as a trend, signaling the need to keep borrowing costs low to underpin a fragile economic recovery. It was not immediately clear whether Ishiba, who had been a vocal critic of the Bank of Japan's past aggressive monetary easing, was taking a more dovish line with his remarks. Iwaya, defense chief from 2018 to 2019, helped Ishiba on strategy in his winning run to lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Former soldier Nakatani, would return to the defense post he held from 2014 to 2016.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-ishiba-opts-for-continuity-in-early-cabinet-picks/7803487.html	2024-09-29T04:23:59-07:00	
125 Ukrainian drones reported in attack sparking fires across Russia, Moscow officials say	KYIV — More than 100 Ukrainian drones were shot down over Russia Sunday, officials said, sparking a wildfire and setting an apartment block alight in one of the largest barrages seen over Russian skies since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russia's Ministry of Defense reported that it had shot down 125 drones overnight across seven regions. The southwestern region of Volgograd came under particularly heavy fire, with 67 Ukrainian drones reportedly downed by Russian air defenses. Seventeen drones were also seen over Russia's Voronezh region, where falling debris damaged an apartment block and a private home, said local governor Aleksandr Gusev. Images on social media showed flames rising from the windows of the top floor of a high-rise building. No casualties were reported. A further 18 drones were reported over Russia's Rostov region, where falling debris sparked a wildfire, said Gov. Vasily Golubev. He said that the fire did not pose a threat to populated areas, but that emergency services were fighting to extinguish the blaze, which had engulfed 20 hectares (49.4 acres) of forest. Meanwhile, 13 civilians were injured in an overnight barrage on the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia Sunday after Ukrainian military leaders warned that Moscow could be preparing for a new military offensive in the country's south. The city was targeted by Russian guide bombs in 10 separate attacks that damaged a high-rise building and several residential homes, regional governor Ivan Fedorov wrote on his official Telegram channel. More people could still be trapped beneath the rubble, he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said that the Zaporizhzhia attack had damaged the city's transport links. 'Today, Russia struck Zaporizhzhia with aerial bombs. Ordinary residential buildings were damaged and the entrance of one building was destroyed. The city's infrastructure and railway were also damaged,' Zelenskyy said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. 'In total, 13 people were injured, and two were rescued from under the rubble. I thank all the emergency services for their rapid response and providing necessary assistance. The rubble clearing is still ongoing.' The attacks come after the Ukrainian military warned Saturday that Russian forces may be preparing for offensive operations in the wider Zaporizhzhia region. Vladyslav Voloshyn, spokesperson for Ukraine's southern military command, said that Russia was amassing personnel in this direction. Ukraine's air force also reported that 22 Russian drones were launched over the country overnight.

Pope Francis, after Belgian criticism, says church has 'no place for abuse'	BRUSSELS — Pope Francis on Sunday wrapped up a weekend trip to Belgium, where he faced some of the strongest criticism yet levied during one of his foreign trips. The 87-year-old pontiff was pressed by high-profile figures at three of the five major events on his three-day visit in unusual and sometimes fierce language for a papal trip. In a meeting with Belgian dignitaries on Friday, both King Philippe and Prime Minister Alexander De Croo called for more concrete action to help survivors of abuse by Catholic clergy. And in later events at two Catholic universities, officials denounced his stance on the role of women in the church and society. Francis did not specifically mention the criticisms at his last event in Belgium on Sunday, a celebration of Mass at Brussels' King Baudouin soccer stadium. But the pope did add to the prepared text for his sermon and made a strong condemnation of Catholic clergy abuse. 'There is no place for abuse,' the pontiff said, drawing scattered applause from the estimated 37,000 attendees. 'There is no place for the cover-up of abuse. 'I ask everyone, do not cover up abuse. I ask bishops, do not cover up abuse.' The Belgian tour, which started with a one-day visit to nearby Luxembourg, was Francis's 46th trip abroad since being elected as pope in March 2013. The visit was meant to focus on the 600th anniversary of the two Catholic universities. Francis has also faced such criticism on previous tours, especially on the issue of clergy sexual abuse. On a trip to Chile in 2018 groups of demonstrators protested outside his events and Catholic churches were attacked before his visit. But the pope, leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, is not usually confronted directly in public by political leaders or Catholic officials organizing his events. Professors and students at UCLouvain, where Francis gave a talk on Saturday afternoon, issued a press release moments after the pope had finished speaking, saying they wanted to express their 'disapproval' of his views. The pope's speech at the university largely called for global action on climate change, but he also responded to a letter to him from students and professors that had asked about the Catholic Church's teaching on women. Francis emphasized that the church, which bans ordination of women to the priesthood, was not run like a corporation. He described women as having 'a fertile welcome, care [and] vital devotion.' The Vatican did not respond to the university's statement. Francis apologized on Friday for sexual abuse by Catholic clergy in Belgium, saying the Church must 'be ashamed and ask forgiveness.' He also held a two-hour meeting with a group of survivors, who pressed him to provide better financial compensation for victims.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-after-belgian-criticism-says-church-has-no-place-for-abuse-/7803471.html	2024-09-29T03:40:42-07:00	
11 wounded in southern Ukraine in Russian strikes	Kyiv — At least 11 people were wounded on Sunday in a series of Russian strikes on Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine, emergency services announced. The regional capital was hit by several 'massive aerial strikes' at dawn, Ukrainian emergency services said in a statement. 'A building and six houses in different city neighborhoods suffered a lot of destruction,' said the statement, adding that 42 members of the emergency services were helping those potentially trapped under the rubble. 'According to preliminary information, the number of wounded people has risen to 11,' said the emergency services, adding that rescue operations had ended. A woman dragged from the rubble was taken to the hospital. Regional governor Ivan Fedorov had earlier said that six people were wounded. He said that Zaporizhzhia was hit by 10 Russian strikes that destroyed 'one multistory building and some houses.' Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the president, hit out in a social media post at an attempt to 'terrorize' the civilian population. Yermak also reiterated his called on Western allies to supply more weapons to intercept Russian missiles and apply more economic sanctions against Moscow. Russia annexed the Zaporizhzhia region in 2022, but the main city of the same name remains under Kyiv's control.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wounded-in-southern-ukraine-in-russian-strikes/7803467.html	2024-09-29T02:35:08-07:00	
Israel says it has killed another high-ranking Hezbollah official in an airstrike	JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said Sunday that it has killed another high-ranking Hezbollah official in an airstrike. The military said Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of Hezbollah's Central Council, was killed in an airstrike on Saturday. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah. Several senior Hezbollah commanders have been killed in Israeli strikes in recent weeks, including the group's overall leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut on Friday. The group has also been targeted by a sophisticated attack on its pagers and walkie-talkies, and Israel has carried out waves of airstrikes over the past week across large parts of Lebanon. Hezbollah has continued to fire hundreds of rockets and missiles into northern Israel, but most have been intercepted or fallen in open areas. Kaouk was a veteran member of Hezbollah going back to the 1980s and had previously served as Hezbollah's military commander in southern Lebanon. The United States had announced sanctions against him in 2020.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-it-has-killed-another-high-ranking-hezbollah-official-in-an-airstrike/7803466.html	2024-09-29T02:23:36-07:00	
Syrians in Austria do volunteer work to disarm doubts about migrants	KRITZENDORF, Austria — While shoveling mud out of gardens almost two weeks after torrential flooding battered the small Austrian town of Kritzendorf, Abulhkeem Alshater gestures towards a banner: 'Austro-Syrians say: Thank you, Austria.' Alshater, 45, originally from Homs, Syria, has been working with dozens of his countryfolk to help clean up the mess left by floods. The work is a gesture of gratitude to Austria at a time when immigration has become a hot topic in Sunday's general election. Alshater hopes the sight of Syrians devoting time and energy to bring relief to the hard-hit state of Lower Austria will take some steam out of the often-strident campaign rhetoric about uncontrolled immigration. 'There's an election on. We're trying to show that we're not all the same,' said Alshater, who heads the Free Syrian Community of Austria, a support group for Syrians. Fleeing war in their homeland, the number of Syrians living in Austria rose more than eightfold between 2015 and 2024, according to official data, with 95,180 there as of January. Right-wing efforts to curb immigration to Austria have gained traction since deadly attacks in Germany blamed on migrants of Muslim origin, and a foiled plot to attack a Taylor Swift concert supposedly masterminded by an ISIS-inspired teenager. For weeks, the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) has led opinion polls, just ahead of the ruling conservative Austrian People's Party (OVP). Both parties promise to enact tougher asylum laws and crack down on illegal immigration if victorious. Alshater, a painter and decorator who arrived in 2015, has spent the past few days helping locals recover from flooding in places like Kritzendorf just north of Vienna, where the deluge left houses partially submerged in muddy water. Homeowner Dinko Fejzuli, a resident of Austria who was born to parents from Croatia and Macedonia, said the Syrian volunteers had given rise to some interesting encounters. 'Yesterday, I brought some of the helpers to a lady who I know will be voting FPO,' he said. 'They helped her because she had neither friends nor family to help. It was ironic.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrians-in-austria-do-volunteer-work-to-disarm-doubts-about-migrants-/7802696.html	2024-09-29T00:07:19-07:00	
US suicides in 2023 still at highest level in nation's history, says data	new york — U.S. suicides last year remained at about the highest level in the nation's history, preliminary data suggests. A little more than 49,300 suicide deaths were reported in 2023, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number that could grow a little as some death investigations are wrapped up and reported. Just under 49,500 were reported in 2022, according to final data released Thursday. The numbers are close enough that the suicide rate for the two years are the same, CDC officials said. U.S. suicide rates have been rising for nearly 20 years, aside from a two-year drop around the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. So 'a leveling off of any increase in suicide is cautiously promising news,' said Katherine Keyes, a Columbia University public health professor who studies suicide. Indeed, there's reason for optimism. A 2-year-old national crisis line allows anyone in the U.S. to dial 988 to reach mental health specialists. That and other efforts may be starting to pay off, Keyes said, but it 'really remains to be seen.' Experts caution that suicide — the nation's 11th-leading cause of death in 2022 — is complicated and that attempts can be driven by a range of factors. Contributors include higher rates of depression, limited availability of mental health services, and the availability of guns. About 55% of all suicide deaths in 2022 involved firearms, according to CDC data. The CDC's Thursday report said: —Suicide was the second-leading cause of death for people ages 10–14 and 20–34, and the third-leading cause for people ages 15–19. —Deaths continue to be more common among boys and men than girls and women. The highest suicide rate for any group — by far — was in men ages 75 and older, at about 44 suicides per 100,000 men that age. —Among women, the highest rate was in those who were middle-aged, about 9 per 100,000. But more dramatic increases have been seen in teens and young women, with the rate for that group doubling in the last two decades. —The overall suicide rate in 2022 and 2023 was 14.2 per 100,000. It also was that high in 2018. Before then, it hadn't been that high since 1941.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-suicides-in-2023-still-at-highest-level-in-nation-s-history-says-data/7802649.html	2024-09-29T00:06:05-07:00	
Brick by brick, Morocco rebuilds 12th-century mosque destroyed by 2023 quake	TINMEL, Morocco — The hand-carved domes and brick-laid arches had almost all been put back together when an earthquake shook Morocco so violently that they caved in on themselves and crashed to the earth. After nearly 900 years, the Great Mosque of Tinmel lay in pieces — its minaret toppled, its prayer hall full of rubble, its outer walls knocked over. But even in ruins, it remained holy ground for the residents of Tinmel. Villagers carried the sheet-laden bodies of the 15 community members killed in the quake down the hillside and placed them in front of the decimated mosque. Among the mourners was Mohamed Hartatouch, who helped carry the remains of his son Abdelkrim, 33. A substitute teacher, he died under bricks and collapsed walls while the village waited a day and a half for rescue crews to arrive. 'It looked like a storm. I wasn't able to feel anything,' the grieving father said, remembering the day after the quake. One year later, the rubble near Hartatouch's half-standing home has been swept aside and Tinmel residents are eager to rebuild their homes and the mosque. They say the sacred site is a point of pride and source of income in a region where infrastructure and jobs were lacking long before the earthquake hit. 'It's our past,' Redwan Aitsalah, 32, a construction worker, said the week before the earthquake's anniversary as he reconstructed his home overlooking the mosque. The September 2023 quake left a path of destruction that will take Morocco years to recover from. It killed nearly 3,000 people, knocked down almost 60,000 homes and leveled at least 585 schools. Rebuilding will cost about $12.3 billion, according to government estimates. Stretches of road were left unnavigable, including Tizi N'Test, the steep mountain pass that weaves from Marrakech to Tinmel and some of the hardest-hit villages near the earthquake's epicenter. Workers are now sifting through the rubble, searching for the mosque's puzzle pieces. They are stacking usable bricks and sorting the fragments of remaining decorative elements arch by arch and dome by dome, preparing to rebuild the mosque using as much of the remains as possible. Though incomparable to the human loss and suffering, the restoration effort is among Morocco's priorities as it attempts to rebuild. The country's Ministry of Islamic Affairs and Ministry of Culture have recruited Moroccan architects, archaeologists and engineers to oversee the project. To assist, the Italian government has sent Moroccan-born architect Aldo Giorgio Pezzi, who had also consulted on Casablanca's Hassan II Mosque, one of Africa's largest. 'We will rebuild it based on the evidence and remains that we have so it returns to how it was,' Morocco's Minister of Islamic Affairs Ahmed Toufiq told The Associated Press. The Great Mosque was a marvel of North African architecture with lobed arches, hand-carved moldings and the adobe-style bricks used to construct most the area's structures. It was undergoing an 18-month restoration project when the quake struck, causing its ornate domes and pillars to cave in. Its clay-colored remnants lay in pieces beneath scaffolding erected by restoration workers from villages throughout the region, five of whom also died. 'The mosque withstood centuries. It's the will of God,' Nadia El Bourakkadi, the site's conservationist, told local media. The temblor leveled it months before repairs and renovations were to be completed. Like in many of the area's villages, residents of Tinmel today live in plastic tents brought in as temporary shelter post-earthquake. Some are there because it feels safer than their half-ruined homes, others because they have nowhere else to go. Officials have issued more than 55,000 reconstruction permits for villagers to build new homes, including for most of the homes in Tinmel. The government has distributed financial aid in phases. Most households with destroyed homes have received an initial $2,000 installment of rebuilding aid, but not more. Many have complained that isn't enough to underwrite the initial costs of rebuilding. Fewer than 1,000 have completed rebuilding, according to the government's own figures. Despite the extent of their personal losses, Moroccans are also mourning the loss of revered cultural heritage. Centuries-old mosques, shrines, fortresses and lodges are scattered throughout the mountains. Unlike Tinmel, many have long been neglected as Morocco focuses its development efforts elsewhere. The country sees Tinmel as the cradle of one of its most storied civilizations. The mosque served as a source of inspiration for widely visited sacred sites in Marrakech and Seville. Pilgrims once trekked through the High Atlas to pay their respects and visit. Yet centuries ago it fell into disrepair as political power shifted to Morocco's larger cities and coastline. 'It was abandoned by the state, but materials were never taken from it,' said Mouhcine El Idrissi, an archaeologist working with Morocco's Ministry of Culture. 'People here have long respected it as a witness to their glorious and spiritual past.' Some of the historic sites of the High Atlas have long been a lure to tourists. But the earthquake shone a spotlight on the vast disparities plaguing the primarily agricultural region. Poverty and illiteracy rates are higher than the nationwide average, according to census data and an October 2023 government report on the five earthquake-hit provinces. 'The mountainous areas most affected were those already suffering from geographical isolation,' Civil Coalition for the Mountain, a group of Moroccan NGOs, said in a statement on the earthquake's anniversary. 'The tragedy revealed structural differences, and a situation caused by development policies that have always kept the mountains outside the scope of their objectives.' 'There's a Morocco that exists in Rabat and Marrakech, but we're talking about another Morocco that's in the mountains,' added Najia Ait Mohannad, the group's regional coordinator. 'Right now, the most urgent need is rebuilding houses.' The government has promised 'a well-thought-out, integrated and ambitious program' for the reconstruction and general upgrading of the affected regions, both in terms of infrastructure reinforcement and improving public services. It has also pledged to rebuild 'in harmony with the region's heritage and respecting its unique architectural features' and 'to respect the dignity and customs' of the population. For the village's residents, the landmark could stand as a symbol of reinvestment in one of Morocco's poorest regions, as well as a tribute to a glorious past. For now, it stands in disrepair, its enchanting ruins upheld by wooden scaffolding, while down the hill, villagers hang laundry and grow vegetables amid the remnants of their former homes and the plastic tents where they now live.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brick-by-brick-morocco-rebuilds-12th-century-mosque-destroyed-by-2023-quake-/7801343.html	2024-09-29T00:05:34-07:00	
Alcohol-free beer is gaining popularity, even at Oktoberfest	MUNICH — The head brewmaster for Weihenstephan, the world's oldest brewery, has a secret: He really likes alcohol-free beer. Even though he's quick to say he obviously enjoys real beer more, Tobias Zollo says he savors alcohol-free beer when he's working or eating lunch. It has the same taste but fewer calories than a soft drink, he said, thanks to the brewery's process of evaporating the alcohol. 'You can't drink beer every day — unfortunately,' he joked last week at the Bavarian state brewery in the German town of Freising, about 30 kilometers north of Munich. Zollo isn't alone in his appreciation for the sober beverage. Alcohol-free beer has been gaining popularity in recent years as beer consumption shrinks. At Weihenstephan, which was founded as a brewery in 1040 by Benedictine monks, non-alcoholic wheat beer and lager now make up 10% of the volume. The increase over the last few years, since they started making alcohol-free drinks in the 1990s, mirrors the statistics for the rest of Germany's beer industry. 'The people are unfortunately — I have to say that as a brewer — unfortunately drinking less beer,' Zollo said Friday, the day before Oktoberfest officially started. 'If there's an alternative to have the crisp and fresh taste from a typical Weihenstephan beer, but just as a non-alcoholic version, we want to do that.' Even at Oktoberfest — arguably the world's most famous ode to alcohol — alcohol-free beer is on the menu. All but two of the 18 large tents at the festival offer the drink through the celebration's 16 days. The sober beverage will cost drinkers the same as an alcoholic beer — between 13.60 and 15.30 euros ($15.12 and $17.01) for a 1-liter mug — but save them from a hangover. 'For people who don't like to drink alcohol and want to enjoy the Oktoberfest as well, I think it's a good option,' Mikael Caselitz, 24, of Munich said Saturday inside one of the tents. 'Sometimes people feel like they have more fun with alcohol, which is not a good thing because you can also have fun without alcohol.' He added: 'If you want to come and drink alcohol-free beer, nobody will judge you.' This year marked the first time an alcohol-free beer garden opened in Munich. 'Die Null,' which means 'the zero' in German, served non-alcoholic beer, mocktails and other alcohol-free drinks near the city's main train station this summer but was scheduled to close a few day before Oktoberfest opened. Walter König, managing director of the Society of Hop Research north of Munich, said researchers have had to breed special hops varieties for alcohol-free beer. If brewers use the typical hops for alcohol-free beer, the distinct aroma gets lost when the alcohol is reduced during the brewing process. But customers don't care about that, König said Friday as he prepared for Oktoberfest. 'They only want to know that what they are tasting is as good as traditional beers with alcohol,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/alcohol-free-beer-is-gaining-popularity-even-at-oktoberfest/7799892.html	2024-09-29T00:04:26-07:00	
Attacks by Islamic extremists are rampant in Africa's Sahel	DAKAR, Senegal — Extremist attacks in Sahel, an arid swath of land south of the Sahara in Africa, have proliferated in recent months: Last week, Islamic militants attacked Bamako, the capital of Mali, for the first time in almost a decade, demonstrating their capacity to carry out large scale assaults. And last month, at least 100 villagers and soldiers were killed in central Burkina Faso during a weekend attack on a village by al-Qaida-linked jihadis, as they were forcibly helping security forces dig trenches to protect security outposts and villages. Here's what we know about the security situation in Sahel: A region characterized by uprisings and coups Over the last decade, the region has been shaken by extremist uprisings and military coups. Three Sahelian nations, Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, are now ruled by military leaders who have taken power by force, on the pledge of providing more security to citizens. But the security situation in Sahel has worsened since the juntas took power, analysts say, with a record number of attacks and a record number of civilians killed both by Islamic fighters and government forces. Over the first six months of this year, 3,064 civilians were killed by the violence, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a 25% increase compared to the previous 6 months. Extremist groups operating in Sahel, and what they want The main two groups operating in the region are the al-Qaida-linked militant group Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), and the Islamic State in the Sahel. Over the last year, the JNIM has strengthened its presence in Mali and Burkina Faso, by becoming a more coherent political grouping. 'The local populations support (JNIM) more than IS-affiliated groups,' said analyst Shaantanu Shankar of the Economist Intelligence Unit. 'They have integrated local rebel groups, which have close community ties.' Unlike JNIM, Islamic State in the Sahel is a loose coalition of anti-government forces that is much less entrenched politically, he said. They are much more dominant in the Lake Chad region. These groups attack, terrorize and kill local populations and their actions likely amount to war crimes, according to rights organizations. In addition, there are also a number of local militia groups on the ground, which are not affiliated with IS or al-Qaida, as violence has exploded between rival ethnicities and local self-defense groups resulting in a self-perpetuating spiral of violence. Why the extremists in Sahel are getting stronger The military juntas in three countries have capitalized on popular discontent with the former democratically elected governments, which they saw as corrupt and propped up by France. After coming into power, all three juntas left the Economic Community of West African States, the nearly 50-year-old regional bloc known as ECOWAS, and created their own security partnership, the Alliance of Sahel States, in September. They have cut ties with the traditional Western allies, ousting French and American military forces, and instead sought new security ties with Russia. 'There is a huge security vacuum after the withdrawal of the French and American military' from the region, said Shankar, which cannot be filled by Russia. Troops from the Wagner Group, the Russian private military company, present in the region are being financed by the junta governments, Shankar added, with fewer financial resources. But experts say the other factor fueling instability is the worsening economic situation, as well as the lack of job opportunities, which contribute to the rising popularity of extremist groups. In all three countries, Islamic extremists have been recruiting among groups marginalized and neglected by the central governments. 'There are very few opportunities for people in rural Sahel, especially the youth,' said Heni Nsabia, the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project analysis coordinator for West Africa. 'But the other aspect is that people whose families and communities were targeted by state forces seek security, status and vengeance.' How the groups finance themselves Despite being affiliated with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, extremist groups in the Sahel mostly get financial resources within their own strongholds, analysts said. They impose taxes on the local population, take control of the management of natural resources, especially of gold, and steal cattle. They also impose sieges on towns and use kidnappings, improvised explosive devices and landmines as they seek to control supply routs and resources. The extremists are also involved in trafficking, especially of drugs, said Aaryaman Shah, a security analyst who specializes in the financing of extremist groups. And they profit from people smuggling — which might bring them even more money in the future. 'We are concerned about the recent turmoil in Libya, and how that could actually affect the migrant flow,' said Shah. 'We are also looking at Niger, where the junta disbanded the law stopping people from crossing into Libya.' The business model that these groups developed is very diversified, analysts said. 'This is why it is difficult to destroy them economically,' said Nsabia from ACLED. 'If you target one aspect, they have other sources of revenues.' The outlook for the future Analysts predict that the situation in the Sahel is going to worsen in the coming months, with the military governments becoming increasingly desperate as they focus on preserving their political existence, and no way of holding them accountable. 'It's a very volatile phase, security is projected to get worse in the next two years,' said Shankar of the Economist Intelligence Unit. And the violence has been spilling outside the Sahel borders: Extremists believed to be linked to al-Qaida have crossed into Benin and the north of Nigeria, the latest trend in the militants' movements to wealthier West African coastal nations. 'It's undeniable that things are getting worse, and the scope of the threat has been expanding,' said Nsabia. 'Today, we should not be talking only about Sahel, but also about Benin and Togo, where the JNIM have done excursions as far as 200 kilometers inland.' Europe and United States are seeking to support the governments of these coastal nations in their counter-terrorism efforts. Michael Langley, the top U.S. commander for Africa, told reporters last week the U.S. was in talks with Ivory Coast, Ghana and Benin as the country starts 'to reset and recalibrate some of our assets.' A major challenge has been, and will continue to be, access to information, experts said. All juntas significantly restricted journalism, so now they are in complete control of the narrative, including of who is defined as a jihadi. In Mali, the government branded all Touaregs an ethnic group which staged a rebellion against the government, as jihadis, although only some of them allied with JNIM.	https://www.voanews.com/a/attacks-by-islamic-extremists-are-rampant-in-africa-s-sahel/7799880.html	2024-09-29T00:03:26-07:00	
Israel carries out raids on 'dozens' of Hezbollah targets in Lebanon: IDF	Jerusalem — The Israeli military said Sunday it conducted strikes against 'dozens' of Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, two days after an air strike killed the group's chief Hassan Nasrallah. The Israel Defense Forces 'attacked dozens of terrorist targets in the territory of Lebanon in the last few hours,' the army said in a statement on Telegram. The statement said the strikes targeted 'buildings where weapons and military structures of the organization were stored.' Israel has attacked 'hundreds' of Hezbollah targets in the last day, it added, as it aims to disable the group. On Friday, an Israeli air strike on a suburb of Beirut killed Hezbollah's longtime leader Nasrallah, sparking fears of an all-out war in the region. More than 700 people have been killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon, according to health ministry figures, since the bombardment of Hezbollah strongholds began earlier this month. Hezbollah began low-intensity cross-border strikes on Israeli troops a day after its Palestinian ally Hamas staged its unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, triggering war in the Gaza Strip.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-carries-out-raids-on-dozens-of-hezbollah-targets-in-lebanon-idf/7803432.html	2024-09-28T22:24:38-07:00	
Nepal closes schools after heavy rains kill 100	KATHMANDU, Nepal — Nepal has shut schools for three days after landslides and floods triggered by two days of heavy rain across the Himalayan nation killed 100, with 67 missing, officials said Sunday. Flooding brought traffic and normal activity to a standstill in the Kathmandu valley, where 37 deaths were recorded in a region home to 4 million people and the capital. Authorities said students and their parents faced difficulties as university and school buildings damaged by the rains needed repair. 'We have urged the concerned authorities to close schools in the affected areas for three days,' Lakshmi Bhattarai, a spokesperson for the education ministry, told Reuters. Some parts of the capital reported rain of up to 32.2. centimeters, pushing the level of its main Bagmati river up 2.2 meters past the danger mark, experts said. But there were some signs of respite on Sunday morning, with the rains easing in many places, said Govinda Jha, a weather forecaster in the capital. 'There may be some isolated showers, but heavy rains are unlikely,' he said. Kathmandu weather officials blamed the heavy downpours on a low-pressure system in the Bay of Bengal extending over parts of neighboring India close to Nepal. Haphazard development amplifies climate change risks in Nepal, say climate scientists at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. 'I’ve never before seen flooding on this scale in Kathmandu,' said Arun Bhakta Shrestha, an environmental risk official at the center. In a statement, it urged the government and city planners to 'urgently' step up investment in, and plans for, infrastructure, such as underground stormwater and sewage systems, both of the 'grey,' or engineered kind, and 'green,' or nature-based type. The impact of the rains was aggravated by poor drainage due to unplanned settlement and urbanization efforts, construction on floodplains, lack of areas for water retention, and encroachment on the Bagmati river, it added. The level in the Koshi river in Nepal's southeast has started to fall, however, said Ram Chandra Tiwari, the region's top bureaucrat. The river, which brings deadly floods to India's eastern state of Bihar nearly every year, had been running above the danger mark at a level nearly three times normal, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nepal-closes-schools-after-heavy-rains-kill-100/7803430.html	2024-09-28T21:59:27-07:00	
In US, it’s time to roll up sleeves for new COVID, flu shots	WASHINGTON — Fall means it's time for just about everybody to get up to date on their flu and COVID-19 vaccines – and a lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV. Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters — they're not just another dose of last year's protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body's immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains. 'Right now is the best time' to get all the recommended fall vaccinations, said Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as she got her flu shot Wednesday. She has an appointment for her COVID-19 shot, too. It's 'the single most effective thing you can do to protect yourself, your family, your community.' While they're not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 — or dying from it. 'It may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,' said CDC's Dr. Demetre Daskalakis. 'I would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.' The challenge: Getting more Americans to roll up their sleeves. Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot. A survey released Wednesday by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases shows an equally low number intend to this fall. And the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year. 'Maybe we believe that it's not going to be me but let's not take a chance,' said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. 'Why not get a vaccine that's going to help you reduce that risk?' Who needs a fall COVID-19 or flu vaccination? The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge. Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year. Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu – and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too. What's new about the COVID-19 shots? Last fall's shots targeted a coronavirus strain that's no longer spreading while this year's are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading. The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older. Which flu vaccine to choose? High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot. For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics — although next year it's set to be available for use at home. All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine. What about that other virus, RSV? RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems. The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination – but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter. And while 'your arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,' it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said. What will it cost? The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider. About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access -- and states and large cities are starting to roll out their plans. Call your local health department to ask about options because in many areas, 'availability of vaccine at lower or no cost is expected to trickle in over the next couple of weeks,' advised Dr. Raynard Washington, who heads the Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, health department. Check the government website, vaccines.gov, for availability at local pharmacies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-us-it-s-time-to-roll-up-sleeves-for-new-covid-flu-shots-/7801310.html	2024-09-28T21:51:36-07:00	
Trump lists his grievances in a Wisconsin speech intended to link Harris to illegal immigration	PRAIRIE DU CHIEN, Wisconsin — Former President Donald Trump meandered Saturday through a list of grievances against Vice President Kamala Harris and other issues during an event intended to link his Democratic opponent to illegal border crossings. A day after Harris discussed immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump spoke to a crowd in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, about immigration. He blamed Harris for migrants committing crimes after entering the U.S. illegally, alleging she was responsible for 'erasing our border.' 'I will liberate Wisconsin from the mass migrant invasion,' he said. 'We're going to liberate the country.' Trump hopes frustration over illegal immigration will translate to votes in Wisconsin and other crucial swing states. The Republican nominee has denounced people who cross the U.S.-Mexico border as 'poisoning the blood of the country' and vowed to stage the largest deportation operation in American history if elected. And polls show Americans believe Trump would do a better job than Harris on handling immigration. Trump shifted from topic to topic so quickly that it was hard to keep track of what he meant at times. He talked about the two assassination attempts against him and blamed the U.S. Secret Service for not being able to hold a large outdoor rally instead of an event in a smaller indoor space. But he also offered asides about climate change, Harris' father, how his beach body was better than President Joe Biden's, and a fly that was buzzing near him. 'I wonder where the fly came from,' he said. 'Two years ago, I wouldn't have had a fly up here. You're changing rapidly. But we can't take it any longer. We can't take it any longer.' Trump repeatedly brought up Harris' Friday event in Douglas, Arizona, where she announced a push to further restrict asylum claims beyond Biden's executive order announced earlier this year. Harris denounced Trump's handling of the border while president and his opposing a bipartisan border package earlier this year, saying Trump 'prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.' 'I had to sit there and listen' to Harris last night Trump said, eliciting cheers. 'And who puts it on? Fox News. They should not be allowed to put it on. It's all lies. Everything she says is lies.' The Republican nominee also intensified his personal attacks against Harris, insulting her as 'mentally impaired' and a 'disaster.' Trump professed not to understand what Harris meant when she said he was responsible for taking children from their parents. Under his administration, border agents separated children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border in a policy that was condemned globally as inhumane and one that Trump himself ended under pressure from his own party. Harris, at a rally in San Francisco, told supporters there were 'two very different visions for our nation' and voters see it 'every day on the campaign trail.' 'Donald Trump is the same old tired show,' she said. 'The same tired playbook we have heard for years.' She said Trump was 'a very unserious man.' 'However, the consequences of putting him back in the White House are extremely serious.' At Trump's event, on either side of the stage were poster-sized mug shots of men in the U.S. illegally accused of a crime, including Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate, a case Trump cited in his speech. Wisconsin Republicans in recent days have cited the story of Coronel Zarate's arrest in Prairie du Chien as more evidence that people in the country illegally are committing crimes across the United States, not just in southern border states. Prosecutors charged Coronel Zarate on September 18 with sexual assault, child abuse, strangulation and domestic abuse. His lawyers declined to comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-lists-his-grievances-in-a-wisconsin-speech-intended-to-link-harris-to-illegal-immigration/7803421.html	2024-09-28T19:44:38-07:00	
Protesters rally to dispute Maduro's claim he won July presidential election in Venezuela	Caracas, Venezuela — Small groups of opposition protesters rallied Saturday in Venezuela, joined by supporters outside the country, marking two months since the country's disputed election that President Nicolas Maduro claimed to have won. Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, in hiding after denouncing the proclaimed results as fraudulent, called for smaller gatherings to avoid security crackdowns seen at earlier protests. About 30 people shouted slogans at a Caracas plaza, including Leida Brito, known as 'Red Helmet Grandmother' from her years of anti-government activism. 'Nicolas Maduro should leave because he lost,' she said, holding a sign that read: 'To defend the vote is a right.' 'The freedom of Venezuela is in danger,' Hidalgo Valero, a retired colonel, told AFP. 'Today our people are afraid to be in the streets because there is tremendous repression.' Machado addressed supporters in a voice note released by her team: 'Here we are standing firm, advancing every day with more strength and enthusiasm, gathered here as the brave and good Venezuela.' Dozens of opposition leaders have been arrested since the contested poll, along with more than 2,400 other Venezuelans accused of terrorism for allegedly taking part in protests. Twenty-seven people were killed in the post-election clashes. The opposition says its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, won the July 28 election with 67% of the vote, releasing its own tally of polling station results. Maduro, however, was declared the winner with 52% of the vote by the pro-government National Electoral Council, which has yet to release detailed voting results, as required by law. Gonzalez Urrutia, a 75-year-old retired diplomat, left Venezuela this month for asylum in Spain after spending weeks in hiding. Larger protests also took place outside Venezuela, including in Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Panama City and Montevideo. In Madrid, Gonzalez Urrutia greeted supporters who were waving the Venezuelan flag. Meanwhile, hundreds of Maduro supporters marched in Caracas to proclaim victory in the election. Maduro told the crowd the 'supposed queen bee,' in reference to Machado, 'is beginning to pack her Gucci suitcases ... she is preparing to leave, too.' 'We are not in Madrid, we are not hiding, we are in the street,' he declared. On Thursday, about 30 countries led by the United States and Argentina urged Maduro to engage in dialogue with the opposition. In a joint statement, the countries called for 'constructive and inclusive discussions' on a democratic transition and to immediately release Venezuelans detained in the election aftermath.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protesters-rally-to-dispute-maduro-s-claim-he-won-july-presidential-election-in-venezuela/7803418.html	2024-09-28T19:16:25-07:00	
12 dead in strikes targeting pro-Iranian fighters in Syria, monitor says	beirut — Twelve pro-Iranian fighters have been killed in airstrikes in eastern Syria, a war monitor said Sunday, adding that a large number of people were wounded. Twelve pro-Iranian fighters were killed in airstrikes of unknown origin targeting their positions in the city of Deir El Zour and to the east of the city, as well as the Boukamal region, near the border with Iraq, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The strikes were not immediately claimed by any entity, according to the monitor. Five strikes targeted military positions near Deir El Zour airport, it added. Iran has been providing military aid to Syria since the civil war there began in 2011, while Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes targeting pro-Iranian groups in eastern Syria. The United States has also targeted such groups in the country's east. Israeli authorities rarely comment on individual strikes in Syria but have repeatedly said they will not allow archenemy Iran to expand its presence there. Israel has launched an intense bombing campaign against Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon in recent days, intensifying fears of a regional war. The Israeli army has also repeatedly targeted the movement's arms supply routes on the Syrian-Lebanese border, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-strikes-targeting-pro-iranian-fighters-in-syria-monitor-says/7803414.html	2024-09-28T18:37:21-07:00	
Austria holds tight election with far-right bidding for historic win	VIENNA — Austrians elect a new parliament Sunday with the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) aiming to secure its first general election win in a neck-and-neck race with the ruling conservatives that has been dominated by economic worries and immigration. Having led opinion polls for months, the FPO's edge over the Austrian People's Party (OVP) has shrunk to almost nothing as Chancellor Karl Nehammer casts himself as a statesman and depicts his rival, FPO leader Herbert Kickl, as a toxic menace. Whoever wins will fall well short of an absolute majority, polls show but claim the right to lead a coalition government. Projections are due minutes after polls close at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT), with results being finessed over the ensuing hours. 'What's at stake is whether the FPO will appoint the chancellor or not,' said Kathrin Stainer-Haemmerle, political science professor at the Carinthia University of Applied Sciences. 'Should that happen, then I have to say the role of Austria in the European Union would be significantly different. Kickl has often said that (Hungarian Prime Minister) Viktor Orban is a role model for him and he will stand by him.' The Eurosceptic, Russia-friendly FPO, which is critical of Islam and pledges tougher rules on asylum-seekers, won a national vote for the first time in June when it beat the OVP by less than a percentage point in European elections. An FPO victory would make Austria the latest European Union country to register surging far-right support after gains in countries including the Netherlands, France and Germany. President Alexander Van der Bellen, who oversees the formation of governments, has voiced reservations about the FPO because of its criticism of the EU and its failure to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The party also opposes EU sanctions on Moscow, citing Austria's neutrality. He has hinted he might thwart Kickl, noting the constitution does not require him to ask the first-placed party to form a government, even though that has long been the convention. The OVP, which like the FPO backs tougher immigration rules and tax cuts, is the only party open to forming a coalition with the far-right party. Polls suggest they could muster a majority together, but Nehammer says his party won’t join a government with Kickl. 'Ideally I would vanish into thin air for you, but I won't do you that favor, Mr. Nehammer,' Kickl, 55, said this week when asked if he would stand aside to let his party be junior partner under the OVP. 'Fortress Austria' Kickl has relished the role of opposition firebrand but has at times appeared uncomfortable trying to moderate his tone to widen his leadership appeal. The FPO wants to stop granting asylum altogether and build a 'fortress Austria' preventing migrants from entering, even though that would be widely viewed as illegal or impractical. In his closing campaign speech, Kickl said sanctions against Moscow were hurting Austria even more than Russia, adding, 'if you look at Germany, VW for example, the threat of mass unemployment and everything that then spills over into Austria.' Nehammer has sought to depict Kickl as a conspiracy theorist shouting from the sidelines while he is running Austria. The 51-year-old Nehammer has since 2021 led a coalition with the left-wing Greens, but the alliance has proved fractious with the economy struggling and inflation worrying voters. Some voters think Nehammer's crisis-management efforts against severe flooding that struck Austria this month probably helped him regain ground in the election race. Susanne Pinter, 55, a Greens supporter in Vienna said the floods had helped Nehammer look statesman-like, as she fretted about the prospect of a far-right victory. 'If the FPO wins ... it'll have bad consequences for women, people of migrant origin and climate change,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/austria-holds-tight-election-with-far-right-bidding-for-historic-win/7803410.html	2024-09-28T18:19:26-07:00	
SpaceX launches rescue mission for 2 NASA astronauts stranded in space	CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — SpaceX launched a rescue mission for the two stuck astronauts at the International Space Station on Saturday, sending up a downsized crew to bring them home but not until next year. The capsule rocketed into orbit to fetch the test pilots whose Boeing spacecraft returned to Earth empty earlier this month because of safety concerns. The switch in rides left it to NASA's Nick Hague and Russia's Alexander Gorbunov to retrieve Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. Because NASA rotates space station crews approximately every six months, this newly launched flight with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams won't return until late February. Officials said there wasn't a way to bring them back earlier on SpaceX without interrupting other scheduled missions. By the time they return, the pair will have logged more than eight months in space. They expected to be gone just a week when they signed up for Boeing's first astronaut flight that launched in June. NASA ultimately decided that Boeing's Starliner was too risky after a cascade of thruster troubles and helium leaks marred its trip to the orbiting complex. The space agency cut two astronauts from this SpaceX launch to make room on the Dragon capsule's return leg for Wilmore and Williams. Wilmore and Williams watched the liftoff via a live link sent to the space station, prompting a cheer of 'Go Dragon!' from Williams, NASA deputy program manager Dina Contella said. Williams has been promoted to commander of the space station, which will soon be back to its normal population of seven. Once Hague and Gorbunov arrive Sunday, four astronauts living there since March can leave in their own SpaceX capsule. Their homecoming was delayed a month by Starliner's turmoil. Hague noted before the flight that change is the one constant in human spaceflight. 'There's always something that is changing. Maybe this time it's been a little more visible to the public,' he said. Hague was thrust into the commander's job for the rescue mission based on his experience and handling of a launch emergency six years ago. The Russian rocket failed shortly after liftoff, and the capsule carrying him and a cosmonaut catapulted off the top to safety. Rookie NASA astronaut Zena Cardman and veteran space flier Stephanie Wilson were pulled from this flight after NASA opted to go with SpaceX to bring the stuck astronauts home. Promised a future space mission, both were at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, taking part in the launch livestream. Gorbunov remained on the flight under an exchange agreement between NASA and the Russian Space Agency. 'Every crewed launch that I have ever watched has really brought me a lot of emotion. This one today was especially unique,' a teary-eyed Cardman said following the early afternoon liftoff. 'It was hard not to watch that rocket lift off without thinking, 'That's my rocket and that's my crew.'' Moments before liftoff, Hague paid tribute to his two colleagues left behind: 'Unbreakable. We did it together.' Once in orbit, he called it a 'sweet ride' and thanked everyone who made it possible. Earlier, Hague acknowledged the challenges of launching with half a crew and returning with two astronauts trained on another spacecraft. 'We've got a dynamic challenge ahead of us,' Hague said after arriving from Houston last weekend. 'We know each other and we're professionals and we step up and do what's asked of us.' SpaceX has long been the leader in NASA's commercial crew program, established as the space shuttles were retiring more than a decade ago. SpaceX beat Boeing in delivering astronauts to the space station in 2020, and it is now up to 10 crew flights for NASA. Boeing has struggled with a variety of issues over the years, repeating a Starliner test flight with no one on board after the first one veered off course. The Starliner that left Wilmore and Williams in space landed without any issues in the New Mexico desert on September 6, and has since returned to Kennedy Space Center. A week ago, Boeing's defense and space chief was replaced. Delayed by Hurricane Helene pounding Florida, the latest SpaceX liftoff marked the first for astronauts from Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. SpaceX took over the old Titan rocket pad nearly two decades ago and used it for satellite and station cargo launches, while flying crews from Kennedy's former Apollo and shuttle pad next door. The company wanted more flexibility as more Falcon rockets soared.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spacex-launches-rescue-mission-for-2-nasa-astronauts-stranded-in-space/7803409.html	2024-09-28T18:19:01-07:00	
Europeans, Arab and Muslim nations launch initiative for Palestinian state	UNITED NATIONS — European, Arab and Islamic nations have launched an initiative to strengthen support for a Palestinian state and prepare for a future after the war in Gaza and escalating conflict in Lebanon, Norway's foreign minister said Friday. Espen Barth Eide told The Associated Press that 'there is a growing consensus in the international community from Western countries, from Arab countries, from the Global South, that we need to establish a Palestinian Authority, a Palestinian government, a Palestinian state — and the Palestinian state has to be recognized.' Eide said many issues need to be addressed, including the security interests of Israel and the Palestinians, recognition and normalization of relations after decades of conflict and the demobilization of Hamas as a military group. 'These are pieces of a bigger puzzle,' Norway's chief diplomat said. 'And you can't just come in there with one of these pieces, because it only works if all the pieces are laid in place.' But even if the puzzle is completed, it's unlikely to gain traction with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Still, Eide believes that after decades of failed or stalled negotiations, 'we need to take a new approach' to achieving an independent Palestinian state. To accelerate work on these issues, Eide said almost 90 countries attended a meeting Thursday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly's current gathering of world leaders. He and Saudi Arabia's foreign minister co-chaired the session to launch 'The Global Alliance for the Implementation of a Palestinian State and a Two-State Solution.' 'We have to see how we can come out of this deadlock and try to use this deep crisis also as an opportunity to move forward,' Eide told a U.N. Security Council meeting on Gaza later Friday. Norway is the guarantor of the 1993 Oslo Accords, hailed as a breakthrough in the decades-long conflict between Arabs and Jews, which created the Palestinian Authority and set up self-rule areas in the Palestinian Authority. Eide said more than 30 years later, Israel's 'occupation' is continuing, and there are no negotiations leading to a final settlement and an independent Palestinian state, which led to Norway's decision in May to recognize a Palestinian state. Eide brought up the alliance again Saturday during his address to the annual meeting of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, stressing that 'while cease-fires in Gaza and Lebanon are most urgently needed, ending hostilities must not be confused with lasting solutions.' He again called on the 44 U.N. member nations that haven't done so to recognize the state of Palestine and allow it to become a full member of the United Nations. And he called on 'everyone who can, to help to build Palestine's institutions, and on regional actors to help embed a political settlement in a broader regional framework.' Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that his country, the joint Islamic-Arab ministerial committee, Norway and the European Union launched the alliance 'because we feel responsible to act to change the reality of the conflict without delay.' He told the assembly Saturday that the coalition aimed 'to promote the two-state solution,' calling on all countries to join the group and to recognize the Palestinians as an independent state. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell urged all countries to take practical measures 'to bring about the free Palestine next to a secure Israel.' First meetings will be in Saudi Arabia and Belgium Eide said this new effort is built on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, 'but updated to today's reality.' The 2002 initiative, endorsed by the Arab League and the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation, offered Israel normalized relations in exchange for a full withdrawal from territories captured in 1967.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europeans-arab-and-muslim-nations-launch-initiative-for-palestinian-state/7803405.html	2024-09-28T17:51:08-07:00

Marburg virus kills 6 in Rwanda, health minister says	KIGALI, Rwanda — Rwanda has confirmed six deaths and 20 cases of Marburg disease, the country's health minister Sabin Nsanzimana said late on Saturday. The majority of victims are health workers in the intensive care unit, Nsanzimana said in a video statement posted on X. 'We are counting 20 people who are infected, and six who have already passed away due to this virus. The large majority of cases and deaths are among healthcare workers, mainly in the intensive care unit,' the health minister said. Marburg disease, a viral hemorrhagic fever, can cause death among some patients, with symptoms including severe headache, vomiting, muscle aches and stomach aches, the ministry has said. Institutions and partners are working to trace those who have been in contact with the virus-affected individuals, the minister added. With a fatality rate of as high as 88%, Marburg is from the same virus family as the one responsible for Ebola and is transmitted to people from fruit bats. It then spreads through contact with bodily fluids of infected people. Neighboring Tanzania had cases of Marburg in 2023, while Uganda had similar ones in 2017.	https://www.voanews.com/a/marburg-virus-kills-6-in-rwanda-health-minister-says/7803399.html	2024-09-28T17:21:10-07:00	
48 dead in 2 days of Sudan paramilitary attacks on Darfur city, doctor says	Port Sudan, Sudan — Two days of attacks by Sudanese paramilitaries on the Darfur city of El Fasher killed 48 people, a medical source told AFP on Friday, after world leaders appealed for an end to the country's suffering. Artillery fire from the Rapid Support Forces killed 30 people and wounded dozens on Friday, a medical source at El Fasher Teaching Hospital told AFP, as the paramilitaries and regular army vie for control of the North Darfur state capital. The shelling comes a day after an assault on a market brought '18 dead to the hospital' on Thursday, 'some of them burned and others killed by shrapnel,' the source said, requesting anonymity for their protection in light of repeated attacks on health workers and hospitals. The plight of Sudan, and El Fasher in particular, has been under discussion this week at the U.N. General Assembly in New York after 17 months of devastating fighting between the RSF and the regular army. 'We must compel the warring parties to accept humanitarian pauses in El Fasher, Khartoum and other highly vulnerable areas,' the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Wednesday. The Teaching Hospital is one of the last still receiving patients in El Fasher, where reports of a 'full-scale assault' by RSF last weekend led U.N. chief Antonio Guterres to call for an urgent cease-fire. The paramilitaries have besieged El Fasher since May, and famine has been declared in Zamzam refugee camp near the city of 2 million. The war has killed tens of thousands of people. The World Health Organization has cited a toll of at least 20,000, but U.S. envoy Tom Perriello has said some estimates reach 150,000. U.S. President Joe Biden, who raised particular concern over the assault on El Fasher, on Tuesday urged all countries to cut off weapons supplies to the country's warring generals, armed forces chief Abdel Fattah Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. 'The world needs to stop arming the generals,' Biden told the U.N. General Assembly. On the sidelines of the U.N. talks, Guterres met with Burhan, expressing concern about escalation and the risk of 'a regional spillover,' the UN said. Both sides have been repeatedly accused of war crimes. The RSF, which has its origins in Darfur's notorious Arab tribal militias, the Janjaweed, has been specifically accused of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Darfur, a region the size of France, is home to around a quarter of Sudan's population but more than half of its 10 million people are internally displaced.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-2-days-of-sudan-paramilitary-attacks-on-darfur-city-doctor-says/7803207.html	2024-09-28T17:07:07-07:00	
Belgian Catholic university denounces pope's views on women's roles in society	brussels — Pope Francis' burdensome trip through Belgium reached new lows Saturday when defiant Catholic university women demanded to his face a 'paradigm change' on women's issues in the church and then expressed deep disappointment when Francis dug in. The Catholic University of Louvain, the Francophone campus of Belgium's storied Catholic university, issued a scathing statement after Francis visited and repeated his view that women are the 'fertile' nurturers of the church, inducing grimaces in his audience. 'UC Louvain expresses its incomprehension and disapproval of the position expressed by Pope Francis regarding the role of women in the church and society,' the statement said, calling the pope's views 'deterministic and reductive.' Francis' trip to Belgium, ostensibly to celebrate the university's 600th anniversary, was always going to be difficult, given Belgium's legacy of clerical sexual abuse and secular trends that have emptied churches in the once staunchly Catholic country. Francis got an earful Friday about the abuse crisis starting with King Philippe and Prime Minister Alexander Croos and continuing on down to the victims themselves. But it's one thing for the pope to be lambasted by the liberal prime minister for the church's mishandling of priests who raped children. It's quite another to be openly criticized by the Catholic university that invited him and long was the Vatican's intellectual fiefdom in Belgium. Church needs 'paradigm shift,' say students The students made an impassioned plea to Francis for the church to change its view of women. It is an issue Francis knows well: He has made some changes during his 11-year pontificate, allowing women to serve as acolytes, appointing several women to high-ranking positions in the Vatican, and saying women must have greater decision-making roles in the church. But he has ruled out ordaining women as priests and has refused so far to budge on demands to allow women to serve as deacons, who perform many of the same tasks as priests. He has taken the women's issue off the table for debate at the Vatican's upcoming three-week synod, or meeting, because it's too thorny to be dealt with in such a short time. He has punted it to theologians and canonists to chew over into next year. In a letter read aloud on stage with the pope listening attentively, the students noted that Francis' landmark 2015 environmental encyclical Laudato Si (Praised Be) made virtually no mention of women, cited no women theologians and 'exalts their maternal role and forbids them access to ordained ministries.' 'Women have been made invisible. Invisible in their lives, women have also been invisible in their intellectual contributions,' the students said. 'What, then, is the place of women in the church?' they asked. 'We need a paradigm shift, which can and must draw on the treasures of spirituality as much as on the development of the various disciplines of science.' Francis said he liked what they said, but repeated his frequent refrain that 'the church is woman,' only exists because the Virgin Mary agreed to be the mother of Jesus, and that men and women were complementary. 'Woman is fertile welcome. Care. Vital devotion,' Francis said. 'Let us be more attentive to the many daily expressions of this love, from friendship to the workplace, from studies to the exercise of responsibility in the church and society, from marriage to motherhood, from virginity to the service of others and the building up of the kingdom of God.' Louvain said such terminology had no place in a university or society today. It emphasized the point with the entertainment for the event featuring a jazz rendition of Lady Gaga's LGBTQ+ anthem 'Born This Way.' 'UC Louvain can only express its disagreement with this deterministic and reductive position,' the statement said. 'It reaffirms its desire for everyone to flourish within it and in society, whatever their origins, gender or sexual orientation. It calls on the church to follow the same path, without any form of discrimination.' The comment followed a speech Friday by the rector of the Dutch campus of the university in which he ventured that the church would be a much more welcoming place if women could be priests. The university's back-to-back criticism was especially significant as Francis was long held up in Europe as a beacon of progressive hope following the conservative papacies of St. John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. Pope prays at king's tomb Yet Francis toed the conservative line earlier in the day too. He went to the royal crypt in the Church of Our Lady to pray at the tomb of King Baudouin, best known for having refused to give royal assent, one of his constitutional duties, to a parliament-approved bill legalizing abortion. Baudouin stepped down for one day in 1990 to allow the government to pass the law, which he would otherwise have been required to sign, before he was reinstated as king. Francis praised Baudouin's courage when he decided to 'leave his position as king to not sign a homicidal law,' according to the Vatican summary of the private encounter, which was attended by Baudouin's nephew, King Philippe, and Queen Mathilde. The pope then referred to a new legislative proposal to extend the legal limit for an abortion in Belgium, from 12 weeks to 18 weeks after conception.

Biden, Harris call Israeli killing of Hezbollah's Nasrallah 'measure of justice'	REHOBOTH BEACH, Delaware — The Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah was a 'measure of justice' for victims of a four-decade 'reign of terror,' President Joe Biden said Saturday. The comments came after Lebanon's Hezbollah group confirmed earlier Saturday that Nasrallah, one of the group's founders, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day. Biden noted that the operation to take out Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas' massacre of Israelis on October 7, 2023. 'Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a 'northern front' against Israel,' Biden said in a statement. He also noted that Hezbollah under Nasrallah's watch has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans, Israelis and Lebanese. Hezbollah attacks against U.S. interests include the truck bombing of the U.S. Embassy and multinational force barracks in Beirut in 1983 and the kidnapping of the Central Intelligence Agency chief of station in Beirut, who died while held captive. The U.S. said Hezbollah leaders armed and trained militias that carried out attacks on U.S. forces during the war in Iraq. The White House sees the death of Nasrallah as a huge blow to Hezbollah. At the same time, the administration has sought to tread carefully as it has tried to contain Israel's war with Hamas, which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran, from exploding into an all-out regional conflict. The White House and Pentagon were quick Friday, shortly after the strike, to say publicly that Israel offered it no forewarning of the operation. 'President Biden and I do not want to see conflict in the Middle East escalate into a broader regional war,' Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement Saturday that echoed Biden's description of a 'measure of justice.' She added, 'diplomacy remains the best path forward to protect civilians and achieve lasting stability in the region.' The confirmation of Nasrallah's death comes during a week that began with Biden's top national security aides working on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly to build support for a 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech Friday to the United Nations, vowing to keep up operations against Hezbollah until tens of thousands of Israeli citizens displaced by rocket attacks can return home. Shortly after, Israel carried out the strike that killed Nasrallah. Biden reiterated Saturday that he wants to see cease-fires both in Gaza and between Israel and Hezbollah. 'It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,' Biden said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused the United States of supporting the killing that took out Nasrallah and dozens of others. 'The world community will not forget that the order of the terrorist strike was issued from New York and the Americans cannot absolve themselves from complicity with the Zionists,' Pezeshkian was quoted as saying in a statement read on Iranian state television.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-harris-call-israeli-killing-of-hezbollah-s-nasrallah-measure-of-justice-/7803193.html	2024-09-28T15:36:25-07:00	
At UN, Russian foreign minister dismisses Zelenskyy's peace plan as 'doomed'	united nations — Russia's foreign minister reinforced the Kremlin's disagreements with the West in his United Nations General Assembly remarks Saturday and showed no interest in a genuine peace with Ukraine. 'I'm not going to talk here about the senselessness and the danger of the very idea of trying to fight to victory with a nuclear power, which is what Russia is,' Sergey Lavrov said. Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin revised his government's nuclear doctrine, in a clear attempt to discourage the West from lifting its restrictions on Ukraine using long-range weapons to strike inside Russian territory. Lavrov dismissed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's 10-point peace formula as 'doomed,' and said a resolution of the conflict is not possible unless the root causes of the crisis, as Moscow sees them, are addressed. The veteran diplomat also took the opportunity to repeat complaints about NATO, Washington, London and the European Union. His speech came a few hours after Lebanese Hezbollah acknowledged the death of their leader, Hassan Nasrallah, following a series of targeted Israeli airstrikes in Beirut. 'We are particularly concerned by the now almost commonplace practice of political killings, as once again, took place yesterday in Beirut,' he told the assembly. At a news conference following his speech, Lavrov expressed concerns about a wider regional war. 'A lot of people say that Israel wants to create the grounds to drag the U.S. directly into this,' he said. 'And so, to create these grounds, is trying to provoke Iran and Hezbollah. So the Iran leadership, I think, are behaving extremely responsibly, and this is something that we should take due note of.' War in Ukraine In February 2022, Russia and China declared a 'no limits partnership,' just days before President Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The United States has repeatedly accused China of assisting the Kremlin with its war. 'China, another permanent member of this council, is the top provider of machine tools, microelectronics, and other items that Russia is using to rebuild, to restock, to ramp up its war machine and sustain its brutal aggression,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday at a high-level U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine that President Zelenskyy attended. Beijing denies the charge and has sought to distance itself publicly from Moscow on the war. 'The top priority is to commit to no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting, and no provocation by any party, and push for de-escalation of the situation as soon as possible,' Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the General Assembly on Saturday. Beijing says it is committed to playing 'a constructive role' in ending the conflict. China and 'multipolar world' On the margins of the annual U.N. meetings, China and Brazil launched what they are calling the group of friends for peace for Ukraine, which includes several other countries from the global south. In a sign of China's desire to be recognized as a global economic and political power, Wang said international relations should be 'more democratic.' 'Gone are the days when one or two major powers call the shots on everything,' he said. 'We should advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world and see that all countries, regardless of their size, have their own place and role in the multipolar system.' Wang also called for full U.N. membership for the Palestinians and urged implementation of a two-state solution. 'There must not be any delay in reaching a comprehensive cease-fire, and the fundamental way out lies in the two-state solution,' he said. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi asked the assembly how the international community could believe Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim on Friday that 'Israel yearns for peace.' 'Yesterday, while he was here, Israel conducted an unprecedented, massive air attack on Beirut. Prime Minister Netanyahu wants the war to continue. We must stop that! I repeat, we must stop that! We must pressure Israel to come back to a political solution for a two-state solution,' she said to much applause. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister also expressed concern about regional stability following the escalation in Lebanon. 'We call on all parties to show wisdom and to show restraint in order to avoid a true war breaking out in the region,' Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-russian-foreign-minister-dismisses-zelenskyy-s-peace-plan-as-doomed-/7803182.html	2024-09-28T14:55:33-07:00

Hundreds rally in Paris to support world abortion rights	paris — Hundreds of people came out Saturday in Paris, marching in support of the right to abortion for women across the world, just six months after France became the first country to guarantee in its constitution a woman's right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy. The protest, organized by civil society groups to mark International Safe Abortion Day, also called for greater and easier access to abortion in France, denouncing budget cuts, staff reductions and the closure of abortion centers and maternity wards, which organizers say all contribute to penalizing women. Sarah Durocher, president of France's not-for-profit family planning services, said French women sometimes must travel to another region to access the medical services needed to abort, denouncing the 'obstacle course' they sometimes face. Thibault Thomas, 28, said the ongoing trial of a man who has confessed to drugging his wife so that dozens of men could rape her while she was unconscious, was one of the reasons that motivated him to attend the protest Saturday. 'There's a mood in France, a particular context with the Mazan trial,' he said, referring to the name of the small Provence town where the couple had bought their retirement home, and where the repeated rapes occurred. 'This sweeps away all the excuses, or all the mitigating circumstances that we thought could have existed before,' Thomas said. 'In fact, it is something broader, generalized.' Earlier this year, France became the only country to explicitly guarantee a woman's right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy, when lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a bill to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution. Abortion in France has been legal since 1975 and enjoys wide support across most of the political spectrum. Enshrining the right in the Constitution sought to prevent the kind of rollback seen in the United States in recent years. Still, many in the protest Saturday said the right to abort could never be taken for granted, especially at a time when far-right nationalist parties are gaining influence in France and other European countries. 'Every time the far right comes to power, sexual and reproductive rights are threatened. I don't see why there would be a French exception,' said Durocher, stressing that every nine minutes, a woman dies somewhere in the world for not having been able to access safe abortion. 'So obviously these rights are threatened.' Also in the Saturday march was a small organization representing Colombian women in Paris, carrying a large purple banner with a feminist sign. 'In France, fortunately, it is enshrined in the constitution. But we know that when we exert pressure in France or in Latin America, we also help all women to say, 'We are not alone,'' said 49-year-old Talula Rodriguez. 'We're all going to fight for rights, rights over our bodies.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-rally-in-paris-to-support-world-abortion-rights-/7803144.html	2024-09-28T12:55:49-07:00	
Poland's flooding death toll rises after more bodies found	WARSAW, Poland — The death toll in Poland from recent floods rose to nine after two more bodies were found, the national police chief said Saturday. One person is still missing, police chief Marek Boron said during a government meeting on the effects of the floods that hit southwestern Poland earlier this month. The floods following torrential rains inundated houses and damaged bridges and roads in the towns of Stronie Slaskie, Nysa and many villages in the area. More than 20 people have died in Poland and elsewhere in Central Europe from the floods. A German citizen is among the dead in Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said earlier this week. In the wake of the floods, Poland's 2025 draft budget will set aside $836 million as a reserve for dealing with natural disasters, the government said Saturday. The worst floods in at least two decades left many towns in southwestern Poland submerged, and the government plans to free up millions of dollars from the budget and European Union funds to deal with the aftermath. The deluge has also compounded the financial worries of a government facing the prospect of EU budget discipline measures. In a statement published after the government adopted the 2025 budget with changes due to the floods, it said that the reserve for counteracting and removing the effects of natural disasters would be increased. It said that around $5 million in EU funds would be allocated to helping regions affected by the floods. Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski said that no decision has been made on whether changes to the 2024 budget would be necessary.	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-s-flooding-death-toll-rises-after-more-bodies-found/7803127.html	2024-09-28T12:21:15-07:00	
Czech opposition party wins most seats in election for third of Senate	prague — The main Czech opposition group led by former populist Prime Minister Andrej Babis won an election Saturday for a third of the seats in Parliament's upper house, the Senate. The ruling coalition of Prime Minister Petr Fiala still retained a majority in the Senate. With all the votes from the two-day ballot counted, Babis' ANO, or YES in English, won eight of the 27 seats up for grabs in the 81-seat Senate in the two-round election. It's the first time the centrist movement won that many seats in the chamber. The results are a boost for Babis ahead of next year's parliamentary elections. ANO has been the most popular party and is favored to win that vote. The candidates linked to the coalition won 15 seats. Parliament's lower house dominates the legislative process, but the Senate plays an important role in passing constitutional amendments and approving Constitutional Court judges. In a separate vote last week, ANO dominated Czech regional elections, winning 10 of the 13 regions contested. The current Czech government firmly stands behind Ukraine after it was invaded by Russia. The country has donated arms, including heavy weapons, to the Ukrainian armed forces and is behind a plan to acquire artillery shells Ukraine badly needs from countries outside the European Union. Some 320,000 refugees from Ukraine currently live in Czechia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/czech-opposition-party-wins-most-seats-in-election-for-third-of-senate-/7803106.html	2024-09-28T11:36:56-07:00	
6 killed by bomb blasts in Somalia after leader addresses UN	WASHINGTON — Bomb blasts in Mogadishu and a town in the country's Middle Shabelle region killed at least six people and injured 10 others Saturday, police said and witnesses confirmed to VOA. 'An explosives-laden vehicle, which was parked on the road near a restaurant in the busy Hamar Weyne district, went off. I could see the dead bodies of at least three people, two of them women,' Mohamed Haji Nur, a witness, told VOA. The explosion site is opposite of Somalia’s National Theater, about one kilometer from the president's office. The target of the attack is still unknown, but the affected Gel Doh restaurant is frequented by government staff and people from the diaspora for serving traditional Somali food. In a separate incident, a bomb planted in a livestock market in Jowhar city in Somalia's Middle Shabelle region killed one person and injured three other civilians, Jowhar police Commander Bashir Hassan told a news conference. It was not immediately clear who had carried out the attacks. However, the Islamist militant group al-Shabab is known for orchestrating bombings and gun attacks in Mogadishu and elsewhere in the Horn of Africa country. Barre addressed UN General Assembly Somalian Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre publicly accused Ethiopia before the U.N. General Assembly on Friday of actions that he says 'flagrantly violate' Somalia's territorial integrity. This accusation comes as tensions continue to escalate between the two neighboring countries since January, when Ethiopia struck a controversial maritime deal with the breakaway region of Somaliland. This region, at the northern tip of the country, declared independence in 1991 but lacks international recognition. Under the deal, Somaliland would lease 20 kilometers of shoreline to Ethiopia in return for recognition, a move that raised alarms in Mogadishu. 'Somalia currently faces a serious threat from Ethiopia's recent actions, which flagrantly violate our territorial integrity,' Prime Minister Barre stated at the U.N. General Assembly. Somalia has accused Ethiopia of unlawfully attempting to build a naval base and commercial port in Somaliland. 'Ethiopia's attempt to annex part of Somalia under the guise of securing sea access is both unlawful and unnecessary,' Barre emphasized, highlighting the gravity of the situation. Ethiopia, a landlocked nation, has long sought access to the sea, but its move to deal with Somaliland infuriated the Somali government. Barre elaborated on the implications of Ethiopia's actions, saying, 'Somalia ports have always been accessible for Ethiopia’s legitimate commercial activities, reflecting our commitment to regional trade and cooperation.' He warned, though, that 'Ethiopia's aggressive maneuvers undermine Somalia’s sovereignty and embolden secessionist movements, which could threaten national unity.' 'These actions also serve as propaganda for terrorist groups like al-Shabab, who exploit Ethiopia’s provocations to recruit and radicalize vulnerable individuals,' he said. Ethiopia denies accusations Addressing the General Debate of the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Taye Atske-Selassie, minister for foreign affairs of Ethiopia, denied Somalia’s accusation. 'Ethiopia’s memorandum of understanding with Somaliland is based on existing political dispensation in Somalia,' he said. 'Our objective is a shared growth and prosperity in the region. Similar agreements have been concluded by other states, and there is no reason for the government of Somalia to incite hostility that obviously intends to cover internal political tensions. I therefore reject the unfounded allegations leveled against my country.' In a show of defiance, several times Somalia has threatened to expel Ethiopian troops who have been part of an African Union mission against al-Shabab militants since 2007. Afyare Abdi Elmi, a Mogadishu-based professor of international affairs, told VOA that recent Egyptian military cooperation with Somalia raised concerns in Addis Ababa. 'The stakes are raised further, as Mogadishu has signed a military deal with Cairo and received weapons shipments that have alarmed Ethiopian officials.' 'I am afraid that the unfolding events signal a crucial moment in the Horn of Africa, with the potential to reshape the region's geopolitical landscape and security dynamics,' said Somalia analyst Abdiqafar Abdi Wardhere, who is based in Virginia. Last week, the Somali government accused Ethiopia of sending an 'unauthorized shipment of arms and ammunition' to Somalia's semiautonomous region of Puntland. 'Ethiopia must be held accountable for actions threatening to destabilize the Horn of Africa,' Barre warned in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly. As the African Union mission prepares to transform at the end of the year, Egypt has offered to replace Ethiopian troops for the first time. Somalia may also push for the removal of the estimated 10,000 Ethiopian troops stationed in Somalia’s regions along the border, aimed at preventing incursions by Islamist militants. Although he did not name Egypt, Ethiopia’s foreign minister said that other actors’ actions are undermining regional stability. 'The recent maneuvers of actors from the outside of the Horn of Africa region undermine these efforts. Ethiopia will not be deterred from its resolute commitment to combating terrorism,' Atske-Selassie said. 'I am confident that the government of Somalia will reckon and recognize the sacrifice we made to Somalia’s liberation from the grip of terrorist groups.'

Hezbollah deputy Qassim tapped to replace slain Nasrallah	CAIRO — Lebanese media is reporting that Hezbollah has named its deputy leader, Naim Qassim, to succeed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed after Israeli planes bombed the organization's headquarters in Beirut's southern suburbs Friday. It wan't clear if the interim appointment would be revised, amid reports that another Hezbollah leader, Hashim Safieddine, is seeking the position. Hezbollah officially announced the death of its veteran leader Hassan Nasrallah on Saturday, after initially denying reports that he had been killed Friday in an Israeli attack on the group's bunker in Beirut's southern suburbs. Iran's Revolutionary Guard also told Iranian media that Quds Force Deputy Commander Abbas Niloforoshan was killed alongside Nasrallah and several other top Hezbollah commanders, including the group's rocket expert, Ali Karaki, during the Israeli bomb attack Friday. Iranian media reported that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei was moved to a more secure location, amid fears that Israel might target him, as well. Israel assassinated Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in August. More than 200,000 Lebanese reportedly have fled their homes in parts of the country to escape possible Israeli attacks, and many are sleeping in parks and outdoor locations according to Lebanese media. UNHCR head Filippo Grandi wrote in a post on social media platform X that 20,000 Lebanese also have fled to Syria. Lebanese media showed video of the Syrian border post along the highway from Beirut to Damascus overwhelmed by Lebanese and Syrians fleeing Lebanon. Lebanese Health Minister Firaas Abiad told hospitals in Beirut and north of the capital 'not to take unessential cases during the next week' in order to deal with the current wave of casualties from Israeli attacks. Abiad also told Arab media that Lebanon has a four-month supply of medicine and other hospital necessities to deal with the current emergency but that it was requesting aid from other countries to deal with possible shortages. The Lebanese army reportedly has deployed in many parts of the country that have been Hezbollah strongholds in recent years, but it wasn't clear if the government received a green light from the group to do so.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hezbollah-deputy-qassim-tapped-to-replace-slain-nasrallah/7803092.html	2024-09-28T11:02:30-07:00	
9 die in migrant boat shipwreck off Spanish island; 48 missing	Madrid — A boat carrying migrants capsized off Spain's Canary Islands overnight, killing at least nine people and leaving 48 missing, the national maritime rescue service said Saturday. Eighty-four people were on board and 27 were saved after rescuers responded to a distress call received shortly after midnight from off El Hierro, one of the islands in the Atlantic archipelago, a statement said. This follows the death of 39 migrants in early September when their boat sank off Senegal while attempting a similar crossing to the Canaries, from where migrants hope to reach mainland Europe. Thousands of migrants have died in recent years setting off into the Atlantic to reach Europe onboard overcrowded and often dilapidated boats. The latest tragedy 'again underlines the dangerousness of the Atlantic route,' Canaries regional President Fernando Clavijo wrote on X. 'We need Spain and the EU to act decisively in the face of a structural humanitarian tragedy' as lives are lost 'meters from Europe's southern border,' he said. In late August, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez visited Mauritania and Gambia to sign cooperation agreements to crack down on people smugglers while expanding pathways for legal immigration. As of August 15, some 22,304 migrants had reached the Canaries since the start of the year, up from 9,864 in the same period the previous year. Almost 40,000 migrants entered the Canaries in 2023, a record on course to be broken this year as easier navigation conditions from September tend to lead to a spike in crossing attempts. The Atlantic route is particularly deadly, with many of the crowded and poorly equipped boats unable to cope with the strong ocean currents. Some boats depart African beaches as far as 1,000 kilometers from the Canaries. The International Organization for Migration, a U.N. agency, estimates that 4,857 people have died on this route since 2014. Many aid organizations say that is a massive undercount, with Caminando Fronteras, a Spanish nongovernmental organization that aids migrants, saying 18,680 have died trying to reach Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/die-in-migrant-boat-shipwreck-off-spanish-island-48-missing/7803078.html	2024-09-28T10:34:36-07:00

Thai MP Rome urges reform to fix Myanmar migration crisis, corruption	Bangkok — As Thailand faces a growing influx of refugees from Myanmar following the military coup, MP Rangsiman Rome, chair of the Thai House Committee on National Security and deputy leader of the People’s Party, emphasizes the need for urgent reform. 'The immediate step is to register the people,' Rome tells VOA, citing corruption and the lack of legal recognition that leave many refugees vulnerable. 'By recognizing them, we can give them access to education and work, while ensuring they contribute by paying taxes.' In this exclusive interview with VOA, Rome discusses Thailand’s challenges with migration, corruption and the need for coordinated government action to address the crisis. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. VOA: What are your criticisms of the government’s handling of this crisis, and what should they do differently? Rangsiman Rome: The civil war in Myanmar is devastating, forcing many to flee into Thailand. Unfortunately, Thailand wasn’t prepared, and refugees now live in the shadows without legal status. We can’t return them due to international and domestic laws, so we’ve been working with [nongovernmental organizations] to provide humanitarian aid, but a long-term solution is necessary. Thailand shares a 2,400-kilometer border with Myanmar, and instability there allows for illegal activities like drug smuggling and human trafficking, affecting Thailand and the region. ASEAN [the Association of Southeast Asian Nations] must pressure the State Administration Council [SAC], Myanmar’s junta, to support peace and democracy in Myanmar. In the short term, Thailand must register the 6 million Myanmar people here, providing them with legal status, work and education. Right now, the government’s policy on this issue remains unclear. VOA: What immediate steps should be taken? Rome: Registering the Myanmar people who are in Thailand would be a good first step. One of the problems that we are facing is corruption. A lot of refugees have to pay the money to the police or other authorities in order to work. If the Thai government would recognize these people living in Thailand, it would make it so they can not only access health care and education, but also they will be able to work and therefore have the responsibility to pay taxes. At the same time, we need to reach out to our friends like Japan, the U.S. and Australia for help with managing this situation, such as humanitarian aid. VOA: A recent Lower House report highlighted legal loopholes contributing to human rights violations. What changes do you propose? Rome: When we register them, we can make sure that our law will protect them. Abuses can happen because we don’t recognize them. So, [if] anything happens to them, they cannot report it; but if they are registered, they can earn, can live like normal people in Thailand. At the same time, if you want to solve this, we have to talk about how it starts. In Myanmar we find out that as many as 2 million refugees are in the IDP [internally displaced people] camps because of the ongoing bombardment by the SAC. If everyone in the international community would come together to pressure the SAC to stop this, maybe a million refugees could return to their homes again. So, we need to not just manage the refugees in Thailand, but we have to deal with the situation in Myanmar. VOA: Ministries have been criticized for working in 'silos.' How do you plan to improve coordination? Rome: As chair of the National Security Committee, I ensure that our recommendations benefit Thailand. We aim to play a larger role in the U.N. Human Rights Council, but we must manage the refugee situation appropriately to maintain our reputation. We are working with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure Myanmar refugees can live safely in Thailand. Additionally, the SAC has been using Thailand’s banking system to launder money for weapons, and we’ve been pushing the foreign minister to take action on this. VOA: Access to health care, education and basic services for migrants remain major issues. How do you assess the government’s efforts, and what would you do differently? Rome: The policy around education in Thailand is not very clear. For example, there have been cases where the government closed a day care because they were singing a song to the children in Burmese and they found that unacceptable. The problem is that it’s very hard for refugee children to access school in Thailand and not every school has the same policies. The people at the border, they cannot have a Thai education, so the Thai authority is trying to create a separate Burmese program for them, but it doesn’t make sense to me. How can the Thai government make a Burmese program? I think one of the very important things is we need to change this policy. Kids are innocent. They should have access to the Thai education system, and actually, we have space for them. We are an aging society. Schools are actually closing due to a lack of enrollment because of low birth rates. I think Thailand must change, and if I controlled the government, absolutely we would open the education system for Myanmar people to study in Thailand. I believe that if they are better educated, it benefits not only themselves but all of Thailand. VOA: There was a protest in front of the Myanmar Embassy a few days ago where protesters were complaining about the large number of Myanmar refugees in Thailand. What do you think is driving this protest? Rome: Thailand’s struggling economy has led to job losses, and with over 6 million Myanmar refugees here, tensions are rising. Corruption adds to the issue, with refugees forced to pay bribes just to live. Crimes involving Myanmar refugees are often publicized more, worsening relations between Thai and Myanmar people. Registering the refugees would reduce corruption and ensure equal treatment under the law. Right now, Thai law restricts foreigners from working in many sectors, but if managed properly, Myanmar workers could contribute significantly to our economy. They are essential to Thailand and bringing them out of the shadows will help us all. VOA: Given the current situation, what message would you like to share with the Myanmar migrants living in Thailand? Rome: I understand that the people from Myanmar seek peace and safety here, hoping to provide for their families. The crisis in Myanmar forced them to flee and find opportunities elsewhere. As an MP, I want Thailand to uphold human rights, but that’s difficult due to many factors — history, education and the economy. Still, I believe that Myanmar and Thailand, as neighbors, must work together. Real change requires improving the situation in Myanmar. I know the Myanmar people want peace and democracy, and I hope we can achieve that together.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-mp-rome-urges-reform-to-fix-myanmar-migration-crisis-corruption/7803047.html	2024-09-28T09:55:10-07:00	
China warns against 'expansion' of Ukraine war	United Nations — China 's Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned Saturday against the expansion of the war in Ukraine, which has accused Beijing of assisting Russia in its war. Kyiv has been particularly scornful of Beijing's calls for talks to resolve the conflict, but Wang reiterated China 's offer to help broker an end to fighting. 'The top priority is to commit to no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting, and no provocation by any party, and push for de-escalation of the situation as soon as possible,' he told the U.N. General Assembly. 'China is committed to playing a constructive role, engaging in shuttle mediation and promoting talks for peace, not throwing oil on the fire or exploiting the situation for selfish gains.' Wang also called for an immediate cease-fire in the fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, but only noted the resumption of fighting in Lebanon without commenting on the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike. 'There must not be any delay in reaching a comprehensive cease-fire, and the fundamental way out lies in the two-state solution,' Wang said. 'China has always been a staunch supporter of the just cause of the Palestinian people to regain their legitimate national rights, and a staunch supporter of Palestine's full U.N. membership.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-warns-against-expansion-of-ukraine-war/7803015.html	2024-09-28T09:01:21-07:00	
US, Asia-Pacific nations hold joint exercises in South China Sea	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — The armed forces of five countries conducted joint maritime exercises in a portion of the South China Sea on Saturday as China carried out its own military drills in the disputed waterway. The exercises involving the Philippines, United States, Australia, Japan and — for the first time — New Zealand took place in Manila's exclusive economic zone and sought to improve the militaries' interoperability, the Philippine armed forces said in a statement. Saturday's exercises included a Philippine warship, the United States' USS Howard, Japan's JS Sazanami and New Zealand's HMNZS Aotearoa, the statement said. Australia's Department of Defense said the drills demonstrated 'our collective commitment to strengthen regional and international cooperation in support of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.' The exercises follow a series of air and sea encounters between the Philippines and China, which have sparred over disputed areas of the South China Sea, including the Scarborough Shoal, one of Asia's most contested features. The shoal has been occupied by China's coast guard for more than a decade. On Wednesday, naval vessels from New Zealand and Australia sailed through the Taiwan Strait, part of the South China Sea. China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own, says it alone exercises sovereignty and jurisdiction over the strait. The U.S. and Taiwan say the strait — a major trade route through which about half of global container ships pass — is an international waterway. Australia has 'consistently pressed China on peace and stability in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait,' Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday. 'We have welcomed the resumption of leader- and military-level dialogue between the U.S. and China,' Wong said, according to a transcript. Chinese air and naval forces conducted maneuvers in a disputed area of the sea hours after the country's top diplomat discussed ways of reducing regional tension with his U.S. counterpart. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, despite overlapping maritime claims by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, angering its neighbors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-asia-pacific-nations-hold-joint-exercises-in-south-china-sea/7803002.html	2024-09-28T08:50:50-07:00	
17 people killed in 2 mass shootings in same South African town	JOHANNESBURG — Seventeen people, including 15 women, were killed in two mass shootings that took place near each other in a rural town in South Africa, police said Saturday. A search was under way for the suspects, national police spokesperson Brigadier Athlenda Mathe said in a statement. The victims were 15 women and two men, she said. One other person was in critical condition in the hospital. The shootings took place Friday night in the town of Lusikisiki in Eastern Cape province in southeastern South Africa. Video released by police showed that the shootings occurred at two houses in the same neighborhood, which is a collection of rural homesteads on the outskirts of the town. Twelve women and a man were killed in one house, and three women and a man were killed in the other house, police said. Four women, one man and a 2-month-old baby survived. 'A manhunt has been launched to apprehend those behind these heinous killings,' Mathe said. Local media reported that the people were attending a family gathering at the time of the shooting, but the motive for the killings remains unknown. Police minister Senzo Mchunu told media on Saturday that a team of detectives and forensic experts had been deployed. 'We have full faith and confidence in the team that has been deployed to crack this case and find these criminals. Either they hand themselves over or we will fetch them ourselves,' Mchunu said. South Africa, a country of 62 million, recorded 12,734 homicides in the first six months of this year, according to official crime statistics from the police. That’s an average of more than 70 a day. Firearms are by far the biggest cause of deaths in those cases. Mass shootings have become increasingly common in recent years, sometimes targeting people in their homes. Ten members of the same family, including seven women and a 13-year-old boy, were killed in a mass shooting at their home in the neighboring KwaZulu-Natal province in April 2023. Firearm laws are somewhat strict in South Africa, but authorities have often pointed to the large number of illegal, unregistered guns in circulation as a major problem.	https://www.voanews.com/a/people-killed-in-2-mass-shootings-in-same-south-african-town/7802974.html	2024-09-28T08:17:53-07:00	
Floods, landslides kill at least 38 people in Nepal	KATHMANDU, NEPAL — At least 38 people have been killed in Nepal since early on Friday as persistent downpours triggered more flooding and landslides, closing major roads and disrupting domestic air travel, officials said on Saturday. The death toll could rise, they added, with an additional 29 people reported missing over the last 30 hours. Most of the deaths took place in the Kathmandu valley, which is home to 4 million people and the country's capital, where the flooding brought traffic and normal activity to a standstill. Rescue workers used helicopters and rubber boats to help people stranded on rooftops or elevated ground as some parts of Kathmandu reported up to 322.2 millimeters of rain over the last day. Most rivers in the Himalayan nation have swollen, spilling over roads and bridges, authorities said, after nearly a week's delay in the retreat of South Asia's annual monsoon rains brought torrential downpours across the region. Police were working to clear debris and reopen roads after landslides blocked highways in 28 places, said police spokesperson Dan Bahadur Karki. The earliest let-up in the rains might not come until Sunday, said Binu Maharjan, a weather forecasting official in Kathmandu, who said a low-pressure system over parts of neighboring India had caused this year's extended rains. 'Heavy rains are likely to continue until Sunday morning, and the weather is likely to clear after that,' Maharjan told Reuters. Most central and eastern areas had received moderate to extremely heavy rainfall, ranging from 50 millimeters to more than 200 millimeters, she added, with moderate levels recorded elsewhere. International flights are operating, but many domestic flights have been disrupted, said Rinji Sherpa, a spokesperson for Kathmandu airport. The Koshi River in the southeast, which causes deadly floods in India's eastern neighboring state of Bihar almost every year, was running above the danger level at 450,000 cusecs, versus the normal figure of 150,000 cusecs, one official said. A cusec is a measurement of water flow equivalent to one cubic foot a second. The river level is still rising, added Ram Chandra Tiwari, the area's top bureaucrat. Hundreds of people die in the monsoon season every year in landslides and flash floods common in the mountainous nation. Authorities said at least 254 people have died and 65 gone missing in landslides, floods and lightning strikes since mid-June, when annual monsoon rains started.	https://www.voanews.com/a/floods-landslides-kill-at-least-38-people-in-nepal/7802966.html	2024-09-28T08:10:15-07:00	
Sexual violence used as weapon of war throughout conflict in Sudan	GENEVA — Sudan’s warring parties are using sexual violence as a weapon of war, and 'gender-based violence has increased more than two-fold' since the conflict erupted in April 2023, according to U.N. Women, a United Nations agency that focuses on women’s rights and social progress, in its new report. 'Sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war throughout this conflict,' Hodan Addou, U.N. Women’s regional director for East and Southern Africa, told journalists in Geneva at the launch of the report Friday. 'The ongoing violent conflict has exacerbated the risks faced by women and girls in Sudan, with rising reports of conflict-related sexual violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, particularly in Khartoum, Al Jazeera, Darfur and Kordofan states,' she said, speaking from South Sudan via a video link. Authors of the report have issued what they call a 'Gender Alert' to highlight the catastrophic impacts of Sudan’s conflict on women and girls. They note that nearly 5.8 million internally displaced women are particularly vulnerable, with many cases of sexual violence going unreported 'due to fear of stigma, retribution and the lack of adequate support.' 'It is ... despicable' Addou observed that rape and sexual violence is used as 'a way of breaking communities and tarnishing the social fabric of a community by targeting the most vulnerable.' 'It is a despicable and human rights violation,' she said. 'The impact this conflict has had on the lives of women and children is horrendous. 'Many of them are seeing their loved ones killed in front of their eyes. They have seen brutal sexual violence against children, against women used as a way of putting more trauma, more fear on communities.' The report finds more than 6.7 million people needed services related to gender-based violence by December 2023, underscoring that 'this figure is estimated to be much higher today.' 'While men and boys also are victims of gender-based violence, most of these cases involve women and girls,' it says. The United Nations calls Sudan one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. Since rival generals of the Sudanese Armed Forces and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces plunged the country into war more than 17 months ago, an estimated 20,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands injured. Some 10.8 million people are displaced inside Sudan and an additional 2 million as refugees in neighboring countries, making Sudan the largest displacement crisis in the world. According to the U.N., Sudan now is also the world’s largest hunger crisis, with nearly 26 million people facing acute hunger. 'Women and girls are eating least and last' Addou said women and children are suffering most from the looming famine gripping the country. 'With 64% of female-headed households experiencing food insecurity compared to 48% of male-headed households in 10 states, women and girls are eating least and last,' she said, adding that they also are disproportionately affected by the lack of safe and easily accessible water, sanitation and hygiene. The World Health Organization reports people lack access to health care services because of insecurity, attacks on medical facilities and a shortage of medicines and medical supplies. The U.N. health agency says critical services, including maternal and child health care, the management of severe acute malnutrition, and the treatment of patients with chronic conditions have been discontinued in many areas because 70% to 80% of hospitals are not functional. 'Across Sudan, women are dying from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications, whether or not those pregnancies are a result of gender-based violence, or whatever,' Dr. Margaret Harris, WHO spokesperson, said. 'Women are not getting the standard care that saves your life and saves the life of your child during childbirth or before childbirth.' She added that childhood vaccinations have been disrupted, as have disease surveillance and vector control, and this 'has created the perfect conditions for the spread of disease outbreaks.' 'Calling for protection' U.N. Women is calling for urgent action to protect women and girls and to provide them with access to food, safe water, and sexual and reproductive health services. 'We are calling for protection for all women and girls, in particular the retributions that they need to address. We are calling for accountability and the provision of justice to all of the victims,' Addou said. 'The high-level sexual violence and exploitation being used as a weapon of war is preventing women from accessing much-needed resources … and the psychosocial support they need because of the chaotic nature of this conflict. 'All those engaged in this violent conflict must be held to account,' she said. 'We cannot let Sudan become a forgotten crisis.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sexual-violence-used-as-weapon-of-war-throughout-conflict-in-sudan/7802951.html	2024-09-28T08:00:19-07:00	
Ukraine says Russian attacks on medical center in Sumy kill 9	KYIV, Ukraine — Russian forces hit a medical center in Sumy in northeastern Ukraine on Saturday morning, then struck again as the building was being evacuated, killing a total of nine people, Ukrainian officials said. Ukrainian prosecutors said that at the time of the attacks, 86 patients and 38 staff members were in the hospital. 'The first attack killed one person and damaged the ceilings of several floors of the hospital,' Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on Telegram. As people were being evacuated, the Russians struck again, killing five more people, he said. Ukrainian emergencies service later said nine people were killed and 10 wounded in all. 'Everyone in the world who talks about this war should pay attention to where Russia is hitting. They are fighting hospitals, civilian objects, and people's lives,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Telegram. 'Only force can force Russia to peace. Peace through force is the only right way.' Klymenko did not specify what weapons were used in Saturday's attacks, but the regional administration and air forces said the strike was carried out by drones. Attacks on Sumy city and the Sumy region have become much more frequent since Ukrainian forces launched an operation in Russia's Kursk region in August and captured dozens of settlements. Sumy city is located just 32 kilometers from the Russian border. Russian forces, which began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, have been attacking the region and the city with drones and guided bombs. Ukrainian air forces earlier on Saturday said they shot down 69 of 73 drones during an overnight Russian attack that included two ballistic and two cruise missiles. About 15 Russian attack drones were destroyed by air defenses in the capital, Kyiv, and on its outskirts, the military administration there said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-russian-attacks-on-medical-center-in-sumy-kill-9/7802942.html	2024-09-28T07:40:40-07:00	
Dozens dead, millions without power after Helene's march across southeastern US	PERRY, Florida — Hurricane Helene caused dozens of deaths and billions of dollars of destruction across a wide swath of the southeastern United States, and more than 3 million customers went into the weekend without power and, for some, a continued threat of floods. Helene blew ashore in Florida's Big Bend region as a Category 4 hurricane late Thursday packing winds of 225 kilometers per hour and then quickly moved through Georgia, the Carolinas and Tennessee. The storm uprooted trees, splintered homes and sent creeks and rivers over their banks and straining dams. Western North Carolina was essentially cut off because of landslides and flooding that forced the closure of Interstate 40 and other roads. There were hundreds of water rescues, none more dramatic than in rural Unicoi County in eastern Tennessee, where dozens of patients and staff were plucked by helicopter from the roof of a hospital that was surrounded by water from a flooded river. The storm, now a post-tropical cyclone, was expected to hover over the Tennessee Valley on Saturday and Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said. Several flood and flash flood warnings remained in effect in parts of the southern and central Appalachian Mountains, while high wind warnings also covered parts of Tennessee and Ohio. Among the at least 44 people killed in the storm were three firefighters, a woman and her 1-month-old twins, and an 89-year-old woman whose house was struck by a falling tree. According to an Associated Press tally, the deaths occurred in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. When the water hit knee-level in Kera O’Neil’s home in Hudson, Florida, she knew it was time to escape. 'There’s a moment where you are thinking, ‘If this water rises above the level of the stove, we are not going to have much room to breathe,’' she said, recalling how she and her sister waded through chest-deep water with one cat in a plastic carrier and another in a cardboard box. Evacuations and record rainfall In North Carolina, a lake featured in the movie 'Dirty Dancing' overtopped a dam and surrounding neighborhoods were evacuated, although there were no immediate concerns it would fail. People also were evacuated from Newport, Tennessee, a town of about 7,000 people, amid concerns about a dam near there, although officials later said the structure had not failed. Tornadoes hit some areas, including one in Nash County, North Carolina, that critically injured four people. Atlanta received a record 28.24 centimeters of rain in 48 hours, the most the city has seen in a two-day period since recordkeeping began in 1878, Georgia’s Office of the State Climatologist said on the social platform X. Some neighborhoods were so badly flooded that only car roofs could be seen poking above the water. Moody’s Analytics said it expects $15 billion to $26 billion in property damage. Climate change has exacerbated conditions that allow such storms to thrive, rapidly intensifying in warming waters and turning into powerful cyclones sometimes in a matter of hours. Big Bend region hit hard Florida's Big Bend is a part of the state where salt marshes and pine flatwoods stretch into the horizon, and where the condo developments and strip malls that have carved up so much of the state's coastlines elsewhere are largely absent. It’s a place where Susan Sauls Hartway and her 4-year-old Chihuahua mix, Lucy, could afford to live within walking distance of the beach on her salary as a housekeeper. At least, until her house was carried away by Helene. Friday afternoon, Hartway wandered around her street near Ezell Beach, searching for where the storm may have deposited her home. 'It’s gone. I don’t know where it’s at. I can’t find it,' she said of her house. Born and raised in rural Taylor County, Hartway said there is nowhere in the world she would rather be, even after Helene. But she’s watched as wealthier residents from out of state have bought up second homes here. She wonders how many of them will sell out — and what will happen to the locals who have nowhere else to go. 'There’s so many people down here ... this was all they had,' she said. The community has taken direct hits from three hurricanes since August 2023. All five who died in one Florida county were in neighborhoods where residents were told to evacuate, said Bob Gualtieri, the sheriff in Pinellas County in the St. Petersburg area. Some who stayed ended up having to retreat to their attics to escape the rising water. He said the death toll could rise as crews go door-to-door in flooded areas. More deaths were reported in Georgia and the Carolinas, including two South Carolina firefighters and a Georgia firefighter who died when trees struck their trucks. Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin reported at least one death in his state. Power loss and infrastructure damage President Joe Biden said he was praying for survivors, and the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency headed to the area. The agency deployed more than 1,500 workers, and they helped with 400 rescues by late Friday morning. Officials urged people who were trapped to call for rescuers and not tread floodwaters, warning they can be dangerous due to live wires, sewage, sharp objects and other debris. In Georgia, an electrical utility group warned of 'catastrophic' damage to utility infrastructure, with more than 100 high-voltage transmission lines damaged. And officials in South Carolina, where more than 40% of customers were without power, said crews had to cut their way through debris just to determine what was still standing in some places. The hurricane came ashore near the mouth of the Aucilla River, about 30 kilometers northwest of where Hurricane Idalia hit last year at nearly the same ferocity. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the damage from Helene appears to be greater than the combined effects of Idalia and Hurricane Debby in August. The destruction extended far beyond Florida. Historic flooding expected A mudslide in the Appalachian Mountains washed out part of an interstate highway at the North Carolina-Tennessee state line. Another slide hit homes in North Carolina, and occupants had to wait more than four hours to be rescued, said Ryan Cole, the emergency services assistant director in Buncombe County. His 911 center received more than 3,300 calls in eight hours Friday. 'This is something that we’re going to be dealing with for many days and weeks to come,' Cole said. Forecasters warned of flooding in North Carolina that could be worse than anything seen in the past century. The Connecticut Army National Guard sent a helicopter to help. Helene was the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-dead-millions-without-power-after-helene-s-march-across-southeastern-us/7802925.html	2024-09-28T07:21:51-07:00	
Kazakh journalists worry as new media rules come into force	ALMATY, KAZAKHSTAN — Media watchdogs and journalists in Kazakhstan have raised fears that new regulations governing reporters, adopted outside a new media law, leave room for authorities to obstruct access to information and limit journalists’ ability to work. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev signed the media law in June, expanding the definition of media subject to the law to include 'internet resources' without specifying what that means. Many journalists distribute information on such channels as Telegram, YouTube and Facebook, which are separate from their accredited outlets. The law allows the Culture and Information Ministry, which oversees media, to set the rules for accrediting journalists. The regulations, which came into force last month, limit journalists to publishing information in outlets to which they are accredited, preventing them from publishing it in other outlets, and require them to comply with new and unspecified 'rules and regulations established by accrediting organization.' Two violations of the rules can lead to suspension of accreditation for six months. 'Any document adopted by a government body, including the Ministry of Culture and Information, undergoes legal expert examination. This means all provisions, all points, comply with the constitution and don’t contradict laws,' Culture and Information Minister Aida Balayeva told journalists this month after they raised concerns over the legality of the new regulations. 'When we see that we drift away from the topic of a press briefing and, in fact, our briefings and news conferences shift to some other planes … when there is improper behavior by journalists — here we need regulation,' she said. Astana-based freelance journalist Tamara Vaal, who writes for the country’s leading vlast.kz news site and other outlets, said in a Facebook post that the rules 'are a violation of the constitution, direct censorship and a ban on the trade of journalist.' In addition, she said, what the ministry is doing 'is nothing but ultimately killing the profession' — journalists in Kazakhstan frequently must supplement their regular income with work for outlets other than the news organizations to which they are accredited. 'Not only do these rules ban us from raising additional income, but also they deprive us of our job because just two violations of rules and regulations and you lose your accreditation for six months,' Vaal told VOA. Vaal said in her post that journalists write for several outlets because 'they want to have children, save up for home and live a life at the end of the day, but this is not possible, unfortunately, on just one wage.' Vaal and others VOA spoke to cite the constitutional provisions banning censorship and ensuring citizens’ rights to access information and to work. Ainur Koskina, another Astana freelance journalist, said she believes the requirement that journalists write for only their accredited outlets would hurt journalists working outside the current and former capitals of Astana and Almaty. 'They write for several outlets, and thanks to this, they can ensure a decent existence for themselves. This opportunity has now been taken away from them. I am afraid local journalism will go extinct, first of all, because of these accreditation rules,' Koskina told VOA. In a statement issued in July when the rules were put up for public discussion, the Almaty-based Adil Soz International Foundation for Freedom of Speech Protection said the new accreditation rules implied that information received from government bodies was not the public domain and was protected by copyright, so it should not be distributed to third parties. 'Adil Soz believes that the rules regulating the work of journalists and media should facilitate access to information, not complicate it,' the statement said. Karlygash Jamankulova, the head of Adil Soz, told VOA that media outlets and journalists — as employers and employees, respectively — could regulate their labor relations themselves and decide whether journalists could work for other outlets. She suggested that while the new rules were vague, it remains to be seen how they would be implemented and how they would affect journalists. 'This kind of issue cannot be disputed by public organizations,' she said. 'It should be journalists themselves who can take it to court, and if we will have this kind of journalist in Kazakhstan, we are ready to stand by [that journalist] and provide all required legal support.' The head of the Media Qoldau, or Support, legal service, Gulmira Birzhanova, cited what she believes is a recent tendency toward tightening media legislation in Kazakhstan. 'Accrediting organizations, which are state-owned companies along with government bodies, will establish their own rules and regulations, and I am afraid this could be used against journalists in the future,' Birzhanova told VOA. Vaal concluded: 'This is a very bad trend, and I don’t know what future holds for Kazakh journalists.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/kazakh-journalists-worry-as-new-media-rules-come-into-force/7802843.html	2024-09-28T05:43:04-07:00	
Nasrallah, who Israel says it has killed, led Hezbollah to become regional force	BEIRUT — Lebanon's Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who Israel said on Saturday it has killed, has led Hezbollah through decades of conflict with Israel, overseeing its transformation into a military force with regional sway and becoming one of the most prominent Arab figures in generations — with Iranian backing. The Iran-backed Hezbollah has yet to issue any statement on the status of Nasrallah, who has led the group for 32 years. The Israeli military said it killed Nasrallah in an airstrike on the group's central headquarters in the southern suburbs of Beirut a day earlier. The Israeli military 'eliminated ... Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Hezbollah terrorist organization,' Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee wrote in a statement on X. If the Israeli claim of his death is confirmed by Hezbollah, Nasrallah will be remembered among his supporters for standing up to Israel and defying the United States. To enemies, he has been the head of a terrorist organization and a proxy for Iran's Shi'ite Islamist theocracy in its tussle for influence in the Middle East. His regional influence has been on display over nearly a year of conflict ignited by the Gaza war, as Hezbollah entered the fray by firing on Israel from southern Lebanon in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas. Yemeni and Iraqi groups followed suit, operating under the umbrella of 'The Axis of Resistance.' 'We are facing a great battle,' Nasrallah said in an August 1 speech at the funeral of Hezbollah's top military commander, Fuad Shukr, who was killed in an Israeli strike on the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs of Beirut. Yet when thousands of Hezbollah members were injured and dozens killed as their communications devices exploded in an apparent Israeli attack last week, that battle began to turn against his group. Responding to the attacks on Hezbollah's communications network in a September 19 speech, Nasrallah vowed to punish Israel. 'This is a reckoning that will come, its nature, its size, how and where? This is certainly what we will keep to ourselves and in the narrowest circle even within ourselves,' he said. He has not given a broadcast address since then. Israel has meanwhile dramatically escalated its attacks, killing several senior Hezbollah commanders in targeted strikes and unleashing a massive bombardment in Hezbollah-controlled areas of Lebanon, which has killed hundreds of people. Recognized even by his enemies as a skilled orator, Nasrallah's speeches are followed by friend and foe alike. Wearing the black turban of a sayyed, or a descendent of the Prophet Mohammad, Nasrallah uses his addresses to rally Hezbollah's base but also to deliver carefully calibrated threats, often wagging his finger as he does so. He became secretary general of Hezbollah in 1992 at age 35, the public face of a once shadowy group founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to fight Israeli occupation forces. Israel killed his predecessor, Sayyed Abbas al-Musawi, in a helicopter attack. Nasrallah led Hezbollah when its guerrillas finally drove Israeli forces from southern Lebanon in 2000, ending an 18-year occupation. 'Divine victory' Conflict with Israel has largely defined his leadership. He declared 'divine victory' in 2006 after Hezbollah waged 34 days of war with Israel, winning the respect of many ordinary Arabs who had grown up watching Israel defeat their armies. But he became an increasingly divisive figure in Lebanon and the wider Arab world as Hezbollah's area of operations widened to Syria and beyond, reflecting an intensifying conflict between Shi'ite Iran and U.S.-allied Sunni Arab monarchies in the Gulf. While Nasrallah painted Hezbollah's engagement in Syria — where it fought in support of President Bashar al-Assad during the civil war — as a campaign against jihadists, critics accused the group of becoming part of a regional sectarian conflict. At home, Nasrallah's critics said Hezbollah's regional adventurism imposed an unbearable price on Lebanon, leading once friendly Gulf Arabs to shun the country — a factor that contributed to its 2019 financial collapse. In the years following the 2006 war, Nasrallah walked a tightrope over a new conflict with Israel, hoarding Iranian rockets in a carefully measured contest of threat and counterthreat. The Gaza war, ignited by the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, prompted Hezbollah's worst conflict with Israel since 2006, costing the group hundreds of its fighters, including top commanders. After years of entanglements elsewhere, the conflict put renewed focus on Hezbollah's historic struggle with Israel. 'We are here paying the price for our front of support for Gaza, and for the Palestinian people, and our adoption of the Palestinian cause,' Nasrallah said in the August 1 speech. Nasrallah grew up in Beirut's impoverished Karantina district. His family hails from Bazouriyeh, a village in the Lebanon's predominantly Shi'ite south, which today forms Hezbollah's political heartland. He was part of a generation of young Lebanese Shi'ites whose political outlook was shaped by Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. Before leading the group, he used to spend nights with frontline guerrillas fighting Israel's occupying army. His teenage son, Hadi, died in battle in 1997, a loss that gave him legitimacy among his core Shi'ite constituency in Lebanon. Powerful enemies He has had a track record of threatening powerful enemies. As regional tensions escalated after the eruption of the Gaza war, Nasrallah issued a thinly veiled warning to U.S. warships in the Mediterranean, telling them: 'We have prepared for the fleets with which you threaten us.' In 2020, Nasrallah vowed that U.S. soldiers would leave the region in coffins after a U.S. drone strike in Iraq killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. He expressed fierce opposition to Saudi Arabia over its armed intervention in Yemen, where, with U.S. and other allied support, Riyadh sought to roll back the Iran-aligned Houthis. As regional tensions rose in 2019 following an attack on Saudi oil facilities, he said Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates should halt the Yemen war to protect themselves. 'Don’t bet on a war against Iran because they will destroy you,' he said in a message directed at Riyadh. On Nasrallah's watch, Hezbollah has also clashed with adversaries at home in Lebanon. In 2008, he accused the Lebanese government — backed at the time by the West and Saudi Arabia — of declaring war by moving to ban his group's internal communication network. Nasrallah vowed to 'cut off the hand' that tried to dismantle it. It prompted four days of civil war pitting Hezbollah against Sunni and Druze fighters. The Shi'ite group took over half the capital, Beirut. He strongly denied any Hezbollah involvement in the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, after a U.N.-backed tribunal indicted four members of the group. Nasrallah rejected the tribunal — which in 2020 eventually convicted three of them in absentia over the assassination — as a tool in the hands of Hezbollah's enemies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nasrallah-who-israel-says-it-has-killed-led-hezbollah-to-become-regional-force/7802798.html	2024-09-28T03:52:43-07:00	
China calls for stable Japan relations after Ishiba election victory	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China has urged Japan to maintain a 'healthy and stable' relationship with Beijing after former Japanese Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba won the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leadership race Friday. Ishiba is set to become Japan’s next prime minister when Japanese lawmakers convene on October 1. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters Friday that the 'sustained, sound and steady' development of China-Japan relations is in both countries’ interests, characterizing the path as 'the only right choice.' China, he said, hopes Japan will 'have an objective and right perception of China, take an active and rational China policy, take concrete efforts to comprehensively advance the strategic relationship of mutual benefit, and work with China to promote the sustained, sound and steady development' of bilateral relations. Beijing’s remarks come amid rising tension between China and Japan. China has increased the frequency of its military activities in waters and airspace near Japan in recent weeks, sailing its aircraft carrier Liaoning through the 'contiguous zone' near Japan’s westernmost island of Yonaguni on September 18 and conducting large-scale military exercises near the Sea of Japan. Meanwhile, a Japanese battleship sailed through the Taiwan Strait for the first time Wednesday, prompting Beijing to reiterate its strong opposition to such 'freedom of navigation' operations. Japan also expressed concern after China test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean for the first time in 40 years Wednesday. The Japanese government said Beijing did not notify it before the missile test and described China’s increasing military activity in the region as 'a serious concern.' Analysts say the Chinese Foreign Ministry statement shows Beijing remains cautious about Ishiba’s stance on relations with China. 'Beijing is very cautious and concerned about Ishiba’s stance because he has been very assertive and hardline about Japan’s security policy,' Kyoko Hatakeyama, an international relations professor at the University of Niigata Prefecture, said in a phone interview with VOA. Before Friday’s leadership election, Ishiba proposed the creation of an 'Asian NATO,' which he said could pave the way for a nuclear-sharing arrangement among like-minded countries or a return of U.S. nuclear tactical weapons to the Indo-Pacific region. During a live debate held by Japan’s Fuji News Network on September 22, Ishiba said it is time to allow Japan’s Self-Defense Forces to fire warning shots at foreign forces intruding Japan’s territorial airspaces and waters. Hatakeyama said Ishiba would likely continue to deepen Japan’s defense and security relationship with like-minded democracies, including the United States, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines. Unlike outgoing Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, she said, Ishiba wants Japan to have more autonomy in shaping its security policies. 'He thinks it’s not good for Japan to follow Washington’s lead and he believes Japan should become more independent in working with other like-minded countries in the region,' Hatakeyama told VOA by phone. Some Chinese analysts say Beijing should keep an eye on Ishiba’s policies toward China, based on his previous remarks and proposals. 'China needs to stay alert to Ishiba as he reportedly had called for creation of an 'Asian NATO' by combining the U.S.-Japan alliance and U.S.-South Korea alliance,' Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at China’s Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told China’s state-run tabloid Global Times. Xiang Haoyu, a research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told Global Times he expects Japan to keep using 'the Taiwan question' and its alignment with the U.S. to 'contain China.' While Ishiba will likely uphold Japan’s current defense and security policies, some experts say he may also seek to adjust Tokyo’s overall policies toward China. 'In his recently released book, Ishiba said some members of the Japanese government play up the idea of the China threat and the need for more military without really explaining them to the Japanese people,' Jeffrey Hall, an expert on Japan studies at Kanda University of International Studies. He said while Ishiba has highlighted the need for Japan to maintain deterrence against China, the incoming Japanese prime minister will try to put less emphasis on threats by China to help Japan avoid 'a security dilemma.' 'He has many big ideas about it, but in the next year, he will continue foreign policy as it was under Kishida,' Hall told VOA in a video interview. While Ishiba may seek to adjust Japan’s policies toward China, Hall said he will also continue Tokyo’s approach of maintaining close relations with Taiwan, as it did under Kishida and deceased former prime minister Shinzo Abe. 'Ishiba’s visit to Taiwan in August was strategically timed because he wanted to show conservatives in Japan that he would stand with Taiwan if he becomes prime minister,' he told VOA, adding that Ishiba will not sacrifice commitment to Taiwan for the sake of friendlier relations with China. Despite the heightened tension between Japan and China, caused mainly by Beijing’s military actions and the death of a 10-year-old Japanese boy in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, Hatakeyama said Tokyo and Beijing will both try to play a balancing act in managing bilateral relations in the near future. 'China has recently agreed to gradually resume imports of Japanese seafood and Japan’s Cabinet Office didn’t declare the Japanese warship’s passage through the Taiwan Strait, which signals that Tokyo and Beijing both want to prevent bilateral tensions from further escalating,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-calls-for-stable-japan-relations-after-ishiba-election-victory/7802773.html	2024-09-28T02:43:15-07:00	
Landslide leaves 12 dead, 2 missing at illegal gold mine in Indonesia	SUNGAI ABU, Indonesia — Mud, rugged terrain and lack of telecommunications hampered rescue efforts Saturday after a landslide set off by torrential rains smashed down into an unauthorized gold mining operation on Indonesia's Sumatra Island, killing at least 12 people. Villagers had been digging for grains of gold in the remote village in the Solok district of West Sumatra province when mud plunged down the surrounding hills and buried them on Thursday. Several people managed to escape and some were pulled out by rescuers, said local search and rescue agency chief Abdul Malik. Eleven people were injured. Malik said rescuers recovered 12 bodies, revising an earlier death toll of 15 after officials discovered that lack of communications and the remoteness of the village had affected the counting of the victims. Two other people are believed still missing under tons of mud, he said. Rescuers earlier said the devastated area could only be reached by walking for four hours from the nearest settlement. 'Relief efforts for the dead and missing were hampered by rugged terrain and blocked roads covered by thick mud and debris,' Malik said, adding that many residents also did not want outsiders, including search and rescue officers, to enter their traditional mining areas. Informal mining operations are common in Indonesia, providing a tenuous livelihood to thousands who labor in conditions with a high risk of serious injury or death. Landslides, flooding and collapses of tunnels are just some of the hazards facing miners. Much of gold ore processing involves highly toxic mercury and cyanide and workers frequently use little or no protection. The country's last major mining-related accident occurred in July when a landslide crashed onto an illegal traditional gold mine in Gorontalo province on Sulawesi island, killing at least 23 people. In April 2022 a landslide hit another gold mine in North Sumatra's Mandailing Natal district, killing 12 women. In February 2019, a makeshift wooden structure in an illegal gold mine in North Sulawesi province collapsed partly due to shifting soil. More than 40 people were buried.	https://www.voanews.com/a/landslide-leaves-12-dead-2-missing-at-illegal-gold-mine-in-indonesia-/7802754.html	2024-09-28T01:04:14-07:00	
Case of Mexico's 43 missing students persists 10 years later	MEXICO CITY — All countries have crimes that resonate. In Mexico, one of the modern day ones is the disappearance of 43 students from a rural teachers college in 2014. Ten years later, it's still not clear where the students from the Rural Normal School at Ayotzinapa are. Authorities believe they were killed but have only turned up small bone fragments from three of them. The families, with the support of the school known for its radical activism, continue to demand justice. They maintain a lack of political will is responsible for not finding the truth. If it was a 'state crime' as the current administration says, the government must know what happened and who is hiding information. The families marked the painful anniversary Thursday, disillusioned after what they say was a decade of unfulfilled government promises. Thousands marched with the families in the rain through Mexico's capital, demanding the truth about what happened and justice for the missing. 'The first time we came through here, who could have imagined that all of this time would pass and (we're) here again without answers,' said Margarito Guerrero, the father of missing student Jhosivani Guerrero de la Cruz. Why is the case still alive? In a country with more than 115,000 registered disappearances, this case continues to hold the public's attention because it combined cartel violence and corrupt authorities and remains stubbornly unresolved. It's considered an emblematic case and another example of abuses that occurred decades ago in Mexico's dirty war and were never corrected. What happened on September 26? The students were attacked by security forces linked to a local drug gang, Guerreros Unidos, in Iguala, when the students were stealing buses to transport themselves to a protest. During the administration of Enrique Peña Nieto (2012-18), authorities said the students had gone to Iguala, Guerrero to protest at an event — the mayor, now jailed, was linked to local gang Guerreros Unidos. They were allegedly mistaken for members of a rival gang. The Peña Nieto administration said that Guerreros Unidos had abducted and killed the students, burned their bodies in a huge fire and tossed their ashes into a river. But investigations by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the successor Attorney General's Office and a Truth Commission created in 2019, found that the fire at a dump was a lie built on false statements extracted under torture and manipulated evidence. Those subsequent investigations found that an enormous operation was put in motion that night involving members of Guerreros Unidos, but also local, state and federal police. And the army was aware of everything that was happening because it had a base in Iguala, soldiers in the streets and spies among the students. Investigators said members of the army were involved with the gang in smuggling heroin from the mountains of Guerrero on buses to the United States. Prosecutors said the decision to hide the truth was taken at the highest levels of government. Has anyone been held accountable? There are more than 100 people in custody and dozens have been charged, but no one has been convicted. At the end of the previous administration, Mexican courts determined that the investigation was plagued by errors and manipulation. There were dozens of cases of torture. Those abuses and missteps led to many of those involved being released. Some have been arrested again under the current administration. The highest-ranking person charged is former Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam, who is accused of torture, forced disappearance and obstruction of justice. There are also 16 soldiers, most of whom are awaiting trial on house arrest, which infuriates the students' families. When did attitudes shift on the current administration? López Obrador had promised to find the students and hold those responsible accountable. But in 2022, when more and more evidence pointed toward the military's involvement in the attack and cover-up the administration's tone changed. The president had ordered the military to open its archives to investigators. That didn't happen. Instead, López Obrador shifted more power and responsibility to the military than any president in recent history. The prosecutor leading the investigation, Omar García Trejo, was suddenly demoted after he sought arrest orders for two dozen soldiers. He was replaced by someone unfamiliar with the case. There was also growing political pressure to show results, said Santiago Aguirre, one of the families' lawyers. The administration presented some evidence that did not appear to come from reliable sources and the government's searches turned slipshod. Where do the families want the investigation to go? Their lawyers point out key arrests are still lacking, among them the man who led the investigation during the Peña Nieto administration, Tomás Zerón. In videos, Zerón is seen interrogating and threatening prisoners. He sought refuge in Israel, which has not agreed to extradite him despite Mexico's request. They also say they want to see military intelligence records from that night that they still haven't had access to. They want too more cooperation from the United States government, which has prosecuted members of Guerreros Unidos in drug trafficking cases that also revealed their ties to the military.	https://www.voanews.com/a/case-of-mexico-s-43-missing-students-persists-10-years-later/7799872.html	2024-09-28T00:05:26-07:00	
Glock pistols popular among US criminals because they're easily modified, report says	BALTIMORE — Glock pistols are a popular choice for people committing gun crimes, in part because they can be easily converted into fully automatic weapons using a small device, according to a new report based on data from nearly three dozen U.S. cities. Often called Glock switches or auto sears, the devices have received heightened attention in recent years because they're increasingly turning up at crime scenes. They effectively turn semiautomatic weapons, which fire one bullet per trigger pull, into machine guns that can spray continuous gunfire. Authorities believe the shooters who killed four people and injured 17 others in Birmingham, Alabama, last weekend were using conversion devices to make their guns more powerful. About 100 shell casings were recovered from the scene. A report by the anti-violence organization Everytown for Gun Safety says criminals often choose Glocks because they're relatively cheap and easy to operate and modify. But the brand is perhaps best known for its popularity among law enforcement officers, who almost exclusively carry Glock handguns. The report was released this week ahead of a conference Thursday in Baltimore hosted by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group that falls under Everytown's umbrella. The organization called on Glock and other weapons manufacturers to take responsibility for their products and do more to prevent violence. 'We have to build that level of accountability for them as well,' Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said in an interview. 'At some point, as a country, the sanctity of the lives of Americans has to begin to outweigh the sanctity of American guns.' A spokesperson for Glock didn't respond to an email seeking comment. Scott and other mayors said while local elected officials are often at the forefront of pushing for better gun policies, Congress must also step up and address the issue. Researchers found that four gun manufacturers accounted for more than 40% of the recovered guns they studied, with Glock alone accounting for 18%. The team compiled data from 34 U.S. cities about guns recovered from crime scenes in 2023. 'They're basically profiting off of pain,' said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown. 'They're prioritizing profits over safety.' Meanwhile, the prevalence of machine gun conversion devices has increased dramatically — 570% between 2017 and 2021, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The devices are banned under federal law. Most are small pieces of metal or plastic made with a 3D printer or ordered online. The report also found that recoveries of Polymer80 ghost guns — untraceable, unassembled firearms that can be purchased online — increased nearly 1,200% across 28 cities over the past five years. Those numbers have started trending downward following the implementation of a new federal rule and a wave of state legislation banning the weapons, according to the report. Polymer80, once a leading manufacturer of ghost guns in the U.S., also shut down operations last month after a deluge of lawsuits. The city of Baltimore was among those who filed suit. City officials announced a settlement agreement in February after the Nevada-based company agreed to stop selling its products to Maryland residents. The city's lawsuit accused Polymer80 of intentionally undermining federal and state firearms laws by designing, manufacturing and providing gun assembly kits without serial numbers to buyers who don't undergo background checks. It was filed the same day Maryland's statewide ban on ghost guns went into effect in 2022 following a law change that expanded the definition of a firearm to include 'an unfinished frame or receiver.' A year later, recoveries of ghost guns in Baltimore had dropped 25%, according to the report. Gun violence has also decreased significantly in the city over roughly the past two years, a positive trend that experts and officials attribute to a wide range of factors, including expanded anti-violence programs and ongoing police reform. Violence is trending downward nationally as well following a sharp spike during the COVID-19 pandemic. The report suggests several actions that manufacturers could take to keep their firearms out of the hands of criminals, including through increased oversight of the gun dealers they work with. Manufacturers could also focus on producing safer weapons that aren't easily modified and fund advertising campaigns to increase public awareness of gun safety. 'I think common sense can get through to people. I think wanting to save the lives of our children can get through to people,' said Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas. 'Manufacturers could do things tomorrow that would make guns safer and save lives.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/glock-pistols-popular-among-us-criminals-because-they-re-easily-modified-report-says-/7802670.html	2024-09-28T00:04:43-07:00	
Probe finds Beijing seeking to mislead, sow distrust ahead of US election	washington — U.S. intelligence agencies this week emphasized that Russia, Iran and China remain the primary external forces attempting to influence American voters ahead of the November presidential election. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence reported that the Kremlin is the most active player, using artificial intelligence, fake accounts and fabricated images to promote narratives favorable to Donald Trump’s candidacy. In contrast, China has not sought to directly influence the outcome of the 2024 presidential race. Sarah Cook, an independent analyst specializing in disinformation, noted that this restraint stems partly from a strong bipartisan consensus in Washington regarding the threat posed by China's authoritarian government. With less than 40 days remaining until the U.S. elections, what narratives is China promoting on social media, and how might these affect American voters? Amplifying polarization A joint investigation by Voice of America and the Doublethink Lab, a Taiwanese social media analytics firm, is tracking 201 China-related accounts on the social media platform X. One of the main themes of these accounts is amplifying controversial domestic issues in the United States, aiming to deepen societal polarization and sow distrust. Through both genuine and AI-generated images and videos, Chinese operatives are intensifying divisive social issues, including LGBTQ+ rights, abortion, immigration, race, gun control and crime rates. One prominent account, CongCong, frequently originates posts that are then shared by others, describing herself as 'a sweet and salty little girl who takes life seriously and shares positive energy.' However, her posts are far from positive. One pinned post features a provocative image of a gun pointed at Gaza, captioned with claims of genocide, depicting Israel as the gunman, the U.S. as the weapon, and the EU as the silencer. The post was amplified by 40 accounts in the network of China-related accounts VOA is tracking. Another so-called seeder account, Little Sister Muxi, shared a comparative graphic highlighting the burdens faced by Americans, such as student loans and health care costs, versus the benefits enjoyed by Israelis. The Israel-Gaza conflict has become a sharply polarizing issue in the U.S. Some Americans support Israel's right to self-defense, while others express strong discontent with what they see as excessive violence. Recently, the network has sought to amplify discussions surrounding Intel's announcement of a 15% workforce reduction, with seeder account CongCong asserting, 'This is the decline of the United States, a recession created by the United States itself.' This message was shared by 36 accounts. Other examples include sharing cartoons from China’s state-owned Global Times that mock the U.S. for its financial support of Ukraine. AI-generated images depict homeless Americans, implying that U.S. citizens are neglected while the government spends billions on overseas conflicts. Fake videos illustrating America's drug epidemic are also common, pushed by the Spamouflage network — a much larger state-sponsored operation aimed at supporting the Chinese government while undermining critics. This approach mirrors Russia's tactics during the 2016 U.S. elections, employing information warfare to fracture Western alliances and deepen societal divisions. MAGAflage Our investigation has uncovered two 'MAGAflage' networks consisting of a total of 25 accounts posing as supporters of Republican candidate Trump, seeking to engage with real American voters. One network, labeled MAGAflage 1 and consisting of 10 accounts, began sharing pro-Trump content extensively following a July 13 assassination attempt. Using stolen bios and sourced photos, these accounts focused on pro-China content and polarizing U.S. issues while promoting Trump as the savior of America. After VOA’s report, X suspended these accounts for 'violating X’s rules.' Whereas the seeder account in the MAGAflage 1 network aggressively posted pro-China content and frequently cited state media outlets, the seeder of MAGAflage 2 takes a more careful approach. Apart from a few exceptions, this person rarely posts about topics directly related to China and stays closer to U.S. election topics. All accounts use emoticons in their usernames. Twelve of the 15 accounts use the American flag as one of the emoticons. They criticize the Biden administration’s immigration policy, promote conspiracy theories and claim that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is responsible for the January 6 Capitol riot. 'These accounts are noteworthy because they go to a great extent to pretend to be American citizens and tried to hide their connection to China,' Jasper Hewitt, a digital intelligence analyst at Doublethink Lab, told VOA Mandarin. Notably, these accounts do not promote anti-Israel content that other trolls frequently share. Trump recently touted himself as Israel’s 'protector,' warning Jewish voters against supporting Vice President Kamala Harris. 'I think this shows that the people behind these operations have a good understanding of the type of content that might resonate with the users they are trying to interact with,' Hewitt added. Meanwhile, researchers continue to uncover accounts attacking candidates from both parties. Microsoft recently reported a Chinese-linked threat actor, Storm-1852, which has engaged with election-related content on social media, emphasizing a highly interactive approach that includes reposting content, replying to comments and polling users. This network does not appear to favor any specific candidate. 'It is true that most of the Spamouflage content we have seen so far expresses criticism for both candidates. However, the fact that we found two MAGAflage networks and have not yet encountered any similar accounts that support Harris is still very relevant,' Hewitt from Doublethink Lab added. Local candidates In their latest assessment, the U.S. intelligence officials have said most Chinese efforts are aimed not at Trump or Harris, but at state and local candidates perceived as hostile to Beijing. Our investigation identified a TikTok video criticizing Republican U.S. Senator Josh Hawley, mocking his persistent questioning of Intel executives about forced labor in Xinjiang and labeling him an 'anti-China senator.' Hawley is up for re-election this year. Another video ridicules Democratic U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler from New York, suggesting he appeared to doze off during a hearing while victims' families testified. Alongside the presidential election, all 435 House seats and 33 Senate seats will be contested this year. Lawmakers critical of China are likely to become targets of online influence campaigns. These include members of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, or CECC. Its chair, Massachusetts Representative Jim McGovern, has been outspoken about human rights abuses in China and was barred from entry to China this past July. New Jersey Republican Representative Chris Smith, co-chair of the commission, has long focused on human rights and religious freedom in China. In the Senate, Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown is seeking re-election this year and has faced attacks from Chinese state media for advocating a ban on Chinese-made electric vehicles.	https://www.voanews.com/a/probe-finds-beijing-seeking-to-mislead-sow-distrust-ahead-of-us-election/7802653.html	2024-09-28T00:04:02-07:00	
Cambodia’s new canal could boost trade but risks harming key river	PREK TAKEO, Cambodia — The Mekong River is a lifeline for millions in the six countries it traverses on its way from its headwaters to the sea, sustaining the world's largest inland fishery and abundant rice paddies on Vietnam's Mekong Delta. Cambodia's plan to build a massive canal linking the Mekong to a port on on its own coast on the Gulf of Thailand is raising alarm that the project could devastate the river's natural flood systems, worsening droughts and depriving farmers on the delta of the nutrient-rich silt that has made Vietnam the world's third-largest rice exporter. Cambodia hopes that the $1.7 billion Funan Techo canal, being built with Chinese help, will support its ambition to export directly from factories along the Mekong without relying on Vietnam, connecting the capital Phnom Penh with Kep province on Cambodia's southern coast. At an August 5 groundbreaking ceremony, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said the canal will be built 'no matter what the cost.' By reducing costs of shipping to Cambodia's only deep-sea port, at Sihanoukville, the canal will promote, 'national prestige, the territorial integrity and the development of Cambodia,' he said. Along with those promises comes peril. Here is a closer look. The threat to the Mekong The Mekong River flows from China through Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. It supports a fishery that accounts for 15% of the global inland catch, worth more than $11 billion annually, according to the nonprofit World Wildlife Fund. Flooding during the wet season makes the Mekong Delta one of the world's most productive farm regions. The river already has been disrupted by dams built upstream in Laos and China that restrict the amount of water flowing downstream, while rising seas are gnawing away at the southern edges of the climate-vulnerable Mekong Delta. Brian Eyler, director of the Washington-based Stimson Center's Southeast Asia Program, warns that high embankments along the 100-meter-wide, 5.4-meter-deep canal will prevent silt-laden floodwater from flowing downstream to Vietnam. That could worsen drought in Vietnam's rice bowl and Cambodia's floodplains, an area stretching over roughly 1,300-square kilometers. The view from Vietnam's rice bowl A drier Mekong Delta is a concern for Vietnam's agricultural sector, which powers 12% of its economy. The southwestern provinces of An Giang and Kien Giang would likely be most impacted. The delta's latticework of rivers crisscrossing green fields is vital for Vietnam's own plans of growing 'high quality, low emission rice' on 1 million hectares of farmland by 2030. The aim is to cut earth-warming greenhouse gases, lower production costs and increase farmers' profits. Water from the river is 'essential' not just for Vietnam's more than 100 million people but also for global food security, said Nguyen Van Nhut, director of rice export company Hoang Minh Nhat. Vietnam's exports of 8.3 million metric tons of rice in 2023 accounted for 15% of global exports. Most was grown in the Mekong Delta. The amount of silt being deposited by the river has already dropped and further disruptions will worsen salinity in the area, hurting farming, Nhat said. 'This will be a major concern for the agriculture sector of the Mekong delta,' he said. Cambodia's view Cambodia says the canal is a 'tributary project' that will connect to the Bassac River near Phnom Penh. President Hun Sen claimed on social media platform X that this means there would be 'no impact on the flow of the Mekong River.' But blueprints show the canal will connect to the Mekong's mainstream and in any case the Bassac consists entirely of water from the Mekong, Eyler said. Cambodian authorities are downplaying the potential environmental impacts of the project. 'This is their logic-defying basis for justifying no impact to the Mekong River,' he said. A document submitted in August 2023 to the Mekong River Commission — an organization formed for cooperation on issues regarding the Mekong — does not mention using water from the canal for irrigation, though Cambodia has since said it plans to do so. The Stimson Center added it was 'logical' that irrigation would be needed during dry months, but that would require negotiating an agreement with the other Mekong countries. The Mekong River Commission told The Associated Press all major projects on the Mekong River 'should be assessed for their potential transboundary impacts.' It said it was providing technical support to 'increase transparency and cooperation among concerned countries.' Sun Chanthol, the Cambodian deputy prime minister who oversees the project, didn't respond to a request for comments. Nationalistic rhetoric and tense neighbors Cambodia has rejected criticism of the canal, which is widely seen as an effort by the country's ruling elite to curry support for Prime Minister Hun Manet, who succeeded his father Hun Sen, who led Cambodia for 38 years. The canal is to be built jointly by Chinese state-owned construction giant China Road and Bridge Corporation and Cambodian companies. But it is enveloped in nationalistic rhetoric. The canal would provide Cambodia a 'nose to breathe through' by reducing its dependence on Vietnam, Hun Sen has said. Vietnam has avoided openly criticizing its neighbor, instead communicating its concerns quietly. Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pham Thu Hang said at a press conference in May that Hanoi had asked Cambodia to share information and assess the environmental impacts of the project to 'ensure the harmony of interests' of Mekong countries. Many Cambodians remain suspicious of Vietnam's intentions, believing it may want to annex Cambodian territory. Given the contentious past between the two countries, bigger and richer Vietnam is taking care not to appear to be impinging on Cambodian sovereignty, said Nguyen Khac Giang, an analyst at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. 'Although in Vietnam, there are big concerns,' he said. Lost in Cambodia's nationalistic rhetoric are the concerns of people like Sok Koeun, 57, who may lose her home. The tin-roofed cottage where she has lived with her family since 1980 is right where the canal is due to be built. The river provides her with fish to feed her family when she struggles to get by selling sugarcane juice and recycling plastic cans. No one has been in touch, she says, to answer her mounting questions: Will she get compensated? Will she get land? Or cash? Where will they go? 'I only learned about it (the canal) just now,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodia-s-new-canal-could-boost-trade-but-risks-harming-key-river/7801366.html	2024-09-28T00:02:57-07:00

Rhino numbers are up a bit, but poaching has increased, too	NAIROBI, Kenya — The rhino population around the world has increased slightly but so have the killings, mostly in South Africa, as poaching fed by huge demand for rhino horns remains a top threat, conservationists said in a recent report. The number of white rhinos increased from 15,942 in 2022 to 17,464 in 2023, but numbers of the black and greater one-horned rhino stayed the same, according to the report published by the International Rhino Foundation ahead of World Rhino Day, observed each year on September 22. Another subspecies, the northern white rhino, is technically extinct with only two females being kept in a secure private conservancy in Kenya, known as Ol Pejeta. A trial is ongoing to develop embryos in the lab from an egg and sperm previously collected from white rhinos for transferring into a surrogate female black rhino. A total of 586 rhinos were killed in Africa in 2023, most of them in South Africa — which has the highest population of rhinos at an estimated 16,056. The killings increased from 551 reported in 2022, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. With all five subspecies combined, there are just under 28,000 rhinos left in the world, from 500,000 at the beginning of the 20th century. Poaching is top threat Rhinos face various environmental threats like habitat loss due to development and climate change, but poaching, based on the belief that their horns have medicinal uses, remains the top threat. Philip Muruthi, the vice president for species conservation at the Africa Wildlife Foundation, said protection has played a big role in increasing rhino population. In Kenya, their numbers rose from 380 in 1986 to 1,000 last year, he said. 'Why has that happened? Because the rhinos were brought into sanctuaries and were protected.' Muruthi advocates for a campaign that will end the demand for rhino horn as well as adoption of new technology in tracking and monitoring rhinos for their protection while also educating communities where they live on the benefits of rhinos to the ecosystem and the economy. Known as mega herbivores that mow the parks and create inroads for other herbivores, rhinos are also good for establishing forests by ingesting seeds and spreading them across the parks in their dung. Murithi lamented that the northern white rhino should have never gotten so close to the brink of extinction. 'Don't get the numbers to where it's very expensive to recover and we are not even sure that it will happen,' he said. The body of the last male northern white rhino – named Sudan – that died in 2018 has been preserved and displayed at the Museums of Kenya in Nairobi. A research scientist and curator of mammals at the museum, Bernard Agwanda, said preserving Sudan will tell the story of how the species lived among humans and why conservation is important. 'So we expect that the northern white rhino behind us here is going to live for one or two centuries to be able to tell its story for generations to come,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rhino-numbers-are-up-a-bit-but-poaching-has-increased-too/7801316.html	2024-09-28T00:01:39-07:00	
The price of gold keeps climbing to unprecedented heights. Here's why	NEW YORK — The rush for gold just keeps coming. Gold hit another all-time high this week. Recent gains for the precious metal are largely credited to ongoing economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and strong demand from central banks around the world. If trends continue, analysts have bullish outlooks on the price of gold for the months ahead. But the future is never promised. Here's what you need to know. Where does the price of gold stand today? The New York spot price of gold closed Tuesday at just over $2,657 per Troy ounce — the standard for measuring precious metals, which is equivalent to 31 grams — the highest recorded to date, per FactSet. That would make a gold bar or brick weighing 400 Troy ounces worth more than $1.06 million today. This week's record high means that the price of gold has climbed hundreds of dollars per Troy ounce over the last year. Tuesday's price is up nearly $145 from a month ago and more than $740 from this time in 2023. The price of gold is up nearly 30% year to date, analysts note — outpacing the benchmark S&P 500's roughly 20% gain since the start of 2024. Why is the price of gold going up? There are a few factors behind the recent gains. Interest in buying gold often comes at times of uncertainty — with potential concerns around inflation and the strength of the U.S. dollar, for example, causing some to look for alternative places to park their money. Gold also surged in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among sources of uncertainty today are geopolitical tensions — which escalated over recent days with Israel's deadly strikes in Lebanon. And the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine have continued to fuel fears about the future worldwide. In markets like the U.S., there's also particular concern about the health of the job market. Last week's larger-than-usual half-point cut by the Federal Reserve signals a new focus on slowing employment numbers, and more rate cuts are expected before the end of the year. And such action arrives in the midst of a tumultuous election year — which could prove crucial to economic policy in the road ahead, too. In the near future, people are considering 'any case of turbulence in the economy,' FxPro senior market analyst Michel Saliby explained. 'This is why they're keeping a decent portion of gold in their portfolio as a 'safe haven.'' Analysts also point to strong demand from central banks around the world. Joe Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, noted last month that central bank demand was well-above the five year average — reflecting 'heightened concern with inflation and economic stability.' Recent stimulus measures in China aimed at boosting consumer spending are also expected to up retail investments, Saliby added, further boosting gold's performance. Is gold worth the investment? Advocates of investing in gold call it a 'safe haven,' arguing the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time. Experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket. Both retail and institutional investors shouldn't be influenced by the 'FOMO effect,' or fear of missing out, Saliby notes — explaining that people should not risk all their money just because they are seeing others rake in gains. He advises investors to watch the market and always have a clear risk management strategy for their position. If geopolitical tensions cool, Saliby expects the price of gold to correct slightly, perhaps falling around $50 to $80. But he remains bullish overall for the near future — expecting gold's spot price to soon surpass the $2,700 mark previously predicted for 2025, and perhaps reach as high as $2,800 or $2,900 if trends continue. Still, future gains are never promised and not everyone agrees gold is a good investment. Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many say it is — and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as through derivative-based investments. The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, the commission said, and prices rise as demand goes up — meaning 'when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers.' If you do choose to invest in gold, the commission adds, it's important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits on the market.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-price-of-gold-keeps-climbing-to-unprecedented-heights-here-s-why/7799908.html	2024-09-28T00:00:18-07:00

Israeli airstrikes rock Beirut; Hezbollah command center hit	BEIRUT/JERUSALEM — A wave of air raids hit Beirut's southern suburbs early Saturday as Israel stepped up attacks on Hezbollah, after a massive strike on the Iran-backed movement's command center that apparently targeted leader Hassan Nasrallah. Reuters witnesses heard more than 20 airstrikes before dawn on Saturday. Abandoning their homes in the southern suburbs, thousands of Lebanese congregated in squares, parks and sidewalks in downtown Beirut and seaside areas. 'They want to destroy Dahiye, they want to destroy all of us,' said Sari, a man in his 30s who gave only his first name, referring to the suburb he had fled after an Israeli evacuation order. Nearby, the newly displaced in Beirut's Martyrs Square rolled mats onto the ground to tried to sleep. Israel's military said early Saturday that about 10 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory and that 'some' had been intercepted. A statement from the military did not identify the projectiles, which it said were detected after sirens sounded in the Upper Galilee area. An unprecedented five hours of continuous strikes early Saturday followed Friday's attack, by far the most powerful by Israel on Beirut during nearly a year of war with Hezbollah. It marked a sharp escalation of a conflict that has involved daily missile and rocket fire between the two sides. The latest escalation has sharply increased fears the conflict could spiral out of control, potentially drawing in Iran, Hezbollah's principal backer, as well as the United States. There was no immediate confirmation of Nasrallah's fate after Friday's heavy strikes, but a source close to Hezbollah told Reuters he was not reachable. The Lebanese armed group has not made a statement. Israel has not said whether it tried to hit Nasrallah, but a senior Israeli official said top Hezbollah commanders were targeted. 'I think it's too early to say... Sometimes they hide the fact when we succeed,' the Israeli official told reporters when asked if the strike Friday had killed Nasrallah. Earlier, a source close to Hezbollah told Reuters that Nasrallah was alive. Iran's Tasnim news agency also reported he was safe. A senior Iranian security official told Reuters that Tehran was checking his status. The Israeli military said in a statement that it had killed the commander of Hezbollah's missile unit, Muhammad Ali Ismail, and his deputy Hossein Ahmed Ismail. Death toll rises Hours before the latest barrage, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the United Nations that his country had a right to continue the campaign. 'As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice, and Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their homes safely,' he said. Several delegations walked out as Netanyahu approached the lectern. He later cut short his New York trip to return to Israel. Lebanese health authorities confirmed six dead and 91 wounded in the initial attack on Friday -- the fourth on Beirut's Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs in a week and the heaviest since a 2006 war. The toll appeared likely to rise much higher. There was no word on casualties from the later strikes. More than 700 people were killed in strikes over the past week, authorities said. Hezbollah's al-Manar television reported seven buildings were destroyed. Security sources in Lebanon said the target was an area where top Hezbollah officials are usually based. Hours later, the Israeli military told residents in parts of Beirut's southern suburbs to evacuate as it targeted missile launchers and weapons storage sites it said were under civilian housing. Hezbollah denied any weapons or arms depots were located in buildings that were hit in the Beirut suburbs, the Lebanese armed group's media office said in a statement. Alaa al-Din Saeed, a resident of a neighborhood Israel identified as a target, told Reuters he was fleeing with his wife and three children. 'We found out on the television. There was a huge commotion in the neighborhood,' he said. The family grabbed clothes, identification papers and some cash but were stuck in traffic with others trying to flee. 'We're going to the mountains. We'll see how to spend the night -- and tomorrow we'll see what we can do.' Around 100,000 people in Lebanon have been displaced this week, increasing the number uprooted in the country to well over 200,000. Israel's government has said that returning some 70,000 Israeli evacuees to their homes is a war aim. Fear the fighting will spread Hezbollah has fired hundreds of rockets and missiles against targets in Israel, including Tel Aviv. The group said it fired rockets on Friday at the northern Israeli city of Safed, where a woman was treated for minor injuries. Israel's air defense systems have ensured the damage has so far been minimal. Iran, which said Friday's attack crossed 'red lines,' accused Israel of using U.S.-made 'bunker-busting' bombs. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Washington was not informed of that strike beforehand. President Joe Biden was being kept abreast of developments. At the U.N., where the annual General Assembly met this week, the intensification prompted expressions of concern including by France, which with the U.S. has proposed a 21-day cease-fire. 'This must be brought to an end immediately,' French Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere told a Security Council meeting. At a New York news conference, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: 'We believe the way forward is through diplomacy, not conflict... We will continue to work intentionally with all parties to urge them to choose that course.' Hezbollah opened the latest bout in a decades-long conflict with a missile barrage against Israel immediately following the October 7 attack on Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-airstrikes-rock-beirut-hezbollah-command-center-hit/7802738.html	2024-09-27T22:55:53-07:00	
Australian treasurer, visiting Beijing, welcomes Chinese efforts to stimulate its economy	BEIJING — Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers on Friday welcomed Chinese efforts to stimulate its slowing economy, noting that its recent weakness has hurt Australia. Chalmers was wrapping up a two-day visit to Beijing, the first to China by an Australian treasurer in seven years, as strained bilateral relations mend. He told reporters that Australia’s economy was slowing because of global economic uncertainty, high interest rates and China’s slowdown. 'Those three things are combining to slow our own economy considerably and when steps are taken here to boost economic activity and to boost growth in the Chinese economy, subject to the details that will be released in good time, we see that as a very, very good development for Australia,' Chalmers said. China is the biggest buyer of Australia’s most lucrative exports: iron ore and coal. 'Our resilience and prosperity are closely connected to China’s economy and the global economy,' Chalmers wrote in an opinion piece published Friday in The Australian newspaper. He noted that his department forecasts Chinese annual economic growth at below 5% for the next three years, the weakest expansion since the late 1970s. While in Beijing the two sides held meetings for the Australia-China Strategic Economic Dialogue, reviving the once annual talks aimed at growing trade and investment after a seven-year hiatus. In 2020, China introduced a series of official and unofficial trade bans on Australian commodities, including coal, that cost Australian exporters more than 20 billion Australian dollars ($14 billion) a year. Such 'trade impediments' now cost Australian exporters less than AU$1 billion ($690 million) a year, Chalmers says. At the outset of Thursday's meetings, Zheng Shanjie, chair of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, noted how relations had improved since Chalmers’ center-left Labor Party government was elected in 2020, ending nine years of conservative rule in Australia. 'Our development represents opportunities rather than challenges with each other,' Zheng said through an interpreter. 'At a time when the international situation is intricate and turbulent, it is of great significance for both countries to discuss economic development and cooperation opportunities together,' Zheng added. Two-way bilateral trade reached a record AU$327 billion ($225 billion) last year, more than double its value when a free trade deal was struck in 2015. During his visit, Chalmers was expected to raise the Chinese restrictions on imports of Australian lobsters and red meat from two Australian processors. Chalmers confirmed he had raised the lobster trade in discussions and said Australia was seeking a 'speedy resolution of the restrictions.' He blamed 'technical issues' between bureaucracies of the two nations for the delay. China raised concerns about Australian foreign investment rules. Chalmers said he had explained to Zheng that Australia's regulations did not target China and had agreed to further discuss the restrictions. 'Ours is a non-discriminatory regime which is about managing risks in foreign investment,' Chalmers said. 'Rejecting proposals is a very rare thing and it isn't just (proposals) from one country,' Chalmers added. China wants to invest in Australian critical minerals, but Australia shares U.S. concerns over China’s global dominance in critical minerals and control over supply chains in the renewable energy sector. Citing Australia’s national interests, in June Chalmers ordered five Chinese-linked companies to divest their shares in the rare earth mining company Northern Minerals. China has been grappling with a lagging economy post-COVID, with weak consumer demand, persistent deflationary pressures and a contraction in factory activity. Earlier this week, China announced a series of new measures to boost the economy and revive its ailing property sector. The central bank lowered bank reserve requirements by 0.5% as of Friday. It also has slashed interest rates on its loans to commercial banks and lowered the minimum down payments for some mortgages. Unconfirmed reports Thursday by the South China Morning Post and Bloomberg said the government plans to spend about 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) on recapitalizing six big state-owned banks. While China is growing economically closer to Australia, Beijing is becoming militarily more belligerent in the Asia-Pacific region. On security issues, Chalmers said he raised in his discussions a Chinese aircraft carrier accompanied by two destroyers entering an area near Japan’s shores for the first time last week. He also raised international concerns over China test-firing an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean this week. 'I was able to reiterate in the meetings yesterday afternoon our expectations of safe and professional conduct of all militaries operating in our region,' Chalmers said. 'But as you would expect, the overwhelming focus of our discussions here have been the economy,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-treasurer-visiting-beijing-welcomes-chinese-efforts-to-stimulate-its-economy/7802708.html	2024-09-27T20:05:46-07:00	
Chinese nuclear attack submarine sank during construction, US official says	WASHINGTON — Satellite imagery showed that China’s newest nuclear-powered attack submarine sank alongside a pier while under construction, a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday. The sinking of China's first Zhou-class submarine represents a setback for Beijing as it continues to build out the world's largest navy. Beijing has become increasingly assertive in pursuing its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, which is crucial to international trade. Meanwhile, China faces longtime territorial disputes involving others in the region including Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. The United States has sought to strengthen ties to its allies in the region and regularly sails through those waters in operations it says maintains the freedom of navigation for vessels there, angering Beijing. The submarine likely sank between May and June, when satellite images showed cranes that would be necessary to lift it off the bottom of the river, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details about the submarine loss. China has been building up its naval fleet at a breakneck pace, and the U.S. considers China’s rise one of its main future security concerns. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Friday he was not familiar with the topic and did not provide any information when asked about it at a Beijing press conference. The U.S. official said it was 'not surprising' that China's navy would conceal it. The submarine's current status is unknown. The identification of the sunken nuclear submarine was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Thomas Shugart, a former U.S. Navy submariner and an analyst at the Center for a New American Security, first noticed the incident involving the submarine in July, though it wasn’t publicly known at the time that it involved the new Zhou-class vessel. Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show what appears to be a submarine docked at the Shuangliu shipyard on the Yangtze River before the incident. An image taken June 15 appears to show the submarine either fully or partially submerged just under the river’s surface, with rescue equipment and cranes surrounding it. Booms surround it to prevent any oil or other leaks from the vessel. A satellite image taken August 25 shows a submarine back at the same dock as the submerged vessel. It's not clear if it was the same one. It remains unclear if the affected submarine had been loaded with nuclear fuel or if its reactor was operating at the time of the incident. However, there has been no reported release of radiation in the area in the time since. China as of last year operated six nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, six nuclear-powered attack submarines and 48 diesel-powered attack submarines, according to a U.S. military report. News of the submarine's sinking comes as China this week conducted a rare launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile into international waters in the Pacific Ocean. Experts say it marked the first time Beijing had conducted such a test since 1980.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-nuclear-attack-submarine-sank-during-construction-us-official-says/7802700.html	2024-09-27T19:49:48-07:00	
Brazil imposes new fine, demands payments before letting X resume	SAO PAULO/BRASILIA BRAZIL — Brazil's Supreme Court said on Friday that social platform X still needs to pay just over $5 million in pending fines, including a new one, before it will be allowed to resume its service in the country, according to a court document. Earlier this week, the Elon Musk-owned U.S. firm told the court it had complied with orders to stop the spread of misinformation and asked it to lift a ban on the platform. But Judge Alexandre de Moraes responded on Friday with a ruling that X and its legal representative in Brazil must still agree to pay a total of $3.4 million in pending fines that were previously ordered by the court. In his decision, the judge said that the court can use resources already frozen from X and Starlink accounts in Brazil, but to do so the satellite company, also owned by Musk, had to drop its pending appeal against the fund blockage. The judge also demanded a new $1.8 million fine related to a brief period last week when X became available again for some users in Brazil. X, formerly known as Twitter, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to a person close to X, the tech firm will likely pay all the fines but will consider challenging the fine that was imposed by the court after the platform ban. X has been suspended since late August in Brazil, one of its largest and most coveted markets, after Moraes ruled it had failed to comply with orders related to restricting hate speech and naming a local legal representative. Musk, who had denounced the orders as censorship and called Moraes a 'dictator,' backed down and started to reverse his position last week, when X lawyers said the platform tapped a local representative and would comply with court rulings. In Friday's decision, Moraes said that X had proved it had now blocked accounts as ordered by the court and had named the required legal representative in Brazil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-imposes-new-fine-demands-payments-before-letting-x-resume/7802694.html	2024-09-27T19:01:57-07:00	
Taliban push back against allegations of gender bias, rights abuses	Islamabad — Taliban leaders in Afghanistan have defended their Islamist rule amid intensified accusations of 'gender-based' discrimination against women and girls at this week's U.N. General Assembly. 'The situation is not as it is portrayed and propagated abroad,' Maulavi Abdul Kabir, the Taliban deputy prime minister for political affairs, asserted in an interview with an Afghan television channel aired Friday. Kabir's comments came a day after nearly two dozen countries jointly supported Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Australia in their initiative to hold the Taliban accountable for their alleged campaign to systematically exclude women from public life since the Taliban regained power in 2021. The de facto Afghan rulers have imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as Sharia. The enforcement includes banning girls' secondary school education, prohibiting Afghan women from most workplaces, and requiring them not to speak aloud and to cover their faces and bodies in public. Kabir, while speaking to the local Ariana News station on Friday, asserted that Western allegations of the Taliban driving women out of public spaces were misplaced, insisting that the human rights of all Afghans are protected under Islamic principles. 'Education for girls beyond the sixth grade and at universities is currently suspended,' he responded when asked when secondary schools would reopen for girls. 'The Islamic Emirate has not decided to keep them closed indefinitely, nor has the cabinet approved any such policy,' Kabir reiterated, using the official title of their government in Kabul. However, the Taliban deputy prime minister said that women are allowed to pursue education in religious seminaries, known as madrassas, across Afghanistan, including in the capital. 'There are female teachers. It is a single-sex Islamic educational system that requires hijab under the prevailing societal norms. It also permits women to pursue medical education,' Kabir stated. He said that the Taliban government employs 85,000 women in health, immigration, education, passport and other departments. 'There are hospitals in Kabul being run by female directors,' Kabir said. Nations urge Taliban to address concerns Countries such as Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Finland, Honduras, Ireland, Iceland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malawi, Morocco, Moldova and Romania are supporting the four-nation push to start proceedings against the Taliban at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The United States in not a member of the ICJ. In their joint statement issued in New York on Thursday, these countries urged the Taliban to respect international treaties on eliminating discrimination against women, to which Afghanistan is a party. They hailed the initiative spearheaded by Germany, Australia, Canada and the Netherlands to push proceedings against the Taliban, urging the de facto Taliban authorities to address international concerns or face the legal challenge. 'This action is without prejudice to our firm position that we do not politically recognize the Taliban de facto authorities as the legitimate representation of the Afghan population,' the statement stressed. 'Afghanistan's failure to fulfill its human rights treaty obligations is a key obstacle to normalization of relations.' The Taliban government is not formally recognized by any country, nor is it allowed to represent Afghanistan at the United Nations, mainly over human rights concerns. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on the sidelines of this week's General Assembly that the Taliban's treatment of women can be compared to 'some of the most egregious systems of oppression in recent history.' 'We will continue to amplify the voices of Afghan women and call for them to play a full role in the country's life, both inside its borders and on the global stage,' he said. Kabir criticized the U.N. for not granting the Afghanistan seat at the world body to the Taliban. 'We have met our obligations,' he said. 'The Islamic Emirate controls the entire geographical territory of the country. People are satisfied with us, and we are governing with the help of the people.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-push-back-against-allegations-of-gender-bias-rights-abuses/7802661.html	2024-09-27T18:48:16-07:00

Blinken dismisses China's Ukraine peace plan over material support for Russia	new york — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that China's words and actions regarding ending Russia's war on Ukraine do not 'add up,' as the Beijing government continues to allow Chinese companies to 'fuel Russia's war machine.' The United States and China are planning a call between President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping in the coming days, with China's material support for Russia in the war on Ukraine expected to be a key topic on the U.S. agenda. Friday afternoon, Blinken held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Ukraine Following talks that lasted more than an hour, Blinken told reporters at a news conference that any peace plan to end Russia's war on Ukraine must be based on the principles of the U.N. Charter, particularly territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence. 'A peace in which the aggressor gets everything that it sought, and the victim does not have its rights upheld, is not a recipe for a lasting peace, and certainly not a just one,' Blinken said when asked about a peace proposal by China and Brazil. Earlier on Friday, China and Brazil pushed forward with efforts to rally developing countries behind a plan to end Russia's war in Ukraine, despite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's rejection of the initiative, viewing it as favorable to Moscow's interests. The meeting between Blinken and Wang came amid growing U.S. concerns over Chinese firms supplying semiconductor chips and drones to Moscow, which have significantly bolstered Russia's battlefield capabilities in its war against Ukraine. Blinken said, 'Roughly 70% of the machine tools that Russia's importing, coming from China, Hong Kong. Ninety percent of the microelectronics, from China, Hong Kong. And this is materially helping the Russians produce the missiles, the rockets, the armored vehicles, the munitions that they need to perpetuate the war, to continue their aggression.' In New York, Wang told reporters that China had discussed with other countries the importance of preventing escalation in Russia's war on Ukraine. 'Russia and Ukraine are neighbors that cannot be moved away from each other and amity is the only realistic option,' Wang said, emphasizing that other nations should support an international peace conference involving Russia and Ukraine. Taiwan On Friday, Blinken said he also 'emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait' during the meeting with his Chinese counterpart. Rick Waters, former deputy assistant secretary of state for China and Taiwan, said the United States and China share an interest in maintaining diplomatic and military communication. 'You're not going to resolve disputes over Taiwan or the South China Sea in those channels, but I don't think either leader wants a military mishap to put them in a corner where they might have to contend with escalation or, even worse, conflict,' Waters, now managing director of Eurasia Group's China practice, said in a recent interview with VOA. The People's Republic of China (PRC) will celebrate its National Day on Tuesday, commemorating the founding of the country in 1949. Taiwan celebrates October 10, known as 'Double 10,' as the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China (ROC) in 1912. The Republic of China is Taiwan's formal name. Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong's communists took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang nationalists in a civil war, prompting the nationalists' relocation to the island. PRC leaders usually carefully watch the speeches from leaders in Taiwan during its Double 10 celebrations. Since Taiwan's democratically elected President Lai Ching-te took office in May, Beijing has increased military pressure against Taiwan. The PRC has deemed Lai a separatist. U.S. officials have stressed to their Chinese counterparts that the more pressure China applies to Taiwan, the more it risks pushing Taiwan further away, according to sources familiar with recent diplomatic discussions between Washington and Beijing. Analysts indicate they do not expect Lai to advocate for issues considered taboo by China in the coming months. 'Taiwan President Lai has been quite careful not to touch China's red lines in his public remarks since becoming the president of Taiwan,' Dennis Wilder, senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University, told VOA. 'I would guess that he will try again to reach out to Beijing and do not expect him to push independence themes.' Wilder added, 'The Chinese leadership came to the conclusion long ago that because of Lai's deep green background they would never be able to trust him. Thus, there is very little he can do, as was the case as well with former President Tsai [Ing-wen], to convince Beijing that they should improve cross-strait relations while he is in office.' He was referring to Taiwan’s political coalition known for its pro-independence platform.

Harris visits Border Patrol leaders in Arizona	DOUGLAS, Arizona — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris walked a scrubby stretch of fence line along Arizona's border with Mexico on Friday, seeking to project an image of strength against illegal migration as she confronts one of her biggest vulnerabilities in the November election. In her first trip to the international boundary since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris chatted with local Border Patrol leaders as they strode along a rust-colored stretch of wall built during Barack Obama's presidency. Temperatures in Douglas, Arizona, neared 37.7 degrees Celsius during a conversation that lasted about half an hour. 'They've got a tough job, and they need, rightly, support to do their job,' Harris said of the Border Patrol as she entered the Douglas port of entry for a briefing on efforts to block the flow of fentanyl across the border. 'They are very dedicated. And so I'm here to talk with them about what we can continue to do to support them. And also thank them for the hard work they do.' Later, she was expected to call for further tightening asylum restrictions, moving beyond President Joe Biden's policy on an issue where her rival, former President Donald Trump, has an edge with voters. Hundreds of people packed into a gymnasium to hear her speak. Trump and his fellow Republicans have pounded Harris relentlessly over the Biden administration's record on migration and fault the vice president for spending little time visiting the border during her time in the White House. Harris will outline her plan to crack down further on asylum claims and keep the restrictions in place longer compared with the executive order that Biden signed this summer, according to a campaign official who spoke on condition of anonymity because Harris had not yet made the announcement. The official briefed reporters aboard Air Force 2 en route to Arizona. Harris arrived by helicopter in Douglas, where she met with Mayor Donald Huish, Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels and County Supervisor Ann English, along with Senator Mark Kelly and Attorney General Kris Mayes. Immigration and border security are top issues in Arizona, the only battleground state that borders Mexico and one that contended with a record influx of asylum-seekers last year. Voters favor Trump on migration, and Harris has gone on offense to improve her standing on the issue and defuse a key line of political attack for Trump. In nearly every campaign speech she gives, Harris recounts how a sweeping bipartisan package aiming to overhaul the federal immigration system collapsed in Congress earlier this year after Trump urged top Republicans to oppose it. 'The American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games,' Harris plans to say, according to an excerpt of her remarks previewed by her campaign. After the immigration legislation stalled, the Biden administration announced rules that bar migrants from being granted asylum when U.S. officials deem that the southern border is overwhelmed. Since then, arrests for illegal border crossings have fallen. Harris will also use her trip to remind voters about her work as attorney general of California in confronting crime along the border. During an August rally in Glendale, outside Phoenix, she talked about helping to prosecute drug- and people-smuggling gangs that operated transnationally and at the border. 'I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won,' Harris said then. The vice president's trip to Douglas thrusts the issue of immigration into the brightest spotlight yet less than six weeks before Election Day. Trump didn't wait for her to arrive there before pushing back. He pointed Friday to purported data about criminals entering the U.S. illegally in a bid to link Harris to violent crimes committed by migrants. In a scathing diatribe, he said 'blood is on her hands.' 'These are hard, tough, vicious criminals that are free to roam in our country,' Trump said at a manufacturing plant in Michigan. Earlier in the week, he told voters that 'when Kamala speaks about the border, her credibility is less than zero.' The Trump campaign has also countered with its own TV ads deriding the vice president as a failed 'border czar.' 'Under Harris, over 10 million illegally here,' said one spot. However, estimates on how many people have entered the country illegally since the start of the Biden administration in 2021 vary widely. Harris also never held the position of border czar. Instead, her assignment was to tackle the 'root causes' of migration from three Central American nations — El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — that were responsible for a significant share of border crossers. The vice president took a long-term approach to an immediate problem, helping persuade multinational corporations and Latin American businesses to invest in the region. That, she argued, would create jobs and give locals more reasons to stay home rather than take the arduous trek north. Still, Trump has continued to decry an 'invasion' of border crossers. Douglas, where Harris appeared, is an overwhelmingly Democratic border town in GOP-dominated Cochise County, where the Republicans on the board of supervisors are facing criminal charges for refusing to certify the 2022 election results. Trump was in the area last month, using a remote stretch of border wall and a pile of steel beams to draw a contrast between himself and Harris on border security. The town of 16,000 people has strong ties to its much larger neighbor, Agua Prieta, Mexico, and a busy port of entry that's slated for a long-sought upgrade. Many locals are as concerned with making legal border crossings more efficient as they are with combatting illegal ones.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-visits-border-patrol-leaders-in-arizona/7802688.html	2024-09-27T18:28:49-07:00

Myanmar military urges armed groups to stop fighting, join elections	washington — Myanmar's military has called on ethnic armed groups and anti-junta resistance forces to end their armed struggle and participate in proposed national elections. While this call to cease fighting was quickly rejected by opposition forces, it marked a significant development in Myanmar's three-year civil war. Ye Myo Hein, a senior expert on Myanmar at the United States Institute of Peace, said the military's call to cease fighting, made public in a statement Thursday, was aimed to appease China. 'The SAC [State Administration Council] is making overtures to Beijing,' he posted on social media, pointing out recent statements in which the military referred to China as Myanmar's closest ally. The statement posted by the SAC, Myanmar's military regime, proposed that ethnic groups, including the People's Defense Forces (PDF) — the armed wing of the anti-junta movement — resolve political issues through peaceful means and electoral participation. Though the SAC did not mention the National Unity Government (NUG), the PDF is largely aligned with the shadow government formed by former lawmakers and junta opponents. The SAC argued that the ongoing conflict has caused significant losses to the country. 'Considering the losses of the state due to armed struggle and terrorism, ethnic armed organizations and PDF terrorists are invited to contact the state to resolve political issues through party politics,' the SAC stated. Opposition response Opposition leaders swiftly dismissed the military's appeal to cease fighting. Sui Khar, foreign minister of the Chinland government, which controls much of Chin state in western Myanmar, and vice chairman of the NUG-affiliated Chin National Front, told VOA the military's statement was not a genuine invitation, as it was limited to political parties and elections. 'It sounded like they were forcing others to join their own agenda,' Sui Khar said. The NUG also rejected the junta's invitation, calling it a ploy to create disunity among resistance forces, and vowed to continue the Spring Revolution — the resistance movement against military rule — and to work toward establishing a federal democratic union. Soe Thuya Zaw, a commander of the Mandalay PDF, described the offer as deceptive. 'It's like hanging a goat's head but selling dog meat,' he wrote on Facebook, using a Myanmar proverb to highlight the military's history of broken promises. Escalation in Lashio The Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), an ethnic armed group with close ties to China, has frustrated the military by capturing key territories along the Myanmar-China border. Despite the junta's attempts to negotiate, ongoing airstrikes cast doubt on the prospects for peace. On Friday, fighter jets bombed Lashio, a major city in northern Shan state and a critical trade route to China, currently under MNDAA control. According to the MNDAA, the strikes targeted civilian areas, killing two people and injuring six. 'They talk about resolving political problems through dialogue, yet continue bombing. So, the offer is impossible,' said Tu Maung Nyo, a writer and political analyst based on the Thailand-Myanmar border. 'The military is calling for negotiations because they can't win on the battlefield. It's just a way out of a crisis.' China's role in path forward Analysts say Beijing has been pressuring both Myanmar's SAC and ethnic armed groups to stabilize the situation, primarily to protect its interests along the shared border and safeguard investments. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Myanmar earlier this year signaled Beijing's desire for a stable Myanmar under military control without prolonged conflict. 'China wants stability,' said Hla Kyaw Zaw, a China-Myanmar relations expert based in China. 'Their top priorities are ensuring bombs don't fall near their territory, preventing refugees from crossing into China, and protecting Chinese investments in Myanmar. China also wants to ensure the safety of its people in Myanmar.' But the situation remains complicated. While China provides political and economic backing to the junta, analysts argue that it also covertly supports some ethnic armed groups along its border. The MNDAA, for example, is widely believed to receive Chinese support. The military's recent warmth toward China is seen by many as a survival tactic. Tu Maung Nyo said the stakes are high for China. Beijing seeks stability but recognizes that as long as the SAC remains in power, peace may be elusive. Although China continues to support the military, it is likely applying pressure behind the scenes for a resolution, especially as regional powers, including the Quad nations — Australia, India, Japan and the United States — express concern over Myanmar's future. 'China may even use its leverage by withholding weapons sales or cutting off the military's jet fuel supply,' Hla Kyaw Zaw said, noting that such actions would align with recent calls from the Quad members. Tu Maung Nyo said outside influences have always played a role in Myanmar, which occupies a strategic position on the Indian Ocean. 'The events in Myanmar, from the start of the civil war to today, have always seen the participation of major powers. While some may call it interference, I see it as inevitable participation,' he said. 'But now, the military seems to have a big problem deciding which side to rely on.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-military-urges-armed-groups-to-stop-fighting-join-elections/7802421.html	2024-09-27T17:54:54-07:00	
Kenyan president discusses Haiti, UN reform, Gen-Z protests	New York — On the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, Kenyan President William Ruto sat down with VOA’s Peter Clottey for an in-depth conversation Thursday. Ruto discussed his recent visit to Haiti, where he met with the top police commanders leading efforts to combat gangs and restore order in the Caribbean nation. He also addressed the proposal for Africa to secure two permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council, as well as the growing protests by Kenya’s Gen-Z demanding reforms in the East African country. The following has been edited for length and clarity. VOA’s Peter Clottey: Thank you very much, Mr. President, for having us this morning. What was your overarching message during your speech at the U.N. General Assembly? Kenyan President William Ruto: Three messages: the ravaging war around the world, tensions and conflict — you know, from Ukraine, Darfur, Sudan, DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo] — and the failure of the multilateral system, especially the U.N. General Assembly and specifically the U.N. Security Council, to be a force of good and a place where we resolve issues. In fact, it has become a gridlock and part of the problem. There is urgency in reforming the U.N. Security Council so that it reflects the dynamics and responds to the urgency of the situation that we face at the moment. It is our position that the U.N. needs to be reformed yesterday — to make it democratic, representative and agile — so that it can respond to the times of challenges of our time. Number two is the challenge we have about the debt situation, the economic situation globally, and the fact that many countries in the Global South, many countries are facing the possibility of debt default. And a need to reform the international financial system, deal with credit rating agencies, ensure that there is longer-term financing, there is concessional financing, there is financing that is at scale to make sure that countries can be able to push their development programs, pay for social services and manage the serious challenges of debt. Thirdly, climate change and the huge potential and opportunity that we have, especially in the Global South, and more particularly in Africa, for the huge resources, energy resources that we have, mineral resources that are in plenty, and the human capital that exists, that we can use to turn the climate change that is ravaging the world into an opportunity for Africa to industrialize, to create jobs, and to decarbonize the whole world. So, these were my very three pointed messages. Of course, not forgetting the challenge we have in Haiti and what Kenya is doing about it. VOA: You were there recently and met with Kenyan police officers. What were your observations, and what did the Kenyan police officers tell you about the challenges they face in Haiti? Ruto: I met with Haiti's political leadership, and we had a candid conversation. I was supposed to be there for an hour but stayed for four. I also met the commanders of the Kenyan contingent, the Multinational Security Support Mission [MSS] and the Haitian police leadership. My assessment was more positive than I initially thought. The reports I received indicated that the pessimists and critics who saw no hope in Haiti are changing their tune. The airport, which used to be under gunfire, is now safe, with more flights coming in and out. The palace is secure, the National Hospital is in good hands, and the National Police Academy, which had been overrun by gangs, is now training officers. I see a very positive trajectory. The Kenyan commanders on the ground and the Haitian police confirmed this to me, though they still face logistical challenges and need more resources and personnel. VOA: Will Kenya provide that additional support? Ruto: I immediately made the decision that Kenya is going to have another 600 security officers sent to Haiti to add on to the 400 already there — 300 next month, and 300 in November. And I am going to mobilize the rest of the global community to make sure that by January, we have 2,500 police officers so that we can execute the mandate that was given to us by the U.N. resolution setting up the MSS in Haiti. VOA: There are suggestions that perhaps the U.N. should lead this effort. Where does Kenya stand on that? Ruto: Whichever way we go, so long as we deploy the requisite personnel on the ground, mobilize resources necessary, the logistics that are needed for us to do the job in Haiti, whatever name we call it, whatever color we give it, my position is that we must focus on making sure that within a year. VOA: What is your plan for the youth of Kenya in terms of listening to them instead of coming up with specific plans to meet their calls and demands? And how do you react when they said, 'Mr. President must go. He has not kept his promises. He has to go'? Ruto: Kenya is a robustly democratic country. I mean, because we are a democracy, I see people even in New York here demonstrating and making all manner of statements, and that is the beauty, that is the diversity of democracy. I have a very clear, elaborate plan on job creation, our housing plan. Our digital footprint plan, our plan on export of labor. We just signed today here in New York a bilateral labor agreement with Austria, where Kenyan young people, the best resource we have, will find jobs in Austria. I came last week from, the other week, from Germany, doing the same thing, creating opportunities for the young people of Kenya to work in Kenya and to work abroad. This is my plan. It is elaborate, understood, and I'm rolling out, and I'm confident that before leaving Nairobi, I launched Climate Works. That is going to hire another 200,000 young people across Kenya on climate action and make sure that we deal with the environmental issues and climate change that is threatening humanity and having significant adverse effects on the people of Kenya swinging from drought to floods, and that program is now on its way beginning 1st of October. This Q&A originated in VOA’s English to Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-president-ruto-talks-haiti-un-reform-and-gen-z-protests/7802309.html	2024-09-27T17:45:19-07:00

US, Taiwan look to boost drone collaboration	taipei, taiwan — Drone companies from Taiwan and the U.S. are exploring ways to work together in a market dominated by China, bringing together Taiwanese enterprises and more than two dozen American companies and officials this week in Taipei. Attacks by swarms of drones have become an almost daily occurrence in Russia’s war in Ukraine, with both Kyiv and Moscow using unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, to carry out strikes and defend themselves from attacks. As the threat China poses to Taiwan grows, many see drones playing a crucial role in a potential conflict there as well. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has tasked his troops to be prepared for an invasion of Taiwan by 2027. And with Chinese companies dominating the market and critical resources used in making drones, analysts say it is important for Taiwan and the U.S. to find ways to create a China-free supply chain. At a drone expo at National Taiwan University in Taipei this week, hundreds of Taiwanese producers met with several officials from the U.S. Department of Defense and Raymond Greene, director of the American Institute in Taiwan, which serves as the de facto U.S. embassy on the island. Patrick Mason, the deputy assistant secretary of the Army for defense exports and cooperation, and Andrew Hong, deputy director of the cyber portfolio of the Defense Department's Defense Innovation Unit, or DIU, spoke at the expo. Mason spoke about 'The Pathway to U.S.-Taiwan Defense Industrial Cooperation' and Hong’s remarks centered on 'Defense Innovation with Taiwan.' For U.S. drone companies, the forum offered the potential to expand business ventures with Taiwan and grow the bilateral trade partnership, according to a statement from the American Institute in Taiwan on Wednesday. Demand for drone technology in Taiwan is large, especially given China’s drone production prowess. Chinese drone company DJI held 76% of the consumer market for household drones in 2021. These drones have also been deployed on the battlefield in places like Ukraine and Myanmar, a practice that the Chinese government and DJI have condemned. Hsu Chih-hsiang, an assistant researcher at the Institute of National Defense and Security Research in Taipei, described drones as 'combat force-multipliers,' and explained that, even in peacetime, China has already begun sending large drones into Taiwanese territory and even uses small civilian drones to hover in Taiwanese airspace in the Kinmen Islands. In 2022, former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen made the drone industry a development priority in Taiwan. Since then, Taiwan has established the 'Drone National Team' program, subsidizing domestic production of these systems. Taiwanese Minister of National Defense Wellington Koo revealed in mid-September that Taiwan would procure 3,422 units of six types of domestically produced military drones, including mini-drones, before 2028, and that Taiwan would also separately acquire two types of missile-type attack drones, totaling 976 units, before 2026, to enhance precision strikes and anti-armor capabilities. Wang Shiow-wen, who is also an assistant researcher at the Institute of National Defense and Security Research, said American support of Taiwanese drone modernization presents an opportunity for Taiwan to break through barriers in production capacity and ensure the security of the supply chain for drones. Taiwan’s government has set a goal for domestic manufacturers to produce 15,000 drones per month by 2028. That is three times current production levels, according to Taiwan’s government-funded Central News Agency. Ja Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore, said the three most important considerations for the U.S. and Taiwan in the future of drone production without Chinese components are cost, mass production capacity, and the impact that this might have on American and Taiwanese budgets, technology transfer and scientific development. China strongly opposes collaboration and engagement between Taiwan and the United States, and it was watching the gathering in Taipei closely. Chinese state media criticized the visit to Taiwan by the delegation of American companies and defense officials, as well as efforts to create a 'China-free' drone supply chain. Liu Heping, a Chinese commentator, said that by attempting to make Taiwan the 'democratic drone supply chain center,' the United States and Taiwan were preparing for a 'vigorous arms race' with China. Katherine Michaelson contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-taiwan-look-to-boost-drone-collaboration/7802406.html	2024-09-27T15:54:51-07:00	
LGBTQ advocates struggle for visibility in Eswatini	MBABANE, ESWATINI — Eswatini Sexual and Gender Minorities, an LGBTQ advocacy group, was denied registration by authorities in 2019, and even after seeking relief from the Supreme Court, which had ruled the group must be registered, its efforts have been unsuccessful. Human rights lawyer Sibusiso Nhlabatsi said the harsh legal environment for LGBTQ individuals in the southern African kingdom causes significant problems. 'There is denial that they exist, so they do not have any form of protection as a group,' Nhlabatsi said. 'They only rely on protection from the law or enjoyment of any rights from the law as human beings under Chapter 3 of our Bill of Rights of our Constitution. So I can say it’s quite challenging, because there’s no instrument that seeks to protect them. There’s no instrument that seeks to recognize them as a group of people that exist. I don’t think there’s any progress that has been made.' Besides the lack of legal recognition, LGBTQ individuals in Eswatini often face discrimination in gaining access to services, high rates of intimate partner violence, and exclusion from public discussions. Sisanda Mavimbela, executive director of Eswatini Sexual and Gender Minorities, said the idea of LGBTQ rights is considered contradictory to traditional African values and religious beliefs, perpetuating a climate of exclusion and marginalization. 'The community cannot equally enjoy rights like all Swazis do, as per their birthright,' Mavimbela said. ESGM has been denied 'a right to associate, which is a right to all Swazis as per the Constitution.' Eswatini is also known by its former official name, Swaziland. In the LGBTQ community, 'justice comes hard and sometimes is not reached at all,' for what are usually quoted as 'non-African, unreligious or cultural' reasons, Mavimbela said. Colonial-era laws In refusing to register Eswatini Sexual and Gender Minorities, the government cited the country’s colonial-era laws, which still have a profound influence on the country’s legal framework. Registration of the group would allow it to operate as a nonprofit organization with the ability to, among other things, open a bank account and receive international funding. If the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry continues to refuse to register ESGM despite the Supreme Court ruling, the court could issue a mandamus order requiring the government to carry out the action. However, no such order has been issued, and it remains to be seen if the court will do so. The ESGM case reached the Supreme Court after the group appealed a ruling by the High Court, a lower-level body. The appellants argued that the High Court had erred in law, and in fact, by stating that the applicants sought to create rights that don't exist. On June 16, 2023, a five-panel bench of the Supreme Court set aside the High Court’s decision to dismiss ESGM’s application to register as a nonprofit organization. But on September 27, 2023, the Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry ordered the Registrar of Companies not to register ESGM, citing the organization’s name and objectives and asserting that it offends the customs and principles of Eswatini. Despite the opposition to LGBTQ rights in Eswatini, Bishop Zwanini Shabalala, the former secretary-general of the Council of Swaziland Churches, has called for understanding and acceptance of the LGBTQ community without discrimination. 'This is an area that still needs more and more dialogue in churches and in society. ... Our position as the church is that we should welcome everyone who comes to church and also advocate for access to services that are rendered by the country from government to all other institutions,' Shabalala said. LGBTQ citizens 'should also be treated like anyone else, without looking at their sexual orientation.' With little to no local support, the LGBTQ community finds solace and support in the Eswatini offices of the European Union and the U.N. Development Program. The EU and the U.S. Embassy to Eswatini backed LGBTQ residents throughout the court battle, and the development program continues to run dialogue sessions and workshops. The situation remains dire, however, as the community faces a lack of recognition, acceptance and equal rights.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lgbtq-advocates-struggle-for-visibility-in-eswatini/7802336.html	2024-09-27T14:40:09-07:00	
Exiled opposition leader: ‘We want Belarus to return to family of European countries’	New York — Among those in New York City for the 79th United Nations General Assembly is exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. On Monday, Tsikhanouskaya and Evgenia Kara-Murza, the Russian human rights activist and wife of former political prisoner Vladimir Kara-Murza, received the annual human rights prize awarded by the Lantos Foundation for Human Rights and Justice, founded by the late Tom Lantos, who was the only Holocaust survivor ever elected to the U.S. Congress. Addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that same day via video link, Tsikhanouskaya said she was speaking on behalf of the more than 1,400 Belarusians imprisoned for political reasons by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko’s government. 'Many of them are held in complete isolation, incommunicado … no letters, no phone calls, no contact with the outside world,' she said. 'My husband, Syarhei, has been cut off for over a year. I do not know if he is alive.' Tsikhanouskaya was interviewed in New York by Victoria Kupchinetsky of Voice of America’s Russian Service. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. VOA: What is the purpose of you coming here to New York to the General Assembly? Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya: The U.N. is a good platform where you can meet not only your allies, but also the countries who might be useful to your cause. We are, as Belarusians ... fighting for the restoration of democracy in Belarus, for the release of our political prisoners. And we are looking for world leaders who can somehow assist us with these questions. People in Belarusian prisons are dying. This is the most painful topic for us in the democratic movement. And I think that countries who still have some relationship with this [Lukashenko] regime, they can assist us in solving the humanitarian crisis. VOA: Why do you think Lukashenko released those dozens of political prisoners? Do you know if there are any negotiations about an exchange similar to the recent prisoner exchange with Russia? Tsikhanouskaya: Lukashenko wants to sell the release of about 100 people as an act of humanity. But it has nothing in common with this. I think this release is connected with the pressure that is imposed on Lukashenko’s regime. They want to have the sanctions lifted, they want to be relevant in the political world, but they are not. Our task is to make sure that the policy of our democratic allies will not change toward Belarus. And, of course, putting pressure on the regime, strengthening Belarusian civil society, agents of democratic forces. We are looking for venues how we can release political prisoners [for] humanitarian reasons. … People are dying. We are looking for countries, for organizations, that can be mediators on this issue. VOA: Are you collecting materials, evidence, against Lukashenko to present in The Hague, at the international tribunal? Tsikhanouskaya: I’m totally sure that in the world, justice has to be restored, and Lukashenko has a long list of crimes — crimes against humanity, crimes of the deportation of Belarusians, crimes of the abduction of Ukrainian children, the immigration crisis, the hijacking of airplanes, bringing our country into the war [against Ukraine], and so on and so forth. And, of course, for years we have been collecting evidence of these crimes, and we want to use international mechanisms — the ICC [International Criminal Court], ICJ [International Court of Justice, aka World Court] — [words indistinct] to bring Lukashenko and his cronies to account, though these instruments are rather slow, honestly speaking. But we are consistent in our approach, and hopefully very soon will start a special investigation against the crimes. VOA: What is the ultimate goal of your struggle — to actually remove Lukashenko from power or something else? Tsikhanouskaya: Our goal is to restore justice in Belarus, hold free and fair elections in my homeland, but I understand that we can’t do this while Lukashenko is there. So, our ultimate goal is to release political prisoners, hold free and fair elections, but before this, of course, we have to weaken the regime as much as possible and strengthen national identity, civil society, democratic forces, to have a smooth and fast transition period. And of course, we want Belarus to return to the family of European countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exiled-opposition-leader-we-want-belarus-to-return-to-family-of-european-countries-/7802307.html	2024-09-27T14:05:35-07:00	
African leaders at UN warn against dwindling malaria funding	Abuja, Nigeria — Leaders in Africa say the fight against malaria on the continent is facing significant funding gaps due to the ongoing global financial crisis and the impact of climate change. African leaders this week met in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and called for a concerted effort to avert a funding crisis they say could set back decades of progress in the fight against malaria. The African Leaders Malaria Alliance, or ALMA, which hosted the high-level meeting, said if malaria funding continues to shrink, there will be an expected additional 112 million cases and some 280,000 deaths by the year 2029. Africa already accounts for an estimated 236 million malaria cases — or 95% of the global total — and 97% of deaths. Nigeria accounts for nearly a third of that burden. Guinea-Bissau President Umaro Sissoco Embalo, who serves as chair of ALMA, said that Africa stands at a critical moment in the fight against malaria. 'We must act urgently to protect lifesaving malaria intervention,' he said. 'This is very important because our target is to finish with malaria in Africa.' Experts said Africa needs up to $6.3 billion in malaria funding annually to eliminate the disease and called for continued support for malaria financing within the global funding framework. ALMA also said the impact of climate change and growing resistance to insecticide and antimalarials are further hampering progress against the disease in Africa. Ngashi Ngongo, head of the Executive Office at the Africa Union, said, 'Achieving the elimination of malaria alongside progress toward other endemic diseases such as HIV and TB will lay the foundation for reducing Africa's disease burden and further propel the achievement of universal health coverage on the continent. 'This progress is essential for strengthening health systems, and it is a necessity as we prepare for future pandemics, which are inevitable,' he said. Following the World Health Organization’s approval last year, the first malaria vaccines are being introduced into routine child immunization schedules across Africa. And on Thursday in New York, Nigerian health authorities signed a deal with U.S.-based drone company Zipline to use artificial intelligence-powered drones to expand access to medical supplies, including blood and vaccines. Abdu Muktar, who is the national coordinator of Nigeria’s Unlocking Healthcare Value-Chain Initiative, commended the 'very bold agenda' for producing health care products locally. 'But now we also have to be able to deliver,' he said. 'What Zipline is doing is using technology to make sure you deliver. You'll be able to reduce wastage in whatever it is — vaccines, therapeutics. You'll be able to be accountable. ... You are able to reach more people.' In 2022, governments of malaria-endemic countries contributed about $1.5 billion toward combatting the disease.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-leaders-at-un-warn-against-dwindling-malaria-funding/7802287.html	2024-09-27T13:39:35-07:00	
Zimbabwe currency plunges after central bank move to allow more flexibility	Harare, Zimbabwe — The value of Zimbabwe's gold-backed currency plunged 44% Friday on the official market. The sudden drop of the gold backed currency, known as ZiG, began Friday shortly after the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s monetary committee met and bank governor John Mushayavanhu said that after looking at 'the recent macroeconomic and financial developments and economic outlook,' the bank was ready to 'allow greater exchange rate flexibility, in line with the increased demand for foreign currency in the economy.' Immediately after, the ZiG started trading at 25 to 1 U.S. dollar, down from 14, where it had been since it was introduced in April. Tapiwa Mupandawana, a Zimbabwean independent economist and doctoral student at Africa Research University in Zambia, said allowing the ZiG to plunge is an adjustment toward its real value and a reflection of the actual state of Zimbabwe’s economy. 'The value of a currency is the derivative of the productive capacity of the country,' Mupandawana said. 'So, in any case, you cannot have a stable currency if you do not have a stable economy.' Prosper Chitambara, senior economist with the Labor and Economic Development Research Institute of Zimbabwe, said the decision to allow the ZiG to drop could be positive for the economy and a sign the central bank is allowing market forces to play more of a role in determining the value of the country’s currency. '[It] should have some stabilizing effect on the exchange rate,' Chitambara said. 'I don't think it is going to have a major impact in terms of pricing on the economy, given that most businesses were already indexing their ... ZiG pricing based on the parallel market or based on the black-market premium.' The gold-backed ZiG is the sixth type of currency Zimbabwe has tried to use since the Zimbabwean dollar collapsed amid hyperinflation in 2009. After Friday’s official devaluation, the ZiG was trading at around 50 on the black market. Before Friday it was trading at 35 ZiG to 1 U.S. dollar.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-currency-plunges-after-central-bank-move-to-allow-more-flexibility/7802167.html	2024-09-27T12:33:43-07:00

US charges Iranians with hacking attempt to disrupt US election	WASHINGTON — The U.S. government said Friday it filed criminal charges against three members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for hacking attempts aimed at disrupting the U.S. presidential election. The indictment is the latest effort by President Joe Biden’s administration to counter foreign efforts to interfere in the November 5 presidential election between Republican Donald Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris. The U.S. Treasury Department also said it was imposing sanctions on seven members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. Iran has previously denied involvement. The Trump campaign said in August it had been hacked by Iran but said the perpetrators were not able to get private information. Several news outlets have said they declined to publish internal campaign documents that were offered to them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-charges-iranians-with-hacking-attempt-to-disrupt-us-election/7802020.html	2024-09-27T10:26:48-07:00	
A defiant Netanyahu addresses UN General Assembly	United Nations — Israel’s prime minister told the U.N. General Assembly Friday that Israel is 'winning' in its fight against terrorists and their patrons in Iran who perpetrated the October 7 terror attacks on his country. 'I have a message for the tyrants of Tehran,' Benjamin Netanyahu said. 'If you strike us, we will strike you. There is no place – there is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach, and that's true of the entire Middle East.' He said Israel’s soldiers have fought with 'incredible courage and with heroic sacrifice' for the past 11 months. 'And I have another message for this assembly and for the world outside this hall: We are winning,' said Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister took the stage to a mix of boos and cheers from the gallery, where some visitors are permitted. A stream of diplomats rose from their seats and left the hall as he strode onto the stage. But Netanyahu was not fazed. He said Hamas must go, and he would not accept their participation in any post-war Gaza governing structure. 'Just imagine, for those who say, well, Hamas has to stay, it has to be part of a post-war Gaza. Imagine in a post-war situation in World War II. Imagine allowing the defeated Nazis in 1945 to rebuild Germany,' he told the U.N. General Assembly. 'It's inconceivable. It's ridiculous. It didn't happen then, it's not going to happen now.' Turning to Lebanon, where there has been a dangerous and deadly escalation between Israel and Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters in the past week, Netanyahu said Israel must also defeat them so thousands of Israeli citizens can return to their homes in northern Israel. 'I've come here today to say enough is enough!' he said. 'We won’t rest until our citizens can return safely to their homes. We will not accept a terror army perched on our northern border able to perpetrate another October 7-style massacre.' Shortly after Netanyahu spoke, the Israel Defense Forces hit what they said is Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut's southern suburbs. The Israeli leader characterized the situation in the region as a battle between the forces of good and evil – Israel battling the evil forces of terrorism in the Middle East. 'Yes, we're defending ourselves, but we're also defending you against the common enemy that, through violence and terror, seeks to destroy our way of life,' he said. The prime minister condemned countries that have accused Israel of genocide in Gaza. And he sought to get ahead of possible arrest warrants from the International Criminal Court at The Hague – they have been sought by the chief prosecutor for Netanyahu and his defense minister Yoav Gallant over their prosecution of the war and civilian suffering, saying it all comes down to antisemitism. 'The real war criminals are not in Israel, they're in Iran. They're in Gaza, in Syria, in Lebanon, in Yemen,' said Netanyahu. Despite his hard line, the Israeli prime minister said his government wants peace. He pointed to the success of the Abraham Accords, brokered by former U.S. President Donald Trump, that led to peace pacts with the UAE, Morocco, Bahrain and Sudan. While landmark agreements, they are all nations Israel has never fought a war with. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas addressed the assembly the day before Netanyahu and called for an end to his people’s suffering. 'Stop this crime. Stop it now. Stop killing children and women. Stop the genocide. Stop sending weapons to Israel,' said Abbas. 'This madness cannot continue. The entire world is responsible for what is happening to our people in Gaza and the West Bank.' Shortly before Netanyahu spoke Friday, Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob told the assembly that he had met two Palestinian girls – Sara and Rand – who told him they just wanted a normal life and asked for his help. He said he was fulfilling his promise to bring their message to New York. 'I want to say this out loud and clear to the Israeli government: Stop the bloodshed! Stop the suffering! Bring the hostages home and end the occupation!' Golob said to loud applause. 'Mr. Netanyahu, stop this war now!' he said, slamming his hand on the podium. Pakistan’s prime minister spoke just before Netanyahu. He said the war in Gaza is the 'systematic slaughter of innocent people.' 'We must act now and demand an immediate end to this bloodshed,' Muhammad Sharif said to applause.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-defiant-netanyahu-addresses-un-general-assembly-/7802014.html	2024-09-27T10:14:01-07:00

Ethnic Chin refugees in Malaysia accuse UN agency of mistreatment	Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — Ethnic Chin refugees from Myanmar in Malaysia are accusing the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR of abuse and of not providing necessary protection, potentially putting lives at risk. Hundreds of members of the Alliance of Chin Refugees held a demonstration Thursday outside the UNHCR office in Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur. Chins, most of whom are Christians, are an ethnic and religious minority in Buddhist-majority Myanmar who face repression that has led to violent conflicts there. In recent decades, waves of ethnic Chins have fled the country, many to Malaysia. U.N. figures from last month show there are about 27,250 ethnic Chin refugees and asylum-seekers in Malaysia registered with UNHCR. But James Bawl Thang Bik, chairman of the Alliance of Chin Refugees, told VOA on Thursday there are tens of thousands more who are not registered. He also said the UNHCR takes too long to make decisions for asylum-seekers who have applied for refugee status. 'The process can take years,' he said. VOA asked UNHCR Malaysia how long it typically takes for an applicant to get a decision on their case but did not receive an immediate answer. Further complicating matters, Malaysia has not signed the United Nations refugee convention and does not officially recognize refugees, viewing them as illegal immigrants. UNHCR registration provides some protection that typically prevents arrest, but the refugees are still not allowed to attend government schools or work legally — although many take off-the-books jobs, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by employers, according to migrant rights groups. James Bawl Thang Bik said that after Myanmar’s 2021 coup approximately 50 ethnic Chin Myanmar soldiers and police officers fled to Malaysia because they refused to fight for Myanmar's military. He said some of them have been arrested and are in detention in Malaysia because they lack UNHCR documentation. 'If these former soldiers and policemen get sent back to Myanmar their lives could be in danger,' he said. 'UNHCR needs to prioritize these types of cases and register them quickly.' UNHCR documentation also gives refugees access to medical care at public hospitals for lower prices than what foreigners typically pay but the Alliance of Chin Refugees said asylum-seekers without UNHCR documentation frequently need medical treatment but cannot get it. 'The UNHCR needs to meet with these people immediately and give them the necessary status and documentation,' Bik said, mentioning cases of people with broken bones and serious infections. Responding to media inquiries after Thursday’s demonstration, the United Nations refugee agency released a written statement that said: 'UNHCR wishes to emphasize that we recognize the frustration felt by many refugee communities living in the complex protection environment in Malaysia where they lack legal status, are unable to access legal work or formal education. … UNHCR is doing its utmost to protect and assist refugees. This includes prioritizing protection and assistance interventions for highly vulnerable refugees.' Additionally, Bik said he has received reports about security guards outside the UNHCR office punching and kicking ethnic Chins trying to get in without appointments. UNHCR responded in its written statement saying it has 'zero tolerance' for this type of treatment but also said: 'At this time, we have not received any reports of abuse by security personnel from any individual refugee from the Chin Community.' The alliance chairman dismissed the UNHCR’s response as false. 'We have told them about mistreatment many times,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethnic-chin-refugees-in-malaysia-accuse-un-agency-of-mistreatment/7801860.html	2024-09-27T08:43:40-07:00	
Trump to meet Zelenskyy amid tension, Republican criticism of Ukraine	Washington — Former President Donald Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in New York on Friday, amid increased skepticism of U.S. support for Ukraine’s war efforts from the Republican presidential nominee and lawmakers loyal to him. Trump announced the meeting at a press conference Thursday, which was confirmed for VOA by Zelenskyy’s team. The meeting comes a day after the Ukrainian leader met with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris Thursday to discuss U.S. support for the war in Ukraine. Tension has been brewing between the two leaders. Trump is known for his skeptical remarks on U.S. involvement in Ukraine and claims that he can quickly end the conflict by making a deal between Ukraine and Russia, if elected. During a campaign event on Wednesday, Trump slammed Zelenskyy for making 'little, nasty aspersions' toward him. He appeared to be referring to Zelenskyy’s comments in a recent New Yorker magazine article that Trump 'doesn’t really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows how.' Trump suggested the Ukrainian leader together with the Biden administration are at fault for prolonging the war that followed Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 'Biden and Kamala allowed this to happen by feeding Zelenskyy money and munitions like no country has ever seen before,' Trump said in North Carolina. He argued that Kyiv should have made concessions to Moscow before Russian troops attacked, asserting that Ukraine is now 'in rubble' and in no position to negotiate the war’s end. 'Any deal — the worst deal — would’ve been better than what we have now,' said Trump. The former U.S. president has repeatedly said he wants the Russia-Ukraine war to end but has not stated whether he wants Kyiv to win or keep all its territories. His position stands in contrast with that of Biden and Harris, who have championed American aid and military support for the embattled country. 'Ukraine will prevail, and we'll continue to stand by you every step of the way,' Biden said Thursday as he met with Zelenskyy at the White House. During her meeting with Zelenskyy, Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, reiterated the administration’s support for Kyiv’s war efforts and underscored that it is up to Ukraine to decide how the war will end. Without mentioning his name, Harris criticized Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance, whose proposal to end the war would mean Ukraine had less territory and would not join NATO. 'These proposals are the same of those of Putin, and let us be clear, they are not proposals for peace,' she said. 'Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable.' Vance suggested in a recent interview that Ukraine and Russia halt fighting and create a demilitarized zone at the current battle lines. Kyiv would need to adhere to a neutral status and stop its bid to join NATO. Zelenskyy, in the same New Yorker interview, said that Vance’s plan would 'give up' Ukrainian territory, calling Trump’s running mate 'too radical.' 'His message seems to be that Ukraine must make a sacrifice,' he said. 'The idea that the world should end this war at Ukraine’s expense is unacceptable.' Zelenskyy, who has been in the United States since Sunday to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York, was scheduled to depart Thursday but extended his visit as Trump announced the meeting. Partisan politics On Wednesday, congressional Republicans loyal to Trump demanded that the Ukrainian leader fire his ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, for organizing Zelenskyy's visit earlier this week to an ammunition factory in Pennsylvania, a hotly contested battleground state in the November U.S. presidential election. Zelenskyy met with the Democratic governor of the state, Josh Shapiro. In a letter to Zelenskyy, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said the visit to the factory that made munitions for Ukraine was a 'partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats' that amounts to 'election interference.' The White House called Johnson’s letter a 'political stunt' and pointed out that Zelenskyy recently met the Republican governor of Utah, Spencer Cox, in a 'similar event.' Ahead of Zelenskyy’s visit, the U.S. administration announced $8 billion in new aid for Ukraine. In a statement, Biden said the aid includes a Patriot missile battery and missiles, as well as air-to-ground munitions and a precision-guided glide bomb with a range of up to 130 kilometers. The White House said no announcement was imminent regarding Ukraine’s request for weapons donors to allow Ukrainian forces to use the weapons to strike targets deeper inside Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-meet-zelenskyy-amid-tension-republican-criticism-of-ukraine/7801726.html	2024-09-27T07:05:19-07:00

As Ukraine war enters a critical period, the EU moves ahead without the US	BRUSSELS — s the war in Ukraine enters a critical period, the European Union has decided that it must take responsibility for what it sees as an existential threat to security in its own neighborhood and is preparing to tackle some of the financial burden, perhaps even without the United States. EU envoys have been working in Brussels this week on a proposal to provide Ukraine with a hefty loan package worth up to $39 billion. It was announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during a trip to Kyiv last Friday. 'Crucially, this loan will flow straight into your national budget,' she told President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 'It will provide you with significant and much-needed fiscal space. You will decide how best to use the funds, giving you maximum flexibility to meet your needs.' Zelenskyy wants to buy weapons and bomb shelters and rebuild Ukraine's shattered energy network as winter draws near. In international matters, particularly involving major conflicts, the EU rarely moves ahead without the U.S., but it hopes this decision will encourage others to come forward. Russian troops and an election close in Almost 1,000 days since their full-scale invasion, Russian forces are making advances in the east. Ukraine’s army has a shaky hold on part of the Kursk region in Russia, which has provided a temporary morale boost, but as casualties mount it remains outmanned and outgunned. On the political front, Zelenskyy hopes to secure support for a 'victory plan' that might force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. He’s trying to persuade U.S. President Joe Biden and other allies to help strengthen Ukraine’s hand in any future talks. But a U.S. election looms, and polls suggest that Donald Trump might return to the White House in January. Trump has been critical of U.S. aid to Ukraine. On Wednesday, he said Zelenskyy should have made concessions to Putin before the invasion began in February 2022. Most of the 27-nation EU fears that a Putin victory would lead to deep uncertainty. Russia’s armed forces are depleted and currently incapable of another war, but the prospect of a future land grab in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Poland remains. Reworking a G7 loan plan The EU loans are part of a plan by the Group of Seven major industrialized nations to take advantage of interest earned on about $250 billion worth of frozen Russian assets, most of them held in Europe. These windfall profits are estimated at around $5 billion to $6 billion a year. The profits underpin the G7 plan. The EU would stump up $20 billion, the U.S. $20 billion, and Canada, Japan and the U.K. $10 billion together, for a combined total of $50 billion. The scheme expires at the end of the year, before the next U.S. president takes office. Now, amid differences over how long the Russian asset freeze should be guaranteed, the EU has decided to go it alone. Its offer of up to $39 billion in loans accounts for almost the entirety of the U.S. share as well. The U.S. wants to ensure that the assets are locked away for at least three years to guarantee the income. But EU member Hungary insists this should only happen in 6-month increments. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán styles himself as a peacemaker and is too close to Putin for many of his partners' comfort. The other 26 EU countries feel they must move now because time is running out. Evolving alliance with the United States The U.S. election is just weeks away. The Europeans are wary of Trump’s unpredictability and are testing scenarios to help protect themselves from the kind of battering, like tariff hikes, their economies received during his past presidency. But they also see the Democrats as more inward looking these days. Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act left European leaders fuming over rules that favored American products. China and war in the Middle East are the foreign policy priorities of Democrat or Republican candidates alike, and for now the U.S. is in the grip of election campaign fever. The EU hopes that Vice President Kamala Harris, if she is elected president, would enter the loan program as previously planned and reduce the EU's financial burden. But that remains an open question for now, and EU members say Ukraine’s position is too precarious to hesitate. Political delays in the U.S. Congress last year over a $60 billion support package starved Ukrainian troops of weapons and ammunition for months, resulting in 'real consequences on the battlefield,' in the words of NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Pressing ahead on pressing needs Helping Ukraine in military terms is a challenge for the Europeans. They could not do it alone, and cannot match the U.S. transport, logistics and equipment superiority, despite progress in ramping up their defense industries to supply arms and ammunition. But the world’s biggest trading bloc does wield economic might. It has already given Ukraine about $132 billion since the full-scale invasion started. Within weeks it appears ready to provide tens of billions more, even though going it alone is not in the EU's DNA. 'I do not know what the Americans, the United States with the new presidency, will do or not,' EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Tuesday. But, he said, 'as long as the Ukrainians want to resist, we have to support them. Otherwise, we will make a historical mistake.' The Biden administration did announce Wednesday that the U.S. will send Ukraine a major military aid package, including cluster bombs and an array of rockets, artillery and armored vehicles. A U.S. official also said billions of dollars more in assistance would arrive over the coming months. Meanwhile, deliberations on the EU's share of the G7 loan package will be high on the agenda of a summit of the bloc's leaders in Brussels on October 17-18.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-ukraine-war-enters-a-critical-period-the-eu-moves-ahead-without-the-us-/7801558.html	2024-09-27T04:56:58-07:00	
Israel to continue cease-fire discussions for Lebanon, Netanyahu says	JERUSALEM/BEIRUT — Israel will continue to discuss cease-fire proposals for Lebanon in the days ahead, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday, as Washington warned that further escalation would only make it harder for civilians on both sides to return home. Israel's foreign minister on Thursday rejected global calls for a cease-fire with the Iran-backed Hezbollah group and pressed ahead with airstrikes that have killed hundreds in Lebanon and heightened fears of a regional war. An Israeli strike on Friday killed nine members of a family, including four children, in the Lebanese border town of Shebaa, mayor Mohammad Saab told Reuters. Israeli attacks have killed more than 600 people in Lebanon since Monday, the health ministry says. Hezbollah said it had fired rockets into Israel on Friday at Kiryat Ata near the city of Haifa some 30 kilometers from the border, and the city of Tiberias, declaring the attacks a response to Israel strikes on villages, cities and civilians. Though Israeli air defenses have shot down many of Hezbollah's rockets, limiting the damage they've done, the group's attacks have shut down normal life across much of northern Israel as more areas fall into its crosshairs. The Israeli military said it had intercepted four unmanned aircraft that crossed from Lebanese territory into the maritime space off the coast of Rosh Hanikra at the Lebanese border. The conflict between Israel and the heavily armed Hezbollah is their worst in more than 18 years and part of the spillover that has swept through the Middle East as a result of the Gaza War. Syrian state media reported that an Israeli airstrike on Friday killed five soldiers in Syria, where Israel has intensified a years-long campaign aimed at rolling back the influence of Iran and Hezbollah. The United States and France proposed on Wednesday an immediate 21-day truce across the Lebanese-Israeli border, and said negotiations continued, including on the sidelines of a United Nations meeting in New York. Netanyahu said on Friday that Israeli teams had meetings to discuss the U.S. ceasefire proposals on Thursday and would continue discussions in the days ahead, adding that he appreciated the U.S. efforts. 'Our teams met [September 26] to discuss the U.S. initiative and how we can advance the shared goal of returning people safely to their homes. We will continue those discussions in the coming days,' he said in a statement. On Thursday, after Netanyahu left for New York where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly, his office issued a statement saying the prime minister had ordered Israeli troops to continue fighting with full force in Lebanon. His statement made no reference to the comments of Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who on Thursday rejected ceasefire proposals, or other Israeli politicians who have echoed that position, saying only that there had been 'a lot of misreporting around the U.S.-led ceasefire initiative.' Blinken stresses importance of cease-fire Israel says its campaign aims to secure the return home of tens of thousands of Israelis who have been forced to evacuate areas near the Lebanese border over the last year of hostilities. Hezbollah began firing at Israel on October 8 as the Gaza war began, declaring solidarity with the Palestinians. Hezbollah has said it will only cease fire when Israel's Gaza offensive ends. In Lebanon, more than 90,000 people have been reported as newly displaced this week, according to the U.N. International Organization for Migration, or IOM, adding to more than 111,000 already uprooted by the conflict. The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said 30,000 people had crossed from Lebanon into Syria in the last few days, 80% of them Syrians. Well over a million Syrians fled to Lebanon during the Syrian civil war that erupted in 2011. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel further escalation would only make it harder for civilians to return home on both sides of the border, the State Department said. 'The Secretary discussed the importance of reaching an agreement on the 21-day cease-fire across the Israel-Lebanon border,' the State Department said in a statement on Thursday, referring to talks between Blinken and Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer. 'He underscored that further escalation of the conflict will only make that objective [of civilian return] more difficult.' The State Department added that Blinken also discussed efforts to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and steps that Israel needs to take to improve delivery of humanitarian assistance in the enclave where nearly the entire 2.3 million population is displaced and faces a hunger crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-to-continue-cease-fire-discussions-for-lebanon-netanyahu-says-/7801552.html	2024-09-27T04:40:28-07:00	
Trump and Zelenskyy will meet as tensions rise over US backing for Ukraine	NEW YORK — Donald Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as public tensions have been rising between the two over Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion. Trump said Zelenskyy asked for the meeting. The visit is set for about 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time at Trump Tower in New York, less than a day after Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent, met with the Ukrainian leader and expressed unwavering support. 'I look forward to seeing him tomorrow,' Trump said in a press conference Thursday. 'I believe I will be able to make a deal between President [Vladimir] Putin and President Zelenskyy, quite quickly.' The meeting is highly anticipated and comes as Election Day nears, with Trump and Harris taking sharply different positions on backing Ukraine in the third year of its war with Russia. Trump argues Putin would never have invaded had he been president while derisively calling Zelenskyy a 'salesman' for getting U.S. assistance for Ukraine. Trump has in recent days praised Russia’s historic military victories and insisted the U.S. needs 'to get out' and end its involvement with Ukraine. Friday's meeting almost wasn't scheduled despite Zelenskyy’s office saying something had been planned during the Ukrainian leader’s visit to the U.N. General Assembly, during which he is making his endgame pitch to allies. In an interview with The New Yorker magazine that was published earlier this week, Zelenskyy implied Trump does not understand and oversimplifies the conflict. The Ukrainian leader said Trump's running mate JD Vance was 'too radical' and had essentially advocated for Ukraine to 'make a sacrifice' by 'giving up its territories.' Trump ripped Zelenskyy and Ukraine on two separate occasions this week. Speaking Wednesday in North Carolina, Trump referred to Ukraine as 'demolished' and its people as 'dead.' 'Any deal — the worst deal — would’ve been better than what we have now,' Trump said. 'If they made a bad deal, it would’ve been much better. They would’ve given up a little bit and everybody would be living, and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years.' Meanwhile, Harris on Thursday stood alongside Zelenskyy and said Trump's push for Ukraine to quickly cut a deal to end the war were 'not proposals for peace,' but 'proposals for surrender.' Trump on Thursday said he was not advocating for a surrender. While Trump and Vance have long been skeptics of U.S. backing for Ukraine, other Republican allies of the former president have backed Kyiv's defense against Moscow's invasion and argue supporting Ukraine is in America's interest. One ally of both Ukraine and Trump is Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. At a closed-door meeting Zelenskyy had with senators on Capitol Hill, also on Thursday, Graham stood up and said he had been talking to Trump about the Ukrainian president, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss the private meeting. Graham told those in the room he would talk to Zelenskyy privately about his conversations with Trump, the person said. As the meeting came to a close, Graham pulled Zelenskyy aside and the two had a private conversation. Graham is close to the former president, despite an on-again-off-again relationship, and has often played a role as an intermediary on various subjects. He did not respond to a message seeking comment Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-and-zelenskyy-will-meet-as-tensions-rise-over-us-backing-for-ukraine-/7801544.html	2024-09-27T04:23:53-07:00	
Is China-US competition driving the Africa proposal in the UN?	Johannesburg — This week at U.N. meetings in New York, the United States said that two African countries should have permanent seats on one of the world’s major decision-making bodies, the United Nations Security Council. For years, numerous African leaders have called for the continent to have representation on the U.N. Security Council, which since World War II has had just five permanent members: the U.S., France, the UK, Russia and China. This week, the top representative of one of those permanent seats, U.S. President Joe Biden, threw his weight behind the idea. However, there was one major caveat, which Kenyan analyst Cliff Mboya said is not going over well on the continent. The new African members would not have veto power on decisions. 'We’ve already seeing a lot of backlash… like this is a big joke, the question is what is the point in joining the Security Council if you don’t have veto powers, what are you going to do there?' asked Mboya. That could play in China’s favor, as it has long positioned itself as a fellow developing country and leader of what’s become known as the Global South, while disparaging the West for its colonial past, said Mboya, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Africa-China Studies at the University of Johannesburg. 'So I don’t think this helps the U.S. and the West in terms of perception and narratives, and it will only embolden African countries to lean more to the East because it just speaks to the hypocrisy,' he said. 'China’s been able to, you know, build this coalition of emerging and developing countries against the U.S. and Western-led world order.' But Paul Nantulya, a research associate with the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, said he thought the announcement was a 'win’’ for U.S. diplomacy and would mostly be welcomed by African nations as it opens the door to further negotiations. 'Regarding China, China has been very, you know, kind of like sitting on the fence. So rhetorically China has said all the right things, supporting Africa’s, what it calls Africa’s legitimate interests in the United Nations, including the United Nations Security Council,' he said. But its plan for that has been hazy, he added. 'When it comes to specific details, in terms of whether China supports permanent African representation on the council with veto power, when it comes to that China has not articulated a position.' Among those in New York this week calling for U.N. reform was South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. He said, quote: 'Africa and its 1.4 billion people remain excluded from its key decision-making structures.' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also called for reform, saying the UNSC hasn’t kept up with a changing world and Africa is underrepresented. Some African countries want veto power in the Security Council dispensed with entirely. If there is reform, and Africa gets the two seats on the Security Council that the U.S. proposes, key contenders could include the continent’s largest economy, South Africa; most populous country, Nigeria; or North African heavyweight Egypt, Nantulya told VOA. However, analysts say any future process of adding African countries as permanent members is likely to face hurdles, as there will be problems reaching consensus. Nantulya said some African politicians think it could even drive a wedge between countries on the continent. There are also concerns the U.S. statement could just be rhetoric — and so far no timeline has been given regarding the next steps. Under U.N. rules, any change to Security Council membership would need approval from two-thirds of the General Assembly, including all five permanent members.	https://www.voanews.com/a/is-china-us-competition-driving-the-africa-proposal-in-the-un-/7801507.html	2024-09-27T04:04:26-07:00	
Veteran lawmaker Ishiba set to become Japan PM	TOKYO — Former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba was set on Friday to become Japan's next prime minister after winning a closely fought contest in his fifth and final attempt to lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The 67-year-old prevailed over hardline nationalist Sanae Takaichi in a run-off vote in what was one of the most unpredictable leadership elections in decades with a record nine candidates in the field. The leader of the LDP, which has ruled Japan for almost all of the post-war era, is essentially assured of becoming the next premier because of its majority in parliament. The scramble to replace current premier Fumio Kishida was sparked in August when he announced his intention to step down over a series of scandals that plunged the LDP's ratings to record lows. 'We must believe in the people, speak the truth with courage and sincerity, and work together to make Japan a safe and secure country where everyone can live with a smile once again,' an emotional Ishiba said in a brief speech to lawmakers after the result. Ishiba must quell anger at home over rising living costs and navigate a volatile security environment in East Asia fueled by an increasingly assertive China and nuclear-armed North Korea. His approach to diplomacy with Japan's closest ally, the United States, will be in focus given he has repeatedly called for a more balanced relationship. In his campaign, he also called for the creation of an Asian NATO, an idea that could draw ire from Beijing and has already been dismissed by a senior U.S. official as hasty. U.S. ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, congratulated Ishiba in a post on X saying he looked forward to working with him to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance. Ishiba entered parliament in 1986 after a short banking career, but his outspoken views have earned him enemies in the LDP. He was sidelined by outgoing prime minister Kishida, instead becoming a dissenting voice in the party who enjoyed broad support from the public and rank-and-file members. He has rebelled on policies including the increased use of nuclear energy and has criticized his party for not allowing married couples to use separate surnames. His contrarian views and spats with colleagues contributed to four previous failed leadership bids. He has said this was his 'final battle.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/veteran-lawmaker-ishiba-set-to-become-japan-pm/7801443.html	2024-09-27T01:00:54-07:00	
Dozens of children drown while bathing during 3-day Hindu festival in eastern India	PATNA, India — Dozens of children drowned while bathing in rivers and ponds in rituals that were part of a three-day Hindu festival in eastern India's Bihar state, officials said. Heavy monsoon rains recently had raised the levels of waterways across the state. At least 46 people, including 37 children, drowned in separate incidents across the state's 15 districts, a statement from Bihar's disaster management department said. Authorities have recovered 43 bodies so far, and the three missing people are presumed to be dead. During the annual festival, mothers fast for 24 hours for the well-being of their children. The women are sometimes accompanied by their children when they visit rivers and ponds for cleansing rituals. The festival concluded Thursday. The state government has announced a compensation of 400,000 rupees ($4,784) for the families of each of the dead. Deadly accidents like drownings and stampedes during religious festivals are common in India. In July, at least 121 people were killed after severe overcrowding and a lack of exits contributed to a stampede at a religious festival in northern India.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-of-children-drown-while-bathing-during-3-day-hindu-festival-in-eastern-india/7801431.html	2024-09-27T00:19:22-07:00

Sudan’s army chief: RSF must withdraw before peace	United Nations — Sudan’s de facto ruler said Thursday that he wants to end the war in his country, but he said he will not sit with his rival general unless he withdraws his fighters. 'We are keen on stopping the war and restoring peace and security, without any pre-conditions,' Army Chief Abdel-Fattah al Burhan told reporters in New York, where he was attending U.N. General Assembly meetings. However, he stated several conditions for talks to start. 'We will never sit with Hemedti unless his forces pull out, and unless they implement what we agreed to,' he said referring to his rival, the head of the Rapid Support Forces, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as 'Hemedti.' Once allies in Sudan's transitional government following a 2021 coup, the two generals have turned into bitter rivals for power. On April 15, 2023, fighting erupted between their forces in the capital, Khartoum. It has since spread across Sudan, resulting in widespread atrocities and killing. Burhan was asked about new fighting that erupted between his forces and the RSF in Khartoum on Thursday, but did not offer any new details. Earlier Thursday, Burhan addressed the U.N. General Assembly annual debate. He used most of his speech to talk about the war in his country. Not to be outdone, his rival, Hemedti, issued a 'General Assembly speech' of his own, on the social media platform X. Ten million people have been displaced and half of Sudan’s population, 26 million people, are struggling with crisis levels of food insecurity. Famine was confirmed in August in Sudan’s Darfur region, which has seen heavy fighting. At least 14 other areas of Sudan are considered at risk of famine in the coming months. 'The food gap is there, but it hasn’t reached the level of famine yet,' Burhan told reporters. Regarding efforts by the United States and Saudi Arabia to bring the parties to the negotiating table in Switzerland in August, the army chief said it didn’t happen because 'external parties interfered' with the process. The Sudanese military accuses the United Arab Emirates of arming and equipping the RSF. The UAE was invited to a meeting in Switzerland in August and Burhan did not attend. He said he was also not happy with how the invitation was sent to him – in his personal capacity, not as head of state. He added that any peace process should be purely Sudanese-led. Asked about a July phone call he had with the leader of the UAE, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, Burhan said he told the Emirati that the RSF has received either direct or indirect assistance from the UAE in the forms of weapons and training. He said MBZ, as the UAE leader is known, 'promised to reconsider the situation.' A report by a U.N. panel of experts earlier this year said there was substance to media reports that cargo planes originating in the UAE capital had landed in eastern Chad with arms, ammunition and medical equipment destined for the RSF. Publicly, the UAE denies that it arms the RSF and says it has only sent humanitarian aid to Sudan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-s-army-chief-rsf-must-withdraw-before-peace/7801390.html	2024-09-26T21:34:23-07:00	
Migrant crossings through Panama's Darien Gap down 35% so far in 2024	METETI, Panama — Migrant crossings through the treacherous Darien Gap that connects Panama to Colombia are down by over a third in the year's first nine months, a Panamanian border official said on Thursday, crediting heightened security by the new government. Between January and September 25, 259,712 migrants arrived in Panama through the Darien, a 35% decrease compared with the same period in 2023, said Alexis de Gracia, head of the National Border Service's eastern brigade, citing official data. Panamanian authorities attribute the drop to stricter security measures implemented by the government of President Jose Raul Mulino since he took office on July 1. The new government's efforts include the closing of some routes through the jungle passage and increasing deportations with U.S. support. The data also come nearly four months after U.S. President Joe Biden instituted a broad asylum ban on migrants caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Panama has become a transit route for hundreds of thousands of migrants, most of them seeking to reach the United States. Last year, a record 520,000 migrants - most of them Venezuelans -- crossed the Darien in search of better opportunities in the north. In July, Mulino's first month in office, 20,519 migrants crossed the Darien, down 34% from June and less than half of the number of migrants who crossed in the same month last year. In August there were 19% fewer crossings compared with the previous month and five times fewer compared with the same month in 2023, according to official data. Some analysts are skeptical the government's measures will succeed in the medium term without addressing the root causes of migration, while some also fear the measures could make travel even more dangerous for migrants. Further, 'there is the possibility that they use other routes,' De Gracia said, and the government's measures could have pushed migrants to use routes from Colombia through the Caribbean in lieu of the Darien Gap.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrant-crossings-through-panama-s-darien-gap-down-35-so-far-in-2024/7801388.html	2024-09-26T21:20:29-07:00

Blinken to meet Chinese counterpart amid concerns over China's drone supply to Russia	New York — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. This meeting between the countries’ top diplomats comes amid growing U.S. concerns over Chinese firms supplying chips and drones to Moscow, which have significantly bolstered Russia's battlefield capabilities in its war against Ukraine. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell has told the Congress that China's material support for Russia's war effort 'comes from the very top.' Blinken’s talks with Wang will take place ahead of a call between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, expected later this fall. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the U.N. General Assembly that Ukraine would never accept a deal imposed by other nations to end Russia’s 31-month invasion, questioning the motives of China and Brazil in pushing for negotiations with Moscow. For months, U.S. officials have accused China of actively aiding Russia's war effort. Washington has sanctioned Chinese firms providing crucial components to Russia's defense industry. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller recently told VOA that the U.S. openly discusses its 'differences' with China to ensure that both countries 'at least understand where the other is coming from, even if we can’t reach an agreement.' He added that Washington is managing its relationship with China to prevent it from 'veering from competition into conflict.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-to-meet-chinese-counterpart-amid-concerns-over-china-s-drone-supply-to-russia/7801376.html	2024-09-26T20:43:44-07:00

US offers $20M for details about Iranian allegedly behind plot to kill official	Washington — The U.S. State Department announced a $20 million reward on Thursday for information leading to the arrest of the alleged Iranian mastermind behind a plot to assassinate former White House official John Bolton. U.S. officials said in August 2022 that they had uncovered a plot by Shahram Poursafi, a member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), to kill Bolton, who served as national security adviser to former President Donald Trump. The State Department's Rewards for Justice program 'is offering a reward of up to $20 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction' of Poursafi, a notice said Thursday. The move came as Trump, 78, who is running for a new White House term, claimed there were 'big threats' on his life by Iran. Bolton, considered a foreign policy hawk, is a fierce critic of Iran and advocated that Trump unilaterally withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. Poursafi allegedly offered an unidentified person inside the United States $300,000 to kill Bolton in the capital area. The plan was likely set in motion after the U.S. killing of top IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani in Iraq in January 2020, the Justice Department said at the time. But it never made headway because the ostensible assassin became an informant of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Iranian authorities have dismissed the allegations as 'fiction.' The United States designated the entire IRGC a 'foreign terrorist organization' in 2019, after previously designating its external operation, the Quds Force.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-offers-20m-for-details-about-iranian-allegedly-behind-plot-to-kill-official-/7800969.html	2024-09-26T16:29:23-07:00

US port employers file labor practice complaint against union	LOS ANGELES / WASHINGTON — Employers negotiating a labor contract at U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast ports on Thursday filed an unfair labor practice complaint against the longshoremen's union, saying its leaders refuse to resume talks ahead of a threatened Tuesday strike. The United States Maritime Alliance said it filed the complaint with the National Labor Relations Board because of the repeated refusal of the International Longshoremen's Association to return to the bargaining table. The six-year master contract between USMX and the ILA expires Monday, and the two sides appear to be deadlocked on wage issues. The employer group said it requested immediate injunctive relief requiring the union to resume bargaining so a deal could be finalized. It is uncommon, but not unheard of, for employers to make such complaints to the NLRB, an independent agency of the federal government that enforces U.S. labor law, particularly with regard to collective bargaining and unfair labor practices. In rare cases, the NLRB will go to court and ask for an injunction pending the outcome of a board case, but that can take weeks to play out. The ILA on Thursday responded, calling the USMX a poor negotiating partner. Earlier this week, ILA leader and chief negotiator Harold Daggett said he had rebuffed USMX approaches. 'They call me several times each week trying to get the ILA to accept a lowball wage package,' Daggett said. Sources close to the talks said the ILA asked for a wage increase of 77%, a percentage the union called exaggerated. Industry experts predict that the increase will be higher than the 32% raise won by the West Coast longshoremen's union last year. Companies that rely on ocean shipping are increasingly worried that the ILA's 45,000 members will strike and close 36 ports that handle more than half of U.S. ocean trade of products such as bananas, meat, prescription drugs, auto parts, construction materials and apparel. If that happens, delays and costs could quickly cascade, threatening the U.S. economy in the weeks ahead of the U.S. presidential election, burdening already taxed global ocean shipping networks and over time foisting higher prices on consumers. Economists at Oxford Economics estimated that the impending strike would reduce U.S. gross domestic product by $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion, or 0.1% annualized, for every week it continues. A strike has the potential to weigh on the October employment report at a time when the Federal Reserve is highly attuned to signs of weakness in the labor market, they said. The timing is politically sensitive because Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is facing former Republican President Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election on November 5. A White House official on Thursday reiterated that President Joe Biden does not intend to invoke a federal law known as the Taft-Hartley Act to prevent a strike. 'We encourage all parties to come to the bargaining table and negotiate in good faith,' the official said. 'Senior officials from the White House, Labor Department and Department of Transportation are in touch with the parties and delivering the message to them directly.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-port-employers-file-labor-practice-complaint-against-union-/7800902.html	2024-09-26T14:52:14-07:00

X asks to be reinstated in Brazil after following court's orders, source says	SAO PAULO — In the high-stakes showdown between the world's richest man and a Brazilian Supreme Court justice, Elon Musk blinked. Musk's social media site X has complied with Alexandre de Moraes' orders and requested its service be reestablished in the country, a source said Thursday. X complied with orders to block certain accounts from the platform, name an official legal representative in the country and pay fines imposed for not complying with earlier court orders, his lawyers said in a petition filed Thursday, according to the source, who is familiar with the document. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. On Saturday, de Moraes ordered the platform to submit additional documentation about its legal representative for court review, which the source said has been done. X was blocked in the highly online country of 213 million people on August 30. De Moraes ordered the shutdown after sparring with Musk for months over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. The company said at the time that de Moraes' efforts to block certain accounts were illegal moves to censor 'political opponents' and that it would not comply. Musk called the judge an enemy of free speech and a criminal. In a twist, X's new representative is the same person who held the position before X shuttered its office in Brazil. That happened after de Moraes threatened to arrest the person, Rachel de Oliveira Villa Nova Conceicao, if X did not comply with orders to block accounts. Brazil is not the first country to ban X, but such a drastic step has generally been limited to authoritarian regimes. The platform and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, including Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt, have previously temporarily suspended X, usually to quell dissent and unrest. In an unusual move for a democratic country, de Moraes also set exorbitant daily fines for anyone using virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access the platform. The fines have been questioned by legal experts and challenged by the nation's bar association, although it does not appear that any Brazilian has yet been punished. Local media have reported that the Federal Police are evaluating how to enforce violations. X named Villa Nova as its representative on Friday and registered her with Sao Paulo's commercial registry. To avoid her getting blamed for potential violations of Brazilian law — and risk arrest — a clause has been written into the representation agreement that any action on the part of X that will result in obligations for her requires prior instruction in writing from the company, according to the company's public filing with the registry. X's dustup with Brazil has some parallels to the company's dealings with the Indian government three years ago, back when it was still called Twitter and before Musk purchased it for $44 billion. In 2021, India threatened to arrest employees of Twitter (as well as Meta's Facebook and WhatsApp) for not complying with the government's requests to take down posts related to farmers' protests that rocked the country. Unlike in the United States, where free speech is baked into the constitution, in Brazil speech is more limited, with restrictions on homophobia and racism, for example, and judges can order sites to remove content. Many of de Moraes' decisions are sealed from the public and neither he nor X has disclosed the full list of accounts he has ordered blocked. Prominent supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro and far-right activists were among those that X earlier removed from the platform. Musk accused de Moraes of suppressing free speech and violating Brazil's constitution, and he noted on X that users could seek to bypass any shutdown of the social media platform by using VPNs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/x-asks-to-be-reinstated-in-brazil-after-following-court-s-orders-source-says/7800849.html	2024-09-26T13:29:33-07:00

Groups call to protect women, children working in Africa's mines	nairobi, kenya — As the global race to acquire economically vital minerals unfolds, those working in Africa’s mining sector are calling for the protection of women and children laborers who keep it running. Women in Mining Africa, an advocacy group that aims to mitigate harsh working conditions in rural communities, organized a virtual meeting this week with organizations and experts. They are working to promote gender equity and social justice in the mining sector as demand for African resources continues. 'We seek to empower women in mining by advocating for equal access to resources, opportunities, and leadership roles across the continent,' said Comfort Asokoro Ogaji founded Women in Mining Africa, which works in 36 African countries. 'We also work to promote responsible mining and advocate for sustainable, ethical, and socially inclusive mining practices,' Ogaji said. 'Child protection in mining communities is at the core of our mission and also capacity building and collaboration across the continent.' Challenges women face in industry The World Bank says women represent 30% of the industry known as Artisanal and Small-scale Mining, or ASM. However, women are often barred from entering the mines and relegated to lower-paying jobs. According to the International Institute for Sustainable Development, women's contributions are overshadowed by the historically dominant role of men, hindering women's meaningful participation and resulting in unequal pay. Women, unlike their male counterparts, also face gender inequality, violence and harassment. Jose Diemel works as a senior adviser at Levin Sources, a consulting firm that drives the transition to just and sustainable minerals value chains. Diemal has worked with artisanal and small-scale miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo. She said the management of mining fields has improved over the years. 'I've seen the mentality change towards artisanal mining, and we slowly started to talk about artisanal management plans around the possibility of peaceful coexistence,' said Diemel. 'And now we're working at 11 sources, we very regularly receive a request from large-scale mining companies, industrial mining companies, to help them set up ASM management plans that range from peaceful coexistence to collaboration.' Mining experts say miners are being empowered, receiving different ways to sustain their livelihood and undergoing safety training. The small-scale miners also have been able to obtain loans to purchase equipment that ease their work, increase their product, and their income. Call to get more women into sector Thokozile Budaza advocates for women's rights in South Africa, the largest platinum and manganese producer in the world. She said the voices of the resource owners and those working on them must be included in decision-making. 'African leaders can better anticipate the ripple effects of their policies and decisions and the lack of decisions ensuring that the benefits of mining are equitably distributed and the voices of the stakeholders, especially those marginalized, are heard and respected while dealing with investors coming into Africa to source critical materials for development,' said Budaza. A World Bank report released at the 2024 Mining Indaba Conference urges implementation of gender-focused legislation to improve mining rules and regulations and promote greater participation of women in the sector. The report also calls for changing property laws and land tenure agreements that restrict women's ability to own land and access mineral resources.	https://www.voanews.com/a/empowering-african-women-miners-path-to-sustainable-trade-economic-growth-/7800674.html	2024-09-26T12:18:14-07:00	
US Congress passes security pact with Pacific Island allies	Washington — Buried in the hundreds of pages of the continuing resolution passed Wednesday by U.S. lawmakers to prevent a government shutdown are Washington’s final steps to implement a 20-year security pact with Pacific Island allies, cementing a U.S. commitment to the region in the face of an increasingly assertive China. The Compacts of Free Association, or COFA, provide economic support for Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. In exchange, the nations will allow the U.S. military exclusive access to their land, water and airspace and the right to deny Beijing access to their ports and expansive territorial waters. But six months after the compacts were passed, extending $7 billion in economic aid over 20 years to the three Pacific Island nations, key provisions still languished. Palau’s access to postal service, aviation security, national weather service and federal banking insurance was set to run out on September 30. The temporary spending package finalized Wednesday contained an extension of those services, Representative Ed Case, a Democrat, said in a statement to VOA. In doing so, said Case, 'The U.S. restates its commitment to the people of Palau as a full partner in a shared future and to assisting Palau in resisting the dependence upon and coercion by the PRC that has marked the PRC’s efforts to dominate the countries of the Pacific.' PRC is an abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China. 'Reassuring the people of Palau that they [the services] will continue is an important message from the people of the United States to the people of Palau,' Palauan President Surangel Whipps Jr. said in an interview with VOA on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Cleo Paskal, a nonresident senior fellow for the Indo-Pacific at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, argues that the extension of these services also sends a message to Beijing. Palau is just one of three remaining Pacific Island nations who still recognize Taiwan diplomatically over Beijing. Paskal said that a gap in these basic services could have left Whipps — who is running for reelection in November — vulnerable to 'those wanting to undermine the relationship with the U.S., possibly feeding into the narrative that the U.S. isn’t helping' its Pacific partners. But U.S. lawmakers of both parties coalesced around closing the loophole for Palau, said Whipps. The agreement for Palau 'represents a significant milestone in the process of affirming our countries’ partnership for another 20 years,' U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, a Democrat, said in a statement to VOA. 'This relationship is vital to the security and stability' of the U.S. 'as we work to promote democracy and our shared values throughout the Pacific.' U.S. Representative Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen, a Republican who represents the U.S. territory of American Samoa, led a hearing earlier this month that exposed gaps in COFA implementation, including the Palau federal services expiration. 'It’s extremely important to the entirety of the Pacific region for our allies, and any nation at all, to see the U.S. following through with its commitments to our closest friends in the region,' Coleman Radewagen said in a statement to VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-congress-passes-security-pact-with-pacific-island-allies/7800734.html	2024-09-26T12:16:39-07:00	
Kurdistan Region set to hold long-delayed parliamentary election	Washington — The semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq on Wednesday officially began a campaign phase for its parliamentary elections scheduled for October 20. The vote, which was rescheduled five times due to political disagreements over the election system, comes at a time when the region is still suffering from a financial crisis related to disagreements with the Iraqi government. 'Everyone is free to propagate their policies and programs, to criticize, but no one must allow themselves to spread hatred,' said Kurdish President Nechirvan Barzani. The region was supposed to hold the election by the end of 2022, but the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) were not able to reach an agreement about amending the region’s electoral system, particularly minority quota seats. Consequently, the Kurdish parliament was suspended in May 2023. Relations with Baghdad At the center of the election is the debate over the Kurdistan Regional Government’s (KRG) prolonged financial crisis due to the lack of cash flow from Baghdad. The region’s public sector employees continue to suffer from unpaid and delayed salaries, as Irbil and Baghdad continue their painstaking talks on the KRG internal revenues, employee list and oil contracts. The crisis goes back to February 2014, when Iraq’s then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki cut the Kurdish share of the Iraqi budget to protest the KRG’s independent oil exports via Turkey. It was worsened by an Islamic State attack in August 2014, the Iraqi and Iranian pushback against the October 2017 Kurdish referendum for independence, and Turkey’s decision to halt oil exports from KRG in March 2023. While the KDP officials accuse the Iraqi central government of keeping the KRG budget 'hostage' to weaken Kurdish autonomy, the opposition parties blame, at least in part, the lack of transparency of KRG internal revenues and oil contracts with foreign companies. During his first campaign appearance, which was held in the Kurdistan Region capital, Irbil, on Wednesday, KDP head Masoud Barzani began his speech to zealous supporters acknowledging the Kurdish independence referendum anniversary, congratulating people 'on this sacred day, when the nation of Kurdistan did not allow its will to be broken and did not bow itself.' Barzani noted restored relations with the current Iraqi government led by Mohammed Shia’ Al Sudani but warned his supporters against 'a chauvinistic mindset' targeting the Kurdish people in Iraq. Barzani also recognized shortcomings in governance but asked voters to 'put criticism aside for now' and vowed reform 'from the top' after the elections. Governance and corruption While the KDP appeals to the nationalist sentiment of voters in the region, its main competitor, PUK, is focused on countering the KDP’s 'self-imposition' and offering itself as a better alternative to rule the region. 'Only the PUK can readjust this crippled governance,' PUK leader Bafel Talabani said in a televised address on Wednesday. Talabani accused the KDP of abusing the region’s revenues for its own benefit and failing to defend Kurdish rights in Baghdad. He presented 'a new PUK,' which he said will act upon its promises of fighting corruption and mismanagement. Talabani counted the appointment of a Kurdish governor for Kirkuk from his party and his pressure to change the KRG electoral system as proof for a stronger comeback of the PUK, which has been riddled with separation and internal divisions, particularly after the death of his father and the PUK’s founding leader and former Iraqi president Jalal Talabani. In 2013 the Change Movement, one of the key offshoots of the PUK, won 24 seats out of the region’s then 111 parliament seats, leading the PUK by six seats. Divided opposition But the Change Movement over the years has suffered a significant setback among voters who are seeking an alternative to the KDP-PUK ruling system. Additionally, the appearance of more opposition groups, such as the New Generation, is expected to further divide the opposition votes to the benefit of the KDP and PUK, experts say. Renowned Kurdish politician Mahmoud Osman told VOA from Irbil, 'Whether the elections are held or not, there will be no change in Kurdistan's governance, because the KDP rules one zone and the PUK rules another.' He added, 'The newly established parties are minor to the KDP and the PUK, which control the armed forces.' The outbreak of civil war in 1994 split the Kurdistan Region into two zones, with the KDP controlling the yellow zone in Irbil and Duhok provinces, and the PUK in charge of the green zone in Sulaimaniyah and Halabja provinces. In 2006, both parties signed an agreement to create a joint administration, but division, especially in the Peshmerga forces, continues to hold back the region from its aspirations for stronger government institutions. 'The will for change is present among the people of Kurdistan but not in the political parties,' Luqman Ali, a political observer from Sulaimaniyah, told VOA. He charged that political parties in the region used parliament members as 'employees' to implement their agendas. 'So long as the government is not institutionalized to prioritize people over parties and political individuals, these elections will not bring about any considerable change,' he said. About 2.9 million people from the region’s four provinces are eligible to vote in the October 20 election, which is organized by Iraq’s Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC). IHEC spokeswoman Jumana al-Ghalai on Tuesday told VOA Kurdish Service that her commission is taking various steps to ensure a transparent process. 'The vote-counting process will be conducted both manually and electronically. If the difference between them is 5%, manual counting will be used,' she said. According to Aram Jamal, head of the Kurdish Institute for Elections, despite challenges in the system, the vote is an important step for the region’s democratic process. The participation of more than 1,190 candidates in the election will ensure an intense campaign, he said. 'What is important is to have a calm and civilized competition away from violence,' Jamal told VOA. 'The chances for fraud have been eliminated to a great extent and therefore, a new voting phase has started.'

Push for renewable energy sparks new environmental worries	According to the International Energy Agency, the world now invests almost twice as much in clean energy as it does in fossil fuels. But with that shift comes environmental risks related to the mining of critical minerals. VOA’s Jessica Stone looks at how nations are navigating the environmental challenges of creating a renewable future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/push-for-renewable-energy-sparks-new-environmental-worries/7800592.html	2024-09-26T11:30:07-07:00	
US, Vietnamese leaders meet, seek deeper ties	Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden says Washington is committed to a strong, prosperous, resilient, and independent Vietnam and discussed a broad range of ways the two countries can cooperate during a meeting with this Vietnamese counterpart, To Lam. Since coming to office in May, Vietnam’s new president has been actively reaching out, meeting with the leaders of China and Russia. Washington is seeking to counter those advances and strengthen ties with Hanoi as well. Lam, who is also head of the ruling Communist Party, met with Biden on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York Wednesday. According to a White House statement, the two talked about 'building secure and resilient semiconductor supply chains' and strengthening their tech relationship as well as progress in cybersecurity cooperation and Vietnam’s efforts to increase its digital connectivity. Vietnam is looking to the United States and China to triple its number of subsea cables by 2030. Biden and Lam also focused on ways the two could deepen a comprehensive strategic partnership they entered last year. Biden said Washington wants to cooperate with Vietnam to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific and discussed the importance of maintaining peace and stability — especially in the South China Sea, according to the White House statement. During the meeting, which lasted a little more than an hour, Lam assured Biden that the United States is 'a partner of strategic importance,' while Biden told Lam that Vietnam is 'a top partner of the U.S. in the region,' Vietnam News Agency reported. Analysts say that while the meeting did not take place in the White House, it did highlight the high level of trust between Hanoi and Washington and the growing importance of bilateral ties. Nguyen Hong Hai, a lecturer of international relations at Hanoi-based VinUni, told VOA in an email that the way Washington and Hanoi are talking about one another and the high importance they attach to bilateral relations is significant. It is also a sign of deepening trust, Hai added. 'Vietnam falls short of a U.S. ally. But as a partner, it is a top of its kind,' Hai said. Hai said that Hanoi fits perfectly into Washington’s Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy since it supports the rules-based order and is playing an increasingly bigger role in the U.S.-led global supply chain. On the other hand, Hanoi needs Washington as a regional security guarantor while its goal of becoming a developed economy with high income by 2045 is contingent on access to the U.S. market as well as its capital and technology. Ha Hoang Hop, chair of the Hanoi-based Think Tank Viet Know, said it was significant that both leaders reaffirmed the importance of their comprehensive strategic partnership. So, too, was Biden’s commitment to support Vietnam’s tech-driven growth and encouragement for Hanoi to play an active role in regional security. 'The momentum of U.S.-Vietnam comprehensive strategic partnership will be maintained far beyond Biden’s and To Lam’s presidencies no matter who will succeed Biden next year or who will take the helm of the Vietnamese Communist Party in 2026,' Hop told VOA in an email. The two countries recently marked the first anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership Biden signed with Nguyen Phu Trong, Lam’s predecessor, during a visit to Hanoi last year. At that time, Lam was the country’s security czar. He became president following the forced resignation of President Vo Van Thuong in March and replaced Nguyen Phu Trong as party chief after Trong unexpectedly died in late July. Lam’s first foreign trip after becoming Vietnam’s top leader took him to Beijing in August, when he and Chinese President Xi Jinping reaffirmed their commitment to bilateral ties. He also hosted Russia’s Vladimir Putin in Hanoi in late June. Although readouts of Wednesday’s meeting gave no indication that China was discussed, Beijing was watching the meeting closely, Hai said. China became Vietnam’s first comprehensive strategic partner in 2008, and the two countries agreed late last year to build what they call a 'community of shared future' following the upgrade in U.S.-Vietnam ties. 'Any progress in U.S.-Vietnam ties is unwelcome in Beijing. However, Bejing should understand that Hanoi’s deepening ties with the U.S. is not targeted at any country but just serves its own security,' Hai said. Think Tank Viet Know’s Ha Hoang Hop said that Beijing is 'fully aware of Hanoi’s strategic position in the Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy' and is trying to capitalize on this to serve its interests. 'For its part, Hanoi is proactively navigating between the two superpowers,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-vietnamese-leaders-meet-seek-deeper-ties/7800641.html	2024-09-26T11:23:02-07:00

Cryptocurrency exchange network accused of helping Russia hit with sanctions	WASHINGTON — A network of people and virtual currency exchanges associated with harboring Russian cybercrime were hit with sanctions on Thursday, in a government-wide crackdown on cybercrime that could assist Russia ahead of President Joe Biden's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. U.S. Treasury sanctioned alleged Russian hacker Sergey Ivanov and Cryptex — a St. Vincent and Grenadines registered virtual currency exchange operating in Russia. Virtual currency exchanges allow people and businesses to trade cryptocurrencies for other assets, such as conventional dollars or other digital currencies. Treasury alleges that Ivanov has laundered hundreds of millions of dollars worth of virtual currency for cyber criminals and darknet marketplace vendors for the last 20 years, including for Timur Shakhmametov, who allegedly created an online marketplace for stolen credit card data and compromised IDs called Joker's Stash. Ivanov laundered the proceeds from Joker's Stash, Treasury says. The State Department is offering a $10 million reward for information that would lead to the arrest and possible conviction of the two men, and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Virginia has unsealed an indictment against them. Biden said in a statement announcing the sanctions Thursday that the U.S. 'will continue to raise the costs on Russia for its war in Ukraine and to deprive the Russian defense industrial base of resources.' He meets with Zelenskyy Thursday to announce a surge in security assistance for Ukraine and other actions meant to assist the war-torn country as Russia continues to invade. State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller said, 'We will continue to use all our tools and authorities to deter and expose these money laundering networks and impose cost on the cyber criminals and support networks. We reiterate our call that Russia must take concrete steps to prevent cyber criminals from freely operating in its jurisdiction.' U.S officials have taken several actions against Russian cybercriminals since the start of the invasion in February 2022. Earlier this year, Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned 13 firms — five of which are owned by an already sanctioned person — and two people who have all either helped build or operate blockchain-based services for, or enabled virtual currency payments in, the Russian financial sector, 'thus enabling potential sanctions evasion,' according to U.S. Treasury.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cryptocurrency-exchange-network-accused-of-helping-russia-hit-with-sanctions-/7800550.html	2024-09-26T10:03:42-07:00

US gun owners’ views unchanged by Trump assassination attempts	U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump has been the target of two assassination attempts during this campaign.

Hearing on Trump assassination attempts suggests failure was with Secret Service, not local police	WASHINGTON — Members of a bipartisan House panel investigating the Trump assassination attempts suggested during its first hearing Thursday that the failures that led to a gunman being able to open fire on former President Donald Trump were with the U.S. Secret Service, not local police. In his opening statement, the Republican co-chair of the committee, Rep. Mike Kelly from Pennsylvania, blamed a cascade of failures by the Secret Service that allowed the gunman, Thomas Michael Crooks, to gain access to the roof of a nearby building and open fire on Trump. Trump was wounded and a man attending the rally with his family was killed. 'In the days leading up to the rally, it was not a single mistake that allowed Crooks to outmaneuver one of our country's most elite group of security professionals. There were security failures on multiple fronts,' said Kelly. The panel — composed of seven Republicans and six Democrats — has spent the last two months analyzing the security failures that allowed a gunman to scale a roof and open fire at the former president during a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Now they are also investigating this month's Secret Service arrest of a man with a rifle on Trump's Florida golf course who sought to assassinate the Republican presidential nominee. The suspect in the second assassination attempt, Ryan Wesley Routh, was allegedly aiming a rifle through the shrubbery surrounding Trump's West Palm Beach golf course when he was detected by a Secret Service agent. The agent opened fire and Routh fled before being apprehended by local authorities. The hearing Thursday is the first time the task force presents its findings to the public after spending weeks conducting nearly two dozen interviews with law enforcement and receiving more than 2,800 pages of documents from the Secret Service. It focuses on the use of local law enforcement by the Secret Service, featuring testimony from Pennsylvania and Butler County police officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hearing-on-trump-assassination-attempts-suggests-failure-was-with-secret-service-not-local-police/7800315.html	2024-09-26T07:37:57-07:00	
FBI seizes New York City mayor's phone ahead of expected unsealing of indictment	New York — FBI agents entered the official residence of New York City Mayor Eric Adams and seized his phone early Thursday morning, hours before an indictment detailing criminal charges against the Democrat was expected to be made public. Adams was indicted by a grand jury on federal criminal charges that remain sealed, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. 'Federal agents appeared this morning at Gracie Mansion in an effort to create a spectacle (again) and take Mayor Adams phone (again),' Adams' lawyer, Alex Spiro, said in a statement, adding that the mayor had not been arrested. 'They send a dozen agents to pick up a phone when we would have happily turned it in.' Federal law enforcement agents were seen entering the mayor's Manhattan residence at dawn Wednesday, with several vehicles bearing federal law enforcement placards parked outside. The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan has declined to comment on the investigation. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment. A spokesperson for the mayor did not immediately respond to questions Thursday morning. In a video speech released Wednesday night, Adams vowed to fight any charges against him, claiming he had been made a 'target' in a case 'based on lies.' 'I will fight these injustices with every ounce of my strength and my spirit,' he said. It was not immediately clear what laws Adams is accused of breaking or when he might have to appear in court. The indictment caps off an extraordinary few weeks in New York City, as federal investigators have homed in on members of Adams' inner circle, producing a drumbeat of raids, subpoenas and high-level resignations. Federal prosecutors are believed to be leading multiple, separate inquiries involving Adams and his senior aides, relatives of those aides, campaign fundraising and possible influence peddling of the police and fire departments. In the last two weeks alone, the city's police commissioner and head of the school's system have announced their resignations. FBI agents had seized Adams' electronic devices nearly a year ago as part of an investigation focused, at least partly, on campaign contributions and Adams' interactions with the Turkish government. Because the charges were sealed, it was unknown whether they dealt with those same matters. In early September, federal investigators seized devices from his police commissioner, schools chancellor, two deputy mayors and other trusted confidantes both in and out of City Hall. All have denied wrongdoing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-seizes-new-york-city-mayor-s-phone-ahead-of-expected-unsealing-of-indictment/7800234.html	2024-09-26T06:33:22-07:00

Hong Kong court jails former editor, releases another on health grounds	HONG KONG — A Hong Kong court on Thursday night sentenced a former editor to jail for 21 months and immediately released another after both had earlier been found guilty of conspiring to publish seditious articles. In a landmark case about media freedom, Chung Pui-kuen and Patrick Lam of the now-defunct Stand News media outlet were convicted last month — the first time journalists have been found guilty of sedition since the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997. Chung was sentenced to 21 months while Lam was given a sentence that allowed him to be released immediately on health grounds. District Court Judge Kwok Wai-kin noted evidence from Lam's lawyer on Thursday that he had serious autoimmune and advanced kidney disease and that prison could further endanger him. Chung smiled as the judge said his colleague Lam would be released, and Lam's wife wept. Chung would have to serve around 10 months in jail given earlier remand custody. Stand News, once Hong Kong's leading online media outlet, was known for its hard-hitting reports about the city's 2019 pro-democracy protests and later the national security crackdown. Under the colonial-era sedition law, the maximum sentencing is two years imprisonment and a fine of HKD5,000 ($642). Western diplomats that included representatives from the United States, the European Union, France, Britain, Canada and Ireland witnessed the sentencing. Liz Throssell, a spokesperson for the United Nations Human Rights Office, said earlier that the office was calling on Hong Kong authorities to review the court's decision in line with obligations under international human rights law. Twenty-three member states of the Media Freedom Coalition, including the U.S., U.K. and Canada, have similarly signed a statement, urging 'Hong Kong and China authorities to abide by their international human rights commitments and legal obligations, and to respect freedom of the press and freedom of speech in Hong Kong.' A spokesperson for Hong Kong's government said in a statement that the government 'strongly disapproved of and rejected the fact-twisting remarks and baseless smears' by the coalition. Hong Kong and Chinese officials have said the security clampdown was needed to maintain stability after the pro-democracy protests. Judge Kwok wrote in a verdict in August that 'the political ideology of Stand News was localism' and 'the line it took was to support and promote Hong Kong local autonomy.' Hong Kong's mostly youthful localist movement emerged in the 2010s amid political tensions with Beijing, emphasizing local identity and culture, as well as greater autonomy. Some supporters called for Hong Kong independence. 'I believe that during the offense period, the ... defendants did not carry out real media work but participated in the so-called struggle at that time,' the judge said on Thursday. In August, Chung wrote in a mitigation letter to the court that some Hong Kongers 'care about the freedom and dignity of everyone in the community and are willing to pay the price of losing their own freedom.' Lam wrote that 'the only way for journalists to defend press freedom is to report.' Stand News was raided by police in December 2021, and its assets were frozen, leading to its closure.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-court-jails-former-editor-releases-another-on-health-grounds/7800221.html	2024-09-26T06:28:58-07:00	
Indian-ruled Kashmir election officials report over 50% turnout	Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir — Voter turnout of just over 56% was reported Wednesday in Jammu and Kashmir, the disputed, Indian-controlled territory holding its first legislative elections in ten years. Two hundred thirty-nine candidates ran for 26 assembly constituencies in Wednesday’s voting, part two of the three-phase elections. More than 2.5 million adults were eligible to cast ballots. The elections took place under tight security arrangements to ensure smooth conduct of the polls. 'The polls ended peacefully in all the six districts. However, some stray incidents like arguments et cetera occurred at a few places but there is no need for re-poll anywhere,' Pandurang Kondbarao Pole, J&K Chief Electoral Officer, told reporters in a press conference. Jammu and Kashmir is experiencing its first elections since the government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party revoked its limited autonomy in 2019, downgrading its status to that of a union territory. Some locals see the elections as a battle between the BJP and the people of Kashmir, saying the government has systematically snatched away their rights over the last decade. 'Desperate times call for desperate measures. I have boycotted elections ever since I became eligible to vote. Today I feel it’s necessary to cast a vote and send a message to New Delhi,' Ikhlaq Shah, a resident of Qamarwari, told VOA. 'If we fail to act now, I believe the BJP government will impose its hazardous agenda against us.' India, he said, is more interested in exploiting Jammu and Kashmir’s resources than caring for its people. Shah expressed disappointment that regional political parties, particularly the National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party, are competing against each other in the elections despite sharing the common goal of throwing BJP out of J&K. Muzamil Maqbool, a political analyst, told VOA that the parties have fragmented because their leaders are prioritizing personal interests. 'Most of these mainstream parties were once colleagues of each other in the past. Now they have sprouted and formed their own separated parties to fight under different names and banners,' Maqbool said. The result, he predicted, is that none of them will win a majority in the J&K legislature. 'It’s too early to say, but J&K may see a large coalition formed to govern after the October 2024 elections,' he said. Shameem Ahmad Baba, a resident of old Srinagar, said voters are confused about the parties, who are accusing each other of being hidden allies of the BJP. 'There is a mass confusion among the people about who supports us and who stands with the government, as so many candidates are running this time,' Baba told VOA. 'I wish the regional political parties had agreed on seat-sharing, as this would have helped keep New Delhi’s influence at bay.' Muzaffar Shah, vice president of the Awami National Conference, or ANC, said that if all regional parties worked together under the banner of the now-dissolved Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, PAGD, it would have strengthened the movement of the local population. PAGD was a coalition of major parties created to press the demand that India revive J&K’s special status. 'PAGD was recognized almost throughout diaspora of Kashmir and throughout the world,' Shah said. 'Unfortunately, political parties in the alliance, they gave much more weightage to their organizational matters and power politics than the interests of people of region. That fact unfortunately led to the breakup.' Meanwhile, a 16-member delegation of foreign diplomats from countries like the U.S., Mexico, Singapore and Norway visited Kashmir at the invitation of the Indian government. Former Chief Minister of J&K, Omar Abdullah, lashed out at the central government for inviting foreign diplomats to observe the elections. 'If these diplomats comment on J&K the Government of India immediately says it’s an internal matter and they don’t want outside interference. If that’s the case, why are they inviting them now?' Abdullah said. The third phase of the J&K elections takes place October 1.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-ruled-kashmir-election-officials-report-over-50-turnout/7800201.html	2024-09-26T06:11:11-07:00

Oxfam: 'Oligarchy' of super-rich undermining cooperation to tackle poverty, climate change	London — As world leaders gather for the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, the charity Oxfam says they are being undermined by what it calls a 'global oligarchy' of the super-rich who exert considerable control over the global economy – and who it blames for exacerbating problems like extreme inequality and climate change. 'Today, the world’s richest 1% own more wealth than 95% of humanity. The immense concentration of wealth, driven significantly by increased monopolistic corporate power, has allowed large corporations and the ultrarich who exercise control over them to use their vast resources to shape global rules in their favor, often at the expense of everyone else,' the Oxfam report says. The charity says international cooperation on issues like climate change and poverty is failing due to extreme economic inequality. 'The wealth of the world's five richest men has doubled since the start of this decade. And nearly five billion people have got poorer,' said Nabil Ahmed, the director of economic and racial justice at Oxfam America, in an interview with VOA. Fair taxes The report urges fairer taxation of large corporations and the ultra-wealthy. 'We live in a world in which mega-corporations… are paying next to or little to no tax basically. Not like the small businesses, not like the rest of us,' Ahmed said. 'It's such a phenomenal lost opportunity because we know governments, rich and poor, across the world need to claw back these revenues to be able to invest in their people, to be able to meet their rights,' he added. Oxfam praises a campaign led by Brazil, which currently holds the presidency of the G20, to impose a 2% minimum tax on the world’s richest billionaires. Brazil’s government claims it would raise up to $250 billion from about 3,000 individuals, to pay for healthcare, education and tackling climate change. A report by the French economist Gabriel Zucman, commissioned by Brazil, suggests billionaires currently pay the equivalent of 0.3% of their wealth in taxes. The plan is backed by other members including South Africa, Spain and France. However, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spoke against the move at a G20 meeting in July. 'Tax policy is very difficult to coordinate globally and we don't see a need or really think it's desirable to try to negotiate a global agreement on that. We think that all countries should make sure that their taxation systems are fair and progressive,' Yellen told reporters. Private debt Oxfam says tax revenues in the global south meanwhile are increasingly spent on servicing debt to private creditors like banks and hedge funds. 'This shift has exacerbated the debt crisis, further entrenching 'debtocracy.' Compared with official creditors, private entities issue debt with shorter maturities and higher, more volatile interest rates,' the Oxfam report says. Vaccines The charity also accuses large pharmaceutical companies of shaping rules over intellectual property rights to benefit their shareholders. Oxfam says that during the COVID-19 pandemic, this meant poorer nations struggled to access coronavirus vaccines, such as the mRNA vaccine made by Pfizer. 'Its negative impacts are most harshly felt by countries in the Global South, which bear the brunt of 'artificial rationing,' where pharmaceutical corporations keep drug costs — and thus profits — high by limiting generic manufacturing, while simultaneously failing to invest in research and development for priority diseases in the Global South deemed less profitable,' Oxfam said. Responding to VOA, Pfizer highlighted an open letter written by the company’s chairman Albert Bourla in 2021, in which he said the company had created a tiered pricing structure and had offered its mRNA coronavirus vaccine at cost price or for free to poorer nations. However, Bourla said that many richer countries moved faster to purchase the available doses. 'When we developed our tiered pricing policy, we reached out to all nations asking them to place orders so we could allocate doses for them. In reality, the high-income countries reserved most of the doses,' Bourla wrote. Pfizer’s chairman also warned that losing intellectual property rights could 'disincentivize' anyone else from taking a big financial risk in developing such vaccines, a view echoed by other large pharmaceutical giants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/oxfam-oligarchy-of-super-rich-undermining-cooperation-to-tackle-poverty-climate-change/7800166.html	2024-09-26T05:26:53-07:00

What's behind China's launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile	TAIPEI, Taiwan — China test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday in a rare occurrence, adding to tensions in the region where multiple countries have overlapping territorial claims and both Beijing and Washington seek to project their influence. The launch was part of routine training by the People's Liberation Army's Rocket Force, which is in charge of conventional and nuclear missile operations, and was not aimed at any country or target, the Defense Ministry said in a statement. The ICBM, carrying a dummy warhead, landed in a designated area in the sea, the ministry said, without specifying where exactly. China rarely tests ICBMs out in international waters, with some experts tracing the last such deployment back to May 1980, when Beijing launched a DF-5 missile into the South Pacific. Usually, the PLA test-fires ballistic missiles in China's remote Xinjiang region or in the Bohai Sea. Why the Pacific, why now? China choosing the Pacific Ocean as the location for test-firing its missile comes across as both a display of its increased nuclear capabilities and as a warning to the United States and its allies in the region, experts say. 'There is no other potential audience, as China does not expect to have to confront the EU or the U.K. militarily,' said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London. The test also comes weeks ahead of an expected call between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden. It marks an increase in regional security tensions with U.S. allies Japan and the Philippines, and a continuation of frictions with the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory. Taiwan's Defense Ministry said Wednesday it was monitoring the missile launch, along with other military exercises by China in the region. The launch, coinciding with the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York, 'is a pretty blunt signal' to the international order, said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and a former U.S. defense official. 'China is signaling that its forbearance has limits, that it is prepared to use its most powerful weapons to deter adversaries or punish them if needed, if deterrence fails,' he said. Wednesday's launch also follows a series of corruption arrests this year that ensnared several leading officers in its rocket corps on allegations of misconduct. Its aim could be to both provide assurances at home and signal to the world that the issues have been resolved. How strong is China's military? China boasts the world's largest standing army and the biggest navy. Its military budget is the second highest in the world, after that of the U.S. According to the U.S., China also has the largest air force in the Indo-Pacific, with more than half of its fighter planes consisting of fourth or fifth generation models. China also boasts a massive stockpile of missiles, along with stealth aircraft, bombers capable of delivering nuclear weapons, advanced surface ships and nuclear-powered submarines. In his more than a decade in power, Xi, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, has spearheaded the armed forces' modernization, with investments in high-tech military technologies from stealth fighters to aircraft carriers and a growing arsenal of nuclear weapons. China's defense budget has more than doubled since 2015, even as the country's economic growth rate has slowed considerably. A U.S. Department of Defense report last year said China has continued to strengthen the PLA's ability to 'fight and win wars against a strong enemy.' How do China's missiles compare to those of others? The U.S. report also estimated China had more than 500 operational nuclear warheads as of May 2023 and was on track to accumulate more than 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030. China has not revealed the size of its nuclear arsenal. In comparison, Russia is believed to have a total inventory of more than 5,580 warheads — including 4,380 stockpiled warheads for operational forces, as well as an additional 1,200 retired warheads awaiting dismantlement — according to a report this year by the Federation of American Scientists. The same report put the U.S. nuclear warheads at 5,044. How common are missile tests in the region? Few countries have ICBMs in their arsenal, and testing is usually restricted to their own territory. North Korea has carried out multiple ICBM tests since 2017, including firing a developmental solid-fueled missile in December that came down in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The U.S. earlier this year fired two unarmed ICBMs equipped with reentry vehicles from California and brought them down on an American test site in the Marshall Islands.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-s-behind-china-s-launch-of-an-intercontinental-ballistic-missile/7800052.html	2024-09-26T03:02:28-07:00

AFRICOM, African militaries unite to combat gender-based violence	Gaborone, Botswana — U.S. Africa Command, or AFRICOM, is working with southern African countries to combat gender-based violence in the military. This week, AFRICOM and regional military officials are holding a series of workshops in Zambia to strengthen regional collaboration in the fight against workplace harassment. AFRICOM and its component, the U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa, or USAFE-AFAFRICA, have united with the Zambia Defense Force to foster strategies to tackle gender-based violence in the region. Botswana and Zambia are participating in efforts to strengthen regional initiatives against sexual assault. Lieutenant Colonel Linda Jones, USAFE-AFAFRICA chief for African health engagements, said it is imperative to come up with strategies to fight gender-based violence in the armed forces. 'It is the responsibility of leaders that all of us set the tone, including an environment where everyone is valued and empowered to speak up against misconduct,' she said. 'This involves not only enforcing policies but also modeling respect for behavior and actively supporting those who report incidents.' In 2021, U.S. Defense Department officials reported sexual violence had reached the highest level ever reported, with 8.4% of women assaulted on duty. U.S. Air Force Tech Sergeant Samara Brown said if left unchecked, gender-based violence can affect execution of military tasks. 'Gender-based violence undermines the core values of any military organization,' Brown said. 'It erodes trust, disrupts unity, cohesion and ultimately compromises mission readiness. We must take a firm stand against it, not just as a matter of policy but a commitment to uphold the principles of honor, integrity and respect that define our service.' Retired U.S. Air Force official and workplace development consultant Keith Castille facilitated the Lusaka workshop. He said such collaborations with the Zambia Defense Force can ensure gender-based violence is addressed within regional militaries. 'No military can tackle this issue alone,' he said. 'By sharing knowledge and collaborating across branches and communities, we can develop more effective strategies to combat gender-based violence. Engaging in open dialogue, facilitating workshops and creating joint initiatives will enable us to learn from one another and strengthen our collective efforts.' Attending the workshop in Lusaka, Zambian Defense Force Major Stephen Muleya said the military workplace must be free of gender-based harassment. 'When individuals know that they can perform their duties without the threat of harassment or violence, they are more likely to focus fully on their missions,' he said. 'We must actively cultivate an atmosphere where everyone can thrive free from fear and intimidation.' Zambian officials said they’re planning to open a regional office for innovative gender-based violence solutions. Zambian air force legal adviser Major Glory Musonda said collaboration with U.S. partners should result in solutions to gender-based violence within the force. 'We all have a responsibility to build military environments where respect and dignity are upheld,' Musonda said. 'It’s not enough to simply acknowledge the issue, we must actively work toward solutions that ensure the safety and well-being of every service member.' Meanwhile, officials representing the U.S. Army War College are in Lusaka for discussions on women, peace and security, which aligns with efforts to address gender-based violence in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/africom-african-militaries-unite-to-combat-gender-based-violence/7800014.html	2024-09-26T01:00:47-07:00	
South Korea publishes compensation plan for dog meat farmers ahead of 2027 ban	SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea announced plans Thursday to compensate famers and others in the country's dwindling dog meat industry before a formal ban goes effect in 2027, a move that is drawing opposition from both farmers and animal rights activists. South Korea's parliament passed a landmark bill in January that will ban slaughtering, breeding or selling dog meat for human consumption after a three-year grace period. It will be punishable by 2-3 years in prison. The Agriculture Ministry said that farmers would receive compensation starting from 225,000 won ($170), and rising up to 600,000 won ($450) per dog if they agree to shut down their business early. It's likely that farmers won't accept the offer, as they earlier called for 2 million won ($1,505) per dog. They've said the ban infringes on their freedom and will aggravate their economic difficulties. In a statement Tuesday, an association of dog farmers called for the law to be amended to extend the grace period and add appropriate compensation plans. Sangkyung Lee, a campaign manager at the Korean office of the anti-animal cruelty group Humane Society International, called the South Korean announcement 'an important milestone in this historic ban that will see the ban through to completion and end our country's dog meat era for good.' But Lee said his office is 'disappointed' at the South Korean plan because it would pay farmers based on the number of dogs they have, 'potentially increasing dog breeding to get more money from the scheme and more puppies being born into suffering.' Dog meat consumption is a centuries-old practice on the Korean Peninsula. Dog meat is eaten in China, Vietnam, Indonesia and some African countries. But South Korea's dog meat industry has drawn more attention because of the country's reputation as a cultural and economic powerhouse. It's also the only nation with industrial-scale dog farms. South Korea's anti-dog meat campaign received a big boost from the country's first lady, Kim Keon Hee, who repeatedly expressed her support for a prohibition. She was subjected to withering criticism and crude insults during demonstrations by farmers. Surveys have found that that around one in three South Koreans opposes the ban, though most people now don't eat dog meat and favor a ban. Vice Agriculture Minster Park Beomsu told reporters that government studies found that about 466,000 dogs are currently being raised for food across South Korea. He said officials will try to convince farmers to voluntarily phase out dog breeding ahead of the ban. After the ban comes into force, Park said, the government plans to facilitate adoptions for the remaining dogs or move them to care facilities rather than euthanize them. The agriculture ministry said butchers will also be compensated, while local authorities will be responsible for dismantling dog farms and slaughterhouses. Former farmers and butchers will also get low-interest loans if they pivot to other agricultural businesses. The ministry said authorities will also offer financial assistance to traders and restaurant owners to shut down their businesses and find new jobs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-publishes-compensation-plan-for-dog-meat-farmers-ahead-of-2027-ban/7800001.html	2024-09-26T00:08:06-07:00	
Pope Francis heads for Luxembourg and Belgium on a trip to a dwindling flock	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is traveling to once-strong bastions of Christianity in the heart of Europe to try to reinvigorate a Catholic flock that is dwindling in the face of secular trends and abuse scandals that have largely emptied the continent's magnificent cathedrals and village churches. Francis stops first Thursday in Luxembourg, the European Union's second-smallest country, with a population of some 650,000 people, and its richest per capita. Torrential downpours are expected, days after the 87-year-old pope canceled his audiences because of a slight flu. He seemed in fine form at the Vatican on Wednesday, during his general audience on the eve of the trip, but his respiratory health is a constant concern and his medical team will be on hand. After meeting with Luxembourg's political leaders, Francis will speak to the country's Catholic priests and nuns. The venue is the late-Gothic Cathedral of Notre Dame, which was built in the early 1600s by Francis' own Jesuit order and stands as a monument to Christianity's long and central place in European history. Francis is likely to dwell on Europe's role past, present and future — particularly as war rages on European soil — during his visits to Luxembourg and Belgium, where he arrives later Thursday and stays through the weekend. The trip is a much-truncated version of the 10-day, 1985 tour St. John Paul II made through Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands, during which the Polish pope delivered 59 speeches or homilies and was greeted by hundreds of thousands of adoring faithful. In Luxembourg alone, John Paul drew a crowd of some 45,000 people to his Mass, or some 10% of the then-population, and officials had predicted a million people would welcome him in Belgium, according to news reports at the time. But then as now, the head of the Catholic Church faced indifference and even hostility to core Vatican teachings on contraception and sexual morals, opposition that has only increased in the ensuing generation. Those secular trends and the crisis over clergy abuse have helped lead to the decline of the church in the region, with monthly Mass attendance in the single digits and plummeting ordinations of new priests. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said that by traveling to the two countries, Francis will likely want to offer 'a word to the heart of Europe, of its history, the role it wants to play in the world in the future.' Immigration, climate change and peace are likely to be themes during the four-day visit, which was organized primarily to mark the 600th anniversary of the founding of Belgium's two main Catholic universities. In Luxembourg, Francis has a top ally and friend in the lone cardinal from the country, Jean-Claude Hollerich, a Jesuit like the Argentine pope. Hollerich, whom Francis made a cardinal in 2019, has taken on a leading role in the pope's multi-year church reform effort as the 'general rapporteur' of his big synod, or meeting, on the future of the Catholic Church. In that capacity, Hollerich has helped oversee local, national and continental-wide consultations of rank-and-file Catholics and synthesized their views into working papers for bishops and other delegates to discuss at their Vatican meetings, the second session of which opens next week. Last year, in another sign of his esteem for the progressive cardinal, Francis appointed Hollerich to serve on his kitchen cabinet, known as the Council of Cardinals. The group of nine prelates from around the globe meet several times a year at the Vatican to help Francis govern.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-heads-for-luxembourg-and-belgium-on-a-trip-to-a-dwindling-flock/7800000.html	2024-09-25T23:48:27-07:00	
Japanese court acquits former boxer in a 1966 murder retrial	TOKYO — A Japanese court ruled Thursday that an 88-year-old former boxer was not guilty in a retrial for a 1966 quadruple murder, reversing an earlier wrongful conviction after decades on death row. Iwao Hakamada's acquittal by the Shizuoka District Court makes him the fifth death-row convict to be found not guilty in a retrial in postwar Japanese criminal justice. The case could rekindle a debate around abolishing the death penalty in Japan. The court's presiding judge, Koshi Kunii, said the court acknowledged multiple fabrications of evidence and that Hakamada was not the culprit, NHK said. Hakamada was convicted of murder in the 1966 killing of a company manager and three of his family members and setting a fire to their central Japan home. He was sentenced to death in 1968 but was not executed due to lengthy appeals and the retrial process. He spent 48 years behind bars — most of them on death row — making him the world's longest-serving death row inmate. It took 27 years for the top court to deny his first appeal for retrial. His second appeal for a retrial was filed in 2008 by his sister Hideko Hakamada, now 91, and the court finally ruled in his favor in 2023, paving the way for the latest retrial that began in October. Hakamada was released from prison in 2014 when a court ordered a retrial based on new evidence suggesting his conviction may have been based on fabricated accusations by investigators but was not cleared of the conviction. After his release, Hakamada served his sentence at home because his frail health and age made him a low risk for escape. At a final hearing at the Shizuoka court in May before Thursday's decision, prosecutors again demanded the death penalty, triggering criticism from rights groups that prosecutors were trying to prolong the trial. The extremely high hurdles for retrials have also prompted legal experts to call for a revision to the system. During the investigation that followed his arrest, Hakamada initially denied the accusations, then confessed. He later said he was forced to confess under violent interrogation by police. A major point of contention was five pieces of blood-stained clothing that investigators claimed Hakamada wore during the crime and hid in a tank of fermented soybean paste, or miso. The clothes were found more than a year after his arrest. A Tokyo High Court ruling in 2023 acknowledged scientific experiments that clothing soaked in miso for more than a year turns too dark for bloodstains to be spotted, noting a possible fabrication by investigators. Defense lawyers and earlier retrial decisions said the blood samples did not match Hakamada's DNA, and trousers that prosecutors submitted as evidence were too small for Hakamada and did not fit when he tried them on. Japan and the United States are the only two countries in the Group of Seven advanced nations that retain capital punishment. A survey by the Japanese government showed an overwhelming majority of the public support executions. Executions are carried out in secrecy in Japan and prisoners are not informed of their fate until the morning they are hanged. In 2007, Japan began disclosing the names of those executed and some details of their crimes, but disclosures are still limited. Supporters say Hakamada's nearly half-century detention has taken a toll on his mental health. Most of his time behind bars was spent in solitary confinement, in fear of execution. He spent a total of 48 years in prison, more than 45 of them on death row. His sister Hideko Hakamada has devoted around half of her life to win his innocence. Before Thursday's ruling, she said she was in a never-ending battle. 'It is so difficult to get a retrial started,' she told reporters in Tokyo. 'Not just Iwao, but I'm sure there are other people who have been wrongly accused and crying. … I want the criminal law revised so that retrials are more easily available.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/japanese-court-acquits-former-boxer-in-a-1966-murder-retrial/7799995.html	2024-09-25T23:46:21-07:00	
Hong Kong welcomes new giant pandas gifted by Beijing	HONG KONG — Hong Kong welcomed a new pair of giant pandas gifted by Beijing on Thursday with a lavish ceremony, raising hopes for a boost to the city's tourism. An An and Ke Ke are the third pair of giant pandas to be sent to the city from mainland China since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Their arrival came after their new neighbor, Ying Ying, gave birth to twins last month and became the world's oldest first-time panda mother on record. With the addition of the new bears, the twins, and their father, Le Le, Hong Kong now houses six pandas. Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said An An is a 5-year-old male panda who is agile, intelligent and active, while Ke Ke, a 5-year-old female, is good at climbing, cute and has a gentle temperament. The new arrivals will undergo two months of quarantine and adapt to their new home at Ocean Park, a zoo and aquarium that has long been a favorite of residents and tourists. Lee expressed hope that the public could meet the new bears in mid-December. In October, the government will invite residents to propose new names that showcase the pandas' characteristics. Tourism industry representatives are optimistic about the potential impact of housing six pandas, hoping it will boost visitor numbers in Hong Kong. Officials have encouraged businesses to capitalize on the popularity of the new bears and newborn cubs to seize opportunities in what some lawmakers have dubbed the 'panda economy.' Pandas are widely considered China's unofficial national mascot. The country's giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing's soft-power diplomacy. Giant pandas are only found in China's southwest and their population is under threat from development. But caring for pandas in captivity is expensive. A zoo in Finland agreed with Chinese authorities to return two loaned giant pandas to China more than eight years ahead of schedule because they were too costly for the facility to maintain amid declining visitors. Hong Kong's Ocean Park has been hosting pandas since 1999, when the first pair, An An and Jia Jia, arrived in the financial hub shortly after it was handed back to China. Jia Jia, who died at 38 in 2016, is the world's oldest-ever panda to have lived in captivity. The average lifespan for a panda in the wild is 18 to 20 years, while in captivity it's 30 years, according to the Guinness World Records.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-welcomes-new-giant-pandas-gifted-by-beijing/7799992.html	2024-09-25T23:31:12-07:00	
Deadly Thai floods intensified by climate change, La Niña displace 150,000 families	CHIANG RAI, Thailand — The severe and prolonged flooding that has deluged Thailand is devastating hundreds of thousands of residents and prompting calls for long-term solutions, including measures to mitigate the long-term impact of climate change. Thailand suffers from an annual monsoon season from July to October. Although floods are common nationwide, authorities say this year has been the worst in decades. Thanapon Piman, senior research fellow, SEI Asia Center, says climate change has contributed to the flooding. 'Climate change and La Niña ... cause heavy rainfall over the region more than normal condition. For example, the monthly rainfall in Chiang Rai in August is higher [than] normal [by] 40% to 50%. Mae Sai has faced flooding six times in a month, which never happened before,' he told VOA. The La Niña phenomenon is the natural cooling of the water in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. It occurs every few years and affects weather worldwide. Thanapon said authorities knew La Niña would make this season wetter than normal, but not that it would be so extreme. 'This is certainly caused by climate changes.' The floods were exacerbated by Typhoon Yagi, which rampaged through Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries in mid-September. Upwards of 150,000 families have been affected by the floods in Thailand, with 46 killed, according to Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department. 'It triggered severe flash floods and mudslides over the north region. As the result of heavy rainfall since August, land turned into saturated soil. Thus, when the heavy rainfall from the Yagi Typhoon hit the region, it caused the extreme flooding,' Thanapon said. 'Flooding and extreme events happen [not] only [in] Thailand but also happen in Vietnam, the Philippines, Laos and Myanmar.' In Chiang Mai, the second largest city in Thailand, floods have intensified in recent days. Direct daily train service between Bangkok and Chiang Mai was temporarily affected by a landslide, while roads were flooded. In Chiang Rai itself, the flooding has been a problem for weeks, with at least 1,268 families affected. Residents told VOA that the floods were waist-deep and even though they have subsided, foot-deep water remains in the streets while buildings are clogged with sludgy mud. Chalermpon 'Por' Thungkham owns a congee restaurant in Chiang Rai with his mother and father. He says the floods have ruined his home and business. 'The stuff for the food to prepare got damaged, the electricity got cut, everything is ruined inside. It was like this for three days until it got back to ‘normal,’ but then there was the mud. We wanted to clean the mud, but we didn’t have the water supply,' he told VOA. He said his breakfast shop usually brings in around $30 per day, but the damage to his facilities is equal to a year’s worth of income. His family has been relying on aid trucks to bring everyday supplies. 'The flooding has caused more than maybe 300,000 THB ($9,168) of damage. The car, the furniture we need to fix. It will take one month to clean and re-open the restaurant,' he added. Fifty miles north in Mae Sai, on the border with Myanmar, relatives of the city’s residents have come from around the country to help repair and clean up ruined homes. One of those is Sky, a hairdresser who works in Bangkok. 'I came back to Chiang Rai because I was worried about my mother and child who were trapped in our house for three days during the flooding,' she told VOA. 'We still have mud on both sides of the house, and there is still mud in the kitchen and bathroom that needs to be cleaned. We have to wait for clean water.' The Wat Tham Pha Chom Buddhist Temple has become a makeshift shelter for hundreds of residents in Mae Sai. Situated on a hill, the religious sanctuary has been largely unaffected by the floods. 'After the big flooding, the people came to stay here,' said Phra Manatcha Pothisam, a monk and acting director of Wat Tham Pha Chom, who spoke to VOA amid stacked water containers and piles of second-hand clothes for those in need. 'There was around 300 people, men and women are separated, but we provide food for meals, drinking water, and some clothes. This is from donations and government subsidies. Right now there are 150 people live here,' he said. 'Many of the villagers were very scared. This temple is the place for meditation [and] has been supported by the people, so we need to give back.' Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who became Thailand’s 31st prime minister in August, has said the government’s top priority is addressing the flooding, and called for the mud to be cleared in Chiang Rai promptly. Economically, the floods could cause Thailand up to $176 million in damages, Thailand’s Chamber of Commerce has estimated. But Arisara Lekkham, a lecturer at the School of Law at the Mae Fah Luang University in Chiang Rai insists Thailand needs a long-term plan to combat the flooding. 'Flood management should become a regular, year-round effort rather than a reactive, seasonal approach,' she told VOA. 'Many houses are damaged, and it will take months before people can return to their homes. It is proposed that the government implement additional relief measures for the affected people. The lessons learned from the Chiang Rai floods should be applied to other areas currently facing flood problems, especially regarding early warning systems,' she added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-thai-floods-intensified-by-climate-change-la-ni%c3%b1a-displace-150-000-families/7799976.html	2024-09-25T22:31:07-07:00

UK foreign secretary: ‘We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Ukrainians’	NEW YORK — Among the issues on the agenda for world leaders who gathered this week for the United Nations General Assembly is Russia’s war against Ukraine. In an interview in New York with VOA’s Ukrainian Service, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said his nation stands 'shoulder-to-shoulder with the Ukrainians' and will provide Ukraine with military aid for 'as long as it takes' to help it 'stand off this aggression.' He also cited intelligence findings that Russian President Vladimir Putin is facing mounting problems, with a deteriorating economy and mounting battlefield losses. The following has been edited for length and clarity. VOA: Have you had the chance to discuss with your counterparts in other countries, including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the issue of lifting restrictions on Ukraine using long-range Western missiles against targets inside Russia? U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy: It was very important for me to be with Secretary Blinken in Ukraine just two weeks ago to see for ourselves, to discuss with [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy ... also to discuss Ukraine’s needs as they head out of the autumn into the winter, and that we continue as allies to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position to stand off this aggression that we're seeing from Vladimir Putin. That was why I also went to the White House with [U.K.] Prime Minister [Keir] Starmer. We remain in the U.K. absolutely clear that we stand shoulder to shoulder with the Ukrainians. It's important that Ukraine has the finances and the money, the military aid, as well as the political, diplomatic and humanitarian aid, to get through 2025. And of course, here at the U.N. General Assembly, I will meet with Zelenskyy once again today. But, also, it's hugely important that we rally the Global South to ensure that they're not falling into the trap of Russian propaganda … and efforts to destabilize [and distract] the international community … when in fact what they are doing is taking ballistic missiles from Iran to use against [Ukrainian] men, women and children. VOA: You’ve already mentioned this meeting between Prime Minister Keir Starmer and U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington. Can you share the details of the conversation? Lammy: I do think it is very important for us in the U.K. and Europe, and of course in the United States, to understand more the details of President Zelenskyy’s 'victory plan.' And over the coming days, he will present that in detail to close allies. And of course, I’m not going to speculate what’s in the papers … because I don’t want to give any advantage to Vladimir Putin. But I am really clear that this is a time for Western allies to show nerve and guts, because Vladimir Putin thinks that we’ll get distracted. He thinks that we haven’t got the attention span to stand with our Ukrainian friends. That’s why we in the U.K. have found 3 billion pounds for Ukraine to buy and have the military equipment it needs, not just this year, [but] for every year as long as it takes. And that’s what I said to my G7 allies last night when I met with them. That’s the position we’ve got to ensure Ukraine is in. VOA: When do you think this crucial decision could be made? Lammy: We meet here in the U.N. General Assembly. I know that President Zelenskyy is meeting with President Biden a little bit later in the week also in Washington. We will head on to the G20 [summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, November 18-19, 2024] as well. So, over the coming days and weeks, I expect us to be in a very strong position to ensure that Ukraine is in the best position it can be as we head into that tough winter in 2025. And let's just be clear about what I mean by that. All of our intelligence actually suggests things are going to get a lot tougher for Vladimir Putin as he comes out of next year. His economy is in trouble. He's going to find it very problematic with the amount of losses and casualties that he's taking. And actually, when you look at what Ukraine is doing — their ability to take back half the ground that's been lost, their ability to repel him from the Black Sea, their ability to advance in Kursk and hopefully keep the ground — this is a time for Western countries to show their nerve and to be absolutely committed as we head out of the autumn into the winter period. VOA: What do you say to people, including leaders, who warn that allowing Ukraine to use long-range weapons to strike inside Russia could lead to a third world war? Lammy: Well, we’re really clear that under the U.N. Charter and under Article 51, Ukraine has the right to defend itself, to defend itself against the horrendous attacks that are coming from Russia, and we will do all we can within international law and the rules of engagement to support Ukraine to defend itself. VOA: You said that the war between Russia and Ukraine is likely to continue for at least another two years. Will Ukraine and the West will have enough to stand so long? Lammy: Let’s be clear: The war could end tomorrow if Putin left. That’s how it ends: Leave Ukraine. But in the absence of Putin showing any desire to negotiate, we have to continue to stand with Ukraine, because the cost of not standing with Ukraine would actually be financially far greater. You know, defense spending would rise substantially across all Western allies, and indeed, there will be a very vulnerable Baltic frontier in relation to Putin's threats. So, that is why we stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. And I'm quite sure that ... this war will only be settled in the end politically, of course. That also gets into the security guarantees that Ukraine needs. And we've always believed in the U.K. that that path to Ukraine joining NATO is a very important dimension of that security guarantee.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-foreign-secretary-we-stand-shoulder-to-shoulder-with-the-ukrainians-/7799955.html	2024-09-25T20:56:03-07:00

Harris promises tax breaks, investments for US manufacturers	PITTSBURGH — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said on Wednesday she would offer tax credits to domestic manufacturers and invest in sectors that will 'define the next century,' as she detailed her economic plan to boost the U.S. middle class. Speaking at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, the Democratic candidate in the November 5 presidential election said she would give tax credits to U.S. manufacturers for retooling or rebuilding existing factories and expanding 'good union jobs,' and double the number of registered apprenticeships during her first term. Harris also promised new investments in industries like bio-manufacturing, aerospace, artificial intelligence and clean energy. Harris' speech, which lasted just under 40 minutes, did not detail how these policies would work. She highlighted her upbringing by a single mother, in contrast with former President Donald Trump, the wealthy son of a New York real estate developer. 'I have pledged that building a strong middle class will be the defining goal of my presidency,' Harris said, adding that she sees the election as a moment of choice between two 'fundamentally different' visions of the U.S. economy held by her and her Republican opponent, Trump. The vice president and Trump are focusing their campaign messaging on the economy, which Reuters/Ipsos polling shows is voters' top concern, as the election approaches. The divide between rich and poor has grown in recent decades. The share of American households in the middle class, defined as those with two-thirds to double that of median household income, has dropped from around 62% in 1970 to 51% in 2023, Pew Research shows. These households' income has also not grown as fast as those in the top tier. Harris said she was committed to working with the private sector and entrepreneurs to help grow the middle class. She told the audience that she is 'a capitalist' who believes in 'free and fair markets,' and described her policies as pragmatic rather than rooted in ideology. Harris in recent months has blunted Trump's advantage on the economy, with a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Tuesday showing the Republican candidate with a marginal advantage of 2 percentage points on 'the economy, unemployment and jobs,' down from an 11-point lead in late July. Trump discussed his economic plan in North Carolina on Wednesday and said Harris' role as vice president gave her the chance now to improve the economic record of the Biden administration. 'Families are suffering now. So if she has a plan, she should stop grandstanding and do it,' he said. While Trump has proposed across-the-board tariffs on foreign-made goods -- a proposal backed by a slim majority of voters -- Harris is focusing on providing incentives for businesses to keep their operations in the U.S. Boosting American manufacturing in industries such as semiconductors and bringing back jobs that have moved overseas in recent decades have also been major goals for Biden. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act -- all passed in 2021 and 2022 -- fund a range of subsidies and tax incentives that encourage companies to place projects in disadvantaged regions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-promises-tax-breaks-investments-for-us-manufacturers/7799930.html	2024-09-25T19:53:41-07:00	
Hurricane Helene is expected to hit Florida as a major storm, strike far inland	TALLAHASSEE, Florida — An enormous Hurricane Helene swamped parts of Mexico on Wednesday as it churned on a path forecasters said would take it to Florida as a potentially catastrophic storm with a surge that could swallow entire homes, a chilling warning that sent residents scrambling for higher ground, closed schools, and led to states of emergency throughout the Southeast. Helene's center was about 735 kilometers southwest of Tampa, Florida, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, and the hurricane was expected to intensify and accelerate as it crosses the Gulf of Mexico toward the Big Bend area of Florida's northwestern coast. Landfall was expected sometime Thursday evening, and the hurricane center said by then it could be a major Category 4 storm with winds above 208 kph. Tropical storm conditions were expected in southern Florida on Wednesday night, spreading northward and encompassing the rest of Florida as well as Georgia and South Carolina through Thursday night. The storm was moving north at 19 kph with top sustained winds of 140 kph Wednesday evening. Helene could create a life-threatening storm surge as high as 6.1 meters in parts of the Big Bend region, forecasters said. Its tropical storm-force winds extended as far as 555 kilometers from its center. The fast-moving storm's wind and rain also could penetrate far inland: The hurricane center posted hurricane warnings well into Georgia and tropical storm warnings as far north as North Carolina, and it warned that much of the Southeast could experience prolonged power outages, toppled trees and dangerous flooding. 'Just hope and pray that everybody's safe,' said Connie Dillard, of Tallahassee, as she shopped at a grocery store with thinning shelves of water and bread before hitting the highway out of town. 'That's all you can do.' One insurance firm, Gallagher Re, is expecting billions of dollars in damage in the U.S. Around 18,000 linemen from out of state staged in Florida, ready to help restore power. Airports in St. Petersburg, Tallahassee and Tampa were planning to close on Thursday, and 62 hospitals, nursing homes and assisted living facilities evacuated their residents Wednesday. Georgia activated 250 National Guard soldiers for rapid deployment. State game wardens, foresters and Department of Correction teams will help provide swift-water rescues and other emergency responses. State meteorologist Will Lanxton said tropical storm-force winds are expected throughout Georgia. Lanxton said metro Atlanta hasn't seen sustained tropical storm winds since Hurricane Irma in 2017. 'I think we're going to see some significant power outages, probably nothing like we've seen, because it's 159 counties wide,' said James Stallings, director of the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency. In Tallahassee, where stations started to run out of gas, 19-year-old Florida A&M student Kameron Benjamin filled sandbags with his roommate to protect their apartment before evacuating. Their school and Florida State shut down. 'This hurricane is heading straight to Tallahassee, so I really don't know what to expect,' Benjamin said. As Big Bend residents battened down their homes, many saw the ghost of 2018's Hurricane Michael. That storm rapidly intensified and crashed ashore as a Category 5 that laid waste to Panama City and parts of the rural Panhandle. On Wednesday, the National Weather Service posted an urgent warning for residents along Apalachee Bay: 'There is a danger of catastrophic and unsurvivable storm surge for Apalachee Bay,' it said. 'Storm surge may begin to arrive as early as late Wednesday night ahead of the winds. This forecast, if realized, is a nightmare surge scenario for Apalachee Bay. Please, please, please take any evacuation orders seriously!' 'People are taking heed and hightailing it out of there for higher ground,' said Kristin Korinko, a Tallahassee resident who serves as the commodore of the Shell Point Sailboard Club, on the Gulf Coast about 48 kilometers south of Tallahassee. For toughened Floridians who are used to hurricanes, Robbie Berg, a national warning coordinator for the hurricane center, advised: 'Please do not compare it to other storms you may have experienced over the past year or two.' Helene is forecast to be one of the largest storms in breadth in years to hit the region, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. He said since 1988, only three Gulf hurricanes were bigger than Helene's predicted size: 2017's Irma, 2005's Wilma and 1995's Opal. Areas 160 kilometers north of the Georgia-Florida line can expect hurricane conditions. More than half of Georgia's public school districts and several universities canceled classes. And for Atlanta, which is under a tropical storm watch, Helene could be the worst strike on a major Southern inland city in 35 years, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd. 'It's going to be a lot like Hugo in Charlotte,' Shepherd said of the 1989 storm that struck the North Carolina city, knocking out power to 85% of customers as winds gusted above hurricane force. Landslides were possible in southern Appalachia, with catastrophic flooding predicted in the Carolinas and Georgia, where all three governors declared emergencies. Rainfall is possible as far away as Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana. Parts of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula were under hurricane warnings as Helene wound between it and the western tip of Cuba and into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm formed Tuesday in the Caribbean, and it flooded streets and toppled trees as it passed offshore and brushed the resort city of Cancun. In Cuba, authorities moved cattle to higher ground and medical brigades went to communities often cut off by storms. The government preventively shut off power in some communities as waves as high as 5 meters slammed Cortes Bay. In the Cayman Islands, schools remained closed as residents pumped water from flooded homes. In the U.S., federal authorities positioned generators, food and water, along with search-and-rescue and power restoration teams. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that Helene could be as strong as a Category 4 hurricane when it makes landfall. The state was providing buses to evacuate people in the Big Bend region and taking them to shelters in Tallahassee. But near Florida's center, outside Orlando, Walt Disney World said its only closures Thursday would be the Typhoon Lagoon water park and its miniature golf courses. Helene is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures. In the Pacific, former Hurricane John reformed Wednesday as a tropical storm and was strengthening as it threatened areas of Mexico's western coast. Officials posted hurricane warnings for southwestern Mexico. John hit the country's southern Pacific coast late Monday, killing at least two people, triggering mudslides, and damaging homes and trees. It grew into a Category 3 hurricane in a matter of hours and made landfall east of Acapulco. It reemerged over the ocean after weakening inland.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-helene-is-expected-to-hit-florida-as-a-major-storm-strike-far-inland/7799918.html	2024-09-25T19:32:42-07:00

Tunisia presidential candidate sentenced to six months in prison	tunis, tunisia — A Tunisian court sentenced presidential candidate Ayachi Zammel to six months in prison on Wednesday on charges of falsifying documents, his lawyer told Reuters, the second prison sentence against him in a week, days before the presidential election. The verdict highlights rising tensions ahead of the election, amid opposition and civil society groups' fears of a rigged election aimed at keeping President Kais Saied in power. Zammel was sentenced to 20 months in prison last week on charges of falsifying popular endorsements. 'It is another unjust ruling and a farce that clearly aims to weaken him in the election race, but we will defend his right to the last minute,' Zammel attorney Abdessattar Massoudi told Reuters. Zammel was among only three admitted candidates competing for the position of president alongside incumbent Saied and Zouhair Magzhaoui. Political tensions in the North African country have risen ahead of the October 6 election since an electoral commission named by Saied disqualified three prominent candidates this month amid protests by opposition and civil society groups.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tunisia-presidential-candidate-sentenced-to-six-months-in-prison/7799885.html	2024-09-25T18:23:39-07:00

Hong Kong court to sentence 2 former editors found guilty of sedition in landmark case	HONG KONG — A Hong Kong court is due to sentence two former editors on Thursday who have been found guilty of sedition after publishing articles about the national security crackdown in the city under China — a ruling that has prompted an international outcry. In a landmark case about media freedom, Chung Pui-kuen and Patrick Lam of the now-defunct Stand News media outlet were convicted last month — the first time that journalists have been found guilty of sedition since the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997. Chung, 55, and Lam, 36, had pleaded not guilty. Stand News, once Hong Kong's leading online media outlet, was known for its hard-hitting reports about the city's 2019 pro-democracy protests and later the national security crackdown. Under Hong Kong law, they could be jailed for up to two years. Liz Throssell, a spokesperson for the U.N. Human Rights Office, said the office was calling on Hong Kong authorities to review the court's decision in line with obligations under international human rights law. Twenty-three member states of the Media Freedom Coalition, including the U.S., U.K. and Canada, have similarly signed a statement, urging 'Hong Kong and China authorities to abide by their international human rights commitments and legal obligations, and to respect freedom of the press and freedom of speech in Hong Kong.' A spokesperson for Hong Kong's government said in a statement that the government 'strongly disapproved of and rejected the fact-twisting remarks and baseless smears' by the coalition. Hong Kong and Chinese officials have said the security clampdown —which has included tighter laws — has been needed to maintain stability after the pro-democracy protests. During the 57-day trial, the prosecution argued that Stand News had acted as a political platform to promote 'illegal' ideologies and incited readers' hatred against the Chinese and Hong Kong governments. Chung wrote in a letter to the court that some Hong Kongers 'care about the freedom and dignity of everyone in the community and are willing to pay the price of losing their own freedom.' 'Recording and reporting their stories and thoughts truthfully is an unavoidable responsibility for journalists,' Chung wrote. Lam wrote that 'the only way for journalists to defend press freedom is to report.' Stand News was raided by police in December 2021 and its assets were frozen, leading to its closure.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-court-to-sentence-2-former-editors-found-guilty-of-sedition-in-landmark-case/7799855.html	2024-09-25T17:40:05-07:00	
Pakistan's PM Sharif hails IMF's $7B loan approval	islamabad — Pakistan reported Wednesday that the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, had approved a crucial $7 billion loan for the cash-strapped nation struggling to meet its external financing needs. In a statement issued by his office, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif 'expressed satisfaction' and hailed the IMF's approval of the much-needed loan. He also thanked Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF chief, and his own economic team for successfully negotiating the agreement, the statement said. The Washington-based global lender was expected to release a separate statement. Pakistani media reports said the IMF had agreed to the 37-month loan agreement for the South Asian nation under the Extended Fund Facility and authorized the immediate release of the first tranche of nearly $1.1 billion. Sharif, who is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly session, told Pakistani media representatives before Wednesday's approval that his government had met all of the lender's conditions. He stated that the lender had 'set stringent conditions' for the loan program preliminarily agreed to in July. The prime minister credited Pakistan's longtime allies, China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, with helping Islamabad finalize the IMF deal, but he did not elaborate. Pakistan was required to seek an extension on existing $5 billion, $4 billion and $3 billion cash loan agreements from Riyadh, Beijing and Abu Dhabi to fulfill a critical IMF condition. Islamabad reportedly has committed not to repay more than $12 billion in debt to three allied nations and Kuwait during the 37-month IMF program period. The new $7 billion loan is Pakistan's 25th IMF program since it gained independence in 1947 — the highest number acquired by any country. 'We are committed to ensuring this is the last time we seek such financial support from the IMF,' Sharif reiterated while speaking to Pakistani media in New York. However, critics remain skeptical about his assertions. Experts blame chronic economic mismanagement, corruption, repeated dictatorial military regimes, and the failure of successive elected governments to introduce much-needed reforms for the financial troubles facing Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country of more than 240 million people. Islamabad has managed its external funding needs in the past with loans, economic support from its long-standing allies and IMF financial assistance. Historic inflation Experts describe Pakistan's latest economic crisis as the most prolonged. Inflation reached historic levels, pushing the country to the brink of default on its external payments before an IMF bailout helped avert the crisis last summer. Inflation has since eased, and credit ratings agency Moody's has upgraded Pakistan's local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings, citing improved macroeconomic conditions and moderately better government liquidity and external positions. The Sharif administration also has ramped up efforts to increase its tax intake in line with the IMF requirements, despite protests by traders and opposition parties over the new tax scheme and high energy rates. The Asian Development Bank, or ADB, said in a Wednesday report that Pakistan's economic outlook hinges on continued and effective economic reform. It expected the IMF loan program to enhance the country's macroeconomic stability, consolidate public finances, expand social spending and protection, and rebuild foreign exchange, among other things. 'The new government has committed to the necessary stabilization and structural reforms but faces challenges owing to elevated political and institutional tensions and the prospects of social unrest from a steep drop in real incomes,' the ADB warned. Pakistan's economic troubles have deepened because of the political turmoil that hit the country in April 2022 when then-Prime Minister Imran Khan was removed from office through a controversial opposition-led parliamentary vote of no confidence. Khan, who has been imprisoned for more than a year on contentious charges, is the most popular politician in Pakistan. His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Party has been organizing anti-government protests. The party alleges that election authorities rigged the February 8 parliamentary polls to hinder Khan-backed candidates from winning and helped military-backed parties' allies to form a coalition government, charges Sharif and army officials deny. Some information for this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-s-pm-sharif-hails-imf-s-7b-loan-approval/7799560.html	2024-09-25T17:13:28-07:00

Biden reaches out to Africa at UN General Assembly	new york — President Joe Biden is turning to Africa in the sunset of his presidency. In the space of one day, in front of world leaders, he elevated Sudan's conflict to a priority, announced he would travel to Angola and endorsed adding two seats for African countries to the U.N. Security Council. In his valedictory speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Biden made several brief overtures to the African continent — reminding world leaders of the evils of South Africa’s apartheid regime, calling for an end to Sudan’s grueling conflict and citing urgency in combating an mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But these two short lines may have the most weight: 'The U.N. needs to adapt to bring in new voices and new perspectives,' he said. 'That’s why we support reforming and expanding the membership of the U.N. Security Council.' For years, African leaders have called for a seat at this table. But critics point out that Washington does not support a critical privilege enjoyed by the current permanent members of the Security Council: veto power. Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow in the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says African nations are puzzled by Biden’s position. 'This is really, I think, an unfinished project of his, probably more words than reality,' he told VOA. The fact that Biden supported council membership for them but not veto power 'has left Africans scratching their heads.' John Fortier, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said it mattered that Biden used this platform to call for an end to Sudan’s raging 17-month conflict, but he doubted whether that call would provoke action. Trying to elevate issue 'This is one of the conflicts that is serious but has not been getting world attention, and I think his pointing to it is really to elevate it in world consciousness but not yet to really know how we're going to see an end to this,' Fortier said. This conflict has displaced millions of people and sparked a near-famine. And so, analysts say, it matters that the American president is putting pressure on the warring parties. 'I think Biden genuinely wants to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and resolve the conflict in Sudan,' said Daniel Volman, director of the African Security Research Project, in an email to VOA. 'But I think he is reluctant to press countries like Egypt and the [United Arab] Emirates that are arming the generals, because they are key allies during the Gaza war. 'Also, Biden is being driven by pressure from some members of Congress to take stronger and more effective action. I think he will take some limited action, like the new funds for humanitarian aid just announced, but I don't think this will yield significant results.' And finally, Biden’s off-camera announcement that he will visit Angola next month allows him to keep his promise to visit the continent. But again, Hudson wondered how this long-delayed visit would land. 'Coming, as it does, at the very tail end of his administration, without much to, I think, really celebrate in terms of his involvement in Africa, I think the visit will ring rather hollow,' Hudson said. Biden has four months left in his presidency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-reaches-out-to-africa-at-un-general-assembly/7799553.html	2024-09-25T16:45:28-07:00	
Sudan's jailed former strongman Omar al-Bashir moved to better-equipped hospital	cairo — Sudan's former autocratic President Omar al-Bashir, who ruled for 30 years before he was toppled in a popular uprising and then jailed by the country's military rulers, has been transferred to a medical facility in northern Sudan, his lawyer said Wednesday. Since war broke out in April last year between the Sudanese military and its rival, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the 80-year-old al-Bashir has been held at a military facility on the outskirts of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. His lawyer, Mohamed al-Hassan al-Amin, told The Associated Press that al-Bashir was transferred on Tuesday and would get proper care at a better-equipped hospital in the town of Merowe, about 330 kilometers north of Khartoum. Al-Bashir's health had deteriorated recently, the lawyer said, adding that the former strongman suffers from age-related complications and high blood pressure. 'He needs regular checks and follow-ups,' al-Amin said over the phone, 'but his condition is not critical.' Al-Amin said that Sudan's former Defense Minister Abdel-Rahim Muhammad Hussein — who was also arrested soon after al-Bashir — also was transferred to the same facility. He suffers from heart-related problems, the lawyer said. The office of Sudan's military spokesman declined to comment when contacted by the AP. Al-Bashir ruled Sudan for three decades, despite wars and sanctions, before he was overthrown during a popular uprising in 2019. He is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for genocide and other crimes committed during the conflict in Sudan's western Darfur region in the 2000s. The ICC has indicted both al-Bashir and Hussein on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Darfur, where the government's campaign was marked by mass killings, rape, torture and persecution. Some 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes. Sudan's military rulers — now themselves fighting to stay in power in a bitter conflict with the rival RSF — declined ICC requests that al-Bashir and others wanted by the world court be handed over for trial. Al-Bashir, Hussein and others were held in a Khartoum prison before being taken to a fortified military base after the prison was attacked by the RSF in April last year. Another former official, Ahmed Harun, who is also wanted by the ICC, walked away after the prison was attacked. His whereabouts are unknown. The latest war in Sudan has devastated Khartoum and many other urban areas and also has been marked by atrocities, such as mass rape and ethnically motivated killings. The United Nations and international rights groups say these acts also amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in Darfur, which has been facing a bitter onslaught by the RSF. The war has killed at least 20,000 people and left tens of thousands wounded, according to the United Nations. Rights groups and activists say the toll is much higher. The conflict has also forced some 10 million people to flee their homes in Sudan — about a quarter of the country's population, according to the International Organization for Migration. Of them, more than 2 million have been driven abroad, mostly to neighboring Chad, South Sudan and Egypt, the IOM said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-jailed-former-strongman-omar-al-bashir-taken-to-hospital-in-north-for-better-care-/7799517.html	2024-09-25T16:27:40-07:00

A decade after Uyghur scholar's life sentencing, calls for action grow	washington — This week marks 10 years since Ilham Tohti, a 54-year-old Uyghur economist and human rights advocate, was sentenced to life in prison by Chinese authorities. For some, like Enver Can, a 75-year-old German-based Uyghur rights activist who leads an organization advocating for Tohti's release, the fight for his release continues to this day. 'South Africa had Nelson Mandela, India had Mahatma Gandhi, and we Uyghurs have Ilham Tohti,' Can tells VOA. Tohti, a former professor at Minzu University in Beijing, was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2014 on charges of separatism. He is widely recognized for promoting dialogue between Uyghurs and Han Chinese. In 2019, he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the European Parliament. Like Tohti, Can was born in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region where the Uyghur remains imprisoned. At the age of 12, Can fled Xinjiang with his family. In the 1970s, he moved to Germany and worked as a journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty until the early 1990s. In 2016, two years after Tohti's life sentence, Can founded the 'Ilham Tohti Initiative' to campaign for his release. Earlier this month, Can was particularly busy meeting European parliamentarians and other groups to push for Tohti's release from Chinese detention. 'To my knowledge, Ilham Tohti is one of the very few Uyghurs who dared to speak up for Uyghur rights while living under the Chinese regime. He articulated his demands eloquently and clearly, framing them within both international norms and Chinese law,' Can told VOA in a phone interview. EU pressure continues In a statement released on Monday, the European Union reiterated its call for the 'immediate and unconditional release' of Ilham Tohti and other human rights defenders, lawyers, and intellectuals 'arbitrarily detained' in China. 'The imprisonment of Ilham Tohti is representative of the deeply worrying human rights situation in Xinjiang,' the EU said, citing reports from U.N. bodies and the 2022 assessment by the U.N. Human Rights Office. Since Tohti's arrest in 2014, concerns about human rights abuses in Xinjiang have worsened with significant attention drawn to the issue around the beginning of 2017, when reports of mass detentions of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the region started to emerge. Advocacy organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have been vocal about the situation in Xinjiang, with notable reports and statements escalating around 2018. In particular, the U.N. Human Rights Office has issued assessments and reports highlighting the situation, including a U.N. rights report released in August 2022 that detailed human rights violations in Xinjiang. China's response has consistently been to deny these allegations, labeling them as part of a Western agenda to undermine its sovereignty and stability in the region. Can told VOA that the time for mere statements is over. 'Just calling for Ilham Tohti's release is not enough,' he said. 'There have been countless petitions and open letters over the past decade. We need concrete actions.' Can urged tougher measures against China, including sanctions on officials, visa restrictions, and re-negotiating trade terms. China's defense In an email to VOA, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, defended the sentencing of Ilham Tohti, asserting that he is guilty of 'splitting the country' and that the evidence against him is 'conclusive.' 'As a teacher, Ilham Tohti once publicly called terrorist extremists 'heroes', incited, lured and coerced some people to go abroad to participate in the activities of the 'East Turkestan' separatist forces, and planned, organized and carried out a series of criminal activities to split the country,' Liu said. He insisted that China's judicial system acted strictly in accordance with Chinese law and that 'China's internal affairs and judicial sovereignty must not be interfered with.' Jewher Ilham, the daughter of Ilham Tohti and a human rights activist in the U.S., disputed the Chinese government's portrayal of her father's case, asserting that his imprisonment resulted from his peaceful advocacy for marginalized Uyghurs rather than any legal violations. 'A normal and healthy society allows for more than one voice or opinion,' Ilham told VOA. 'The Chinese government did not tolerate different opinions 10 years ago, and it is clear they still do not.' Family's heartbreak Jewher Ilham last saw her father on February 2, 2013, in a Beijing airport interrogation room, where they shared their final goodbye. During that encounter, Ilham urged her to leave China for the U.S., despite the presence of Chinese authorities. 'Look at them, look at how they treat you and me. Do you still want to stay in this country? I would rather you sweep the streets in America than be treated like this here,' Ilham recalled her father's words. At the time, Ilham Tohti was prevented from departing for a year-long visiting scholar position at Indiana University, and those parting words continue to resonate with his daughter to this day. After 11 months of house arrest, Chinese authorities arrested Tohti on January 15, 2014, while Jewher was in the United States. 'On January 15, 2014, over 20 police officers came to arrest my father. My youngest brother was three-and-a-half years old, and the oldest was seven. They were napping when the police broke in and aggressively took him away,' Ilham told VOA in a phone interview. She kept in touch with her family and friends until early 2017, and that's how she learned what had happened. 'My stepmother wasn't home because she was working away. My grandmother found out about my father's arrest later, and she became very sick. I recently heard that my grandmother passed away two years ago,' she said. Eight months later, on September 23, 2014, Chinese authorities sentenced Tohti to life imprisonment on alleged charges of 'splitting the country.' 'September 23 is a devastating date for my family. My father Ilham Tohti was sentenced to life on this date 10 years ago,' Jewher told VOA. 'Just like my father never stopped advocating for the voiceless, I will not stop, no matter what.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-decade-after-uyghur-scholar-s-life-sentencing-calls-for-action-grow/7799489.html	2024-09-25T15:52:07-07:00	
Thousands pour into Syria, fleeing worsening conflict in Lebanon	JDEIDET YABOUS, Syria — Families fleeing the escalating conflict in Lebanon poured into Syria in growing numbers on Wednesday, waiting for hours in heavy traffic to reach the relative safety of another war-torn country. U.N. officials estimated that thousands of Lebanese and Syrian families had already made the journey. Those numbers are expected to grow as Israel targets southern and eastern Lebanon in an aerial bombardment that local officials say has killed more than 600 people this week, at least a quarter of them women and children. Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah fighters and weapons. Lines of buses and cars extended for several kilometers from the Syria border beginning on Monday, and some families were seen making the journey on foot. Once in Syria, people waited hours more to be processed by overwhelmed border officials, and relief workers handed out food, water, mattresses and blankets. 'Many will have to spend the night outdoors waiting their turn,' Rula Amin, a spokesperson for the U.N.'s refugee agency, said in a statement. Amin said some of the people arriving from Lebanon had visible injuries suffered from recent attacks. The cross-border flow was a striking reversal in fortunes given that Lebanon is still hosting more than 1 million Syrian refugees who fled the war in their country that began in 2011. That's when an initially peaceful anti-government uprising was met by a brutal government crackdown and spiraled into an ongoing civil war. In the Syrian border town of Jdeidet Yabous, some families sat glumly on the side of the road when Associated Press journalists visited the area. Some used their bags as seats, waiting for taxis, buses or relatives to pick them up. Many said they had spent eight or nine hours in traffic just to get into Syria. Before crossing the border, crowds packed into a government office to be processed by immigration officers and, in the case of Syrian citizens, to change $100 to Syrian pounds before entering — a measure imposed in an attempt to prop up the local currency by bringing more dollars into the country. Because of the sudden spike in demand, the supply of Syrian pounds at the border ran short. Some were returning refugees, like Emad al-Salim, who had fled Aleppo in 2014. He was living in the southern coastal city of Tyre when Monday's bombardment began. He gathered his wife and six children and fled again. 'There were houses destroyed in front of me as we were coming out,' he said. 'It took us three days to get here.' Nada Hamid al-Lajji returned with her family after seven years in Lebanon with her husband. They are from eastern Syria, but al-Lajji said she doesn't know if they will return there. 'Where am I going to go?' she said. 'I don't even have a house anymore. I don't know where I will go.' Many Lebanese families were also fleeing. Mahmoud Ahmad Tawbeh from the village of Arnoun in the country's south had come with an extended family of 35 people, planning to stay in a rented house in a Damascus suburb. 'We left with difficulty. There were a lot of bombs dropping above our heads,' he said. Five or six houses in the village were destroyed and several neighbors were killed, he said. For many in Lebanon, particularly those living in the Bekaa Valley in the east, Syria appeared to be the quickest route to safety. Israeli strikes across the country this week have wounded more than 2,000. Many of the Lebanese arriving at the border refused to speak to journalists or would not give their full names because of the sensitivity of the situation. One woman from the town of Harouf in southern Lebanon, who gave her family name, Matouk, said she had come with her brother's wife, who is Syrian, to stay with in-laws. Several families near where they lived were killed, she said, and she was worried about her father and siblings who she had left behind. While the war in Syria is ongoing, active fighting has long been frozen in much of the country. Lebanese citizens, who can cross the border without a visa, regularly visit Damascus. And renting an apartment is significantly cheaper in Syria than in Lebanon. Even before the latest escalation, some Lebanese had rented in Syria as a Plan B in case they needed to flee. Apart from those who fled the war, many Syrians come to Lebanon for work or family reasons, and regularly cross the border. However, many of those who came as refugees have been reluctant to return out of fear they could be arrested for real or perceived ties to the opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad or forcibly conscripted to the army. If they leave Lebanon, they could also lose their refugee status. Earlier this week, Assad issued an amnesty for crimes committed before September 22, including for those who dodged compulsory military service. He had issued similar amnesties over the past years, but they largely failed to convince refugees to return, as have efforts by Lebanese authorities to organize 'voluntary return' trips.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-pour-into-syria-fleeing-worsening-conflict-in-lebanon/7799491.html	2024-09-25T15:22:02-07:00	
Mice killing off rare seabirds on remote South African island	johannesburg — South Africa is planning a massive mouse eradication project on a sub-Antarctic island to try to stop the invasive species from wiping out the precious seabirds that nest there. Marion Island, in the southern Indian Ocean almost 2,000 kilometers from Cape Town, is a remote and windswept South African territory that’s home to extensive bird life, including the wandering albatross. But those birds face an unusual threat: predatory mice that have been feasting on their chicks. The mice are an accident of history, but their population has been increased by climate change. 'The mice were introduced accidentally in the early 1800s,' said Anton Wolfaardt, a conservationist who is leading the program to eradicate the mice. 'They came ashore - they were essentially stowaways on the vessels of the early seal hunters that visited the island.' Huge jump in population As the island has grown warmer and drier because of climate change, it has also grown more favorable for the mice. Now, by the end of the summer, the mouse population will have increased by 500 percent, he said. It was only fairly recently that researchers on Marion observed the mice preying on chicks, but the phenomenon has increased. The rodents are such a threat now, Wolfaardt said, 'that experts predict that 19 of the 29 bird species on Marion Island face local extinction in the presence of mice.' Elsa van Ginkel, a researcher who was employed by the University of Pretoria to collect data on the island last year, said the island region was 'truly out of this world. Walking among wandering albatross chicks every day and watching them grow into fledglings - wow, just wow, it’s an absolute privilege.' But they are slowly being wiped out. 'These fledglings have no means of defending themselves from a mouse that actually starts eating it alive,' van Ginkel said. 'It’s quite horrific.' So Birdlife South Africa, a nongovernmental organization, and South Africa’s forest, fisheries and environment department are planning a major intervention to try to save the seabirds and restore the island to its natural state. Wolfaardt is heading the initiative, which is still seeking funding and is scheduled to take place in a few years. 'Very simply, the operation involves broadcasting a specialized rodenticide bait, from bait spreader buckets that are slung beneath helicopters that are guided by GPS technology,' he said. The pellets of rodent poison won’t negatively affect the rest of the flora and fauna on the island, experts say. A similar project has been undertaken before. In the 1940s, feral cats were introduced to Marion Island to try to control the mice, but then the felines started preying on the seabirds. The cats were successfully eradicated in the early 1990s, although that, of course, left the mice to flourish.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mice-killing-off-rare-seabirds-on-remote-south-african-island/7799474.html	2024-09-25T15:04:46-07:00	
Mexico excludes Spanish king from president's swearing-in	Madrid — Mexican president-elect Claudia Sheinbaum angered Spain on Wednesday by barring its King Felipe VI from her swearing-in ceremony, accusing him of failing to acknowledge harm caused by his country's conquest of Mexico five centuries ago. The decision prompted Spain to boycott the event altogether, with its Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez calling the Mexican decision 'inexplicable' and 'totally unacceptable.' Mexico's outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in 2019 sent a letter to the king asking that he 'publicly and officially' acknowledge the 'damage' caused by the 1519-1521 conquest, which resulted in the death of a large part of the country's pre-Hispanic population. 'Unfortunately, this letter was never replied to directly, as should have been the best practice in bilateral relations,' Sheinbaum said in a statement. Mexico had in July invited just Sanchez to the swearing-in ceremony on October 1, the statement added. The Spanish foreign ministry said in a statement that the government 'has decided not to participate in the inauguration at any level.' 'Spain and Mexico are brotherly peoples. We cannot therefore accept being excluded like this,' Sanchez said later in a news conference on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. 'That is why we have made it known to the Mexican government that there will be no diplomatic representative from the Spanish government, as a sign of protest.' Mexico published the guest list a week ago for the inauguration of Sheinbaum, who will be the country's first woman president following her left-wing ruling party's landslide June election victory. King Felipe VI was not on the list, which includes regional leftist leaders, as well as U.S. first lady Jill Biden. Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles told journalists in Madrid on Wednesday: 'The head of state, the king of Spain, always attends all swearing-in ceremonies and therefore we cannot accept that in this case he should be excluded.' While Mexico and Spain have close historical and economic links, relations between the Latin American nation and its former colonial ruler have been strained since Lopez Obrador — an ally of Sheinbaum took office in 2018. He has frequently complained about Spanish companies operating in Mexico and twice declared during his mandate that his country's relations with Spain were 'on pause'. Madrid has rejected his demand for an apology for the events of the Spanish conquest five centuries ago. Sanchez said on Wednesday, without elaborating, that Spain had 'already explained its position on the subject.' The socialist premier expressed 'great frustration' at Sheinbaum's decision, saying that he considered Mexico's leaders to be 'progressive' like his government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-excludes-spanish-king-from-president-swearing-in/7799477.html	2024-09-25T15:04:20-07:00	
Norway arrests Cameroonian 'separatist leader' for crimes against humanity	Oslo, Norway — Norwegian police on Wednesday said they had arrested a man on suspicion of incitement to commit crimes against humanity in Cameroon, where a radio station identified him as 'separatist leader' Lucas Cho Ayaba. The Kripos police unit that deals with war crimes and crimes against humanity said in a statement that it had arrested 'a man in his 50s' on Tuesday, but did not name him. 'Norwegian police have arrested the separatist leader Lucas Cho Ayaba. He is implicated in atrocities committed in the northwest and southwest,' said CRTV radio station. Two sources had earlier told AFP that Ayaba, 52, was the man arrested. Cameroon has been gripped since 2016 by a bloody conflict in its two anglophone regions, in the northwest and southwest, between separatists and state forces. The conflict was sparked by the brutal suppression of peaceful protests in the anglophone regions by long-time President Paul Biya. 'Kripos considers that the suspect is playing a central role in the ongoing armed conflict in Cameroon,' the Norwegian police statement said. The anglophone community, which has long complained of marginalization and discrimination, makes up about 20% of the largely francophone central African country. Ayaba is the leader of the Ambazonia Defense Forces, one of the main armed groups operating in the anglophone areas. International NGOs accuse both the armed separatists and government forces of abuses. More than 6,000 people have been killed and at least a million displaced during the conflict, the International Crisis Group has said. A lawyer representing victims of the conflict filed a complaint in the United States against Ayaba and the Norwegian state. In February, the lawyer, Emmanuel Nsahlai, also petitioned the International Criminal Court to launch an investigation. Ayaba was a former student union activist in the 1990s and holds German nationality. It was the first time that Norway had arrested someone on suspicion of inciting crimes against humanity. If convicted, he could face 30 years in prison.	https://www.voanews.com/a/norway-arrests-cameroonian-separatist-leader-for-crimes-against-humanity-/7799479.html	2024-09-25T15:03:20-07:00	
US House Speaker wants Ukraine's ambassador fired over Zelenskyy ammunition plant visit	Washington — The Republican Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives demanded on Wednesday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fire his ambassador to the United States over Zelenskyy's trip this week to a factory in Pennsylvania. 'I demand that you immediately fire Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova,' Speaker Mike Johnson wrote in a letter to Zelenskyy. Johnson released the letter a day before Zelenskyy was due to visit the U.S. Capitol in Washington for meetings with lawmakers. Johnson was not expected to meet with the Ukrainian leader. The Ukrainian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some Republicans have been fuming over Zelenskyy's visit earlier in his weeklong trip to the United States to an ammunition plant in President Joe Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is one of the swing states seen as crucial to victory in the November 5 presidential election. During the trip, Zelenskyy also met with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Senator Bob Casey and U.S. Representative Matt Cartwright, who are all Democrats. Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris, is the Democratic candidate running against Republican former President Donald Trump in the race for the White House. 'The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because — on purpose — no Republicans were invited,' Johnson wrote. 'The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,' he said. The Republican-led House Oversight Committee had already announced that it would investigate whether Zelenskyy's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris' campaign. It is common practice for governors to meet with foreign leaders who travel to their states. In July, Zelenskyy visited a factory in Utah and was hosted by that state's Republican governor, Spencer Cox.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-speaker-wants-ukraine-ambassador-fired-over-zelenskyy-ammunition-plant-visit/7799471.html	2024-09-25T14:46:47-07:00	
Namibia begins restorative justice for descendants of genocide	Windhoek, Namibia — The Namibian government is welcoming back nearly 100 Batswana of Herero descent to their ancestral land, marking a significant moment in the ongoing process of restorative justice for the descendants of those who fled German South West Africa — now Namibia — during the 1904-1908 genocide. Fleeing German aggression, many sought refuge in then Bechuanaland — what's now known as Botswana. As part of this effort, Namibia has made five commercial farms available for their resettlement, a step toward reconciliation and healing. John Kandjii and other elders of his clan have gathered at the Dobe Border Post, a transit area for immigration between Botswana and Namibia. His role today is the lighting of the 'Holy Fire,' where he calls upon the elders who have already departed the earthly realm to guide and protect them at this significant occasion which marks the return of the descendants of the Ovaherero who fled their ancestral land more than 120 years ago. 'They were one — I am sure that they were one at that time — but now we are having borders, there is a difference,' said Kandjii. 'This is a different country; Namibia is alone, but communication they are together, those countries … you understand what I am saying.' Kandjii explained to VOA how the formation of the Nation State and the Berlin Conference separated the Ovaherero from each other which could have been a good thing because the Ovaherero from Namibia had somewhere to flee to during the 1904-1908 genocide which decreased their population by an estimated 80%. Although Namibia was prepared to receive 98 returnees, only 50 crossed the border on Friday. Some are still waiting for the quarantine clearance for their livestock before they can cross the border. James Uerikua is the governor of the region where the returnees were received and where some will be relocated. 'They will be settled in Otjozondjupa region, in Omaheke region and in the Hardap region because the government of the Republic of Namibia in preparation to receiving you brothers and sisters efforts were made at high level and a reception area was created at Gam measuring about 20 hectares,' he said. The 20 hectares at Gam will be treated as a transit camp for returnees to adapt to life in Namibia before moving to the commercial farms they have been allocated by the government. At the settlement in Gam, the returnees will be issued hospital cards and proper identification documents. Their children will be placed into Namibian schools. Officials have promised that potable water, sewage and electricity will be available in Gam as soon as possible.

US House passes temporary bill to avoid government shutdown	Washington — The House has passed a temporary measure that would keep federal agencies funded when the new fiscal year begins next Tuesday while punting final spending decisions for the next budget year until after the Nov. 5 election. The stopgap measure, approved Wednesday by a 341-82 vote, generally funds agencies at current levels through Dec. 20. But an additional $231 million was included to bolster the Secret Service after the two assassination attempts against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Money was also added to aid with the presidential transition, among other things. The bill will next move to the Senate for final approval. Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, said that he had reached agreement ensuring passage will happen quickly. 'This is how things should be done,' Schumer said. 'Without brinkmanship, without delay.' House Speaker Mike Johnson, billed the measure as doing 'only what's absolutely necessary,' a statement directed at members of his own conference concerned about spending levels. Still, it's a no-go for some Republicans, which forced House Republican leadership to rely on Democratic votes to pass the bill through a process that requires at least two-thirds support from voting members. Johnson said the only alternative to the continuing resolution at this stage would have been a government shutdown. 'It would be political malpractice to shut the government down,' Johnson said. 'I think everyone understands that.' The House floor was largely empty during debate on the measure. Lawmakers in both chambers are anxious to return to their home states and districts to campaign, smoothing the path for passage of a temporary funding fix. But more arduous fiscal negotiations await them at the end of the year. Under terms of a previous deal to avoid a federal default and allow the government to continue paying its bills, spending for defense and nondefense programs would rise 1% next year. The Senate has been charting a course to go above that level, while House Republicans have been voting for steep cuts to many nondefense programs, and they have attached policy mandates to the spending bills that Democrats overwhelmingly oppose. So a final agreement will be difficult to reach. In the meantime, the temporary bill will mostly fund the government at current levels, with a few exceptions like the funding infusion for the Secret Service. The $231 million for the Secret Service does come with strings attached. It's contingent upon the agency complying with congressional oversight. The bill also allows the Secret Service to spend its allocations faster if needed. 'Everybody understands that's critically important right now,' Johnson said of the Secret Service money. Trump thanked lawmakers for the extra Secret Service funding at a campaign event Wednesday. He had earlier called on Republicans not to move forward on a spending bill without also including a requirement that people provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote. That legislation failed in the House last week. In a recent letter, the Secret Service told lawmakers that a funding shortfall was not the reason for lapses in Trump's security when a gunman climbed onto an unsecured roof on July 13 at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and opened fire. But acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., also made clear the agency had 'immediate needs' and that he's talking to Congress. The continuing resolution is needed because Congress is nowhere close to completing work on the dozen annual appropriations bills that fund much of the federal government. The House has passed five of the 12 bills, mostly along party lines. The Senate has passed zero. Republicans blame the current impasse on Senate Democrats for not putting the dozen appropriations bills on the Senate floor for a vote, where they then could be reconciled with the House bills during negotiations. But Democrats counter that House Republicans are acting in bad faith, bogging the process down by undercutting an agreement that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy negotiated with the White House over spending caps for the 2024 and 2025 budget years. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democratic member of the House Appropriations Committee, said her party will accept nothing less than the 1% increase specified in that agreement. Also, if Republicans seek more than that for defense, there must be 'dollar for dollar parity for nondefense,' she said. 'We know where we have to end up. And it is my hope that this bill will provide the bipartisan momentum needed to get there,' DeLauro said. The White House called on both chambers to pass the stopgap bill, while cautioning that it did not provide adequate funding to help communities recover from natural disasters and failed to include enough funding for health care provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs. Still, the administration called for swift passage to 'avoid a costly, unnecessary Government shutdown' and to ensure adequate time for passing the full-year spending package. Johnson warned that when the new extension expires in December, he will not support a massive, catchall bill to fund the government, referred to as an omnibus, so another stopgap may be needed that would allow the new president and Congress to have the final say on fiscal year 2025 spending levels. 'I have no intention of going back to that terrible tradition,' Johnson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-passes-temporary-bill-to-avoid-government-shutdown/7799439.html	2024-09-25T14:28:59-07:00

Haiti's leader says nation far from winning gang war as UN deadline looms	NEW YORK — Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille said on Wednesday that the Caribbean country was a long way from winning its war against armed gangs that control most of the capital, as a United Nations deadline for long-delayed support fast approaches. 'We are nowhere near winning this, and the simple reality is that we won't without your help,' Conille said at an event on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. 'There is a sense of urgency because the Haitian people are watching with cautious optimism, they're really hoping to see clear results,' he said. Haiti is currently facing a gang attack at the capital's main port, Conille said, the key entry point for funding and goods. A shipping official told Reuters this week that ships were being shot at, preventing them from docking and unloading containers, while authorities have reported the kidnapping of two Filipino crew members from a cargo vessel in the port. Haiti's main seaports and international airport closed for nearly three months earlier this year after violence escalated at the end of February, an outbreak that saw thousands broken out of prison and the last prime minister resign. 'We worry that without the urgent implication of everyone to support this effort, we will lose the little success that we've been able to obtain at a very large price,' Conille said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier announced sanctions against former deputy Prophane Victor and gang leader Luckson Elan for their role in human rights abuses, as well as $160 million in assistance for Haiti, and called for further support of the U.N.-backed international security mission. About 10 countries have together pledged over 3,100 troops, but only around 400 have deployed. The U.N.'s one-year mandate expires in early October and the U.N. Security Council is set to vote on Sept. 30 on whether to renew it. While countries have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars, both the U.N. mission trust fund and humanitarian plan remain drastically underfunded. Musalia Mudavadi, an official from Kenya, which is leading the mission, said the current funds were not enough to sustain the current deployment, let alone the thousands of troops that were promised. 'We encourage all the countries that have pledged troops to move with speed,' he said. The number of people internally displaced has nearly doubled in the last six months, according to U.N. estimates, now surpassing 700,000. Around half the country is going hungry. Conille's government is also tasked with arranging the first elections since 2016. His predecessor repeatedly delayed a vote, saying a free and fair process could not take place under the existing insecurity. The United States, the mission's top financial backer, has pushed for elections by next year. Conille said that while far more security was needed, Haiti is already investing half of an estimated $140 million needed to hold a referendum on the Constitution in February and elections in November 2025. Conille said he was 'quite confident' that they would be able to hold the votes despite the insecurity but warned that this would not be possible if commitments enabling the mission's full deployment are not kept.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-s-leader-says-nation-far-from-winning-gang-war-as-un-deadline-looms/7799444.html	2024-09-25T14:26:35-07:00	
Report: Increasing women’s participation in workforce could boost Africa's GDP	nairobi, kenya — A report commissioned by the Mastercard Foundation says that increasing women's participation in Africa's formal workforce could boost the continent's economy by approximately $287 billion by 2030, boosting GDP by 5 percent. The report, Young Women in Africa: Agents of Economic Growth and Transformation by 2030, was conducted in collaboration with the McKinsey & Company consulting firm. Released last week, it examines the impact, challenges and contributions of women in the African labor force. The report says young women are important contributors to the African economy, yet their role has been trending downward. Women's contribution to Africa's GDP declined from 18 percent in 2000 to just 11 percent in 2022, the report says. Marguerita Bagulo is one of the millions of women employed in and contributing to the growth of African economies. She works as a customer service representative for a company in Ghana. She says her company promotes gender equality and that women fight for their jobs. 'I was lucky to be in a place where your gender is not really a problem,' Bagulo said. 'And it’s great, because we are given the same opportunity that our male counterparts are being given, and that, in turn, gives us the opportunity to stand up for ourselves and better ourselves in order to compete on the same level as our male counterparts.' In Namibia, despite government policies aimed at increasing women's participation in the economic sector, their participation rate has risen only 2 percentage points, to 42 percent, over five years, according to the report. The report notes 10 countries, most from eastern and western Africa, have the potential to achieve faster economic growth if they prioritize gender equality. However, persistent obstacles continue to keep many women out of the labor force. Wacu Mureithi, an entrepreneur in Kenya, says she could not continue with her hair product business because of family commitments. 'Business is hard for everyone, man and woman, but I think a woman has a bigger challenge, because sometimes, looking for business opportunities, you are trading for sexual favors instead of doing the work,' Mureithi says. 'But my biggest problem has been balancing trying to be mum and dad and at the same time being an entrepreneur. I felt I was losing on parenting, because I was busy with meetings all the time.' Mureithi has returned to a university to pursue further studies to better her life and that of her family. Samuel Nyandemo, a lecturer on economics at the University of Nairobi, says more girls and women are enrolling in universities to increase their chances of joining the labor force, which is dominated by men. 'What they are mostly doing, they are in the hospitality industry, and some are in the managerial sector,' he says. 'In any case, you can see now when it comes to enrollment in universities, the number is now increasing, which means that in terms of job skills, they are acquiring a lot of job skills that are empowering them to spearhead most of the management positions within African economies.' The Mastercard Foundation says private sector-led approaches, such as investing in after-school care led by young women, could create 3.2 million jobs. The researchers say women also need government-funded initiatives to expand centers to improve child care initiatives, while the private sector can help by offering technical support, resources and low-interest loans. At least 26 percent of girls complete their secondary education, but unpaid care work keeps 35 percent to 40 percent of women from employment, the report notes. It says that in 2021, 66 percent of women lacked access to a bank account, while 13 percent had access to formal credit, versus 16 percent for men. Lower access to financial services for women is blamed on the types of businesses run by women, which are seen as paying less and lacking income stability. Nyandemo says governments need to create programs that make it easier for women to participate in the economic sector. 'There should be affirmative action that spearheads the aspect of gender equality,' he says. 'Create more opportunities for women and empower them both economically and politically, and more so, invest heavily in training them in various small-scale business enterprises. Equip them with entrepreneurial skills and management skills.' The Mastercard Foundation plans to invest $360 million to help more than 70,000 young women and girls complete their education, start businesses and find job opportunities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-increasing-women-s-participation-in-workforce-could-boost-africa-s-gdp-/7799423.html	2024-09-25T14:06:04-07:00	
Zoo in Finland with financial woes to return giant pandas to China	HELSINKI — A zoo in Finland has agreed with Chinese authorities to return two loaned giant pandas to China more than eight years ahead of schedule because they have become too expensive for the facility to maintain as the number of visitors has declined. The private Ahtari Zoo in central Finland some 330 kilometers north of Helsinki said Wednesday on its Facebook page that the female panda Lumi, Finnish for 'snow,' and the male panda Pyry, meaning 'snowfall,' will return 'prematurely' to China later this year. The panda pair was China's gift to mark the Nordic nation's 100 years of independence in 2017, and they were supposed to be on loan until 2033. But since then, the zoo has experienced several challenges, including a decline in visitors due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic and Russia's war against Ukraine, as well as an increase in inflation and interest rates, the facility said in a statement. The panda deal between Helsinki and Beijing, a 15-year loan agreement, had been finalized in April 2017 when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Finland for talks with then-Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. The pandas arrived in Finland in January 2018. The Ahtari Zoo, which specializes in typical northern European animals such as bears, lynxes and wolverines, built a special annex at a cost of about $9 million in hopes of luring more tourists to the remote nature reserve. The upkeep of Lumi and Pyry, including a preservation fee to China, cost the zoo $1.7 million annually. The bamboo that giant pandas eat was flown in from the Netherlands. The Chinese Embassy in Helsinki noted to Finnish media that Beijing had tried to help Ahtari solve its financial difficulties by urging Chinese companies operating in Finland to make donations to the zoo and supporting its debt arrangements. However, declining visitor numbers combined with drastic changes in the economic environment proved too high a burden for the smallish Finnish zoo. The panda pair will enter a monthlong quarantine in late October before being shipped back to China. Finland, a country of 5.6 million people, was among the first Western nations to establish political ties with China, doing so in 1950. China has presented giant pandas to countries as a sign of goodwill and closer political ties, and Finland was the first Nordic nation to receive them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zoo-in-finland-with-financial-woes-to-return-giant-pandas-to-china/7799373.html	2024-09-25T13:08:32-07:00	
Pope expels bishop, 9 others from Peru movement over 'sadistic' abuses	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis took the unusual decision Wednesday to expel 10 people — a bishop, priests and laypeople — from a troubled Catholic movement in Peru after a Vatican investigation uncovered 'sadistic' abuses of power, authority and spirituality. The move against the leadership of the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, or Sodalitium of Christian Life, followed Francis' decision last month to expel the group's founder, Luis Figari, after he was found to have sodomized his recruits. The decision was announced by the Peruvian Bishops Conference, which posted a statement from the Vatican embassy on its website. The statement was astonishing because it listed the abuses uncovered by the Vatican investigation that have rarely been punished canonically with such measures, and the people responsible. According to the statement, the Vatican investigators uncovered physical abuses 'including with sadism and violence,' sect-like abuses of conscience, spiritual abuse, abuses of authority, economic abuses in administering church money and the 'abuse in the exercise of the apostolate of journalism.' The latter was presumably aimed at a Sodalitium-linked journalist who has attacked critics of the movement on social media. Figari founded the movement in 1971 as a lay community to recruit 'soldiers for God,' one of several Catholic societies born as a conservative reaction to the left-leaning liberation theology movement that swept through Latin America, starting in the 1960s. At its height, the group counted about 20,000 members across South America and the United States. It was enormously influential in Peru. Victims of Figari's abuses complained to the Lima archdiocese in 2011, although other claims against him reportedly date to 2000. But neither the local church nor the Holy See took concrete action until one of the victims, Pedro Salinas, wrote a book along with journalist Paola Ugaz detailing the twisted practices of the Sodalitium in 2015, entitled 'Half Monks, Half Soldiers.' An outside investigation ordered by Sodalitium determined that Figari was 'narcissistic, paranoid, demeaning, vulgar, vindictive, manipulative, racist, sexist, elitist and obsessed with sexual issues and the sexual orientation' of Sodalitium's members. The investigation, published in 2017, found that Figari sodomized his recruits and forced them to fondle him and one another. He liked to watch them 'experience pain, discomfort and fear' and humiliated them in front of others to enhance his control over them, the report found. Still, the Holy See declined to expel Figari from the movement in 2017 and merely ordered him to live apart from the Sodalitium community in Rome and cease all contact with it. The Vatican was seemingly tied in knots by canon law that did not foresee such punishments for founders of religious communities who weren't priests. But according to the findings of the latest Vatican investigation, the abuses went beyond Figari and included harassing and hacking the communications of their victims all the while covering up crimes committed as part of their official duties. The highest-ranking person ordered expelled was Archbishop Jose Antonio Eguren, whom Francis already forced to resign as bishop of Piura in April over his record, after he sued Salinas and Ugaz for their reporting. The Vatican, in the statement, said the Peruvian bishops join Pope Francis in 'seeking the forgiveness of the victims' while calling on the troubled movement to initiate a journey of justice and reparation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-expels-bishop-9-others-from-peru-movement-over-sadistic-abuses/7799119.html	2024-09-25T10:34:00-07:00

CrowdStrike executive apologizes to Congress for July global tech outage	WASHINGTON — An executive at cybersecurity company CrowdStrike apologized in testimony to Congress for sparking a global technology outage over the summer. 'We let our customers down,' said Adam Meyers, who leads CrowdStrike's threat intelligence division, in a hearing before a U.S. House cybersecurity subcommittee Tuesday. Austin, Texas-based CrowdStrike has blamed a bug in an update that allowed its cybersecurity systems to push bad data out to millions of customer computers, setting off a global tech outage in July that grounded flights, took TV broadcasts off air and disrupted banks, hospitals and retailers. 'Everywhere Americans turned, basic societal functions were unavailable,' House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green said. 'We cannot allow a mistake of this magnitude to happen again.' The Tennessee Republican likened the impact of the outage to an attack 'we would expect to be carefully executed by a malicious and sophisticated nation-state actor.' 'We're deeply sorry and we are determined to prevent this from ever happening again,' Meyers told lawmakers while laying out the technical missteps that led to the outage of about 8.5 million computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system. Meyers said he wanted to 'underscore that this was not a cyberattack' but was, instead, caused by a faulty 'rapid-response content update' focused on addressing new threats. The company has since bolstered its content update procedures, he said. The company still faces a number of lawsuits from people and businesses that were caught up in July's mass outage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/crowdstrike-executive-apologizes-to-congress-for-july-global-tech-outage/7799074.html	2024-09-25T09:57:21-07:00	
Journalists flee Venezuela as Maduro threatens media freedom	MADRID — Jesus Medina used a fake identity to flee from Venezuela to Colombia by walking across the border like thousands of compatriots. A journalist for Dolar Today, an independent online publication in Venezuela, Medina said he was persecuted by the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro for six years. He was imprisoned for nearly three years between 2017 and 2020 in a high-security military jail awaiting trial. Last year, a court absolved Medina of charges of inciting hate, a charge that is often leveled at journalists. However, after Medina was cleared, he said the government ordered that he face a retrial. He denied all charges. At this point, he decided he had to leave his country, his girlfriend and family behind. Medina arrived in Bogota, Colombia, on September 15 to begin a new life. He currently is searching for work and a permanent place to live. His story is typical of other journalists who have left Venezuela in the wake of a crackdown by the Maduro government against the media and political activists after disputed presidential elections on July 28. Several journalists have been detained, while others face travel bans. Reporters covering politics are looking for innovative ways to stay under the radar and keep covering the news. Two AI journalists, called La Chama or 'The Girl,' and El Pana (Venezuelan slang for 'friend'), were created as part of Operation Retweet by Colombian organization Connectas, Reuters reported. The initiative aims to publish news from a dozen independent Venezuelan media outlets and to help protect reporters amid a government crackdown on journalists and protesters. Electoral officials and Venezuela’s top court declared Maduro the winner of the election with 52% of the vote, Reuters reported. But the opposition says voting machine receipts show a landslide victory for their candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, who fled to exile in Spain. Some Western governments, including the United States, have alleged electoral fraud. A United Nations report last week alleged escalating government repression since the election, including the arrest of minors. The Venezuelan government rejected the claims. The Venezuelan government in Caracas and its embassy in Madrid did not respond to VOA requests for comment on Medina’s case nor on repression of the independent media. 'Repression has gotten worse’ Medina, 42, who works for Dolar Today, an online independent newspaper that reports on national and international news and sports, has been a reporter for 14 years. 'The repression has gotten worse since the election in July,’’ he told VOA by telephone from Bogota. ‘’It has been brutal. They are arresting more people. They [the government] cannot bear that the opposition won the election. It is a dictatorship.' Luis Gonzalo Perez, a Venezuelan journalist who was part of the press team covering opposition leader Maria Corina Machado during the election campaign, went into exile recently after what he claimed were 'repeated threats' from the Venezuelan government and its secret services. 'Hello to my family, friends, followers who have been paying attention to my work in the last few months in Venezuela,' Perez said in a message posted on Instagram. 'I had to make the decision to leave Venezuela. I find myself in exile like millions of Venezuelans. This was never in my life plans, personal or work plans, to have to leave under force, against my will.' Clavel Rangel, a Venezuelan journalist, went into exile in Miami in 2020 when she was accused of libel over articles she wrote with another journalist about the metal sector in southern Venezuela. She said the latest crackdown against the media marks a new level of repression against independent journalists on the part of the government. 'For the first time, Maduro’s government decided to steal a competitive election, and this was marked by a new level of repression at all levels, where the media did not escape the crackdown,' Rangel told VOA. 'They entered a new era of totalitarianism after years of autocracy because it is the only way to maintain power.' Rangel said 16 journalists currently were under arrest in Venezuela, with nine detentions coming after the election. 'The moment marks a clear ‘before and after’ in the timeline in the repression against the press,' she said. Rangel noted research by the Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, a nongovernmental organization that monitors the media in Venezuela, that showed about 350 journalists had left the country in recent years. ‘Constant and ruthless attacks’ Carleth Morales, founder of the association of Venezuelan journalists in Spain, Espana Venezuelan Press, told VOA that journalists had been leaving the country since Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, came to power in 1999. 'We have undergone about 25 years of constant and ruthless attacks on media freedom. The Venezuelan Nacional College of Journalists said more than 400 media have closed in the past two decades,' Morales said. 'We don’t have a free press or jobs in the sector. The online media, which are a reference in journalism, are led by exiled journalists.' In 2000, Morales said, Chavez first started threatening the media, marking 'a macabre line of self-censorship' and leading to the first wave of exiles. In 2004-2005, with the government’s passing of the Law of Social Responsibility in Radio and Television, a large number of reporters left the country because of the censorship and the threats of jail, she said. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Press Association considered the legislation to be a 'gag law' that violated the freedom of the media. In 2007, Morales said another wave of journalists went into exile after the government tightened control of television channels. When the media covered 2014 citizens’ protests, several journalists were arrested and foreign journalists were expelled, she said. In Spain, the largest wave of Venezuelan journalists arrived in 2015, and this rose again in 2017, Morales said, after further waves of repression against the media following their reports about opposition protests and interviews with government critics and independent analysts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/journalists-flee-venezuela-as-maduro-threatens-media-freedom/7799012.html	2024-09-25T09:57:13-07:00	
UN: Russia muzzling dissent amid climate of fear, repression	Geneva — As Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine grinds on for a third year, a United Nations report says all dissenting voices in the Russian Federation have been muzzled, civic and political rights have been shut down, and the human rights situation in the country 'has significantly worsened.' 'The country is now governed by a state-sponsored system of fear and punishment including the use of torture, with absolute impunity,' Mariana Katzarova, who monitors rights in Russia under a mandate from the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council, said Tuesday. Katzarova said civil and political freedoms in Russia have become further restricted since she submitted her first report to the council more than a year ago. 'The severity of the government’s human rights violations has escalated, and its tools expanded to suppress dissent against its repressive domestic policy and war-driven foreign policy,' she said. As with last year’s report, Katzarova noted that she was obliged to gather information for this year’s 23-page report from a range of sources inside and outside the Russian Federation. Despite repeated requests, she said she was not granted access to Russia, 'which would have allowed a dialogue with the government and other stakeholders and enabled the reflection of their position in this report.' The report paints a chilling picture of a dystopian society in which Russian citizens are not free to express their views, state-driven human rights violations are legalized by new or amended legislation, public anti-war expression or dissent of any kind is criminalized, the use of violence by law enforcement is condoned, and 'an environment of absolute impunity has been created.' 'War censorship' Under Russia’s so-called 'war censorship' legislation, Katzarova noted that hundreds of people who 'dare to speak the truth' about what is happening in the war against Ukraine have been prosecuted, given long prison sentences and subjected to the 'crippling financial punishment' of having property and assets confiscated. The report says at least 1,372 human rights defenders, journalists and anti-war critics have been detained on politically motivated charges and sentenced 'in sham trials to lengthy imprisonment, often with treatment amounting to torture.' While Russian authorities have intensified their crackdown on these 'traditional sources of opposition,' Katzarova said poets, playwrights, artists, religious figures, indigenous groups, migrants, and those who’ve fled abroad are often targeted with 'harsh censorship, intimidation and prosecution for any perceived transgression.' 'Of particular concern is the evidence of state-condoned violence and torture against civilians arrested for peacefully exercising their human rights,' she said. 'Brutal assaults of detainees by law enforcement officials go unpunished; there is increased use of solitary confinement in prisons and other deliberate ill-treatment amounting to torture.' The report spells out in searing detail the many human rights violations and state-condoned discriminatory policies used by the state to intimidate, harass and punish vulnerable groups, including women and girls, LGBTQ persons, indigenous peoples, minorities and migrants. 'The risk of severe punishment for any form of public dissent is very high, particularly for individuals and groups vulnerable to discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, political opinion, religion, indigenous status or minority background,' says the report, which devotes a long section to the wide range of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law precipitated by the ongoing war against Ukraine. Ukraine-related violations It expresses particular concern about Ukrainian civilians held in arbitrary detention because 'Russian authorities do not provide information about their number, fate or whereabouts, and many are subjected to enforced disappearance.' The report says at least 1,672 Ukrainian civilians are known to have been arbitrarily detained by Russian authorities and kept 'in penal colonies, pretrial detention centers and temporary makeshift tent camps' located throughout Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. It also says an estimated 14,000 Ukrainian civilians are missing. The report documents the plight of captured military and civilian Ukrainians, including children, who have been forcibly transferred or deported to the Russian Federation. According to the Ukrainian government, 19,546 children were forcibly transferred to Russian-occupied Crimea or deported to Russia or Belarus as of the end of July 2024; 388 have been returned. The whereabouts and fate of the thousands of other children remains unknown, though some are believed to have been given up for adoption by Russian families. The report notes that some of the returned children who were interviewed said they 'were subjected to sexual violence during their time in Russian institutions and some experienced or witnessed physical violence and threats against children by the staff.' Last year, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Commissioner for Children’s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova for 'the war crimes of unlawful deportation and unlawful transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation.' Katzarova told council members that 'The Russian authorities must bring to justice all those responsible for this torture and ill-treatment and immediately and unconditionally release all Ukrainian detainees, ensuring their safe return, especially of children. 'As special rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in the Russian Federation, I will continue to call for accountability for these crimes,' she said. It is a call likely to be ignored by Russia, which boycotted the meeting and did not respond as a concerned country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-russia-muzzling-dissent-amid-climate-of-fear-repression/7799059.html	2024-09-25T09:41:51-07:00	
Taliban formally seek invitation to Russia’s BRICS summit	ISLAMABAD — Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban confirmed Wednesday that they have formally sought to join the upcoming Russia-hosted summit of the BRICS intergovernmental group of major emerging economies. The leaders of the 10 members of BRICS, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, are set to convene October 22-24 in the southwestern Russian city of Kazan for the meeting. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates joined the bloc this year. 'BRICS is an important economic forum, and as a developing economy, Afghanistan needs to join such economic gatherings,' Hamdullah Fitrat, the deputy Taliban spokesperson, stated in a video message aired by their official broadcaster. 'The Islamic Emirate is seeking a presence at the upcoming BRICS forum, and the request has been formally communicated to the host nation,' Fitrat stated, using the official title of their government in Kabul, which is officially not recognized by any country. He shared no further details. There has been no immediate Russian response to the Taliban’s assertion. Moscow has developed close informal ties with the de facto Afghan leaders since they retook control of the conflict-ravaged nation three years ago, when the United States-led Western countries withdrew their troops after almost two decades of war with the then-insurgent Taliban. However, Russia has not recognized the Taliban as a legitimate government in alignment with the global consensus on the issue of recognition. Taliban delegations have repeatedly visited Moscow in recent months for bilateral economic and trade discussions. The Russian foreign and justice ministries submitted a proposal to President Vladimir Putin in June to remove the radical Afghan group from Russia’s list of designated terrorist organizations. The move prompted speculations that Moscow has come closer to officially recognizing the de facto Kabul authorities. The Taliban have been on Russia’s list of transnational militant groups, which includes al-Qaida, since 2003. The de facto Afghan leaders have implemented their strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as sharia, in the impoverished South Asian nation, prohibiting Afghan girls from attending schools beyond the sixth grade, suspending female students from universities, barring women from most workplaces, and banning music. The Taliban also have introduced stoning and public executions of women for crimes such as adultery. The U.N. and other nations The international community, including the United Nations, has consistently called for the urgent reversal of restrictions on women before considering granting diplomatic legitimacy to the Taliban regime. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly this week that the Taliban's treatment of women can be compared to 'some of the most egregious systems of oppression in recent history.' 'We will continue to amplify the voices of Afghan women and call for them to play a full role in the country's life, both inside its borders and on the global stage,' he said. U.N. officials maintain that last month’s enactment of a morality law by the Taliban has made it even more challenging to recognize Kabul rulers. Taliban leaders reject criticism of their governance, saying it is aligned with local culture and sharia. 'It means that one of the major obstacles to Afghanistan’s full reintegration into the international community cannot be part of a necessary dialogue,' Roza Otunbayeva, the head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, told a Security Council meeting last week. China and the Taliban China has also ramped up its political and economic ties with Kabul and is one of two countries, along with the United Arab Emirates, that have formally accepted a Taliban-appointed ambassador. On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a news conference that Beijing expects the Taliban to 'look at the legitimate concerns' of the global community. 'That said, women’s rights and interests are not the entirety of the Afghan issue, nor the core or root cause of the issue,' Lin said. He referenced the U.N. estimates stating that almost 24 million people in Afghanistan need humanitarian assistance, with more than half of them battling severe food insecurity. 'The international community needs to focus on the most pressing difficulties Afghanistan faces, promote the rebuilding and development in Afghanistan … and at the same time encourage, in the spirit of equality and respect, the governing authorities of Afghanistan to improve and strengthen protection of women and children’s rights,' Lin stated. Chinese companies have signed several agreements with the Taliban to enhance economic and trade cooperation, focusing mainly on the Afghan mining sector. Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi told a news conference in Kabul last week that his government controlled about 40 Afghan embassies and consulates worldwide, and that its diplomatic relations with the international community were improving. He stated that the Taliban are keen to develop 'friendly' ties with Western nations. The U.S. and the West at large insist that formal recognition of the Taliban depends on their actions regarding women's rights, education for girls and women and freedom of movement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-formally-seek-invitation-to-russia-s-brics-summit/7798954.html	2024-09-25T08:47:09-07:00	
Mpox cases continue to rise in Africa	Nairobi — As cases of mpox rise across the African continent, public health experts and world leaders are sounding the alarm, saying more needs to be done to contain the viral outbreak. Fifteen countries in Africa are assessed as having active outbreaks, with Morocco being the latest to report a case. Samuel Boland, mpox incident manager for the World Health Organization regional office for Africa, said that while the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi account for almost 90 percent of confirmed cases, more instances are popping up in other countries. 'DRC, Burundi [are] especially affected but also Cameroon, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Cote D'Ivoire, Republic of Congo, Liberia, Uganda, Kenya, Gabon, Rwanda, South Africa and Guinea,' he told VOA, speaking from Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo. The WHO says two distinct clades, or strains, have been identified. Clade I was formerly known as the Congo Basin clade, and Clade II was formerly West African clade. Previously known as monkeypox, the viral disease can spread through close contact between people, according to the World Health Organization, and occasionally via objects and areas touched by a person with mpox. Signs and symptoms include fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. Boland said there have been 6,580 confirmed cases so far this year, but there's a bigger number of suspected cases. Suspected cases are clinically compatible with mpox but may not have been tested due to various limitations in several countries. That number has climbed to nearly 32,000. 'Now amongst that large number of suspected cases, 844 people have died. But when focusing on the confirmed cases this year as in from the first of January, 32 people have, unfortunately, passed away,' Boland said. In a virtual briefing last week, Jean Kaseya, director-general of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said mpox is not under control in Africa. He said that while vaccine donations are trickling in, the amount is insufficient to contain the outbreak. 'Today, we have almost around 4 million commitments of doses, but we say we need more,' Kaseya said. U.S. President Joe Biden, in an address to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 24, 2024, highlighted the need to 'move quickly' to confront the mpox outbreak in Africa. 'We're prepared to commit $500 million to help African countries prevent and respond to mpox and to donate 1 million doses of mpox vaccine now,' he said. No specific date was given as to when the vaccines will arrive in Africa, but Biden said the investments will be delivered bilaterally, through existing relationships with partner countries, as well as through multilateral institutions. In addition to vaccines, Boland said this mpox outbreak requires interventions across the full spectrum of the public health sector. He said the world needs to scale up and make sure it can deliver in several areas. 'Things like surveillance, which will include case investigation and contact tracing — both going out into communities and looking for cases,' he said. 'Also engaging and encouraging communities to report cases when people become unwell.' He said this approach includes infection prevention and control, case management and vaccination.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mpox-cases-continue-to-rise-in-africa-/7798946.html	2024-09-25T08:33:46-07:00	
China 'firmly opposes' proposed ban on connected vehicles	Washington — On Wednesday, China’s commerce ministry said it 'firmly opposes' the United States’ proposed ban on the sale of connected vehicles that use Chinese or Russian software and hardware technology. Most new vehicles are considered to be 'connected' because they can share data with other vehicles and infrastructure with the help of onboard software, hardware and internet access. The U.S. warns that data collected by Chinese or Russian software in connected and autonomous vehicles could pose a threat to national security. A spokesperson from China’s Ministry of Commerce said the proposed U.S. ban has no 'factual basis, violates the principles of market economy and fair competition, and is a typical protectionist act.' 'China urges the United States to stop its wrong practice of generalizing national security, immediately revoke the relevant restrictions, and stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies,' according to a ministry statement. The proposed rule is the latest example of the deteriorating relationship between Washington and Beijing. In February, the Biden Administration said it would probe Chinese cars that pose a risk to national security. The U.S. Department of Commerce said it opened the probe because vehicles 'collect large amounts of sensitive data on their drivers and passengers (and) regularly use their cameras and sensors to record detailed information on U.S. infrastructure.' The Biden Administration also implemented a 100% tariff on Chinese-made EVs earlier this month, citing unfair business practices and the potential for Chinese EVs to flood international markets. The new proposed prohibition on connected vehicles applies both to the software and hardware that link vehicles to the outside world. It did not specify which manufacturers are likely to be impacted by the rule, which will be finalized after a 30-day period for public comment. In a press release Tuesday, the Coalition for a Prosperous America, or CPA, voiced its support for the proposed ban. 'For years, the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] has aggressively pursued global dominance in the automotive industry building tremendous overcapacity to dominate their home market and to displace auto manufacturing worldwide,' said the CEO of CPA, Michael Stumo. 'The Commerce Department’s proposed ban on this technology is an important measure to protect our automotive sector and secure Americans’ sensitive information,' he added. China’s commerce ministry also condemned the U.S. on Wednesday for its newly proposed ban and tariffs implemented earlier this month, saying Washington placed 'high tariffs on Chinese cars, restricted participation in government procurement, and introduced discriminatory subsidy policies.' 'Now, on the grounds of so-called national security, it [Washington] has slandered Chinese connected car software, hardware and complete vehicles as 'unsafe' and restricted their use in the United States,' a ministry statement said. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-firmly-opposes-proposed-ban-on-connected-vehicles/7798881.html	2024-09-25T07:51:40-07:00

Finland zoo returns giant pandas to China over cost	HELSINKI — Finland will return two giant pandas to China in November, more than eight years ahead of time, as the zoo where they live can no longer afford their upkeep, the chair of the zoo's board told Reuters on Tuesday. The pandas, named Lumi and Pyry, were brought to Finland in January 2018, months after Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the Nordic country and signed a joint agreement on protecting the animals. Since its founding in 1949, the People's Republic of China has sent pandas to foreign zoos to strengthen trading ties, cement foreign relations and boost its international image. The Finnish agreement was for a stay of 15 years, but instead the pandas will soon go into a month-long quarantine before they are shipped back to China, according to Ahtari Zoo, the pandas' current home. The zoo, a private company, had invested over 8 million euros ($8.92 million) in the facility where the animals live and faced annual costs of 1.5 million euros for their upkeep, including a preservation fee paid to China, Ahtari Chair Risto Sivonen said. The zoo had hoped the pandas would attract visitors to the central Finland location but last year said it had instead accumulated mounting debts as the pandemic curbed travel, and that it was discussing a return. Rising inflation had added to the costs, the zoo said, and Finland's government in 2023 rejected pleas for state funding. In all, negotiations to return the animals had lasted three years, Sivonen said. 'Now we reached a point where the Chinese said it could be done,' Sivonen said. The return of the pandas was a business decision made by the zoo which did not involve Finland's government and should not impact relations between the two countries, a spokesperson for Finland's foreign ministry said. Despite efforts by China to aid the zoo, the two countries in the end jointly concluded after friendly consultations to return the pandas, the Chinese embassy in Helsinki said in a statement to Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finland-zoo-returns-giant-pandas-to-china-over-cost-/7798696.html	2024-09-25T06:47:36-07:00	
Secret Service failures before Trump rally shooting were 'preventable,' Senate panel finds	Washington — Multiple Secret Service failures ahead of the July rally for former President Donald Trump where a gunman opened fire were 'foreseeable, preventable, and directly related to the events resulting in the assassination attempt that day,' according to a bipartisan Senate investigation released Wednesday. Similar to the agency's own internal investigation and an ongoing bipartisan House probe, the interim report from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee found multiple failures on almost every level ahead of the Butler, Pennsylvania shooting, including in planning, communications, security and allocation of resources. 'The consequences of those failures were dire,' said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the Democratic chairman of the Homeland panel. Investigators found that there was no clear chain of command among the Secret Service and other security agencies and no plan for coverage of the building where the shooter climbed up to fire the shots. Officials were operating on multiple, separate radio channels, leading to missed communications, and an inexperienced drone operator was stuck on a help line after his equipment wasn't working correctly. Communications among security officials were a 'multi-step game of telephone,' Peters said. The report found the Secret Service was notified about an individual on the roof of the building approximately two minutes before shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire, firing eight rounds in Trump's direction less than 150 yards from where the former president was speaking. Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper. Approximately 22 seconds before Crooks fired, the report found, a local officer sent a radio alert that there was an armed individual on the building. But that information was not relayed to key Secret Service personnel who were interviewed by Senate investigators. The panel also interviewed a Secret Service counter-sniper who reported seeing officers with their guns drawn running toward the building where the shooter was perched, but the person said they did not think to notify anyone to get Trump off the stage. The Senate report comes just days after the Secret Service released a five-page document summarizing the key conclusions of a yet-to-be finalized Secret Service report on what went wrong, and ahead of a Thursday hearing that will be held by a bipartisan House task force investigating the shooting. The House panel is also investigating a second assassination attempt on Trump earlier this month when Secret Service agents arrested a man with a rifle hiding on the golf course at Trump's Florida club. Each investigation has found new details that reflect a massive breakdown in the former president's security, and lawmakers say there is much more they want to find out as they try to prevent it from happening again. 'This was the result of multiple human failures of the Secret Service,' said Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the top Republican on the panel. The senators recommended that the Secret Service better define roles and responsibilities before any protective event, including by designating a single individual in charge of approving all the security plans. Investigators found that many of the people in charge denied that they had responsibility for planning or security failures, and deflected blame. Advance agents interviewed by the committee said 'that planning and security decisions were made jointly, with no specific individual responsible for approval,' the report said. Communication with local authorities was also poor. Local law enforcement had raised concern two days earlier about security coverage of the building where the shooter perched, telling Secret Service agents during a walk through that they did not have the manpower to lock it down. Secret Service agents then gave investigators conflicting accounts about who was responsible for that security coverage, the report said. The internal review released last week by the Secret Service also detailed multiple communications breakdowns, including an absence of clear guidance to local law enforcement and the failure to fix line-of-sight vulnerabilities at the rally grounds that left Trump open to sniper fire and 'complacency' among some agents. 'This was a failure on the part of the United States Secret Service. It's important that we hold ourselves to account for the failures of July 13th and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again,' said Ronald Rowe Jr., the agency's acting director, after the report was released. In addition to better defining responsibility for events, the senators recommended that the agency completely overhaul its communications operations at protective events and improve intelligence sharing. They also recommended that Congress evaluate whether more resources are needed. Democrats and Republicans have disagreed on whether to give the Secret Service more money in the wake of its failures. A spending bill on track to pass before the end of the month includes an additional $231 million for the agency, but many Republicans have said that an internal overhaul is needed first. 'This is a management problem plain and simple,' said Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the top Republican on the Homeland panel's investigations subcommittee.	https://www.voanews.com/a/secret-service-failures-before-trump-rally-shooting-were-preventable-senate-panel-finds-/7798657.html	2024-09-25T04:37:10-07:00	
Greece and Turkey explore holding talks on maritime zones	Athens. — Greece and Turkey will explore whether they can start talks aimed at demarcating their maritime zones, Greece's foreign ministry said on Wednesday. Neighbors Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies but historic foes, have been at odds for decades over a range of issues from airspace to maritime jurisdiction in the eastern Mediterranean and ethnically split Cyprus. An agreement on where their maritime zones begin and end is important for determining rights over possible gas reserves and power infrastructure schemes. Tensions have eased in recent years and both countries agreed last year to reboot their relations, pledging to keep open channels of communication and work on the issues that have kept them apart. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan met on the sidelines of the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York on Tuesday and discussed bilateral ties, according to statements from the Turkish presidency and the Greek foreign ministry. 'The two leaders tasked the foreign ministers to explore whether conditions are favorable to initiate discussions on the demarcation of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone,' Greek Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis said. Foreign ministers from the two countries will start preparations for a high-level meeting to take place in Ankara in January, the Greek prime minister's office said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/greece-and-turkey-explore-holding-talks-on-maritime-zones-/7798640.html	2024-09-25T04:25:21-07:00

Environmentalists value peat, smear Finland's parliament in red paint	Helsinki — Environmental activists sprayed red paint on Finland's parliament building on Wednesday to protest against the peat industry, sparking strong criticism from politicians. Activists from Extinction Rebellion Finland and Swedish organization Aterstall Vatmarker (Restore Wetlands) smeared several granite columns at the building's main entrance in red paint resembling blood. They told AFP they were protesting against the Finnish state-owned company Neova mining peat in Swedish wetlands. Peat extracted from wetlands is often used as an energy source or for farming purposes, emitting large amounts of carbon dioxide. In their natural state, peatlands store large amounts of carbon dioxide. 'We have painted the columns with this easily washable paint to show that Finland is actively involved in accelerating the climate crisis,' said Valpuri Nykanen, an activist from Extinction Rebellion Finland standing outside the building. 'Finland is mining peat in Sweden, while we know that we must phase out oil, gas and all fossil fuels and peat is very fossil,' added Lior Tell-Stefansson from Aterstall Vatmarker. Police arrived at the scene after 8:00 am (0500 GMT) and removed 10 protesters sitting on the stairs with signs in their hands. The incident was investigated as aggravated damage to property, the police said in a statement. Several Finnish politicians immediately condemned the act. Newspaper Helsingin Sanomat quoted Prime Minister Petteri Orpo as saying it was 'completely incomprehensible and unacceptable vandalism.' 'Finland is a free democracy. We have the right to demonstrate and influence things, but we have civilized ways of doing it,' Orpo said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/environmentalists-value-peat-smear-finland-s-parliament-in-red-paint-/7798596.html	2024-09-25T03:37:08-07:00	
Thai exports rise in Aug, ministry says will meet 2024 forecast	BANGKOK — Thailand's exports rose for a second straight month in August, the commerce ministry said on Wednesday as it maintained its forecast of 1% to 2% growth this year despite the baht strengthening to 30-month highs against the U.S. dollar. With demand picking up in key markets, further export growth was expected this year and it could even come in above forecast, although the baht's rise would impact Q4 shipments, said Poonpong Naiyanapakorn, head of the ministry's Trade Policy and Strategy Office. Exports, a key driver of Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, rose 7% in August from a year earlier, and followed July's 15.2% rise, which was the fastest growth in 28 months. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected a rise of 5.8% Imports rose 8.9% in August from a year earlier, compared with a forecast rise of 7.30% in the poll. That led to a trade surplus of $0.26 billion in August, compared with a forecast deficit of $0.07 billion. In the first 8 months of 2024, exports rose 4.2% from a year earlier, while imports rose 5.2%, with the cumulative trade deficit at $6.35 billion. The baht has risen 4.6% since the beginning of the year, with large gains seen in the past month, to be the region's second-strongest performing currency after Malaysia's ringgit. 'The stronger baht is impacting liquidity and profits, especially for agricultural goods,' said Chaichan Chareonsuk, chairman of the Thai National Shippers' Council. 'Some business could take a loss when negotiating new orders or not get orders,' he said. The Finance Ministry and central bank are due to meet next week to discuss currency appreciation and inflation target.

Some analysts say China's plan to boost housing market is 'too little, too late'	Taipei, Taiwan — China's central bank has released a series of economic stimulus plans, including cuts to mortgage interest rates and the required cash reserve ratio — the latter of which will allow commercial banks to inject $140 billion into the market — among other monetary policies aimed at reviving the housing market and stimulating economic growth. Many Chinese internet users applauded this initiative, but few expressed immediate willingness to buy a house. Analysts said the policies are 'too late and too few,' since housing prices in China have fallen by half in some areas, leaving people wary of purchasing homes that could further decline in value. The heads of China's three major financial institutions — including Pan Gongsheng, the governor of the People's Bank of China; Li Yunze, the director of the National Financial Regulatory Administration; and Wu Qing, the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission — on Tuesday unveiled the country’s most powerful economic rescue effort since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pan said that soon, commercial banks will be advised to reduce the interest rate of existing mortgages by about 0.5 percentage points on average, and the minimum down payment ratio for second homes will be reduced from the current 25% to the same 15% as the first home. He said this policy is expected to benefit 50 million households and 150 million people by reducing the nation’s total interest bill by about 150 billion yuan, or $21.3 billion, annually. Pan said that depending on market conditions, the central bank may consider cutting the required cash reserve on commercial banks by another 0.25 to 0.5 percentage points before the year’s end. Most Chinese internet users lauded the mortgage rate cuts. But no one answered affirmatively when a user under the name 'Mushroom's Second Sister' in Zhejiang asked on Weibo, 'Will everyone be more willing to buy a house?' A Weibo user from Guangdong under the name 'Chun Sheng Qi' said flatly, 'No.' Another Weibo user in Zhejiang under the name 'Little Lazy Pig Little Lin Lin' said, 'Is there a possibility they cut the interest rate to entice you to buy homes, and then they will increase the interest rate after a few years? They have the final say on the interest rate increase and reduction anyway.' A real estate analyst in Taipei told VOA on the condition of anonymity due to the issue's sensitivity that the new policy may not help restore confidence for Chinese home-buyers, who will be less inclined to spend lifetime savings on properties amid China’s sluggish economy, which has been hard-hit in recent years by the pandemic, the U.S.-China trade war and the global economic recession. She said that while governments around the world have been easing monetary policies to stimulate post-pandemic economic recovery in the past two years, the Chinese government has not taken action, allowing the economy to deteriorate. It is 'too late' to introduce the stimulus package, she said. She added that China’s policymakers are still holding onto an old development model and counting on the property market to drive the economy. But China’s housing market is taking a hit from the country’s declining birthrate. Young people who will inherit a house from elders will not invest in the housing market. Those whose families own no properties may not be able to afford one because of their financial obligations to support elders or children. Francis Lun, CEO of Geo Securities in Hong Kong, said the policies are 'too late and too few' but are better than nothing. He said that the People's Bank of China should have launched them a year ago, and the scale of 1 trillion yuan is not enough because developer Evergrande alone has $300 billion in debt. Other Chinese real estate companies also sit on billions in debt, so Lun expects China’s central bank to ease the monetary policy again in coming months. Lun told VOA by phone that to advance structural reform, China should also 'replace land sales with property tax revenue as local governments’ source of incomes… Or property prices won’t be stabilized, which will only worsen the local economy.'

Sri Lanka’s new president’s faces uphill task in push for change	New Delhi — Catapulted to power on an anti-corruption platform, Sri Lanka’s new Marxist-leaning president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, faces an uphill task in meeting his commitments to clean up the country’s political culture and improving lives for millions mired in poverty since the country’s economic collapse two years ago, say analysts. With his party having only three lawmakers in the 225-member parliament, Dissanayake has called for fresh elections a year ahead of schedule to choose a new house that could give him wider support for the sweeping reforms that he has promised. 'Dissanayake’s hope would be to secure a comfortable majority in parliament,' according to Jayadeva Uyangoda, a political analyst in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, told VOA. 'In the past, it was customary for mainstream parties to bribe opposition lawmakers to join them, but his main plank is clean governance, so he will need to win the numbers.' In a country that rejected mainstream parties in the presidential polls, there is what Uyangoda calls a 'very good chance' that he will be able to substantially improve his party’s parliamentary tally. Elections will be held on Nov. 14. Currently, Dissanayake has the smallest cabinet in the country’s history as he lacks the numbers for a full-fledged cabinet. He has named a new prime minister, Harini Amarasuriya, and two ministers -- in Sri Lanka, only lawmakers can be appointed as ministers. Winning wider support will be crucial. 'Otherwise attempts to deliver on his election promises can be blocked by knee-jerk opposition, due to differences in ideology or political opportunism,' Rajni Gamage, a research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore, told VOA. Meeting expectations of relief from the punishing austerity measures imposed by a $ 2.9 billion bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund is the first big test Dissanayake faces. He will handle the key finance portfolio. His pledge to renegotiate Sri Lanka’s deal with the IMF – which he says is not favorable to working class citizens — will not be easy at a time when the country is still heavily debt-ridden and has limited room to expand welfare measures. The package has helped steer the economy back to a nascent growth path, but the government will need to stick to the program’s criteria of keeping the budget deficit in check. An IMF spokesman in Washington said on Monday that it looked forward to working with President Dissanayake 'towards building on the hard-won gains that have helped put Sri Lanka on a path to economic recovery.' While options for providing relief may be limited, analysts said Dissanayake is expected to reduce income taxes for lower income groups and lower taxes on food and medicine. There is also concern among the business community about the position the Marxist leader, the son of a laborer, will take on free market policies. The policies of his Marxist party, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, are aligned with protectionism, according to Gamage. 'Their party’s economic growth policy is woven around prioritizing industrialization and domestic manufacturing, supporting local businesses and agriculture.' However, Dissanayake now heads a coalition, the National People’s Power, an umbrella group of small political parties, youth, civil society and women’s groups and trade unions. In recent years he has also moderated his party’s hard-left stance and said he believes in an open economy. 'The business class is uneasy because of the Marxist tradition to which he belongs. But my sense is that Dissanayake is a very pragmatic and rational man,' Jehan Perera, who heads the National Peace Council in Colombo, told VOA. 'And the coalition the president heads is not a Marxist group.' Delivering on the clean governance he has promised could also face a pushback. 'Corruption is very deep-seated in the system. It is endemic in society and goes from top to bottom, so rooting it out is very tough,' said Perera. 'He will face strong vested interests to rebuild a system that has broken down. But on the positive side, he has the support of the people.' After taking the oath of office, Dissanayake sounded a note of caution amid the widespread optimism raised by his victory among millions of Sri Lankans, saying he is not a 'magician' but an 'ordinary citizen.' 'There are things I know and don’t know. My aim is to gather those with the knowledge and skills to help lift this country,' he said on Monday. The coming months will be crucial for a country that is navigating a vastly altered political landscape. 'The management of the economic crisis and management of public expectations will be his biggest challenge, otherwise discontent will grow again,' said analyst Uyangoda. 'Past leaders have all belonged to the political elite. This is the first time there is a president who belongs to the working class, so the hopes of the ordinary people are very, very high.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-s-new-president-s-faces-uphill-task-in-push-for-change/7798495.html	2024-09-24T23:50:20-07:00

ADB maintains growth forecast for Asia, more stimulus expected in China	MANILA, Philippines — Developing Asia is on track to grow 5% this year, supported by strong consumption and high demand for tech exports, the Asian Development Bank forecast on Wednesday, and said China was expected to roll out more economic support measures. In an update to its Asian Development Outlook report, the ADB left most growth projections for economies in the region unchanged from its July report, maintaining its growth outlook for developing Asia at 5.0% this year and 4.9% next year. It revised down its inflation forecasts for developing Asia, which groups 46 countries in the Asia-Pacific, to 2.8% for this year and 2.9% for next year from previous forecasts of 2.9% and 3.0%, respectively. The Manila-based lender highlighted some downside risks to its outlook, including rising protectionism, escalating geopolitical tensions, adverse weather conditions, and a deterioration in China's property market. China, the world's second-largest economy, is battling deflationary pressures, and struggling to lift growth despite a series of policy measures aimed at spurring domestic spending. On Tuesday, China's central bank announced broad monetary stimulus and property market support measures as authorities look to restore confidence in the economy. 'Whether that will work remains to be seen because a lot of the structural problems in the property sector remain persistent,' ADB Chief Economist Albert Park said at a briefing. 'It may take more effort and work by their government' to alleviate concerns of consumers and investors, Park said, adding 'more proactive government policy would be helpful.' Park also said the ADB was not so concerned about deflation in China as it sees prices recovering. Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve kicked off its own easing cycle with a hefty half-percentage-point rate cut. 'With the Fed's 50 basis point rate cut, central banks have more space to ease, and we expect more of them to do so,' Park said. The ADB kept its 2024 growth forecast for China at 4.8%, below the government's official target of about 5%. Growth for 2025 is still forecast at 4.5%. 'The PRC (People's Republic of China) growth forecast is retained despite the prolonged downturn in the property sector, on the assumption that further fiscal and monetary easing will help sustain the economy,' Park said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/adb-maintains-growth-forecast-for-asia-more-stimulus-expected-in-china/7798467.html	2024-09-24T22:31:46-07:00	
Global plan for early ditch of coal power hits Indonesia hurdle	CIREBON, Indonesia — A G7-backed push to close coal power plants in emerging markets is facing further delays after a July deadline passed without a deal on the early closure of an Indonesian power plant that would be the first to shut under the initiative. The push against coal comes under the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) with Indonesia, Senegal, South Africa and Vietnam that call for billions of dollars in investments, grants and loans from G7 members, multilateral banks and private lenders to help them transition to low-carbon economies. Cutting emissions from coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, is seen as a crucial element of the JETPs if the world is to stave off the worst impacts of climate change. But a deal on the early shutdown of coal power plants in South Africa remains elusive amid its struggles with rolling blackouts, and hope for proof of concept has turned to Indonesia's 660 megawatt Cirebon-1 plant in West Java province, 220 km east of capital Jakarta. The legal and financial implications of closing Cirebon-1 are a stumbling block though. Jakarta is worried, too, that costs for replacing it with renewable energy could reach $1.3 billion, mostly in subsidies to cover more expensive renewable power generation, according to the finance ministry. A new government is taking office in October as well and that could further dent the chance of a deal on Cirebon, said Fabby Tumiwa, a renewables expert and member of the technical team advising Indonesia on its JETP. 'If this is not signed before Oct. 20, I am worried that this matter will be overlooked,' Fabby said, citing calls by President-elect Prabowo Subianto for self-sufficiency and energy security that suggest a commitment to coal, which generates two-thirds of Indonesia's electricity. Prabowo, who takes office on that date, has not commented on Cirebon and has rarely discussed his energy policy, though the retirement of coal power is mentioned in his campaign pledges. Prabowo's team has not responded to requests for comment. Under Indonesia's JETP, richer nations have pledged $20 billion to help the Southeast Asian nation with its energy transition, although little of that money has been disbursed. Legal concerns Earlier this month, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the outgoing government was trying to close the Cirebon deal as soon as possible, without giving details. David Elzinga, team leader for the Asian Development Bank's regional Energy Transition Mechanism program that is working on the early shutdown scheme, said his group was seeking a binding deal on Cirebon acceptable to both the outgoing and incoming administrations. 'Indonesia has positioned itself to be a leader ... It's really important now that we get the deal done,' Elzinga said. A deal on Cirebon is crucial for the ADB's regional ETM program as it plans similar deals in countries including Vietnam and the Philippines, as well as for other plants in Indonesia. To get there, state utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) and plant operator PT Cirebon Electric Power (CEP) need to reach a new power purchase agreement, which they failed to do by July, CEP Director Joseph Pangalila told Reuters. The need for stronger legal protections and a clear road map for retiring coal plants was the main problem, PLN said, given that power generation costs could rise by nearly 90%. PLN directors also fear a deal could expose them to future criminal charges if anti-graft investigators see the transaction as burdening the state with losses, JETP advisor Fabby said. Rachmat Kaimuddin, deputy minister overseeing power infrastructure, acknowledged this at a recent forum, saying stakeholders were considering the legal repercussions that might arise from any closures. 'If we're not careful, some people can get into trouble because it can create what they call state loss,' he said. In June, a former chief executive of state energy firm Pertamina was sentenced to nine years in jail for signing a long-term gas contract that a corruption court said caused state losses of $114 million. Others to follow 'We are anxious that it needs to get done, but at the same time what is important is that the first transaction be done in the best possible manner,' said Ramesh Subramaniam, ADB director general and head of the bank's sectors group. A number of private banks are lined up to invest and a series of new deals also could be started once Cirebon is done, with the ADB having already looked at about 30 other plants in Indonesia, he said. 'Although this has taken time, we have learnt a lot ... and our very clear feeling is the next ones to come will be considerably easier.' Cirebon-1 is a fairly new plant that started up in 2012. A deal would mean it stops operations in 2035 instead of 2042. Despite running cleaner than older plants, emissions from Cirebon and others around Jakarta are often blamed for Indonesia's chronic pollution, and some of the locals in neighboring fishing villages would be happy to see it go. Fisherman Amin, 64, blamed the plant and coal unloading at its jetty for pollution and a scarcity of fish in nearby waters. 'When they first opened, the water was fine, but it became increasingly murky. The green mussel farms here didn't have any harvest in the past two years,' he said. 'From the beginning of construction, I was against it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/global-plan-for-early-ditch-of-coal-power-hits-indonesia-hurdle/7798462.html	2024-09-24T22:18:19-07:00

US Congresswoman Kamlager-Dove condemns inaction on Sudan conflict	WASHINGTON — Fifty Democratic members of Congress sent a letter to President Joe Biden in late August requesting more humanitarian assistance for Sudan and calling on the U.S. to do more to help end the conflict. Leading the effort is U.S. Representative Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California, who told VOA in a recent interview that she is concerned that international partners aren’t doing enough to support humanitarian aid delivery to families affected by the conflict. 'Famine has erupted. Deaths are happening every day, and the warring parties are working together, in my opinion, to prevent the delivery of humanitarian aid,' she told VOA. 'It is unconscionable. And it is inhumane.' Without more aggressive leadership by the U.S., she said, the conflict risks international neglect amid the war Ukraine and an expanding conflict in the Middle East. The following has been edited for length and clarity. VOA: Your colleagues have joined you to raise awareness about Sudan. A lot of Sudanese who spoke to us say the world has forgotten them. How do you feel about their sentiments? U.S. Representative Sydney Kamlager-Dove: I am disheartened to hear that, but I understand why they would say it, and that is exactly why I wrote this letter and encouraged my colleagues to sign on. Fifty Democratic members of Congress signed with me, to ask this administration to do more. We want them to raise awareness of this war. Get [U.S.] Secretary [of State Anthony] Blinken out in front. We want to rally our international partners to also take this more seriously and pledge more dollars to help with the support around humanitarian aid delivery. Because if we are not taking the lead on this, then it will signal to the rest of the world that this is not important and of course it is. VOA: What about international attention? Are you getting that? Kamlager-Dove: No, we're not getting [international attention.] I have my own suspicions that people just don’t care, or don’t respect the continent of Africa. I think that is wildly ignorant. And we know with forces like China and Russia working to compete against us [the U.S.], and to dismantle democracies, we know that there are other agents and actors playing in this war as well. That is why it is incumbent upon us to take the lead and call for more aid and call for more discussions. VOA: What about America’s foreign policy and its resources? Where does it go? I mean, I know that the war in Ukraine and Gaza is shifting attention. Kamlager-Dove: Thankfully, we have an administration that is trying to engage. They finally got a special envoy, [Former U.S. Representative Tom Perriello], to Sudan. You know, a year too late, but he needs to be supported with more resources and more staff. It is very important that Secretary Blinken shows his face more on the continent and reminds folks that this administration cares. VOA: The U.N. made an appeal for humanitarian assistance. They were projecting $2.7 billion and only 37% of that was received. What should be done to get pledges from donor countries? Kamlager-Dove: Well, I do think we have to make a concerted effort to ask the international community to pledge more. It is important to give more, but if those resources are thwarted because you have bad actors keeping humanitarian aid from the people and the civilians that need it the most, then it doesn't matter. VOA: The U.S. government slapped sanctions on both sides in Sudan — the Rapid Support Forces [RSF] and some leaders of the Sudan Armed Forces [SAF]. And it appears like these sanctions are not biting hard because the two belligerent forces have decided not to sign any cease-fire. Are there other instruments of diplomacy in the toolbox that is yet to be used to bring pressure on these two groups? Kamlager-Dove: Well, it is certainly unfortunate that neither party wants to show up to the negotiating table. It's very hard to come to a resolution when you don't even sit at the table. The other thing that is unfortunate is even if you have sanctions, you know, if you’re still able to buy guns and get the weapons into the country, then obviously you need different kinds of teeth and authority. I think we should be looking at the folks who are supplying the arms to the forces, because that is as important as sanctioning both SAF and RSF. If you don’t stop the flow of arms, what are you really doing? VOA: When Perriello testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he mentioned that those aiding the war in Sudan must be held accountable, or the U.S.'s efforts will be in vain. How do you respond to that? Kamlager-Dove: I wholeheartedly agree. We have an obligation to focus on what is happening in the Sudan. But I want to say I'm grateful that he was actually able to show up. You know, we have not had a full committee hearing in the Foreign Affairs Committee on Africa since the beginning of this term. VOA: The last time we heard about funding [for Sudan] was 2017. And just a month ago, nongovernmental organizations, international aid agencies are saying Darfur is on the verge of famine, there's famine already there. … If you are given an opportunity to speak directly to the people who are making decisions on where aid money should go, what would you tell them? Kamlager-Dove: I would say the world is watching and the world is waiting. And every moment that you do not sit at the table and find a way, using any quiver that you have in your toolbox every day you wait is a day that someone dies in the Sudan. And this is not something that I am willing to keep in my heart. And this is not something that the United States should let happen. So, get off your tuchus (rear end) and find a way to bring about a cease-fire, and to make sure that humanitarian aid is able to get to the Sudan. This Q&A originated in VOA’s English to Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-congresswoman-kamlager-dove-condemns-inaction-on-sudan-conflict/7798455.html	2024-09-24T21:45:12-07:00	
Climate change doubles chance of floods like those in Central Europe, report says	WARSAW, Poland — Climate change has made downpours like the one that caused devastating floods in central Europe this month twice as likely to occur, a report said on Wednesday, as its scientific authors urged policymakers to act to stop global warming. The worst flooding to hit central Europe in at least two decades has left 24 people dead, with towns strewn with mud and debris, buildings damaged, bridges collapsed and authorities left with a bill for repairs that runs into billions of dollars. The report from World Weather Attribution, an international group of scientists that studies the effects of climate change on extreme weather events, found that the four days of rainfall brought by Storm Boris were the heaviest ever recorded in central Europe. It said that climate change had made such downpours at least twice as likely and 7% heavier. 'Yet again, these floods highlight the devastating results of fossil fuel-driven warming,' Joyce Kimutai, a researcher at Imperial College London's Grantham Institute and co-author of the study, said in a statement. 'Until oil, gas and coal are replaced with renewable energy, storms like Boris will unleash even heavier rainfall, driving economy-crippling floods.' The report said that while the combination of weather patterns that caused the storm - including cold air moving over the Alps and very warm air over the Mediterranean and the Black Seas - was unusual, climate change made such storms more intense and more likely. According to the report, such a storm is expected to occur on average about once every 100 to 300 years in today's climate with 1.3 degrees Celsius of warming from pre-industrial levels. However, it said that such storms will result in at least 5% more rain and occur about 50% more frequently than now if warming from pre-industrial levels reaches 2 C, which is expected to happen in the 2050s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/climate-change-doubles-chance-of-floods-like-those-in-central-europe-report-says/7798449.html	2024-09-24T20:52:09-07:00	
China’s youth unemployment fuels rise in postgraduate studies	Taipei, Taiwan — Youth unemployment in China climbed to nearly 19% in August, its highest level so far this year, according to official data. Analysts say that the higher level of youth unemployment is driving more college graduates to enroll in graduate schools to escape the job search as the world’s second-largest economy struggles. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, or NBS, late last week, the unemployment rate among 16- to 24-year-olds rose from 17.1% in July to 18.8% in August. One big reason for the uptick in joblessness, the NBS said, is that nearly 12 million students graduated from Chinese universities this June, heightening competition in an already tough job market. Postgraduates overtake graduates 'The job market has shrunk, and at the same time there are still so many graduates. Too many people are idling every day,' said Lin Chan-Hui, an assistant professor of the General Education Center at Feng Chia University in Taiwan. 'Another way out is to return to school to study further and temporarily escape the competitive workplace.' Some Chinese universities say they are seeing more postgraduate students than undergraduates. According to the state-backed digital publication The Paper, the number of graduate students at Lanzhou University exceeded the total number of undergraduate students for the first time. Lanzhou University is located in the capital of northwestern China’s Gansu Province. In eastern China’s coastal Zhejiang Province, the Zhejiang University of Technology shows 5,382 new graduate students were admitted this year, beating out the number of new undergraduate students by 40. The trend was already picking up at more famous Chinese universities last year. Last December, Beijing’s Tsinghua University said the number of undergraduate freshmen in the previous academic year was 3,760, while the number of master's and doctoral students was 12,069. Shanghai’s Fudan University in October 2023 reported 15,000 undergraduate students and nearly 37,000 graduate students. China's Ministry of Education said that last year there were more than 47 million people enrolled in higher education institutes, 1.3 million were graduate students, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Lei, a higher education consultant in Shenzhen, who due to the sensitivity of the subject only gave his surname, told VOA the trend of higher education is moving toward 'college graduates who don’t go to graduate school would immediately become unemployed' amid China's economic slowdown. 'On one hand, studying in graduate school can really help you find a job. On the other hand, it’s also an avoidance mentality,' Lei said. Wandering masters and doctors Feng Chia University’s Lin said that having an undergraduate degree is not enough in fields like technological innovation and scientific research, so it is still necessary to get a postgraduate degree in certain fields. On the other hand, he said, China has too many people getting doctorates and master’s degrees and not enough technical and vocational education so there will be 'fierce competition for upper-level work, but no one does the lower-level work.' Highly educated young people are not willing to engage in grassroots work, Lin said, so there will be more and more 'wandering masters and doctors.' Lin said the geopolitical tension between China and the U.S. has also made studying abroad for a postgraduate degree harder, so more students choose a domestic one instead. Chinese netizens seem to agree that waiting for the job market to improve is their best hope. A Hunan netizen on China’s Weibo social media platform under the name 'Da Ke Ya Tang' said: 'The market will not be able to provide so many jobs in the foreseeable future, so we have to leave the problem to the future.' 'If colleges and universities cannot adapt to the country's demand for innovative and pioneering talents and reform the way students are trained, more employment pressure may accumulate in society in a few years,' writer Wang Guojin said in a post on Weibo. COVID students coping? A PhD student in Shanghai who, due to the sensitivity of the subject, only gave his surname Zeng, told VOA the increase in master's and doctoral students is also because many graduate students went to college during the COVID-19 pandemic and are struggling to adapt. Zeng blames remote learning for their struggles with social interaction and the skills needed to compete in the job market. 'This group of college students obviously lacks some socialization skills, at least in recruitment interviews,' Zeng said. 'They can't reach the same level as the previous students.' Zeng adds that monthly stipends for master's and doctoral students ranges from roughly $143 to $700 and Chinese universities encourage entrepreneurship by providing funds to start small projects through competitions. 'Who wouldn’t want to continue their studies and earn money at the same time?' she asked.

Trump pledges sweeping tariffs, says they will keep jobs in US	SAVANNAH, Ga. — Donald Trump on Tuesday pledged to stop U.S. businesses from shipping jobs overseas and to take other countries' jobs and factories by relying heavily on sweeping tariffs to boost auto manufacturing — despite warnings that domestic consumers would pay more and a lack of specifics about how his plans would work. 'I want German car companies to become American car companies. I want them to build their plants here,' Trump declared during a speech in Savannah, Georgia. Trump added that, if elected, he'd put a 100% tariff on every car imported from Mexico and that the only way to avoid those charges would be for an automaker to build the cars in the U.S. His ideas, if enacted, could cause a huge upheaval in the American auto industry. Many automakers now build smaller, lower-priced vehicles in Mexico — facilitated by a trade agreement Trump negotiated while president — or in other countries because their profit margins are slim. The lower labor costs help the companies make money on those vehicles. German and other foreign automakers already have extensive manufacturing operations in the U.S., and many now build more vehicles here than they send. BMW, for instance, has an 8 million-square-foot campus in South Carolina that employs 11,000 people building more than 1,500 SUVs per day for the U.S. and 120 export markets. Mercedes and Volkswagen also have large factories here. If German automakers were to increase production here, they likely would have to take it from factories in Germany, which then would run below their capacity and be less efficient, said Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst for Guidehouse Insights. 'It makes no sense,' he said. Trump proposes 'new American industrialism' — without specifics Trump has proposed using tariffs on imports and other measures to boost American industry — even as economists have cautioned that U.S. consumers would bear the costs of tariffs and other Trump proposals like staging the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. The former president laid out a broad array of economic proposals during a speech in the key swing state of Georgia, promising to create a special ambassador to help lure foreign manufacturers to the U.S. and further entice them by offering access to federal land. Additionally, he called for lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%, but only for companies that produce in the U.S. Harris, the Democratic nominee, wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28%. It had been 35% when Trump became president in 2017, and he later signed legislation lowering it. 'We're putting America first,' Trump said. 'This new American industrialism will create millions and millions of jobs.' Trump also suggested wiping away some environmental regulations to boost energy production, saying America has 'got the oil, it's got the gas. We have everything. The only thing we don't have is smart people leading our country.' Tuesday's series of economic proposals raised a lot of questions, but the former president hasn't given specific answers on his ideas, which could substantially affect their impact and how much they cost. He has not specified, for example, whether his U.S.-focused corporate tax cuts would apply to companies that assemble their products domestically out of imports. Trump also suggested he would use a newly created envoy, and his own personal efforts, to recruit foreign companies. But he had a spotty record in the White House of attracting foreign investment. In one infamous case, Trump promised a $10 billion investment by Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn in Wisconsin, creating potentially 13,000 new jobs, that the company never delivered. His calls to offer federal land, meanwhile, might clash with Bureau of Land Management restrictions on foreign entities looking to lease lands. It also wasn't clear whether companies from China would be excluded, given Trump's longtime accusations that China is hurting American business.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-pledges-sweeping-tariffs-says-they-will-keep-jobs-in-us/7798426.html	2024-09-24T19:52:49-07:00

Man who staked out Trump at golf course charged with attempted assassination	washington — A man who authorities say staked out Donald Trump for 12 hours on his golf course in Florida and wrote of his desire to kill him was indicted Tuesday on an attempted assassination charge. Ryan Wesley Routh had been initially charged with two federal firearms offenses. The upgraded charges contained in a five-count indictment reflect the Justice Department's assessment that he methodically plotted to kill the Republican nominee, aiming a rifle through the shrubbery surrounding Trump's West Palm Beach golf course on an afternoon Trump was playing on it. Routh left behind a note in which he described his intention, prosecutors said. Court records show the case has been assigned to Aileen Cannon, a Trump-appointed federal judge who generated intense scrutiny for her handling of a criminal case charging Trump with illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. She dismissed that case in July, a decision now being appealed by special counsel Jack Smith's team. The attempted assassination indictment had been foreshadowed during a court hearing Monday in which prosecutors successfully argued for the 58-year-old Routh to remain behind bars as a flight risk and a threat to public safety. They alleged that he had written of his plans to kill Trump in a handwritten note months before his September 15 arrest in which he referred to his actions as a failed 'assassination attempt on Donald Trump' and offered $150,000 for anyone who could 'finish the job.' That note was in a box that Routh had apparently dropped off at the home of an unidentified witness months before his arrest. The person opened the letter, took a photograph of the front page of the letter, addressed 'Dear World,' and contacted law enforcement after the attempted assassination. Prosecutors also said Routh kept in his car a handwritten list of venues in August, September and October at which Trump had appeared or was expected to be present. The charge of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate carries a potential life sentence in the event of a conviction. The potential shooting was thwarted when a member of Trump's Secret Service protective detail spotted a partially obscured man's face and a rifle barrel protruding through the golf course fence line, ahead of where Trump was playing. The arrest came two months after Trump was shot and wounded in the ear in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service has acknowledged failings leading up to that shooting but has said that security worked as it should have to thwart the potential attack in Florida. The initial charges Routh faced in a criminal complaint accused him of illegally possessing his gun in spite of multiple felony convictions and with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. It is common for prosecutors to bring preliminary and easily provable charges upon an arrest and then add more serious offenses later as the investigation develops.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-who-staked-out-trump-at-golf-course-charged-with-attempted-assassination-/7798402.html	2024-09-24T18:35:39-07:00	
IAEA chief sees willingness from Iran to engage on nuclear issues	UNITED NATIONS — U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday he had sensed a greater willingness by Iranian officials to engage with the agency in a more meaningful way after talks in New York, and that he hoped to travel to Tehran in October. Several long-standing issues have dogged relations between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency, including Tehran's barring of uranium-enrichment experts on the inspection team and its failure for years to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. Grossi held talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, one of the key architects to the 2015 accord that limited Iran's ability to enrich uranium in return for a lifting of Western sanctions, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. 'What I see is an expressed willingness to reengage with us in a more meaningful fashion,' Grossi told Reuters in an interview. With nuclear diplomacy largely stalled between the Iranian presidential election and the U.S. one on Nov. 5, Iranian and European officials have met in New York to test their mutual willingness to reduce tensions amid Tehran's disputed nuclear program, its role in Ukraine and mounting regional tensions. Grossi said he wanted to make real progress in restoring proper technical discussions with Iran quickly and was aiming to travel to Tehran in October to meet with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. 'Of course, now we have to give content and substance to this because we are not starting from zero. We have had [a] relatively protracted process without replies to some of the questions we have,' he said. 'We also need to calibrate together with them how we go through this period where they are waiting to see what is going to happen with their other partners, starting with the United States.' IAEA board resolutions ordering Iran to cooperate urgently with the investigation into the uranium traces and calling on it to reverse its barring of inspectors have brought little change, and quarterly IAEA reports seen by Reuters on Aug. 29 showed no progress. Development of Iran's nuclear program has also advanced. By the end of the quarter, the latest IAEA reports showed Iran had completed installation of eight new cascades at Fordow but had not brought them online. At its larger underground site at Natanz, which is enriching up to 5% purity, it had brought 15 new cascades of other advanced models online. 'Iran has kept a regular pace without accelerating too much, but it continues,' Grossi said, adding that the Fordow cascades remained offline. Iran has stepped up nuclear work since 2019, after then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned an agreement reached under his predecessor, Barack Obama. When asked about the prospects of a revival of nuclear talks, Grossi said the preparatory work needed to start now, notably for the IAEA to get the necessary clarity on Iran's activities since it reduced cooperation with the agency. 'I think we need to, or the ambition should be to get results in a different way, because the old way is simply not going to be possible anymore,' he said, adding that he foresaw a more active role for the agency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-chief-sees-willingness-from-iran-to-engage-on-nuclear-issues/7798407.html	2024-09-24T18:35:26-07:00

China pressures Myanmar ethnic groups to cut ties from forces perceived as close to US	Washington — China, which has long influenced Myanmar’s ethnic armed groups, is pressuring the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, or MNDAA — part of the Three Brotherhood Alliance that includes the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and the Arakan Army (AA) — to avoid aligning with other opposition forces that China perceives as Western-backed, experts say. The MNDAA, also known as the Kokang ethnic armed group, whose members are Mandarin-speaking Han Chinese native to Kokang, reposted a statement on social media confirming their alliance with China. 'Our political red line is not to form alliances or work together with those who are against China,' read the statement, which was briefly posted Sept. 4 and reposted on Sept. 19. Analysts say that Beijing’s pressure on ethnic armed groups, especially the MNDAA, reflects its strategic interests in maintaining control over Myanmar’s political landscape. Strategically located along Myanmar’s northeastern border with China, the MNDAA is being pushed to sever ties with opposition forces that Beijing views as having U.S. support. China used its economic and political leverage when it reportedly cut off trade and supplies to Laukkai, the capital of the Kokang region, to create distance between the MNDAA and the National Unity Government (NUG) — the pro-democracy shadow government leading the fight against the ruling junta. 'The MNDAA’s statement is a follow-up to China’s warning that the ‘three bottom lines’ must not be crossed,' said Than Soe Naing, a veteran political analyst based in Myanmar. The 'three bottom lines,' articulated by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in August, call for Myanmar to avoid civil strife, remain part of ASEAN, and prevent external interference. According to a political analyst based in Yangon who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, there is a perception in China that the National Unity Government and certain resistance forces, as well as some ethnic armed organizations, are close to the United States and are receiving U.S. support. 'This policy reflects China’s emphasis on preventing external forces from interfering in Burma's affairs, which Beijing views as critical to its regional strategy,' said political analyst Than Soe Naing, using an alternative name for Myanmar. So far, Beijing has not commented on the MNDAA’s statement, despite the group’s request for China’s help to resolve the conflict and its willingness to cease fighting and cooperate with Beijing to negotiate a solution to Myanmar’s crisis. Myanmar also has not commented on the MNDAA’s statement. Meanwhile, Myanmar’s military continues airstrikes in northern Shan State. According to a Sept. 24 MNDAA social media post,a recent strike killed one civilian and injured 16 in Lashio, former headquarters of the junta’s Northeastern Command. Beijing’s interests in Myanmar Frequent visits by Chinese officials to Myanmar have reinforced perceptions that Beijing is siding with Myanmar’s military because it perceives the opposition groups to be in alignment with the United States, observers say. 'China sees the NUG and the People’s Defense Forces as Western-backed entities, and for China, that is a red line,' said Thomas Kean, senior consultant for Myanmar at the International Crisis Group. According to Hla Kyaw Zaw, a China-based expert on China-Myanmar relations, Myanmar offers China a valuable connection to the Indian Ocean, providing an essential trade route that would allow Beijing to compete more effectively in the region with the United States. 'If Myanmar is stable, China’s southwestern land-locked provinces will have a safe and secure outlet to the sea,' Hla Kyaw Zaw explained. 'Beijing wants these initiatives to move forward quickly.' China is the largest investor in Myanmar, and the internal conflict is 'not conducive to foreign investment and trade,' according to a Stimson Center report. That said, Kean told VOA that despite MNDAA’s public stance on China, the group may still maintain limited cooperation with resistance forces to secure its territorial interests. Nan Lwin, head of the Myanmar China studies program at the Institute for Strategy and Policy - Myanmar, said, 'If China is to be credible for the Myanmar peace process, it will need to have a multi-country approach.' Balancing act for opposition Earlier this year, the National Unity Government, or NUG, issued its first formal policy statement on Beijing, pledging to safeguard Chinese investments and enterprise as resistance forces continue to gain ground in areas near the Chinese border. However, the Yangon-based analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity said this policy is insufficient to win over China, which seeks complete control in the region and wants to prevent any outside influence, particularly from the United States, near its strategic access point to the Indian Ocean. 'The more the conflict escalates on its border, the greater the risk of disagreements between China and the U.S. on Myanmar,' Kean said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-pressures-myanmar-ethnic-groups-to-cut-ties-from-forces-perceived-as-close-to-us/7797362.html	2024-09-24T18:13:46-07:00	
Academic freedom declines under Hong Kong's national security regime, report finds	Taipei, Taiwan — A report released on Wednesday finds that Hong Kong's national security law, enacted in July 2020, has eroded academic freedom in the former British colony. The report, co-authored by Human Rights Watch, and the Washington-based advocacy organization Hong Kong Democracy Council, said university authorities have imposed greater control and limitations on student activities and that students and faculty members are increasingly exercising self-censorship to avoid getting into trouble. 'Students, academics, and administrators, especially those from Hong Kong studying contemporary socio-political issues, feel as if they are living under a microscope,' the report says. Some analysts say the opaque definition of what constitutes a violation of the security law has created a chilling effect among students and faculty members at Hong Kong universities. 'When the red line isn't clear, there will be a pervasive sense of fear, and students and faculty members will try to make adjustments to ensure they don't get into trouble,' Maya Wang, the associate China director at Human Rights Watch, told VOA by phone. The report said Hong Kong's eight public universities have been managed by people who hold views favored by Beijing following the imposition of the law in 2020. Since then, university officials have increased crackdowns on student unions and banned symbols or events viewed as promoting pro-democracy values. 'University officials have punished students for holding peaceful protests and gatherings, and have broadly censored student publications, communications, and events,' the report reads. Wang at Human Rights Watch said since many college students and academics were involved in 2019 protests over an extradition bill, one of the Chinese government's priorities following the implementation of the law is to 'impose ideological control' over universities. 'The decline of academic freedom in Hong Kong's universities is part of Beijing's attempt to impose ideological control over the entire city,' she told VOA. Exercising self-censorship Most of the 33 students and academics interviewed for the report said self-censorship is a common practice at universities in Hong Kong, especially on socio-political topics related to China and Hong Kong. 'They do this when expressing themselves in classrooms, when writing and researching academic articles, and when inviting speakers for academic conferences,' the report says, adding that academics teaching Hong Kong and China current affairs feel 'especially vulnerable.' In some cases, university officials have asked academics in the social science field to stop offering courses on topics that Beijing considers sensitive. Others face censorship imposed by university administrators or academic publishers. Some academics said the prevalence of self-censorship at universities in Hong Kong will reduce international understanding of the dynamics in China. 'Hong Kong was always an important space that gives the international community some insight into what's happening in Hong Kong and the broader China, but that space is now rapidly disappearing,' Lokman Tsui, a research fellow at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab and a former journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told VOA by phone. The law's negative impact on academic freedom in Hong Kong seems to differ between academics in different fields. 'Some said [the NSL] affected everything they do; others said it has very little impact,' the report says. Since university management is stacked with supporters of the Chinese government's position, the report says university administrators have worked with Chinese and Hong Kong authorities to harass, intimidate or even remove academics voicing different opinions. 'The government does that by defaming and intimidating those academics perceived to hold liberal or pro-democracy views in the state-owned media and denying or not issuing visas to foreign academics expressing such opinions,' the report says, adding that universities would then fire, let go or deny tenure to these academics. Human Rights Watch and Hong Kong Democracy Council said the Chinese government's efforts to 'cleanse' universities in Hong Kong have led to a 'harmonization' of opinion in academia in Hong Kong. They also help amplify Chinese and Hong Kong authorities' claim that pro-democracy voices are now 'in the minority.' 'The Chinese government's overall intention has been to 'cleanse' the universities [and] the result is a sanitized version of higher education compliant with the Party's views, which so far continues to deliver a high-caliber education,' the report says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/academic-freedom-declines-under-hong-kong-s-national-security-regime-report-finds-/7797384.html	2024-09-24T17:49:32-07:00

Former executive gets 2 years in prison for role in FTX fraud	new york — Caroline Ellison, a former top executive in Sam Bankman-Fried's fallen FTX cryptocurrency empire, was sentenced to two years in prison on Tuesday after she apologized repeatedly to everyone hurt by a fraud that stole billions of dollars from investors, lenders and customers. U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan said Ellison's cooperation was 'very, very substantial' and 'remarkable.' But he said a prison sentence was necessary because she had participated in what might be the 'greatest financial fraud ever perpetrated in this country and probably anywhere else' or at least close to it. He said in such a serious case, he could not let cooperation be a get-out-of-jail-free card, even when it was clear that Bankman-Fried had become 'your kryptonite.' 'I've seen a lot of cooperators in 30 years here,' he said. 'I've never seen one quite like Ms. Ellison.' She was ordered to report to prison on November 7. Ellison, 29, pleaded guilty nearly two years ago and testified against Bankman-Fried for nearly three days at a trial last November. At sentencing, she emotionally apologized to anyone hurt by the fraud that stretched from 2017 through 2022. 'I'm deeply ashamed with what I've done,' she said, fighting through tears to say she was 'so so sorry' to everyone she had harmed directly or indirectly. She did not speak as she left Manhattan federal court, surrounded by lawyers. In a court filing, prosecutors had called her testimony the 'cornerstone of the trial' against Bankman-Fried, 32, who was found guilty of fraud and sentenced to 25 years in prison. In court Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon called for leniency, saying her testimony was 'devastating and powerful proof' against Bankman-Fried. The prosecutor said Ellison's time on the witness stand was very different from Bankman-Fried, who she said was 'evasive, even contemptuous, and unable to answer questions directly' when he testified. Attorney Anjan Sahni asked the judge to spare his client from prison, citing 'unusual circumstances,' including her off-and-on romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried and the damage caused when her 'whole professional and personal life came to revolve' around him. FTX was one of the world's most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, known for its Superbowl TV ad and its extensive lobbying campaign in Washington before it collapsed in 2022. U.S. prosecutors accused Bankman-Fried and other executives of looting customer accounts on the exchange to make risky investments, make millions of dollars of illegal political donations, bribe Chinese officials, and buy luxury real estate in the Caribbean. Ellison was chief executive at Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency hedge fund controlled by Bankman-Fried that was used to process some customer funds from FTX. As the business began to falter, Ellison divulged the massive fraud to employees who worked for her even before FTX filed for bankruptcy, trial evidence showed. Ultimately, she also spoke extensively with criminal and civil U.S. investigators. Sassoon said prosecutors were impressed that Ellison did not 'jump into the lifeboat' to escape her crimes but instead spent nearly two years fully cooperating. Since testifying at Bankman-Fried's trial, Ellison has engaged in extensive charity work, written a novel, and worked with her parents on a math enrichment textbook for advanced high school students, according to her lawyers. They said she also now has a healthy romantic relationship and has reconnected with high school friends she had lost touch with while she worked for and sometimes dated Bankman-Fried from 2017 until late 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-executive-gets-2-years-in-prison-for-role-in-ftx-fraud-/7797349.html	2024-09-24T17:16:11-07:00

Women's rights activists at UN call for inclusion in negotiations with Taliban	washington — Afghan women and their international supporters are calling for the inclusion of women in any negotiations on the future of Afghanistan amid the Taliban's increasing restrictions on women in the country. In a side event on the eve of the United Nations General Assembly, co-hosted by Ireland, Indonesia, Switzerland and Qatar together with the Women's Forum on Afghanistan, women's activists called on the international community to stand with Afghan women in the face of the Taliban's repressive measures. Academy Award-winning actress Meryl Streep, who participated in the meeting, said Afghan women have been stripped of their rights under the Taliban. 'A bird may sing in Kabul but a girl may not, and a woman may not in public,' she said. 'This is extraordinary. This is a suppression of the natural law. This is odd.' Streep was referring to the Taliban's newly imposed morality law that prohibits women from speaking aloud in public. 'Whenever an adult woman leaves her home out of necessity, she is obliged to conceal her voice, face, and body,' the new law states. U.N. human rights experts say the Taliban's law issued last month would further restrict women's rights. 'It reinforces and expands existing discriminatory policies, such as mandatory dress codes, the requirement for women to have a male guardian [mahram], and the segregation of men and women in public spaces,' the U.N. human rights experts said in an August 30 news release. Since returning to power in 2021, the Taliban have imposed repressive measures on women in Afghanistan, including banning them from getting secondary and university education, and barring them from working with government and nongovernmental organizations. Under the Taliban, girls and women are not allowed to travel long distances without a male relative and may not go to parks, public baths and gyms. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a side meeting at UNGA that the Taliban's treatment of women can be compared to 'some of the most egregious systems of oppression in recent history.' 'We will continue to amplify the voices of Afghan women and call for them to play a full role in the country's life, both inside its borders and on the global stage,' he said. Yousafzai demands end to discrimination Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai said at the UNGA that discrimination against women should stop in Afghanistan. 'A threat to girls rights in Afghanistan is a threat to girls everywhere,' Yousafzai said in a Facebook post. 'I want us to push our leaders to hold the Taliban accountable for their crimes against humanity. Let's act for our common future.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/women-s-rights-activists-at-un-call-for-inclusion-in-negotiations-with-taliban/7797046.html	2024-09-24T16:39:02-07:00

Statue of American music legend Johnny Cash unveiled at US Capitol	Washington — Johnny Cash now stands among the most famous politicians, trailblazers and activists of American history as he became the first professional musician to be honored with a statue in the U.S. Capitol. Congressional leaders from both parties and members of the Cash family were among the several hundred guests who gathered Tuesday for the unveiling of the statue. They shared their memories of a man who grew up on an Arkansas cotton farm and turned a love of music into a decades-long career that gave voice to the struggles and triumphs of everyday Americans. 'Some may ask: Why should a musician have a statue here in the halls of the great American republic?' House Speaker Mike Johnson said at the unveiling ceremony. 'The answer is pretty simple. It’s because America is about more than laws and politics.' Each state selects two statues to place within the Capitol. The Cash statue is the second new figure Arkansas has sent to replace two existing images that had represented the state at the U.S. Capitol for more than 100 years. Another statue depicting civil rights leader Daisy Bates was unveiled at the Capitol earlier this year. Bates mentored the nine Black children who desegregated Little Rock Central High School in 1957. The state’s legislature in 2019 voted to replace Arkansas’ two prior statues, which depicted little-known figures from the 18th and 19th centuries, with Bates and Cash. Known as the 'The Man in Black,' Cash was a vivid storyteller who sang with a deep voice songs like 'I Walk The Line,' 'Ring of Fire,' 'Jackson' and 'A Boy Named Sue.' The statue depicts the singer with a guitar slung across his back and a Bible in his hand. Little Rock sculptor Kevin Kresse created the statue. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said artistic creativity is an important part of the country's growth, and Cash's 'substance' and 'swagger' inspired generations of artists from every genre imaginable. He quoted singers such as Bob Dylan and Snoop Dogg about Cash's impact. 'He called Johnny Cash a real American gangster. That a compliment from Snoop Doggy Dogg,' Jeffries said as the audience laughed. 'What a life, what a legend, what a legacy.' Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders led a group of Arkansas lawmakers at the ceremony. She said she grew up in a musical family where 'after God and country, came Johnny Cash.' She noted how Cash struggled with addiction but went on to perform for prisoners and held a deep religious faith. She described him as a 'hymn-singing Christian' who also experienced difficult times. 'When so much in today's world is fake, Johnny Cash was very real,' Sanders said. Cash's daughter, Rosanne Cash, said her father would have viewed the statue 'as the ultimate' honor in his life. She said her father's hard upbringing instilled in him a strong work ethic and that he loved the idea of America as a place of dreams and refuge. 'This man was a living redemption story,' Rosanne Cash said. 'He encountered darkness and met it with love.' Cash was born in Kingsland, a tiny town about 100 kilometers south of Little Rock. He died in 2003 at age 71. His achievements include 90 million records sold worldwide spanning country, rock, blues, folk and gospel. He is among the few artists inducted into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Cash's statue will be the newest added to the Capitol since one from North Carolina depicting the Rev. Billy Graham was unveiled in May.	https://www.voanews.com/a/statue-of-american-music-legend-johnny-cash-unveiled-at-us-capitol/7799410.html	2024-09-24T15:27:18-07:00

At UN, Africa renews calls for Security Council seats	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigeria has joined the growing calls by Africans leaders for permanent representation on the United Nations Security Council. On the sidelines of the 79th U.N. General Assembly in New York on Tuesday, Nigerian Defense Minister Mohammed Badaru said such a change would promote fairness and inclusivity. 'We have been in 41 different United Nations’ missions to provide security across the world,' Badaru said. 'Based on that background and the effort of Africa, we also call on the United Nations to reform the Security Council so that Africa can have a permanent seat. It is time. We deserve it for justice and for equity.' Other African nations also are clamoring for change. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday said, 'Placing the fate of the world’s security in the hands of a select few when it is the vast majority who bear the brunt of these threats is unjust, unfair and unsustainable.' Similarly, Kenyan President William Ruto criticized the multilateral system, saying, 'It has proven inadequate.' Many African countries were still under colonial rule at the time the Security Council was established. In 2005, the African Union adopted the so-called Ezulwini Consensus in Ethiopia for Africa to have at least two permanent and five nonpermanent seats at the U.N. council. To date, though, the U.N. General Assembly elects five new members from different geographical zones for two-year terms on the council. Africa has three rotational seats on the 15-member council. The founder of Security Watch Africa Initiative, Patrick Agbambu, said Africa needs to be united to make a good representation. 'The biggest threat to Africa getting that seat is Africa itself,' Agbambu said. 'Africa does not have a united front; they do not have a common voice to be able to push two countries or one country forward. You can't go for such with a divided house. 'As it stands, the various blocs in the African Union seem very divided, with each having a very strong opposition to the other. So, the world is just watching Africa,' he said. Last week, the United States, one of five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, said it is open to having two African seats on the council but without the veto power of the original permanent members: Britain, China, France, Russia and the U.S. Security analyst Senator Iroegbu said African representation on the Security Council is the right call but warned that it wouldn’t solve all problems. 'Nigeria stands in the right mix because it's one of the most important countries in Africa and it's the most populous nation in Africa, with huge economic potential,' he said. 'But just being a member of [the] U.N. Security Council doesn't guarantee stability at home if all the factors causing insecurity are not well addressed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-africa-renews-calls-for-security-council-seats/7796868.html	2024-09-24T13:33:45-07:00	
Qataris can travel to US without visa; first Gulf nation to meet requirements	new york — The Gulf nation of Qatar on Tuesday became just the second Muslim-majority country to be admitted into a program that allows its citizens to travel to the United States without first obtaining a U.S. visa. The departments of State and Homeland Security jointly announced that Qatar had met stringent eligibility requirements to join the visa waiver program. Those requirements include a low visa refusal rate, a low rate of visa overstays and a demand of reciprocal treatment of American travelers, who are already allowed to visit Qatar without a visa for up to 30 days. 'Qatar has been an exceptional partner for the United States, and our strategic relationship has only grown stronger over the past few years,' the departments said in a statement. 'This is further evidence of our strategic partnership and our shared commitment to security and stability.' Qatar, which has played a key role in trying to negotiate a cease-fire deal in Gaza and was an instrumental U.S. partner before and during the American withdrawal from Afghanistan, is the 42nd country to be admitted to the program. Most countries whose citizens can visit the U.S. without a visa are longstanding allies in Europe and Asia. The only other Muslim-majority country in the program is the tiny Southeast Asian nation of Brunei. Although Qatar's population is just over 3 million people, only a small percentage of those — about 320,000 — are actually Qataris who would be eligible for the program if they hold valid passports. The vast majority of people who live in Qatar are foreign workers and other expatriates who do not hold Qatari passports. The program allows citizens of qualifying nations to enter the U.S. for business or tourism without a visa for up to 90 days, although they must still obtain approval through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or ESTA, which is done online and doesn't require an in-person interview as visa applications do. After Oct. 1, U.S. citizens will be allowed to stay in Qatar without a visa for 90 days. Israel was the last country admitted to the program in 2023, and it was allowed in despite significant concerns that it does not treat Palestinian Americans, Arab Americans or Muslim Americans the same as other U.S. passport holders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/qataris-can-travel-to-us-without-visa-first-gulf-nation-to-meet-requirements-/7796871.html	2024-09-24T13:33:24-07:00	
Delegates from African countries meet to discuss trade in live elephants	Gaborone, Botswana — Botswana is hosting delegates from 33 African elephant range states for talks on the trade in live elephants. They are also seeking a common position as Africa battles increasing elephant populations in some areas, while the numbers decline elsewhere on the continent. Botswana’s environment and tourism minister, Nnaniki Makwinja, said Africa must speak with one voice despite the peculiar challenges each region faces. 'We are cognizant that the challenges that we face are diverse and there is no silver bullet to address these challenges,' Makwinja said Monday during the opening of the four-day meeting. 'We call upon these countries to engage with us before they adopt measures that may undermine our efforts to conserve our wildlife heritage and sustainable development goals.' In 2022, delegates from Africa attended talks in Panama on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES. They were divided over elephant management. Southern African nations want CITES to relax measures on elephant trade, but some parts of the continent, particularly the eastern and western areas, want stricter controls. Dan Challender, a conservation scientist on the wildlife trade based at the University of Oxford, said this week’s meeting in Botswana might not address all concerns given the uneven distribution of the animals across the continent. 'The meeting provides an opportunity for African countries to come together and discuss trade in African elephants. I would expect them to find common ground on some issues but not all, recognizing the different status of the species and policy environments across the continent,' Challender said. The meeting is open to governments, but non-profit conservation organizations are not invited. Local conservationist Isaac Theophilus of the Botswana Wildlife Producers Association said delegates from countries that oppose trade in elephants should get a chance to see the impact of human-wildlife conflict. 'We have two opposing blocks that will be seated around the same table to look at issues relating to elephant management,' Theophilus said. 'My hope and wish is that those states attending would have an opportunity to interact with people in the (wildlife) area and get firsthand information relating to problems associated with living with an increasing elephant population.' Veterinarian and wildlife management expert Dr. Eric Verreynne said trade in live elephants poses logistical challenges. 'Transporting elephants from one country to another brings with it some challenges. Most of these challenges relate to logistics,' Verreynne said. 'They are bulk animals; it's very, very expensive to transport. When you talk about females and calves, you have to take your family groups in one. The capacity to transport large numbers of elephants is limited.' Africa’s elephant population is estimated at 415,000, with more than half of the number living in southern Africa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/delegates-from-african-countries-meet-to-discuss-trade-in-live-elephants-/7796861.html	2024-09-24T13:09:36-07:00

Iran believes all remaining workers have died in coal mine explosion	TEHRAN, Iran — Iran said Tuesday it believes the remaining workers trapped by an explosion at a coal mine in the country's east have died, bringing the death toll in one of its worst industrial disasters to at least 49. A provincial emergency official, Mohammad Ali Akhoundi, gave the death toll in a report carried by Iranian state television from the mine in Tabas. Figures for the numbers of miners inside the mine at the time have fluctuated since a methane gas leak on Saturday sparked an explosion at the coal mine in Tabas, about 540 kilometers southeast of the capital, Tehran. Around 70 people had been working at the time of the blast. Bodies recovered so far showed no signs of blast injuries, suggesting many of the workers died from the gas before the blast. Such gases are common in mining, although modern safety measures call for ventilation and other measures to protect workers. It wasn't immediately clear what safety procedures were in place at the privately owned Tabas Parvadeh 5 mine, operated by Mandanjoo Company. The firm could not be reached for comment. On Tuesday, a lawmaker and member of parliament's mine committee said the safety system of the mine was not working and 'even the central alarm system was broken or did not exist.' Lawmaker Zahra Saeedi added that workers learned of the safety issue just before the disaster but couldn't leave in time. Two of the dead were health and safety experts at the mine, she said. Iran's new reformist president, Masoud Pezeshkian, in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, has said he ordered all efforts be made to rescue those trapped and aid their families. He also said an investigation into the explosion was underway. Iran's mining industry has been struck by disasters before. In 2017, a coal mine explosion killed at least 42 people. Then-President Hassan Rouhani, campaigning ahead of winning reelection, visited the site in Iran's northern Golestan province and angry miners besieged the SUV he rode in, kicking and beating the armored vehicle in a rage. In 2013, 11 workers were killed in two separate mining incidents. In 2009, 20 workers were killed in several incidents. Lax safety standards and inadequate emergency services in mining areas were often blamed for the fatalities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-believes-all-remaining-workers-have-died-in-coal-mine-explosion/7796786.html	2024-09-24T12:28:06-07:00	
US Justice Department sues Visa, saying it monopolizes debit card markets	NEW YORK — The U.S. Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa on Tuesday, alleging that the financial services behemoth uses its size and dominance to stifle competition in the debit card market, costing consumers and businesses billions of dollars. The complaint says Visa penalizes merchants and banks who don't use Visa's own payment processing technology to process debit transactions, even though alternatives exist. Visa earns an incremental fee from every transaction processed on its network. According to the DOJ's complaint, 60% of debit transactions in the United States run on Visa's debit network, allowing it to charge over $7 billion in fees each year for processing those transactions. 'We allege that Visa has unlawfully amassed the power to extract fees that far exceed what it could charge in a competitive market,' said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement. 'Merchants and banks pass along those costs to consumers, either by raising prices or reducing quality or service. As a result, Visa's unlawful conduct affects not just the price of one thing — but the price of nearly everything.' The Biden administration has aggressively gone after U.S. companies that it says act like middlemen, such as Ticketmaster parent Live Nation and the real estate software company RealPage, accusing them of burdening Americans with nonsensical fees and anticompetitive behavior. The administration has also brought charges of monopolistic behavior against technology giants such as Apple and Google. According to the DOJ complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Visa leverages the vast number of transactions on its network to impose volume commitments on merchants and their banks, as well as on financial institutions that issue debit cards. That makes it difficult for merchants to use alternatives, such as lower-cost or smaller payment processors, instead of Visa's payment processing technology, without incurring what DOJ described as 'disloyalty penalties' from Visa. The DOJ said Visa also stifled competition by paying to enter into partnership agreements with potential competitors. In 2020, the DOJ sued to block the company's $5.3 billion purchase of financial technology startup Plaid, calling it a monopolistic takeover of a potential competitor to Visa's ubiquitous payments network. That acquisition was later called off. Visa previously disclosed the Justice Department was investigating the company in 2021, saying in a regulatory filing it was cooperating with a DOJ investigation into its debit practices. Since the pandemic, more consumers globally have been shopping online for goods and services, which has translated into more revenue for Visa in the form of fees. Even traditionally cash-heavy businesses such as bars, barbers and coffee shops have started accepting credit or debit cards as a form of payment, often via smartphones. Visa processed $3.325 trillion in transactions on its network during the quarter ended June 30, up 7.4% from a year earlier. U.S. payments grew by 5.1%, which is faster than U.S. economic growth. Visa, based in San Francisco, did not immediately have a comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7796751.html	2024-09-24T11:53:44-07:00

Swiss police detain several people in connection with 'suicide capsule'	GENEVA — Police in northern Switzerland said Tuesday that several people have been detained and a criminal case opened in connection with the suspected death of a person in a 'suicide capsule.' The 'Sarco' capsule is presumably designed to allow a person sitting in a reclining seat inside to push a button that injects nitrogen gas into the sealed chamber. The person is then supposed to fall asleep and die by suffocation in a few minutes. Exit International, an assisted suicide group based in the Netherlands, said it is behind the 3D-printed device that cost over $1 million to develop. Swiss law allows assisted suicide so long as the person takes his or her life with no 'external assistance' and those who help the person die do not do so for 'any self-serving motive,' according to a government website. A law firm informed prosecutors in Schaffhausen canton that an assisted suicide involving the Sarco had taken place Monday near a forest cabin in Merishausen, regional police said in a statement. They said that 'several people' were taken into custody and that prosecutors opened an investigation on suspicion of incitement and accessory to suicide. Dutch newspaper Volkskrant reported Tuesday that police had detained one of its photographers who wanted to take pictures of the use of the Sarco. It said Schaffhausen police had indicated the photographer was being held at a police station but declined to give a further explanation. The newspaper declined to comment further when contacted by the Associated Press. In an email, the Dutch Foreign Ministry told the AP that it was in contact with the newspaper and Swiss officials. 'As always, we cannot interfere in the legal process of another country. At the same time, the Netherlands stands firmly for press freedom. It is very important that journalists worldwide can do their work freely,' it said. Exit International, the group behind the Sarco, said in a statement a 64-year-old woman from the U.S. Midwest — it did not specify further — who had suffered from 'severe immune compromise' had died Monday afternoon near the German border using the Sarco device. It said Florian Willet, co-president of The Last Resort, a Swiss affiliate of Exit International, was the only person present and described her death as 'peaceful, fast and dignified.' Dr. Philip Nitschke, an Australian-born trained doctor behind Exit International, has previously told the AP that his organization received advice from lawyers in Switzerland that the use of the Sarco would be legal in the country. In the Exit International statement on Tuesday, Nitschke said he was 'pleased that the Sarco had performed exactly as it had been designed ... to provide an elective, non-drug, peaceful death at the time of the person's choosing.' The claims of Nitschke and Exit International could not be independently verified. On Monday, Health Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider was asked in Swiss parliament about the legal conditions for the use of the Sarco capsule. She suggested its use would not be legal. 'On one hand, it does not fulfill the demands of the product safety law, and as such, must not be brought into circulation,' she said. 'On the other hand, the corresponding use of nitrogen is not compatible with the article on purpose in the chemicals law.' In July, Swiss newspaper Blick reported that Peter Sticher, a state prosecutor in Schaffhausen, wrote to Exit International's lawyers saying any operator of the suicide capsule could face criminal proceedings if it was used there — and any conviction could bring up to five years in prison. Prosecutors in other Swiss regions have also indicated that the use of the suicide capsule could lead to prosecution. Over the summer, a 54-year-old U.S. woman with multiple health ailments had planned to be the first person to use the device, but those plans were abandoned. Switzerland is among the only countries in the world where foreigners can travel to legally end their lives and has organizations that are dedicated to helping people kill themselves. But unlike others, including the Netherlands, Switzerland does not allow euthanasia, which involves health care practitioners killing patients with a lethal injection at their request and in specific circumstances. Some lawmakers in Switzerland have argued that the law is unclear and have sought to close what they call legal loopholes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swiss-police-detain-several-people-in-connection-with-suicide-capsule-/7796700.html	2024-09-24T11:24:22-07:00	
Pope Francis takes on Belgium, Luxembourg and perhaps euthanasia, too	rome — Despite suffering a mild flu Monday, Pope Francis still plans to travel later this week to Luxembourg and Belgium to visit a once-solid bastion of Roman Catholic culture that now has decreasing church attendance and increasing use of euthanasia. Michele Dillon is a sociologist and the dean of the University of New Hampshire’s College of Liberal Arts. She is also the author of the book, Postsecular Catholicism: Relevance and Renewal. Dillon told VOA that while Pope Francis engages in interreligious dialogue in Asia, Europe and places like Belgium and Luxembourg remain very important to him and the Roman Catholic Church. 'Secularization has sort of really accelerated certainly in the last 20 years. Euthanasia legislation is a good example of that,' she said. Both countries have legalized euthanasia, ending the life of a patient suffering a serious physical or mental illness. 'They have a lot of sex abuse issues there [meaning Belgium] at the highest level to the Church hierarchy. It’s his commitment to really go to where the people are. He is very clear-eyed about what the problems are, the problems within the Church, what the problems of society at large are.' Veteran Vatican observers in Rome, like Francis X. Rocca, formerly of The Wall Street Journal, point out that Belgium was the second country to legalize euthanasia, after the neighboring Netherlands, in 2002. Twelve years later, it legalized euthanasia for minors, with no minimum age specified. Rocca told VOA that Belgium, once historically staunchly Catholic, is seeing a drop in church attendance, while putting in place laws like euthanasia, against its teaching. 'After 22 years of legalization of euthanasia in Belgium, the practices increased steeply, and it’s become much more popular and that’s in direct contradiction with the teachings of the Catholic Church,' Rocca said. 'So, there is a broader question of how welcome his message will be, his presence. There have been some complaints by people in the media there. 'But the question of euthanasia is probably the starkest one because the Church itself has had to figure out ways of ministering to people who have chosen euthanasia.' Rocca added that there are people in the church who approve of euthanasia or think at least it can be justified. He said that includes at least one bishop, the bishop of Antwerp, Johan Bonny. Rocca said that even some Catholic institutions in Belgium, including hospitals, have accommodated the use of euthanasia. But he questions whether the pope will address concerns over euthanasia explicitly or only allude to it. 'He’s condemned euthanasia as being part of what he calls a ‘throwaway’ culture,' Rocca said. 'It’s a question whether he will speak about this when he goes on his trip because Francis doesn’t generally confront these controversial or cultural questions head on when he’s in a country.' The University of New Hampshire’s Dillon said Francis is 'not necessarily going to change things in Belgium and Luxembourg.' 'I think it’s important to what he would call evangelization — being with the people, whether they are first world or third world,' she said. 'He wants to go to countries and show people that he wants to engage with them, talk with them about the challenges and the circumstances of their lives.' Still, Rocca says the sight of 87-year-old Pope Francis in a wheelchair, defying his infirmities, while taking his mission to the world, speaks volumes about his commitment to life.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7796680.html	2024-09-24T11:12:49-07:00

FBI: Son of suspect in Trump assassination attempt arrested on child sexual abuse images charges	WASHINGTON — The son of the man suspected in the assassination attempt in Florida against former President Donald Trump has been arrested on federal charges of possessing child sexual abuse images. Oran Alexander Routh was arrested this week after authorities searched his Greensboro, North Carolina, home 'in connection with an investigation unrelated to child exploitation,' and found hundreds of files depicting child sexual abuse, an FBI agent said in court papers. Investigators who seized multiple electronic devices found videos sent to Oran Routh in July as well as chats from a messaging application commonly used by people who share child sexual abuse material, the FBI agent said. He faces two charges of possessing and receiving child sexual abuse material and is expected to appear later Tuesday in federal court in North Carolina. There was no attorney listed for Oran Routh in court papers. Phone messages left for relatives of Oran Routh were not immediately returned. Oran Routh's father, Ryan Wesley Routh, has been charged with federal gun offenses in connection to the attempted assassination at Trump's Florida golf course earlier this month. Prosecutors have indicated much more serious attempted assassination charges are coming. Oran Routh's arrest was first reported Tuesday by ABC News. A federal judge on Monday agreed with Justice Department prosecutors that Ryan Routh should remain locked up while he awaits trial in his case. Prosecutors have said Ryan Routh left behind a note detailing his plans to kill the former president and kept in his car a handwritten list of dates and venues where Trump was to appear. The note describing Routh's plans was placed in a box that he dropped off months earlier at the home of an unidentified person who did not open it until after Ryan Routh's arrest, prosecutors said. Ryan Routh is currently charged with illegally possessing his gun in spite of multiple felony convictions, including two charges of possessing stolen goods in 2002 in North Carolina, and with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. But a prosecutor said in court Monday that they would pursue additional charges before a grand jury, accusing him of having tried to 'assassinate a major political candidate' — charges that would warrant life in prison in the event of a conviction. It is common for prosecutors to file more easily provable charges as an immediate placeholder before adding more significant allegations as the case proceeds. Ryan Routh was arrested September 15 after a Secret Service agent who was scoping the Trump International Golf Club for potential security threats saw a partially obscured man's face and the barrel of a semiautomatic rifle, aimed directly at the former president. The agent fired at Routh, who sped away before being stopped by officials in a neighboring county, leaving behind a loaded rifle, digital camera, a backpack and a reusable shopping bag that was hanging from a chain-link fence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-son-of-suspect-in-trump-assassination-attempt-arrested-on-child-sexual-abuse-images-charges-/7796556.html	2024-09-24T10:08:28-07:00

Same-sex couples in Thailand to legally wed starting January	Bangkok — Thailand's landmark marriage equality bill was officially written into law Tuesday, allowing same-sex couples to legally wed. The law was published in the Royal Gazette after endorsement by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, and will come into effect in 120 days. This means LGBTQ+ couples will be able to register their marriage in January next year, making Thailand the third place in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, to allow same-sex marriage. The bill, which grants full legal, financial and medical rights for marriage partners of any gender, sailed through both the House of Representatives and the Senate in April and June respectively. 'Congratulations to everyone's love,' Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra wrote on X, adding the hashtag #Love Wins. Thailand has a reputation for acceptance and inclusivity but struggled for decades to pass a marriage equality law. Thai society largely holds conservative values, and members of the LGBTQ+ community say they face discrimination in everyday life. The government and state agencies are also historically conservative, and advocates for gender equality had a hard time pushing lawmakers and civil servants to accept change. Bangkok Deputy Governor Sanon Wangsrangboon said last week that the city officials will be ready to register same-sex marriages as soon as the law gets enacted. The legislation amended the country's Civil and Commercial Code to replace gender-specific words such as 'men and women' with gender-neutral words such as 'individual.' The government led by the Pheu Thai party has made marriage equality one of its main goals. It made a major effort to identify itself with the annual Bangkok Pride parade in June, in which thousands of people celebrated in one of Bangkok's busiest commercial districts. The organizers of Bangkok Pride announced on Facebook that it will organize a wedding for couples who wish to register their marriage on the very first day that the law becomes effective.	https://www.voanews.com/a/same-sex-couples-in-thailand-to-legally-wed-starting-january/7796439.html	2024-09-24T08:47:22-07:00

UN accuses Russia of systematic torture of Ukrainian civilians, prisoners	GENEVA — Investigators at the United Nations accuse Russia of using torture and sexual violence with impunity against Ukrainian citizens and prisoners of war in occupied Ukrainian territories and in the Russian Federation. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine submitted its latest update on the situation in Ukraine on Monday to the U.N. Human Rights Council, which continued a review of its findings during an interactive dialogue on Tuesday. In his oral presentation, commission chair Erik Mose told the council that men were most of the victims subjected to torture, and that new evidence shows that sexual violence is used as a means of torture 'mainly against male victims in detention, and of rapes targeting women in villages under Russian control.' 'The wide geographic spread of locations where torture was committed, and the prevalence of shared patterns, demonstrate that torture has been used as a common and acceptable practice by Russian authorities, with a sense of impunity,' Mose said, adding that the latest findings reaffirm previous reports that torture committed by Russian authorities has been 'widespread and systematic.' 'Our recent investigations show that Russian authorities have committed torture in Ukrainian regions where they have taken control of territories. This reinforces the finding that torture has been widespread,' Mose said. The commission has identified several common elements in the use of torture by Russian authorities, 'reinforcing its earlier finding that this was systematic.' It notes that similar forms of torture were practiced in detention centers where detainees from Ukraine have been held in the Russian Federation, as well as in large penitentiary centers in occupied areas of Ukraine. Another common element emerging from the evidence points toward a coordinated use of personnel from specific services of the Russian Federation 'who are involved in torture in all the detention facilities' investigated by the commission. 'A further common feature is the recurrent use of sexual violence as a form of torture in almost all these detention centers,' Mose said. Russia boycotted the meeting, refusing to respond to the commission’s report as a concerned country. Russia had its supporters, however, several of whom disproved of the report. Belarus called the commission’s accusations 'false and unsubstatiated by facts' and invited specialized national organizations 'to study the situation on the ground for themselves.' Eritrea, Syria and Venezuela echoed these sentiments, as did the representative of North Korea, who described 'the Ukraine incident' as one of the big geopolitical crises facing the world today and 'a direct product of the confrontation of the West against the Russian Federation.' Most of the other countries participating in the interactive dialogue condemned Russia’s blatant defiance of the U.N. Charter and international law. They demanded that Russia 'cease its illegal, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression,' including the relentless airstrikes against Ukrainian civilians and critical infrastructure. Michele Taylor, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, thanked the commission for its detailed work in 'documenting Russia’s violations of international law in Ukraine.' 'Since Russia’s brutal, full-scale invasion of Ukraine, we have seen over and over again credible reports that Russia targets civilian objects in violation of international humanitarian law. 'The effects of Russia’s brutal attacks in Putin’s war of choice are severe,' she said, adding that more must be done 'to hold those who commit any such acts accountable and ensure justice for the victims.' Ukrainians personally involved in Putin’s 'war of choice' welcomed the commission’s findings. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, underscored the importance of ensuring justice and accountability for torture, sexual violence and other 'atrocities that Russia has brought to Ukraine’s soil' 10 years after Russia invaded Ukraine, and over two years after its full-scale aggression on Ukraine. 'Thousands of Ukrainian captives, including civilians and particularly children, are forcibly detained by Russia in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine and in Russia in particular,' Kostin said. 'I am grateful to the U.N. Commission of Inquiry for maintaining an investigative focus on the systematic torture of Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russian captivity and increasing reports of their summary execution,' which he said 'amount to war crimes and potentially other crimes under international law.' Dmytro Lubinets, Ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights, also expressed his gratitude to the commission for its work in preparing evidence for international judicial bodies and paving the way 'for bringing the perpetrators' of crimes against his people to justice. 'Unfortunately, due to the unprovoked Russian invasion, Ukraine has become a country where brutal crimes continue to be committed,' including the murder of civilians, deportation of children, executions of prisoners of war and massive missile attacks and destruction of civilian infrastructure. 'I urge you to continue your work despite all the difficulties,' Lubinets said, noting that the documentation of crimes, victims’ testimonies and facts are the basis 'for ensuring the proper international justice that Ukraine needs.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-accuses-russia-of-systematic-torture-of-ukrainian-civilians-prisoners/7796351.html	2024-09-24T07:49:51-07:00	
Ancient coastal city in Egypt feels impact of changing climate	Egypt’s second-largest city, Alexandria, lies in the Eastern Mediterranean, a top climate change hotspot that has dealt with record global air and ocean temperatures this year.

Heavy rains lash Cayman Islands as southeast US prepares for major hurricane	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Heavy rains lashed the Cayman Islands on Tuesday as forecasters warned that a nearby cluster of thunderstorms could soon become a major hurricane en route to the southeast U.S. Hurricane watches were in effect for Florida's Tampa Bay and from Englewood to Indian Pass, as well as for eastern Mexico from Cabo Catoche to Tulum and for Cuba's Pinar del Rio province. Hurricane conditions could be possible in parts of Cuba and Mexico early Wednesday and in parts of Florida late Wednesday and early Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The disturbance would then move 'over extremely deep and warm waters' that would fuel its intensification. 'Conditions look quite favorable for strengthening over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday and Thursday,' the center said. 'This system will become quite large and powerful before landfall.' The disturbance is expected to become Tropical Storm Helene on Tuesday and then strengthen into a Category 3 hurricane before approaching the northeast Gulf Coast. Since 2000, eight major hurricanes have made landfall in Florida, according to Philip Klotzbach, a Colorado State University hurricane researcher. Given the anticipated large size, storm surge, wind and rain will extend far from the center of the expected storm, especially on the east side. The center warned of 'inland penetration of strong winds over parts of the southeastern United States after landfall.' A tropical storm warning was in effect for Grand Cayman; for eastern Mexico from Rio Lagartos to Tulum; and for Cuba's Artemisa, Pinar del Rio and the Isle of Youth. Meanwhile, a storm surge watch was in effect for Florida's Tampa Bay, Charlotte Harbor and from Indian Pass south to Flamingo. A tropical storm watch was issued for Dry Tortugas, the Lower Keys west of the Seven Mile Bridge, Flamingo to the south of Englewood and from west of Indian Pass to the Walton Bay county line. The National Weather Service in Tallahassee, Florida, urged people to take potential evacuations seriously. '10-15ft of surge is NOT survivable,' it wrote on the social media platform X. On Monday, Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 41 counties. The disturbance was expected to strengthen into a major hurricane as it approaches the northeast Gulf Coast on Thursday. It was located about 150 miles (240 kilometers) west of Grand Cayman. It had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) and was moving northwest at 9 mph (15 kph). Officials in the Cayman Islands shuttered schools and airports as forecasters warned of heavy wind and rain and waves of up to 10 feet (3 meters). 'The current conditions present significant risk, and we must prioritize our safety,' said Ian Yearwood with the Royal Cayman Islands Police Service. Meanwhile, many in Cuba worried about the disturbance, whose tentacles are expected to reach the capital of Havana, which is struggling with a severe shortage of water and piles of uncollected garbage. Overall, roughly 600,000 people in Cuba are experiencing water shortages, including more than 130,000 in Havana alone. Chronic power outages also persist. The disturbance is expected to slip through waters separating Cuba from Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula late Tuesday and then head north to the Gulf Coast. Up to 8 inches of rain is forecast for western Cuba and the Cayman Islands with isolated total of some 12 inches (30 centimeters). Up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain is expected for the eastern Yucatán Peninsula, with isolated total of more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) inches. Heavy rainfall also is forecast for the southeast U.S. starting on Wednesday, threatening flash and river flooding, according to the National Hurricane Center. Up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain was forecast for the region, with isolated totals of 10 inches (25 centimeters). A storm surge of up to 15 feet (5 meters) was forecast from Ochlockonee River, Florida, to Chassahowitzka, and up to 10 feet (3 meters) from Chassahowitzka to Anclote River and from Indian Pass to Ochlockonee River. Helene would be the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season that runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures. It forecast 17 to 25 named storms, with four to seven major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher.	https://www.voanews.com/a/heavy-rains-lash-cayman-islands-as-southeast-us-prepares-for-major-hurricane-/7796274.html	2024-09-24T06:51:26-07:00	
US Navy ship operating in Mideast damaged in incident, officials say	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A U.S. Navy replenishment ship operating in the Middle East sustained damage in an incident which is under investigation, officials said Tuesday. The damage to the USNS Big Horn comes after the oiler had supplied the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group and remained in the region amid heightened tensions over the Israel-Hamas war and Israel's ongoing strikes targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. A U.S. Navy official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters yet to be made public, said the damage happened in the Mideast, but declined to elaborate on its location. 'All crew members are safe, and we’re assessing the situation, and we’ll provide additional information at a later time,' the official said. There was no sign of an oil leak from the vessel. Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reason, said the vessel was being supported by private tugboats and an assessment was still ongoing for the vessel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-navy-ship-operating-in-mideast-damaged-in-incident-officials-say/7796235.html	2024-09-24T06:22:51-07:00	
To preserve sea power, US looks to Japan for help	Tokyo — U.S. naval dominance, unchallenged for decades, is now coming under strain as China’s state-backed shipbuilding industry rapidly expands, while the U.S. Navy faces severe maintenance delays. The impact is being felt across the Navy. While some ships and submarines are stuck waiting for repairs at overcrowded U.S. shipyards, others are forced into extended deployments, pushing crews and vessels to their limits. Analysts say the delays undermine the U.S. ability to project strength and deter conflict, especially in key areas like the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, where China is upsetting the status quo. To help fix the problem, the U.S. is turning to its allies — particularly Japan, one of the world’s largest shipbuilders. Earlier this year, U.S. and Japanese officials began negotiating a plan to expand Japan’s role in performing major repairs on U.S. Navy vessels at its shipyards. Rahm Emanuel, U.S. ambassador to Japan, sees the proposal as crucial for keeping U.S. ships in the region. 'The Indo-Pacific is an away game for us…but with allies, it’s closer to a home game,' Emanuel told VOA. The discussions underscore Japan’s broader shift toward a more active regional security role, as it steps away from decades of pacifism. It’s also part of a strategy by the U.S. to encourage its Asian allies to take on greater security responsibilities in the face of China’s rising influence. However, the proposal faces major hurdles. In the U.S., legal changes would be needed to allow foreign shipyards to overhaul Navy vessels. In Japan, there are concerns about becoming a bigger target for China. Severe backlog But for the U.S. Navy, the challenge is severe. According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), about a third of the U.S. attack submarine fleet is currently out of service, either undergoing maintenance or awaiting repairs. Fewer than 40% of the Navy’s scheduled ship repairs are completed on time, according to recent congressional testimony. By some estimates, the Navy is 20 years behind in maintenance work. A wide range of key shipbuilding projects are also running years behind schedule — an 'extraordinary situation' in the post-World War II history of the Navy, according to CRS. Emanuel argues this reflects a broader decline in the U.S. defense industrial base, which has been hollowed out since the 1990s and is 'not ready' to meet U.S. security needs. 'Every weapon that we’ve agreed to here, I’ve had to renegotiate the contract once it’s signed because we can’t meet the budget at the timeline,' Emanuel said. 'It's really bad planning [and] really bad preparation.' According to a recent CRS report, the Navy's repair backlog is caused by a shortage of skilled workers and limited capacity at the four U.S. government-run naval shipyards. China challenge Meanwhile, China boasts 20 large shipyards, which it is using to quickly build up what is already the world's largest navy in terms of overall vessels. According to a recent unclassified slide released by U.S. naval intelligence, China’s shipbuilding capacity is over 200 times that of the United States, fueled by generous government subsidies. Even though the U.S. still maintains significant naval advantages — such as 11 aircraft carriers compared to China’s three and an unrivaled network of global alliances — some observers believe that China’s ability to dwarf U.S. shipbuilding represents a fundamental shift in the regional balance of power. 'We’ve let that underlying capacity atrophy to the point where we’re behind the eight ball at the moment, and that’s a big, thorny problem,' said Sam Byers, the senior national security advisor at the Washington D.C.-based Center for Maritime Strategy. Benefits and drawbacks In Emanuel’s estimation, the U.S.-Japan ship repair proposal could alleviate the U.S. Navy’s maintenance backlog, freeing U.S. shipyards to focus on meeting their construction goals. It would also allow U.S. ships to stay for longer in Asia, he said. But not everyone agrees. Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, argues that the problem isn’t a lack of shipyard capacity but rather their inconsistent use, due to fluctuating demand from the Navy. He suggests that repairing more ships overseas could help manage these fluctuations and minimize disruptions for Japan-based crews. 'And repair yards in Japan could gain experience working on U.S. ships, which could be beneficial in a conflict,' he added. However, he cautioned that shifting work overseas wouldn’t solve the underlying issues of funding and planning that contribute to the Navy’s repair delays. 'Of course, the Japanese ship repair yards may do a better job or be more efficient than their American counterparts. If that is the argument, then U.S. officials should make that clear,' Clark said. Others in the shipbuilding industry have argued against what they see as outsourcing U.S. Navy shipbuilding and repairs, a step they characterize as 'kicking American shipyard workers to the curb.' Japan risks There are also barriers in Japan, where public opinion doesn’t always align with the government’s more assertive security stance. While certain segments of the Japanese public appear more supportive of increased military involvement after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it’s unclear how deep or lasting this shift is, warned Misato Matsuoka, an associate professor at Teikyo University. 'There is this gap of understanding when it comes to what is going on in the security area,' Matsuoka said. 'I don’t see a lot of Japanese who are even aware of these changes.' Matsuoka also warned that the U.S.-Japan ship repair proposal could eventually be seen as one of many factors escalating U.S.-China tensions, potentially impacting Japan negatively. 'All the things Japan is doing makes it more important within the U.S. alliance but that also increases the risk of something happening to Japanese territory,' said Robert Ward, Japan Chair at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. While Japan deepens ties with the U.S., it is careful not to provoke China, Ward noted. Nonetheless, Japan, like many countries, remains wary of what it sees as China’s destabilizing behavior in the region. 'This isn’t happening in a vacuum,' Ward said, referring to Japan's changing security posture. 'There are very good reasons why all this is happening.' When it comes to the U.S.-Japan ship repair deal, the choices are also complex for the United States, Emanuel acknowledged. However, he argued, sometimes 'you’ve got to choose between what’s bad and what’s worse.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/to-preserve-sea-power-us-looks-to-japan-for-help-/7796121.html	2024-09-24T05:57:14-07:00

Sri Lanka's new leader appoints cabinet ahead of expected snap polls	Colombo, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka's new leftist president appointed his Cabinet Tuesday ahead of an expected snap parliamentary election as he prepares to renegotiate the bankrupt island nation's unpopular International Monetary Fund bailout program. Self-avowed Marxist Dissanayake of the People's Liberation Front (JVP) was sworn into office on Monday after a landslide win in weekend presidential polls. His once-marginal party currently has just three lawmakers in Sri Lanka's 225-member parliament. But support for the 55-year-old surged after a 2022 economic meltdown that immiserated millions of ordinary Sri Lankans and the painful implementation of the IMF rescue plan. On Tuesday his office announced the appointment of lawmaker Harini Amarasuriya, 54, as premier with the additional portfolios of justice, education, health and labor. The sociology lecturer, who was first elected to parliament four years ago, is known for her activism on gender equality and minority rights issues. She and the remaining two JVP-aligned lawmakers will share all ministerial responsibilities between them, and also act as caretaker ministers after parliament is dissolved. 'We will have the smallest Cabinet in the history of Sri Lanka,' party member Namal Karunaratne told reporters on Tuesday. 'Parliament dissolution will happen thereafter. It could be within the next 24 hours.' Sri Lanka's crisis proved an opportunity for Dissanayake, who saw his popularity rise after pledging to change the island's 'corrupt' political culture. He beat 38 other candidates to win Saturday's presidential vote, taking more than 1.2 million more votes than his nearest rival. His predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe, who had imposed steep tax hikes and other unpopular austerity measures under the terms of the $2.9 billion IMF bailout, came a distant third. The IMF offered its congratulations to Dissanayake on Monday, saying it was ready to discuss the future of the rescue plan. 'We look forward to working together with President Dissanayake... towards building on the hard-won gains that have helped put Sri Lanka on a path to economic recovery,' a spokesman from the lender of last resort said. 'Not a magician' A senior aide of the new president told AFP on the weekend that Dissayanake's party would not repudiate the IMF deal. 'Our plan is to engage with the IMF and introduce certain amendments,' Bimal Ratnayake said. 'We will not tear up the IMF program. It is a binding document, but there is a provision to renegotiate.' In his first address after his inauguration, Dissayanake sought to lower expectations of a quick fix for the country's economic woes. 'I am not a conjuror, I am not a magician, I am a common citizen,' he said. 'I have strengths and limitations, things I know and things I don't,' he added. 'My responsibility is to be part of a collective effort to end this crisis.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-s-new-leader-appoints-cabinet-ahead-of-expected-snap-polls-/7796113.html	2024-09-24T04:45:36-07:00	
German economy expected to contract again in 2024, say sources	Berlin — Germany's leading economic institutes have downgraded their forecast for 2024 and now see Europe's largest economy shrinking by 0.1%, people familiar with the figures from the autumn joint economic forecast told Reuters on Tuesday. Germany's economy was the weakest among its large euro zone peers last year with a 0.3% contraction. Even with inflation on a downward trend, consumption remains weak and high energy costs, feeble global orders and high interest rates are still taking their toll. The latest economic data paint a gloomy picture. German business morale fell for a fourth straight month in September and by more than expected, a survey showed on Tuesday. Data earlier this week showed German business activity contracted in September at the sharpest pace in seven months, putting the economy on track to notch up a second consecutive quarter of falling output. The economic institutes have also slashed their forecasts for the coming years, according to the sources. The growth forecast for 2025 has been cut to 0.8% from 1.4%, and for 2026, the institutes envisage growth of 1.3%, the sources said. The institutes' joint economic forecast is due to be published on Thursday, meaning the figures could still change slightly before then. The economy ministry incorporates the combined estimates from the institutes — Ifo, DIW, IWH, IfW and RWI — into its own predictions. According to its latest forecast, the German government expects the economy to grow 0.3% this year. An update is due in October.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-economy-expected-to-contract-again-in-2024-say-sources-/7796098.html	2024-09-24T04:26:07-07:00	
New global poll finds South Africans feel among least safe	Johannesburg — A new global Gallup poll released Tuesday shows South Africa is one of the countries where citizens feel the least safe walking alone. Bartender Gugu Xakaza, 32, was mugged by two men while walking home from the grocery store one day. She said that was the last time she risked walking anywhere alone. 'I’d never walk around these streets, firstly you know because South Africa’s crime status is very high, and also it’s not just safe for a woman to be walking alone at night, because obviously we might be taken advantage of…. so rather be safe than sorry,' she said. She is not alone. Karabo Faith, 23, said she no longer walks anywhere by herself. 'I almost, almost got mugged at night… we were walking, going home,' she said. 'So, this other guy was like, ‘Hey, give us your phone.’ Then luckily these police officers came through, so they never took our phones. But we were scared.' The latest Gallup poll on global safety asked people in 140 countries how safe they felt walking alone. Some 70% of South Africans responded that they did not feel safe, ranking in the bottom three countries, which also included Ecuador and Liberia. Gallup is a global analytics and advisory firm. Gallup’s Julie Ray said sub-Saharan Africa has had low rankings in the annual poll for years. And feelings of safety have declined more here than in any other region. 'The region has ranked amongst the least safe in terms of people’s perceptions for almost two decades,' Ray said. By contrast, citizens in Kuwait, Singapore and Norway said they felt the safest, with between only 8% and 1% feeling unsafe. Women in South Africa typically feel less safe than men, Ray said. Confidence in police in sub-Saharan Africa is also lower than average, she said. Asked for comment on the report, Athlenda Mathe, spokesperson for the South African Police Services, said they were working on heightening police visibility. 'We are making inroads in clamping down on all forms of criminality and the main goal is to ensure that we make South Africa a much better and safer place to live in, so that people can walk freely,' Mathe said. South Africa has notoriously high crime rates. According to the latest police statistics, between April and June alone more than 6,000 murders and 9,000 rapes were recorded, for rates of 10 per 100,000 population and 15 per 100,000, respectively.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-global-poll-finds-south-africans-feel-among-least-safe-/7796025.html	2024-09-24T03:27:44-07:00	
Sweden accuses Iran of hacking messaging service after Koran burnings	STOCKHOLM — Swedish authorities said on Tuesday that Iran hacked into a text messaging service last year and sent thousands of messages urging Swedes to take revenge against Koran burners. In 2023, individuals in Sweden on several occasions set fire to Islam's holy book in public, prompting outrage in the Muslim world and raising fears of attacks by jihadists. 'The security police is able to establish that a cyber group acted on behalf of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to carry out an influence campaign,' the Swedish Security Service said in a statement. 'The purpose was, among other things, to paint the image of Sweden as an Islamophobic country and create division in society,' it said. Sweden last year raised its terrorism alert following the Koran burnings. In a separate statement, the Swedish Prosecution Authority said the investigation showed it was the Iranian state via the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that carried out the data breach. The Swedish agency said it had identified the individual hackers carrying out the breach but would not press charges. 'Since the perpetrators are acting for a foreign power, in this case Iran, we make the assessment that the conditions for prosecution abroad or extradition to Sweden are lacking,' it said. Iran's embassy in Stockholm could not immediately be reached for comment. Iran's foreign ministry had no immediate comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-accuses-iran-of-hacking-messaging-service-after-koran-burnings-/7796051.html	2024-09-24T03:21:54-07:00

Pope asks for liberation of Myanmar's detained ex-leader Suu Kyi	ROME — Pope Francis has called for the liberation of Myanmar's detained former leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and offered the Vatican as a safe haven, the pontiff said in a recent conversation with Jesuits in Asia. 'I asked for the Ms Aung San Suu Kyi's release and received her son in Rome. I offered the Vatican to receive her in our territory,' he said in a private conversation during a recent 12-day tour across Southeast Asia. The 87-year old pontiff visited Myanmar in December 2017. Italian daily Corriere della Sera published the comments on Tuesday in an article by Father Antonio Spadaro, a Rome-based Jesuit priest who attends the meetings and writes about them afterwards with the pope's permission. 'The future of the (Myanmar) must be peace based on respect for the dignity and rights of all, on respect for a democratic order that allows everyone to contribute to the common good,' Pope Francis added. Myanmar's military government has ramped up killings and arrests in an apparent bid to silence opponents and recruit soldiers in an escalating conflict, a U.N. report said last week. Suu Kyi, 78, has been detained by the military since it overthrew her government in a 2021 coup. She faces 27 years in prison for crimes ranging from treason and bribery to violations of the telecommunications law, charges she denies. In April she was moved from prison to house arrest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-asks-for-liberation-of-myanmar-s-detained-ex-leader-suu-kyi/7795996.html	2024-09-24T01:00:00-07:00	
Kmart closes its last full-scale US store	NEW YORK — Attention, Kmart shoppers, the end is near! The erstwhile retail giant renowned for its Blue Light Specials — featuring a flashing blue orb affixed to a pole enticing shoppers to a flash sale — is shuttering its last full-scale store in mainland United States. The store, located in swank Bridgehampton, New York, on Long Island, is slated to close Oct. 20, according to Denise Rivera, an employee who answered the phone at the store late Monday. The manager wasn't available, she said. That will leave only a small Kmart store in Miami. It has a handful of stores in Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Transformco, the company that bought the assets of Sears and Kmart out of the bankruptcy of Sears Holdings in 2019, did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. In its heyday, there were more than 2,000 Kmarts in the U.S. Struggling to compete with Walmart’s low prices and Target’s trendier offerings, Kmart filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early 2002 — becoming the largest U.S. retailer to take that step — and announced it would close more than 250 stores. A few years later, hedge fund executive Edward Lampert combined Sears and Kmart and pledged to return them to their former greatness. But the 2008 recession and the rising dominance of Amazon contributed in derailing that mission. Sears filed for Chapter 11 in 2018 and now has just a handful of stores left in the U.S., where it once had thousands.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kmart-closes-its-last-full-scale-us-store-/7795991.html	2024-09-24T00:45:43-07:00	
Some Japan PM hopefuls want to make hiring and firing workers easier	TOKYO — At least two candidates vying to become Japan's next prime minister are planning to tackle one of the country's most sacred political cows: labor market reforms that would make it easier for businesses to hire and fire workers. Shinjiro Koizumi, the 43-year-old son of former premier Junichiro Koizumi, and Taro Kono, who as digital minister is trying to promote more innovation, have both called for relaxing Japan's rigid labor rules. Those rules have been a feature of Japan's 'salary-man' corporate culture for decades, dating from when the country's post-war population was growing and its traditional labor model of lifetime employment was effective. But rigid labor rules have been more recently blamed for blocking the movement of labor from mature sectors into growing ones where employees are needed in a tight labor market. 'The ongoing labor market reform is missing the crux of the issue, and that's the revision to dismissal rules,' Koizumi said this month. 'An ultimate growth strategy is to create a system that fosters a labor shift to startups and small firms in growth sectors,' said Koizumi, who pledged to submit a labor reform bill next year if elected party leader. Kono specifically proposed establishing a monetary compensation framework for dismissed workers as a way to settle disputes, a step he said would allow more flexibility in the labor market. Overhauling dismissal rules is politically sensitive in Japan, having been repeatedly pushed back with little progress made in the past. International bodies such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have also long blamed the lack of employment flexibility for Japan's low labor productivity, low rates of new business entries and income gap between regular and non-regular staff. On average, Japanese workers have been with their current employer for 12.3 years, compared to 4.1 years in the United States and 9.7 years in Germany. A Gallup poll found only 6% of Japanese workers engaged in their jobs compared to the 23% global average. The statutory law on dismissal is vague, but judicial precedents have established four criteria that have to be met, raising the bar high for layoffs, experts say. The rules, for example, require the company to prove that there is an economic need to decrease its workforce and all efforts have been made to avoid dismissals when firing employees. 'The biggest issue is that these rules are based on judicial precedents decades ago,' said Kotaro Kurashige, a lawyer who specializes in labor issues. Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, which has a parliamentary majority, will elect a new leader on Sept. 27, with the winner to replace outgoing Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. A record nine candidates are running in the race. As in the past, the policy pledges by Koizumi and Kono have sparked heavy backlash on social media and from labor unions, as well as from conservative lawmakers worried such changes could increase layoffs. 'I strongly object to any relaxation of rules that allow companies to freely fire workers,' Tomoko Yoshino, the president of Japan's largest labor organization Rengo, said in an emergency study session last week. Some also doubt the validity of the argument that relaxed dismissal rules would help rejuvenate the economy. 'It may not be true that relaxed rules would promote a shift of labor to growth sectors and overall wage growth, as dismissed workers may end up with low-paying jobs,' Takuya Hoshino, economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, said. The negative reactions have forced Koizumi to water down his pledge and shift his focus more to increasing support for workers to acquire skills and find new jobs, initiatives already launched by the Kishida administration. Still, proponents say the opportunity for reform is now greater than in the past, as Japan exits years of deflation with companies delivering the biggest wage hikes in three decades this year and the jobless rate consistently below 3%. Suntory Holdings CEO Takeshi Niinami, one of the leading voices of corporate Japan, welcomed the issue coming up during the ruling party leadership race. 'Those rules were created during the manufacturing-centered postwar economic boom and must be reviewed,' said Niinami, who also serves as chair of the Keizai Doyukai business lobby. It's good timing for such discussion as labor shortages and tougher competition for talent have begun to push up wages, he said.

Rare graft case grips Singapore, ex-transport minister pleads guilty	SINGAPORE — Singapore's former Transport Minister S. Iswaran has pleaded guilty to receiving gifts while in office, local media reported, as proceedings began on Tuesday in a rare graft trial involving a state official in this Asian financial hub. The case, which charges Iswaran with receiving favors that includes tickets to English Premier League soccer matches and to the Singapore Formula 1 Grand Prix, has gripped the wealthy city-state which prides itself on having a well-paid and efficient bureaucracy as well as strong governance. Iswaran, who joined the cabinet in 2006, is the first Singaporean minister to be tried in court. The 62-year-old was arrested in July last year and was accused of taking kickbacks worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from property tycoon Ong Beng Seng. Iswaran was advisor to the Grand Prix's steering committee, while Ong owns the rights to the race. Ong has not been charged with any offense and Iswaran had previously rejected the allegations when he resigned from the cabinet. In court, he pleaded guilty to the charges of obstructing justice and of a public servant accepting anything of value without payment, or with inadequate payment, from a person with whom he is involved in an official capacity, Channel NewsAsia (CNA) reported, instead of the charges that include corruption. In a surprise move, prosecutors reduced the charges facing Iswaran to five from 35. The remaining 30 charges will be taken into consideration for sentencing, it added. The charge of accepting gifts carries a jail term of up to two years and a fine. For obstructing justice, Iswaran can be sentenced to jail of up to seven years and a fine. However, the prosecution asked for a much lighter sentence of six to seven months in jail, while the defense is asking for eight weeks, according to CNA. The prosecution said Iswaran had obtained, from two local businessmen, gifts worth a total value of $312,440. Iswaran has paid his financial gains of roughly $315,000 in full to the state, they added. 'The accused obtained all of the gifts for himself, some of which he then distributed to family, friends and others,' the prosecution said. The last corruption case involving a Singaporean minister was in 1986, when the national development minister was investigated for allegedly accepting bribes. He died before he could be charged in court. Singapore was among the world's top 5 least corrupt countries last year, according to Transparency International's corruption perception index.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rare-graft-case-grips-singapore-ex-transport-minister-pleads-guilty-/7795981.html	2024-09-24T00:07:39-07:00	
Climate goal to triple global renewable energy by 2030 within reach, IEA says	LONDON — A goal to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030 and cut fossil fuel use is within reach, the International Energy Agency said in a report on Tuesday, but will require a huge push to unlock bottlenecks such as permitting and grid connections. The report comes as leaders from government and business come together at New York Climate week to try to drive forward action against climate change. Almost 200 countries at the COP 28 climate summit in Dubai last year agreed to reach net zero emissions from the energy sector by 2050 and pledged to triple renewable energy capacity like wind and solar. The IEA said the renewable energy goal 'is within reach thanks to favorable economics, ample manufacturing potential and strong policies,' but said more renewable capacity by itself would not slash fossil fuel use and reduce costs for consumers. 'To unlock the full benefits of the tripling goal, countries need to make a concerted push to build and modernize 25 million kilometers of electricity grids by 2030... The world would also need 1,500 gigawatts (GW) of energy storage capacity by 2030,' the IEA said. Countries at COP 28 also pledged to double energy efficiency measures to help curb power use, but this target will require governments to make efficiency much more of a policy priority. Countries must embed the renewable and energy efficiency goals in their national plans to meet goals set under the Paris climate agreement, the IEA said. Emissions from the global energy sector hit a record high last year. Tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency measures to reduce power use could reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 10 billion metric tons by the end of the decade compared with what is otherwise expected, the report said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/climate-goal-to-triple-global-renewable-energy-by-2030-within-reach-iea-says/7795977.html	2024-09-23T23:56:38-07:00

China unveils broad stimulus measures to revive sputtering economy	BEIJING — China's central bank on Tuesday announced broad monetary stimulus and property market support measures to revive an economy grappling with strong deflationary pressures and in danger of missing this year's growth target. The broader-than-expected package marks the latest attempt by Chinese officials to restore confidence in the world's second-largest economy after a slew of disappointing data in recent months. But analysts noted the absence of any policies aimed at supporting real economic activity. Given weak credit demand from businesses and consumers, more fiscal stimulus may be needed to complement the moves announced by the People's Bank of China for growth to return to a trajectory towards this year's roughly 5% target. 'This is the most significant PBOC stimulus package since the early days of the pandemic,' said Capital Economics analyst Julian Evans-Pritchard. 'But on its own, it may not be enough.' Chinese stocks and bonds rallied and Asian stocks hit 2-1/2 year highs as Governor Pan Gongsheng announced plans to lower borrowing costs and inject more liquidity into the economy, as well as to ease households' mortgage repayment burden. Pan told a news conference the central bank in the near future will cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves - known as reserve requirement ratios (RRR) - by 50 basis points (bps). That would free up about $142 billion for new lending. Depending on the market liquidity situation later this year, the RRR may be further lowered by 0.25-0.5 percentage points, Pan said. The PBOC will also cut the seven-day repo rate, its new benchmark, by 0.2 percentage points to 1.5%. The interest rate on the medium-term lending facility will drop by about 30 basis points, and loan prime rates by 20-25 bps. 'The move probably comes a bit too late, but it is better late than never,' said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis. 'China needs a lower-rate environment to boost confidence.' Pan did not specify when the moves will come into effect. The property market support package included a 50 bps reduction on average interest rates for existing mortgages, and a reduction of the minimum downpayment requirement to 15% on all types of homes, among other measures. China's property market has been in a severe downturn since peaking in 2021. A string of developers have defaulted, leaving behind large inventories of unwanted apartments and a troubling list of uncompleted projects. Beijing has removed many home purchase restrictions and sharply lowered mortgage rates and downpayment requirements in response, but has so far failed to revive demand or arrest slumping home prices, which fell in August at the sharpest pace in more than nine years. The property crisis has weighed heavily on the economy and crippled consumer confidence, given that 70% of household savings are parked in real estate. The PBOC also introduced two new tools to boost the capital market. The first - a swap program sized at an initial $71 billion - allows funds, insurers and brokers easier access to funding in order to buy stocks; and the second provides up to $42.5 billion in cheap PBOC loans to commercial banks to help them fund other entities' share purchases and buybacks. August economic data broadly missed expectations, adding urgency for policymakers to roll out more support. On the fiscal side, local governments have been quickening bond issuance to help fund infrastructure projects, but analysts say more may be needed. 'An aggressive fiscal policy is required to inject genuine economic demand,' ANZ analysts said in a note on the PBOC moves, which they described as 'far from being a bazooka.' Investment banks including Goldman Sachs, Nomura, UBS and Bank of America have recently cut their 2024 growth forecasts. The latest Chinese measures come after the U.S. Federal Reserve last week delivered a hefty rate cut, allowing the PBOC to ease monetary conditions without putting too much pressure on the yuan. 'There is still room for further easing in the months ahead as most global central banks are now on a rate-cut trajectory,' said Lynn Song, chief economist for greater China at ING. 'If we see a large fiscal policy push as well, momentum could recover heading into the fourth quarter.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-unveils-broad-stimulus-measures-to-revive-sputtering-economy/7795961.html	2024-09-23T22:35:12-07:00

US commits to defense support for Taiwan as defense industry conference begins	state department — The United States has pledged to continue providing Taiwan with equipment and services essential for maintaining a self-defense capability in line with the threats it faces. This statement came as an annual U.S.-Taiwan defense industry conference kicked off Sunday in Philadelphia. In the lead-up to the event, the conference organizer — the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council (USTBC) — was targeted by a phishing cyberattack involving a forged registration form embedded with information-stealing malware. Despite the hackers' attempt, the council — a nonprofit trade association founded in 1976 to promote commerce between the U.S. and Taiwan — thwarted the attack. The identity of the attackers remains unknown. 'As the council has been targeted by similar attacks for more than 20 years, we realized quickly that the document was suspicious,' USTBC said in a statement. The statement added that the council submitted the document to an online virus scanner, confirmed it was malicious and deleted it. This year’s U.S.-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference, which ends Tuesday, is the 23rd annual event in a series of conferences addressing U.S. defense cooperation with Taiwan. 'There will be considerable focus on how Taiwan's efforts to deter a Chinese attack are progressing ... and how U.S. industry should support the U.S. and Taiwan government policy,' said Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council. 'This is the most important annual gathering of U.S. industry and policymakers on U.S.-Taiwan defense relations,' he added. Taiwan Relations Act The State Department said that American officials' participation in the annual conference aligns with long-standing U.S. policy. Swift provision of equipment and services 'is essential for Taiwan’s self-defense, and we will continue to work with industry to support that goal,' a State Department spokesperson told VOA. 'We continue to have an abiding interest in maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Our 'One China' policy has not changed and remains guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, three joint communiques and six assurances,' the spokesperson added. The 1979 U.S.-China Joint Communique shifted diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China (ROC), Taiwan’s formal name, to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Relations between the U.S. and Taiwan have since been governed by the Taiwan Relations Act, passed by Congress in April 1979, under which the U.S. provides defense equipment to Taiwan. The act states that 'any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes,' is a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of 'grave concern to the United States.' For decades, the U.S. has been clear that its decision to establish diplomatic relations with China in 1979 rested on the expectation that 'the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means,' as stipulated in the Taiwan Relations Act. China has objected to the Taiwan Relations Act — a U.S. public law — and deemed it invalid. In 2022, the U.S. Congress authorized the president to direct the drawdown of up to $1 billion per fiscal year in Defense Department equipment and services for Taiwan. Since 2010, the State Department has authorized more than $38 billion in foreign military sales to Taiwan. PRC sanctioned nine US firms Since its establishment in 1949, the People’s Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan, but it views the democratically governed island as its own territory and has vowed to bring Taiwan under its control, even by force. In recent years, the PRC has frequently sent military vessels near Taiwan and warplanes into its air defense identification zone to pressure the island to accept Chinese sovereignty. Last week, China announced sanctions against nine American companies in response to U.S. defense equipment sales to Taiwan. Beijing’s latest action aims to exert additional pressure on Washington to halt its arms sales to the Taipei government. The sanctions followed the U.S. approval of an estimated $228 million package of spare parts and other hardware for Taiwan's aging air force. In Beijing, officials asserted that U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan undermine China’s sovereignty and security interests. 'China urges the U.S. to earnestly abide by the one China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques and immediately stop the dangerous trend of arming Taiwan,' said Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, during a recent briefing. 'We will take strong and resolute measures to firmly defend our national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,' Lin added. The United States does not subscribe to the PRC’s 'one China principle,' the U.S. State Department said. 'The PRC continues to publicly misrepresent U.S. policy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-commits-to-defense-support-for-taiwan-as-defense-industry-conference-begins/7795538.html	2024-09-23T18:01:54-07:00	
$375 million US military aid package for Ukraine expected as soon as Wednesday	Pentagon — The U.S. military is expected to announce a new military aid package for Ukraine this week valued at up to $375 million, the largest aid sent to Kyiv since May. According to several U.S. officials, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity to discuss the package ahead of the announcement, the aid for Kyiv is expected to be announced as soon as Wednesday. One official told VOA the package is likely to include air-to-ground munitions for F-16 fighter jets, which would allow Ukrainian pilots to operate away from the front lines and Russia’s air defenses. The package also includes ammunition for HIMARS, patrol boats and armored vehicles, along with 155mm rounds, 105 mm rounds and TOW missiles, the official added. The package, which is still being finalized and could change, according to the U.S. officials, is being sent under the presidential drawdown authority that allows the Pentagon to send Ukraine aid directly from its American military stockpiles. The Pentagon has more than $5 billion left of the $61 billion in funding for Ukraine that was signed into law by President Joe Biden in April and could expire at the end of this month. The Pentagon says it is working with Congress to roll the remaining funding over to the next U.S. fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. The officials tell VOA they are working on contingency plans should Congress not approve the extension before the end of the fiscal year. The package is expected to be announced as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet with President Biden and Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris this Friday at the White House. Officials say Zelenskyy will lay out his plan to end the war with Russia and push for restrictions on U.S.-provided missiles to be lifted. U.S. policy does not allow Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied weapons to fire on targets deep within Russian territory. The White House has expressed concerns that these strikes could draw the United States into direct conflict with Russia. Earlier this month, Zelenskyy told military allies meeting in Germany that his country needs the long-range capability to strike deep inside Russian territory 'so that Russia is motivated to seek peace.' The U.S. says that Russia has moved most of its aircraft and weapons out of range of Ukraine’s weapons, but Ukrainian officials are still interested in targeting supply lines and command centers closer to its border. Air Force General James Hecker, the commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Africa, warned reporters last week that Russia’s military is now bigger and stronger than it was before invading Ukraine in February 2022. Despite Russian improvements on the battlefield, Ukraine has continued to put chinks in Russia’s armor, shooting down more than 100 Russian aircraft, which is dozens more aircraft than Russia has been able to down on the Ukrainian side, according to Hecker. 'So what we see is the aircraft are kind of staying on their own side of the line, if you will, and when that happens, you have a war like we're seeing today, with massive attrition, cities just being demolished, a lot of civilian casualties,' he said. The U.S. and Denmark have been training a small number of Ukrainian pilots on the F-16, but qualified Ukrainian pilots and open training slots have been limited.	https://www.voanews.com/a/million-us-military-aid-package-for-ukraine-expected-as-soon-as-wednesday/7795886.html	2024-09-23T17:54:18-07:00	
AI not yet a 'revolutionary influence tool,' US says	washington — Russia, Iran and China are not giving up on the use of artificial intelligence to sway American voters ahead of November’s presidential election even though U.S. intelligence agencies assess the use of AI has so far failed to revolutionize the election influence efforts. The new appraisal released late Monday from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence comes just more than 40 days before U.S. voters head to the polls. It follows what officials describe as a 'steady state' of influence operations by Moscow, Tehran and Beijing aimed at impacting the race between former Republican President Donald Trump and current Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as other statewide and local elections. 'Foreign actors are using AI to more quickly and convincingly tailor synthetic content,' said a U.S. intelligence official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss the latest findings. 'AI is an enabler,' the official added. 'A malign influence accelerant, not yet a revolutionary influence tool.' It is not the first time U.S. officials have expressed caution about how AI could impact the November election. A top official at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the U.S. agency charged with overseeing election security, told VOA earlier this month that to this point the malicious use of AI has not been able to live up to some of the hype. 'Generative AI is not going to fundamentally introduce new threats to this election cycle,' said CISA senior adviser Cait Conley. 'What we're seeing is consistent with what we expected to see.' That does not mean, however, that U.S. adversaries are not trying. The new U.S. intelligence assessment indicates Russia, Iran and China have used AI to generate text, images, audio and video and distribute them across all major social media platforms. Russia, Iran and China have yet to respond to requests for comment. All three have previously rejected U.S. allegations regarding election influence campaigns. While U.S. intelligence officials would not say how many U.S. voters have been exposed to such malign AI products, there is reason to think that some of the efforts are, at least for the moment, falling short. 'The quality is not as believable as you might expect,' said the U.S. intelligence official. One reason, the official said, is because Russia, Iran and China have struggled to overcome restrictions built into some of the more advanced AI tools while simultaneously encountering difficulties developing their own AI models. There are also indications that all three U.S. adversaries have to this point failed to find ways to more effectively use AI to find and target receptive audiences. 'To do scaled AI operations is not cheap,' according to Clint Watts, a former FBI special agent and counterterror consultant who heads up the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC). 'Some of the infrastructure and the resources of it [AI], the models, the data it needs to be trained [on] – very challenging at the moment,' Watts told a cybersecurity summit in Washington earlier this month. 'You can make more of everything misinformation, disinformation, but it doesn't mean they'll be very good.' In some cases, U.S. adversaries see traditional tactics, which do not rely on AI, as equally effective. For instance, U.S. intelligence officials on Monday said a video claiming that Vice President Harris injured a girl in a 2011 hit-and-run accident was staged by Russian influence actors, confirming an assessment last week by Microsoft. The officials also said altered videos showing Harris speaking slowly, also the result of Russian influence actors, could have been done without relying on AI. For now, experts and intelligence officials agree that when it comes to AI, Russia, Iran and China have settled on quantity over quality. Microsoft has tracked hundreds of instances of AI use by Russia, Iran and China over the past 14 months. And while U.S. intelligence officials would not say how much AI-generated material has been disseminated, they agree Russian-linked actors, especially, have been leading the way. 'These items include AI-generated content of and about prominent U.S. figures … consistent with Russia's broader efforts to boost the former president's candidacy and denigrate the vice president and the Democratic Party,' the U.S. intelligence official said, calling Russia one of the most sophisticated actors in knowing how to target American voters. Those efforts included an AI-boosted effort to spread disinformation with a series of fake web domains masquerading as legitimate U.S. news sites, interrupted earlier this month by the U.S. Department of Justice. Iran, which has sought to hurt the re-election bid by former President Trump, has also copied the Russian playbook, according to the new U.S. assessment, seeking to sow discord among U.S. voters. Tehran has also been experimenting, using AI to help spread its influence campaign not just in English, but also in Spanish, especially when seeking to generate anger among voters over immigration. 'One of the benefits of generative AI models is to overcome various language barriers,' the U.S. intelligence official said. 'So Iran can use the tools to help do that,' the official added, calling immigration 'obviously an issue where Iran perceives they could stoke discord.' Beijing, in some ways, has opted for a more sophisticated use of AI, according to the U.S. assessment, using it to generate fake news anchors in addition to fake social media accounts. But independent analysts have questioned the reach of China’s efforts under its ongoing operation known as 'Spamouflage.' A recent report by the social media analytics firm Graphika found that, with few exceptions, the Chinese accounts 'failed to garner significant traction in authentic online communities discussing the election.' U.S. intelligence officials have also said the majority of the Chinese efforts have been aimed not at Trump or Harris, but at state and local candidates perceived as hostile to Beijing. U.S. intelligence officials on Monday refused to say how many other countries are using AI in an effort to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. Earlier this month, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Washington was 'seeing more actors in this space acting more aggressively in a more polarized environment and doing more with technologies, in particular AI.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-not-yet-a-revolutionary-influence-tool-us-says-/7795863.html	2024-09-23T17:35:28-07:00

At UN: calls to implement new pact to address global challenges	united nations — Leaders at the United Nations urged implementation of a newly adopted blueprint for addressing a wide range of global challenges on Monday, the second and final day of the Summit of the Future. 'We cannot afford to wait any longer,' said Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi. 'We must push for true and real reform – reform that listens to the voices of developing countries and addresses their concerns.' She emphasized that the summit’s Pact of the Future must not become 'a set of empty promises without tangible results on the ground.' 'Success of humanity lies in our collective strength, not in the battlefield,' said Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi. 'And for global peace and development, reforms in global institutions are essential. Reform is the key to relevance.' The pact includes frameworks for promoting peace and security, sustainable development, digital cooperation, human rights and gender equality. Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, made his U.N. debut at the summit, pledging that his administration is seeking to reduce inequality and empower women and youth. The country saw a wave of protests in 2022 and 2023 after the death of a young woman who died in police custody after being detained for not properly covering her head. In New York, protesters gathered outside Pezeshkian’s hotel ahead of his speech. A large protest is planned on Tuesday before his address to the General Assembly’s annual debate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy used his turn at the podium to highlight Russia’s obstruction during the negotiations on the Pact for the Future. 'Ukraine supports efforts to keep all nations united, safe, and strictly adhere to the U.N. Charter,' he said. 'And you all can see who stands against it, but also actively works to undermine global unity.' In the final week of negotiations, Russia raised at least 15 different objections to elements of the text. As the assembly gathered to adopt the document on Sunday morning, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin, backed by a handful of countries, tried to get an amendment added to the pact, but it was overwhelmingly rejected by other nations. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to address the summit late Monday. On Tuesday, the assembly’s annual debate kicks off. U.S. President Joe Biden will make his farewell U.N. address. The presidents of Brazil, South Africa, Iran and Nigeria will be among the speakers. Afghan women On the margins of the General Assembly meeting, Afghan women advocated for their rights at an event focused on the inclusion of women in the future of Afghanistan. Last month, the Afghan Taliban enacted a 'morality law' that further erodes the rights of women and girls. Its restrictions include a prohibition on Afghan women using their voices in public and orders them to completely cover their bodies and faces outdoors. Women are also forbidden from interacting with non-Muslims, using public transport alone, and looking at men who are not their husband or blood relative. 'To all male leaders, what if it were the reverse? How would you feel to be banned from existing in society?' asked Asila Wardak, the former director general of Human Rights and Women’s International Affairs in Afghanistan’s Foreign Ministry. Acclaimed American actor Meryl Streep participated in the panel. She noted that historically Afghanistan was ahead of even some Western nations in giving its women the right to vote, and it had many female civil servants, judges, lawyers, doctors and teachers. 'Today in Kabul a female cat has more freedoms than a woman,' she said. 'A cat may go sit on her front stoop and feel the sun on her face. She may chase a squirrel into the park. A squirrel has more rights than a girl in Afghanistan today, because public parks are closed to women and girls by the Taliban.' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres demanded that the Taliban immediately remove all the discriminatory restrictions against women and girls and reopen schools and universities to them. Currently, Afghan girls are only allowed to attend school until grade 6. 'We will never allow gender-based discrimination to become normalized anywhere in the world,' Guterres said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-calls-to-implement-new-pact-to-address-global-challenges-/7795557.html	2024-09-23T15:54:08-07:00	
John rapidly strengthens into hurricane off southern Mexico's Pacific coast	MEXICO CITY — A tropical storm over the eastern Pacific Ocean intensified into a hurricane and was ripping toward Mexico's southern coast on Monday. Originally forecast as a tropical storm, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said that John had 'rapidly strengthened' into a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 155 kph (100 mph). The storm was located 90 kilometers (55 miles) south of Punta Maldonado. It was moving north at 9 kph (6 mph). John was barreling forward as a category 2 hurricane, but was forecast to continue strengthening, possibly into a major category 4 hurricane before making landfall Tuesday. John's forecast path continued shifting so the point of landfall remained uncertain. The center said it could result in dangerous winds and storm surges, as well as 'life-threatening' flash floods in the Pacific coast near Oaxaca, a hub of resort towns. Things were tense in Oaxaca's coastal cities on Monday shortly after the announcement as residents and businesses were bracing themselves. Laura Velázquez, the federal coordinator of civil protection, told residents of Pacific coastal cities they should evacuate their homes and head to shelters in order to 'protect their and their family's lives.' 'It's very important that all citizens in the coastal zone ... take preventive measures,' Velázquez said. Meanwhile, hotels in the tourist hub of Puerto Escondido were awaiting instructions from authorities to begin evacuating tourists to transfer them to safer areas. Ana Aldai, a 33-year-old employee of a restaurant located on the shores of Playa Escondida, said that businesses in the area began closing after authorities ordered the suspension of all work on the area's main beaches. Videos on social media from Puerto Escondido showed flip-flop-clad tourists walking through heavy rain and fishermen pulling their boats out of the water. Strong rains in previous days have already left some roads in the region in a precarious position. Aldai said she was 'a little bit distressed' because notice from authorities came quickly. 'There was no opportunity to make the necessary purchases. That also distresses us,' she said. Mexican authorities were meeting Monday afternoon to plan their response to the hurricane. Through Thursday, John is expected to produce 15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) of rain across coastal areas of Chiapas state with more in isolated areas. In areas along and near the Oaxaca coast to southeast Guerrero, between 25 and 50 centimeters (10 and 20 inches) of rain with isolated higher totals can be expected through Thursday. The hurricane is bleak news for the region, which last year was walloped by a similar rapidly intensifying hurricane. Hurricane Otis devastated the resort city of Acapulco, where residents had little warning of the strength of what was about to hit them.

Gunman who killed 10 at Colorado supermarket found guilty of murder	BOULDER, Colorado — A mentally ill man who killed 10 people at a Colorado supermarket in 2021 was convicted Monday of murder and faces life in prison. Defense attorneys did not dispute that Ahmad Alissa, who has schizophrenia, fatally shot 10 people including a police officer in the city of Boulder. But he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, with the defense arguing he couldn't tell right from wrong at the time of the attack. In addition to 10 counts of first-degree murder, the jury found Alissa guilty of 38 charges of attempted murder, one count of assault, and six counts of possessing illegal, large-capacity magazines. First-degree murder carries a mandatory life sentence in Colorado. Sentencing in the case was set for later Monday, during which the victims and family were expected to address the court. Alissa did not visibly react as the judge began reciting the guilty verdicts against him. He sat at a table with his attorneys and appeared to trade notes with members of the defense team, speaking quietly at times with one of his attorneys. Judge Ingrid Bakke had warned against any outbursts. There were some tears and restrained crying on the victims' side of the courtroom as the murder convictions were read. The courtroom was packed largely with victims' families and police officers, including those who were shot at by Alissa. Several members of Alissa's family sat just behind him. Alissa started shooting immediately after getting out of his car in a grocery store parking lot in March 2021. He killed most of the victims in just more than a minute and surrendered after an officer shot him in the leg. Prosecutors had to prove Alissa was sane. They argued he didn't fire randomly and showed an ability to make decisions by pursuing people who were running and trying to hide from him. He twice passed by a 91-year-old man who continued to shop, unaware of the shooting. He came armed with steel-piercing bullets and illegal magazines that can hold 30 rounds of ammunition, which prosecutors said showed he took deliberate steps to make the attack as deadly as possible. Several members of Alissa's family, who immigrated to the United States from Syria, testified that he had become withdrawn and spoke less a few years before the shooting. He later began acting paranoid and showed signs of hearing voices, they said, and his condition worsened after he got COVID-19 in late 2020. Alissa was diagnosed with schizophrenia after the attack and experts said the behaviors described by relatives are consistent with the onset of the disease.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunman-who-killed-10-at-colorado-supermarket-found-guilty-of-murder/7795539.html	2024-09-23T15:28:18-07:00	
Short corn' could replace the towering cornfields steamrolled by a changing climate	wyoming, iowa — Taking a late-summer country drive in the Midwest means venturing into the corn zone, snaking between 12-foot-tall green, leafy walls that seem to block out nearly everything other than the sun and an occasional water tower. The skyscraper-like corn is a part of rural America as much as cavernous red barns and placid cows. But soon, that towering corn might become a miniature of its former self, replaced by stalks only half as tall as the green giants that have dominated fields for so long. 'As you drive across the Midwest, maybe in the next seven, eight, 10 years, you're going to see a lot of this out there,' said Cameron Sorgenfrey, an eastern Iowa farmer who has been growing newly developed short corn for several years, sometimes prompting puzzled looks from neighboring farmers. 'I think this is going to change agriculture in the Midwest.' The short corn developed by Bayer Crop Science is being tested on about 30,000 acres (12,141 hectares) in the Midwest with the promise of offering farmers a variety that can withstand powerful windstorms that could become more frequent due to climate change. The corn's smaller stature and sturdier base enable it to withstand winds of up to 50 mph — researchers hover over fields with a helicopter to see how the plants handle the wind. The smaller plants also let farmers plant at greater density, so they can grow more corn on the same amount of land, increasing their profits. That is especially helpful as farmers have endured several years of low prices that are forecast to continue. The smaller stalks could also lead to less water use at a time of growing drought concerns. U.S. farmers grow corn on about 90 million acres (36 million hectares) each year, usually making it the nation's largest crop, so it's hard to overstate the importance of a potential large-scale shift to smaller-stature corn, said Dior Kelley, an assistant professor at Iowa State University who is researching different paths for growing shorter corn. Last year, U.S. farmers grew more than 400 tons (363 metric tons) of corn, most of which was used for animal feed, the fuel additive ethanol or exported to other countries. 'It is huge. It's a big, fundamental shift,' Kelley said. Researchers have long focused on developing plants that could grow the most corn but recently there has been equal emphasis on other traits, such as making the plant more drought-tolerant or able to withstand high temperatures. Although there already were efforts to grow shorter corn, the demand for innovations by private companies such as Bayer and academic scientists soared after an intense windstorm — called a derecho — plowed through the Midwest in August 2020. The storm killed four people and caused $11 billion in damage, with the greatest destruction in a wide strip of eastern Iowa, where winds exceeded 100 mph. In cities such as Cedar Rapids, the wind toppled thousands of trees but the damage to a corn crop only weeks from harvest was especially stunning. 'It looked like someone had come through with a machete and cut all of our corn down,' Kelley said. Or as Sorgenfrey, the Iowa farmer who endured the derecho put it, 'Most of my corn looked like it had been steamrolled.' Although Kelley is excited about the potential of short corn, she said farmers need to be aware that cobs that grow closer to the soil could be more vulnerable to diseases or mold. Short plants also could be susceptible to a problem called lodging, when the corn tilts over after something like a heavy rain and then grows along the ground, Kelley said. Brian Leake, a Bayer spokesman, said the company has been developing short corn for more than 20 years. Other companies such as Stine Seed and Corteva also have been working for a decade or longer to offer short-corn varieties. While the big goal has been developing corn that can withstand high winds, researchers also note that a shorter stalk makes it easier for farmers to get into fields with equipment for tasks such as spreading fungicide or seeding the ground with a future cover crop. Bayer expects to ramp up its production in 2027, and Leake said he hopes that by later in this decade, farmers will grow short corn everywhere. 'We see the opportunity of this being the new normal across both the U.S. and other parts of the world,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/short-corn-could-replace-the-towering-cornfields-steamrolled-by-a-changing-climate-/7795526.html	2024-09-23T15:17:31-07:00

France’s new government gets to work amid anger on left, right	paris — After more than two months without a functioning government, France’s new cabinet got to work Monday. How long it will remain in office is unclear. French politics have been in limbo since inconclusive snap legislative elections in late June and early July. The elections saw a leftist coalition win the most votes and the far-right National Rally emerging as the largest party. Only now, after the Paris Olympics, has a new center-right government been named, which doesn’t include either of these two blocs. On national TV Sunday night, conservative Prime Minister Michel Barnier outlined some broad priorities. He called for controlling and limiting immigration, saying the number of migrants arriving in France had become unbearable. His new interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, strongly advocates tighter migration controls. Barnier also called for what he described as a 'national effort,' including taxes on the rich to cut the country’s budget deficit, which is well over the European Union limit. But he said he would not touch social changes like gay marriage and a recent move to enshrine abortion freedoms in the French constitution. Barnier’s new government is already feeling pressure. Thousands demonstrated in Paris even before his cabinet was named. Far-left politician Jean-Luc Melenchon warned Barnier’s government had no future — a warning picked up by the far right. The left has vowed a no-confidence motion, but analysts say it isn’t likely to succeed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-new-government-gets-to-work-amid-anger-on-left-right-/7795513.html	2024-09-23T14:57:47-07:00	
Jill Biden reveals $500 million plan that focuses on women's health at Clinton Global Initiative	NEW YORK — First lady Jill Biden is unveiling a new set of actions to address health inequities faced by women in the United States, plans that include spending at least $500 million annually on women's health research. Biden was making the announcement Monday while closing out the first day of this year's Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in New York. The additional government spending will mainly come from the Department of Defense, which provides medical care to more than 230,000 active-duty military women and nearly 2 million military retirees, as well as their family members. The research will focus on why these women experience endocrine, hematological and other immunity-related disorders twice as often as men. 'Our nation is home to the best health research in the world, yet women's health is understudied and research is underfunded,' Biden said at a separate event on Friday. 'And we still know too little about how to effectively prevent, diagnose, and treat a range of health conditions in women, from heart disease to cancers.' The commitment was among the largest of the more than 100 expected at the two-day meeting of political, business and philanthropic leaders gathering to address some of the world's most pressing issues. Former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton have set this year's theme as 'What's Working,' a way to look for potential solutions and effective programs in tumultuous times. 'You don't look at a problem and say, 'That's impossible,’' Bill Clinton said in his opening remarks. 'You don't just throw up your hands. You roll up your sleeves.' An example of that strategy came from the announcement that a wide-ranging group of 15 nonprofits, humanitarian aid organizations and other funders will join forces to address the humanitarian crisis in Sudan following more than a year of conflict. The Coalition for Mutual Aid in Sudan — which includes The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Giving, Global Fund for Women, and The Unitarian Universalist Service Committee — will donate at least $2 million to mutual aid groups in the country by the end of the year. It also pledged to raise another $4.5 million for those groups within the next two years. Patricia McIlreavy, president of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, which has been representing the coalition, said that, while much more aid is needed, the collaboration and problem-solving of the group is an important step forward. 'It gets us started,' McIlreavy told The Associated Press. 'And it models the behavior you want to see from others. If you wait until it's the perfect opportunity, you've missed many of the opportunities that were good enough.' World Food Program director Cindy McCain said earlier this month that 'Sudan's nearly a forgotten crisis' and that 25 million people there already face acute hunger. Last week, the top United Nations humanitarian official said fighting is escalating in the conflict that began in April 2023 when long-simmering tensions between Sudan's military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital Khartoum and spread to other regions. The U.N. says more than 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured. 'With ongoing impediments to a large-scale international aid response, Sudanese community groups have become the primary frontline responders and are currently the most effective means of reaching millions on the brink of starvation,' Patricia McIlreavy, president of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, said in a prepared statement on behalf of the coalition. 'With so many lives on the line, the imperative to support local aid efforts in Sudan has never been more urgent.' The Center for Disaster Philanthropy says more than 12 million people have been forced from their homes in Sudan, creating what is now the world's largest displacement and hunger crisis. The danger from the conflict has prevented most international aid agencies from delivering supplies to those in need. Greg Milne, the Clinton Global Initiative CEO who convened a panel in April to raise awareness and support for the Sudanese people, said the new coalition is an example of what bringing organizations from varied sectors can do. 'We know strong, diverse partnerships can help address often overlooked and even dire challenges, and develop unexpected and innovative solutions,' he said. Philanthropic leaders, including Bill Gates, World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres, Open Society Foundations President Binaifer Nowrojee, and Rockefeller Foundation President Raj Shah will share information about their work during CGI, as will Prince Harry, who will discuss the launch of The Archewell Foundation Parents' Network, which supports parents of children harmed online. In his Tuesday appearance, the Duke of Sussex will also address his work with the World Health Organization and others to reduce violence against children, an issue he and his wife Meghan outlined on a recent trip to Colombia. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani Sadriu, and Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics are set to address the conference, as are CEOs from Pfizer, Mastercard, IKEA, Pinterest, Sanofi and Chobani.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jill-biden-reveals-500-million-plan-that-focuses-on-women-s-health-at-clinton-global-initiative/7795502.html	2024-09-23T14:44:43-07:00	
Texas jury clears most 'Trump Train' drivers in civil trial over 2020 Biden-Harris bus encounter	AUSTIN, Texas — A federal jury in Texas on Monday cleared a group of former President Donald Trump supporters and found one driver liable in a civil trial over a so-called 'Trump Train' that surrounded a Biden-Harris campaign bus on a busy highway days before the 2020 election. The two-week trial in a federal courthouse in Austin centered on whether the actions of the 'Trump Train' participants amounted to political intimidation. Among those aboard the bus was former Democratic lawmaker Wendy Davis, who testified she feared for her life while a convoy of Trump supporters boxed in the bus along Interstate 35. The jury awarded $10,000 to the bus driver. No criminal charges were filed against the six Trump supporters who were sued by Davis and two others aboard the bus. Civil rights advocates hoped a guilty verdict would send a clear message about what constitutes political violence and intimidation. On Oct. 20, 2020, a Biden-Harris campaign bus was traveling from San Antonio to Austin for an event when a group of cars and trucks waving Trump flags surrounded the bus. Video that Davis recorded from the bus shows pickup trucks with large Trump flags slowing down to box in the bus as it tried to move away from the group of Trump supporters. One of the defendants hit a campaign volunteer's car while the trucks occupied all lanes of traffic, forcing the bus and everyone around it to a 15 mph crawl. It was the last day of early voting in Texas and the bus was scheduled to stop at San Marcos for an event at Texas State University. The event was canceled after Davis and others on the bus — a campaign staffer and the driver — made repeated calls to 911 asking for a police escort through San Marcos and no help arrived. Davis testified that she felt scared and anxious throughout the ordeal. 'I feel like they were enjoying making us afraid,' she testified. 'It's traumatic for all of us to revisit that day.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/texas-jury-clears-most-trump-train-drivers-in-civil-trial-over-2020-biden-harris-bus-encounter-/7795483.html	2024-09-23T14:15:16-07:00

Pentagon: Small number of additional US forces going to Middle East as risk of greater war increases	Pentagon — The United States is sending a small number of additional troops to the Middle East following a sharp spike in violence between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon, Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said on Monday. Ryder did not provide further details on the number of forces or what they would be doing. However, a senior U.S. official told VOA the number of troops would be in the dozens and their primary task would be preparing for a potential military-assisted departure of U.S. citizens, should a greater regional war break out. Another U.S. official stressed that the situation was not at a point yet where a military-assisted departure was needed. If an evacuation is needed, the U.S. military has Marines deployed nearby who could execute the mission, another official told VOA. All spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security issues. Ryder, in response to a VOA question on Monday, told reporters that the Pentagon was a 'planning organization' that was ready for a 'wide variety of contingencies,' should the U.S. military be called for assistance. 'We have more capability in the region today than we did on April 14, when Iran conducted its drone and missile attack against Israel,' he said. The announcement comes after several strikes by Israeli forces against Hezbollah targets inside Lebanon have killed hundreds of people. The State Department is warning Americans to leave Lebanon as the risk of a regional war escalates.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-small-number-of-additional-us-forces-going-to-middle-east-as-risk-of-greater-war-increases/7795446.html	2024-09-23T13:44:47-07:00	
California sues Exxon over global plastic pollution	NEW YORK — California and several environmental groups sued ExxonMobil on Monday and accused the oil giant of engaging in a decades-long campaign that helped fuel global plastic waste pollution. Speaking at an event during Climate Week in New York City, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state sued Exxon after concluding a nearly two-year investigation that he said showed Exxon was deliberately misleading the public about the limitations of recycling. 'Today's lawsuit shows the fullest picture to date of ExxonMobil's decades-long deception, and we are asking the court to hold ExxonMobil fully accountable for its role in actively creating and exacerbating the plastics pollution crisis through its campaign of deception,' Bonta said in a statement. The investigation mirrors California's previous probes into the oil industry's alleged efforts to mislead the public about climate change, which the state is also suing over, and continues a long-standing adversarial relationship between the state and Big Oil. Once a major crude supplier, California's oil production has been on a steady decline for almost four decades, with companies saying the regulatory environment there makes it a difficult place to invest. Exxon rival Chevron Corp., meanwhile, a strong critic of California’s policies, said this year it plans to move its headquarters from the state where it was born to oil-friendly Texas. A coalition of environmental groups including the Sierra Club appeared to join California's legal battle, filing a related lawsuit in the same state court in San Francisco, raising similar allegations against Exxon. Bonta, a Democrat, said his office specifically had sought information on Exxon's promotion of its 'advanced recycling' technology, which uses a process called pyrolysis to turn hard-to-recycle plastic into fuel. He had said the technology's slow progress was a sign of Exxon's ongoing deception. He said he wants to secure an abatement fund and civil penalties for the harm inflicted by plastics pollution on California. Exxon pushed back at the attorney general, arguing that solutions like advanced recycling work. 'Suing people makes headlines but doesn't solve the plastic waste problem. Advanced recycling is a real solution,' said a spokesperson for ExxonMobil, adding that California has done 'nothing to 'advance' recycling.' Notre Dame Law School Professor Bruce Huber, who specializes in environmental law, said California may face an 'uphill battle' with its lawsuit. 'The state's primary claim relies on public nuisance, a notoriously murky area of law. It could be difficult for a court to grant California relief here without opening a Pandora's box of other, similar claims,' he said. Exxon is the world's largest producer of resins used for single-use plastics, according to a report published last year by the Minderoo Foundation, with consultancies Wood Mackenzie and the Carbon Trust. Reuters has reported on the enormous obstacles facing advanced recycling that the plastics industry touts as an environmental savior. California's lawsuit comes ahead of a final round of global plastic treaty negotiations set to take place in Busan, South Korea, at the end of the year. In those talks, countries are split over whether the treaty should call for caps on plastic production, a position opposed by Exxon and the global petrochemical industry. The United States last month said it supports a treaty designed around global plastic production cuts. Environmental groups praised the lawsuit. Christy Leavitt, Oceana's plastics campaign director, said California's lawsuit will 'hold industry accountable and debunk the plastics recycling narrative that holds us back from real solutions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-sues-exxon-over-global-plastic-pollution/7795403.html	2024-09-23T13:09:26-07:00	
Iran’s exiled prince urges Israelis to act on regime change, clarifies stance on funding Iran protests	Washington — The son of Iran’s last monarch, exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi, used a speech to Israeli American activists in Washington on Friday to urge them to act in support of his campaign to oust Iran’s Islamist rulers. In an interview with VOA shortly after his speech at the Israeli-American Council national summit, Pahlavi answered a question about what kind of action he wants to see from Israelis by citing the concepts of 'maximum pressure' against the Islamic Republic and 'maximum support' for the Iranian people. He said that support includes fomenting 'civil disobedience movements' in Iran and said it is 'important to fund' them. After VOA published its initial story on Friday, highlighting Pahlavi’s reference to funding civil disobedience movements in Iran in his answer to the question about what he is urging Israelis to do, some of his supporters in the Iranian diaspora used the social media X platform to express doubt about Pahlavi’s stated position. Those supporters said they did not believe Pahlavi was calling on Israelis to provide financial support to dissidents in Iran. Rather, they said they believed he was referring to diaspora Iranians as the people who should do the funding. In a statement sent to VOA on Saturday, an aide to Pahlavi said the U.S.-based crown prince’s comment about funding civil disobedience movements such as protests and labor strikes in Iran had been misinterpreted in the initial VOA story. 'The crown prince has long been a strong advocate for the establishment of a labor strike fund, emphasizing its importance in empowering the Iranian people in their fight for freedom,' the aide said. 'He believes that such a fund could be financed using Iran's blocked assets, asserting that this money rightfully belongs to the Iranian people, not the regime.' The Washington event at which Pahlavi spoke is an annual gathering of Israeli American activists, their Jewish American allies and other Israel supporters. Pahlavi drew cheers and standing ovations from the audience for urging Israelis to work with Iranians to oust the radical clerics who have ruled Iran since overthrowing his father in 1979. The speech was his most high-profile outreach to Israelis since traveling to Israel in April 2023, when he became the most prominent Iranian opposition figure to make a public visit to the Jewish state. The following transcript of Pahlavi’s interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: In your IAC speech, you urged the audience to take action. What kinds of actions do you expect to see from Israeli Americans, Israelis in general and the Israeli government when it comes to achieving regime change? Reza Pahlavi, exiled Iranian crown prince: There are two major components in this campaign. On one hand, it is important to put maximum pressure on the regime. Parallel to that is maximum support for the people of Iran. We are trying to foment civil disobedience movements within Iran, ranging from protests to labor strikes. It is important to fund them. Many diaspora Iranians would like to help. But U.S. sanctions make it almost impossible for them to, for instance, transfer money back home. Many aspects of the sanctions rules have to change to facilitate that. It requires a new U.S. policy. There also needs to be an appropriate media strategy to counter the regime's propaganda machinery. All aspects of the campaign should be coordinated with some key governments that can help. VOA: Iran and its main proxy Hezbollah are once again threatening revenge against Israel for alleged Israeli attacks on Hezbollah communications devices in Lebanon this week. What is your message to the Islamic Republic as it considers its next move? Pahlavi: There is no message to give to warmongers who stand against freedom, peace, human rights and even our national identity. Iranians, by the millions, have shown how much they despise this regime and want to tell the world that it does not represent us. Iranians are peace lovers. We want to have good relationships with our neighborhood — with Arabs, Israelis and the rest of the world. This is why I’m not going to waste my time telling the regime anything. At the end of the day, the solution is for the Iranian people themselves to put an end to this regime. But as I said in my speech, they have done all of this work alone so far. They need extra support to have a chance of success. VOA: In the audience, some Iranian Muslims waved Iran’s former Lion and Sun flag and chanted your name, reflecting the support you have in the diaspora for your friendship toward Israel. But there also are some in the diaspora who accuse you of supporting Israeli aggression toward Palestinians and others in the region. What is your message to Iranians who are skeptical of your view that they need to embrace Israel to achieve regime change? Pahlavi: I think a strategic partnership with a country like Israel brings a tremendous amount of opportunities for sharing technological knowhow. One of the reasons for my trip to Israel was to explore the possibilities of using their expertise in water management for agriculture. We are facing a drought and water crisis in Iran, so we need to have a cordial relationship with such governments. It is unfortunate that when we have such a conflict [like the Israel-Hamas war], there always are casualties. Of course, my heart goes out to many victims. The main problem is the regime itself. As long as it is there, it will not allow for normalization [of relations in the region], or for stability and peace. I’ve been insisting for years that as long as you don’t eliminate the source of the problem, which finances terrorism and forces governments to act and react, we will never be rid of it. The solution is for this regime to go. That is what the majority of the Iranian people are calling for. And what I’ve been calling for is solidarity. I think governments, including Israel, are very cognizant of, and know the difference between, the people of Iran and the regime that has nothing to do with the people’s aspirations. The regime is only there to represent its own self-interest at the expense of the Iranian people. This story was produced in collaboration with VOA’s Persian Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-exiled-prince/7793045.html	2024-09-23T12:01:24-07:00

Climate of fear permeates repressive Belarusian society	geneva — United Nations investigators are accusing the Belarusian government of Alexander Lukashenko of instilling 'a pervasive climate of fear by quashing all avenues of dissent' by systematically oppressing its perceived political opponents. 'Measures of repression and intimidation aimed at suppressing dissent continue unabated in Belarus, particularly in the lead-up to the presidential election scheduled in 2025,' Karinna Moskaleko, chair of the Group of independent Experts told the U.N. human rights council Monday. Moskaleko presented a searing account of widespread human rights violations, abuse, and horrific cases of cruelty and deprivation in this first oral update of the human rights situation in Belarus by the Expert Group, newly created by the council in March. She read out a list of abuses committed in Belarus since May 2020, when nationwide protests erupted, following Lukashenko’s decision to seek another term as president. Among those cited are arbitrary deprivation of the right to life and to liberty, torture and ill-treatment, including sexual and gender-based violence, denial of a fair trial, violations of the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. 'While sexual and gender-based violence is underreported, there is credible information some women and men in detention have been threatened with rape and subjected to forced nudity and cavity searches,' Moskaleko said. 'We continue to observe a misuse of national security and criminal laws to silence any dissent. Individuals perceived as political opponents continue to be charged and arrested under the criminal code, for exercising their legitimate rights to freedom of expression and association,' she said, adding that 'free trial rights are systematically violated.' The report notes that Belarusians forced into exile continue to be harassed by Lukashenko’s government, that their assets and properties are seized and relatives left behind are intimidated by the authorities. The group of experts accused the government 'for the near-total destruction of civic space and fundamental freedoms,' with most of the opposition either imprisoned or forced into exile since the 2020 elections … creating a chilling effect on any participation in activities 'perceived as critical of the government.' Lukashenko recently pardoned dozens of people who had been convicted for participating in the 2020 protests. While welcoming the announced release, Moskaleko noted that 'they represent only a small fraction of those who have been arrested' and urged the government to promptly release 'all those arbitrarily detained on politically motivated charges.' Larysa Belskaya, Belarusia ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva was unimpressed by what she heard and told 'the West,' which she claimed was behind the report, 'to stop meddling in our domestic affairs.' She said next year’s presidential election will be the domestic affair of a sovereign state. 'We do not need foreign approval or disapproval regarding the outcome of our peoples’ expression of their will,' she said. 'Belarus, like the overwhelming majority of developing countries, does not accept interference in its domestic affairs or pressure or sanctions.' This set off a spirited debate in the council with Western countries strongly condemning the persecution and intimidation of all segments of Belarusian society. They demanded an end to the government’s repressive policies and urged the immediate release of all political prisoners. They denounced the Belarusian government’s support of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and called for an end to its complicity in the illegal deportation of Ukranian children by Russia. Michele Taylor, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. human rights council in Geneva, condemned the ongoing repression in Belarus 'including the use of torture, arbitrary detention, intimidation, harassment of families of political prisoners and transnational repression of Belarusians.' On the other hand, Stanislav Kovpak, chief counselor at the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Department for Multilateral Human Rights Cooperation deplored 'the double standards and biased approach in assessing the situation in Belarus.' 'At the same time, the role of the West is hushed up as is their significant support for the opposition who has emigrated,' he said, criticizing the use of illegal restrictive measures by Western countries against the Belarusian economy … 'and the stirring up of anti-government feeling by Western-controlled, biased media.' He rebuked the group of experts who 'worked here in gross violation of the basic principles of impartiality that should underpin the human rights body.' Addressing the council via videolink, exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said she was speaking for the more than 1,400 political prisoners who could not speak for themselves, along with the teachers, doctors and activists behind bars for 'speaking the truth and dreaming of freedom.' 'Many of them are held in complete isolation, incommunicado … no letters, no phone calls, no contact with the outside world. My husband Syarhei has been cut off for over a year.

FBI data shows violent crime down for a second consecutive year	washington — Violent crime in the United States is down for a second consecutive year, with law enforcement agencies reporting significant declines in murder and rapes, according to a just-released report from the FBI. The FBI Crime in the Nation report released Monday found violent crime, overall, fell by 3% from 2022 to 2023, with murder and manslaughter rates dropping by 11.6% and rape down by more than 9%. There were also smaller declines in the number of robberies and aggravated assaults. Additionally, property crimes, which include burglary, fell by an estimated 2.4% year over year, though motor vehicle theft jumped by 12.6%. FBI officials, briefing reporters on the report, described the drop in the number of murders as notable, saying the 11.6% decline is the largest recorded over the past 20 years. Overall, the officials said the rate of all violent crimes in 2023 was 363.3 crimes per 100,000 inhabitants, down from a rate of 377.1 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants in 2022. More than 16,000 U.S. state and local law enforcement agencies contributed data for the report, including all agencies serving cities with more than one million people. The decrease in violent crimes across the U.S. continues a trend dating back to 2021, when crime rates fell after a spike in murders in 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic. The violent crime rate also remains well below a peak in rates during the early 1990s. Some crimes, though, have seen slight increases, including the number of aggravated assaults with knives, cutting instruments or other weapons. The number of so-called 'strong-arm' robberies – involving intimidation or a threat of the use of force – rose by 3.2%. Assaults on police officers also jumped to a 10-year high according to the FBI report, including 60 officers murdered in the line of duty. The number of hate crimes and victims of hate crimes also increased from 2022 to 2023, though FBI officials said the rise could have been impacted by an increase in the number of law enforcement agencies reporting hate crime data. FBI officials declined to comment on whether the trends and the overall decrease in violent crime from 2022 to 2023 have extended into 2024. But a report issued by the non-partisan Council on Criminal Justice (CCJ) in July indicates the number of violent crimes continue to fall. That study, based on monthly crime rates for dozens of major U.S. cities found murder rates fell by 13% in the first half of 2024 compared to the first six months of 2023. Assaults, assaults with guns and carjacking also fell. But while the CCJ report called the overall trends encouraging, it noted, 'many cities are still experiencing disturbingly high leve	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-data-shows-violent-crime-down-for-a-second-consecutive-year-/7795119.html	2024-09-23T09:29:10-07:00

At least 30 bodies found on boat along migrant route off Senegal	DAKAR, Senegal — At least 30 bodies were found on a boat drifting off the coast of Senegal's capital, the military said Monday, as the number of migrants leaving West Africa increases. The navy was informed of the vessel's presence on Sunday evening and sent out a boat patrol to the area, 70 kilometers (38 nautical miles) from Dakar, Ibrahima Sow, spokesperson for Senegal's military, said in a statement. 'So far, 30 bodies have been counted,' Sow said. The advanced state of decomposition of the bodies is making the identification process very difficult, the military said, adding that investigations will provide more information on the death toll and the boat's origin. Earlier this month, a boat carrying 89 people on board capsized off the coast of Senegal. At least 37 people died, according to Senegalese authorities. Many of the migrants leaving West Africa through Senegal flee conflict, poverty and a lack of jobs. Most head to the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off the coast of West Africa, which is used as a stepping stone to continental Europe. Since the beginning of the year, more than 22,300 people have landed on the Canary Islands, 126% more than the same period last year, according to statistics released by Spain's Interior Ministry. Last month, the Senegalese army said it had arrested 453 migrants and 'members of smuggling networks' as part of a 12-day operation patrolling the coastline. More than half of those arrested were Senegalese nationals, the army said. In July, a boat carrying 300 migrants, mostly from Gambia and Senegal, capsized off Mauritania. More than a dozen died and at least 150 others went missing. The Atlantic route from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. While there is no accurate death toll because of the lack of information on departures from West Africa, the Spanish migrant rights group Walking Borders estimates the victims are in the thousands this year alone. Migrant vessels that get lost or run into problems often vanish in the Atlantic, with some drifting across the ocean for months until they are found in the Caribbean and Latin America carrying only human remains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-30-bodies-found-on-boat-along-migrant-route-off-senegal-/7795054.html	2024-09-23T08:55:26-07:00	
Pakistan names new chief for powerful ISI spy agency	Islamabad — Pakistan has appointed Lieutenant-General Muhammad Asim Malik as the new head of the country’s top spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. The move comes amid persistent criticism of the powerful military-run agency for its alleged role in making or breaking elected governments in the South Asian nation. A senior Pakistani security source confirmed to VOA on Monday that Malik will assume office as the agency's next director general on September 30, replacing the current ISI chief, Nadeem Anjum. The military's media wing did not immediately comment on the high-profile appointment, but Pakistan’s state broadcaster reported it with a brief profile of the new ISI chief. Malik graduated from Fort Leavenworth in the United States and the Royal College of Defence Studies in London and currently serves as an adjutant general at the military headquarters in Rawalpindi, adjacent to the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. The ISI’s meddling in national politics has lately been the subject of intense debate in Pakistan’s national media and political circles. Jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan accuses current ISI chief Anjum of playing a role at the behest of the military in ousting him from power in 2022 through an opposition parliamentary no-confidence vote, instituting frivolous lawsuits subsequently, and unleashing a crackdown on his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party to keep himfrom returning to power. Several federal and provincial court judges, in a recent letter to the Supreme Court chief justice, have also alleged that the ISI was pressuring them to decide cases against Khan to ensure he remains in jail. The incarcerated former prime minister remains Pakistan’s most popular politician. The military, in turn, has recently arrested Anjum’s predecessor, Faiz Hameed, and initiated his court marshal on various charges, including the use of his position as the ISI chief to enable Khan to suppress political opponents while in office. It is widely believed that Khan's decision not to let Anjum replace Hameed in October 2021 angered the military and eventually led to the prime minister's removal from power several months later. Subsequent governments and the military deny having any political role or pressuring judges, a claim critics dispute. The army has ruled Pakistan for more than three decades since the country gained independence from Britain in 1947. Former Pakistani prime ministers, including Khan, and political parties say generals maintain control over foreign policy and national security issues. Khan has persistently alleged in statements from his prison cell that the current coalition government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif 'is merely a tout' of the military. He alleges that the army leadership used the ISI to massively rig the February 8 parliamentary elections this year to prevent his party from winning. The allegations were supported by a detailed Supreme Court majority decision released on Monday, resolving a petition concerning pre- and post-election controversies. The judgment declared several actions of Pakistan’s election commission in the lead-up to the polls 'unlawful,' saying they were meant to keep PTI-nominated candidates from winning. The judgment stated that the commission 'has failed to fulfill this role in the general elections of 2024.' It noted that election authorities’ actions 'significantly infringe upon the rights of the electorate and corrode their own institutional legitimacy.' The vote outcome has worsened the political turmoil triggered by Khan’s ouster, undermining Pakistan’s efforts to stabilize an already troubled economy. A spike in militant violence, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan provinces, which border Afghanistan, has added to the challenges facing the military-backed Sharif administration. 'All this has familiar echoes of the past — a government unwilling to engage with the opposition, jailing opposition leaders, trying to steamroll legislation, and a desperate opposition in constant protest mode against a backdrop of economic gloom, weak governance, and ubiquitous establishment pulling the strings from behind the scenes,' Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the U.S. and the United Nations, wrote in an article published by Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-names-new-chief-for-powerful-isi-spy-agency/7795059.html	2024-09-23T08:54:53-07:00	
Biden proposes banning Chinese vehicles from US roads with software crackdown	Washington — The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday proposed prohibiting key Chinese software and hardware in connected vehicles on American roads due to national security concerns — a move that would effectively bar nearly all Chinese cars from entering the U.S. market. The planned regulation, first reported by Reuters, would also force American and other major automakers in the coming years to remove key Chinese software and hardware from vehicles in the United States. The Biden administration has raised serious concerns about the collection of data by Chinese companies on U.S. drivers and infrastructure through connected vehicles as well as about potential foreign manipulation of vehicles connected to the internet and navigation systems. The White House ordered an investigation into the potential dangers in February. The prohibitions would prevent testing of self-driving cars on U.S. roads by Chinese automakers and extend to vehicle software and hardware produced by other U.S. foreign adversaries including Russia. 'When foreign adversaries build software to make a vehicle that means it can be used for surveillance, can be remotely controlled, which threatens the privacy and safety of Americans on the road,' Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told a briefing. 'In an extreme situation, a foreign adversary could shut down or take control of all their vehicles operating in the United States all at the same time causing crashes, blocking roads.' The move is a significant escalation in the United States' ongoing restrictions on Chinese vehicles, software and components. Earlier this month, the Biden administration locked in steep tariff hikes on Chinese imports, including a 100% duty on electric vehicles as well as new hikes on EV batteries and key minerals. There are relatively few Chinese-made cars or light-duty trucks imported into the United States. But Raimondo said the department is acting 'before suppliers, automakers and car components linked to China or Russia become commonplace and widespread in the U.S. automotive sector... We're not going to wait until our roads are filled with cars and the risk is extremely significant before we act.' Nearly all newer cars and trucks are considered 'connected' with onboard network hardware that allows internet access, allowing them to share data with devices both inside and outside the vehicle. A senior administration official confirmed the proposal would effectively ban all existing Chinese light-duty cars and trucks from the U.S. market, but added it would allow Chinese automakers to seek 'specific authorizations' for exemptions. The United States has ample evidence of China prepositioning malware in critical American infrastructure, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told the same briefing. 'With potentially millions of vehicles on the road, each with 10- to 15-year lifespans the risk of disruption and sabotage increases dramatically,' Sullivan said. The Chinese Embassy in Washington last month criticized planned action to limit Chinese vehicle exports to the United States: 'China urges the U.S. to earnestly abide by market principles and international trade rules, and create a level playing field for companies from all countries. China will firmly defend its lawful rights and interests.' The proposal calls for making software prohibitions effective in the 2027 model year while the hardware ban would take effect in the 2030 model year or January 2029. The Commerce Department is giving the public 30 days to comment on the proposal and hopes to finalize it by Jan. 20. The rules would apply to all on-road vehicles but exclude agricultural or mining vehicles not used on public roads. The Alliance For Automotive Innovation, a group representing major automakers including General Motors, Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai, has warned that changing hardware and software would take time. The group noted connected vehicle hardware and software are developed around the world, including China, but could not detail to what extent Chinese-made components are prevalent in U.S. models.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-proposes-banning-chinese-vehicles-from-us-roads-with-software-crackdown-/7794812.html	2024-09-23T06:58:56-07:00	
Soyuz capsule with 2 Russians, 1 American from ISS returns to Earth	Moscow — A Soyuz capsule carrying two Russians and one American from the International Space Station landed Monday in Kazakhstan, ending a record-breaking stay for the Russian pair. The capsule landed on the Kazakh steppe about 3 1/2 hours after undocking from the ISS in an apparently trouble-free descent. In the last stage of the landing, it descended under a red-and-white parachute at about 7.2 meters per second (16 mph), with small rockets fired in the final seconds to cushion the touchdown. The astronauts were extracted from the capsule and placed in nearby chairs to help them adjust to gravity, then given medical examinations in a nearby tent. Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub returned after 374 days aboard the space station; on Friday they broke the record for the longest continuous stay there. Also in the capsule was American Tracy Dyson, who was in the space station for six months. Eight astronauts remain in the space station, including Americans Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have remained long past their scheduled return to Earth. They arrived in June as the first crew of Boeing's new Starliner capsule. But their trip was marred by thruster troubles and helium leaks, and the U.S. space agency NASA decided it was too risky to return them on Starliner. The two astronauts are to ride home with SpaceX next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/soyuz-capsule-with-2-russians-1-american-from-iss-returns-to-earth/7794800.html	2024-09-23T06:31:17-07:00	
Muslim Americans could flex 'political muscles' in November US elections	Muslims account for less than 2% of the U.S. population, but as VOA’s Kane Farabaugh reports, Muslim American influence in U.S. elections is growing, driven largely by concerns over the continued war between Israel and Hamas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/muslim-americans-could-flex-political-muscles-in-november-us-elections/7794750.html	2024-09-23T05:52:28-07:00	
Cholera spreading in Sudan as fighting between rival generals shows no sign of abating	Cairo — Cholera is spreading in war-torn Sudan, killing at least 388 people and sickening about 13,000 others over the past two months, health authorities said, as more than 17 months of fighting between the military and a notorious paramilitary group shows no sign of abating. The disease is spreading in areas devastated by recent heavy rainfall and floods especially in eastern Sudan where millions of war displaced people sheltered. The casualties from cholera included six dead and about 400 sickened over the weekend, according to Sunday’s report by the Health Ministry. The disease was detected in 10 of the country’s 18 provinces with the eastern Kassala and al-Qadarif provinces the most hit, the ministry said. Cholera is a fast-developing, highly contagious infection that causes diarrhea, leading to severe dehydration and possible death within hours when not treated, according to the World Health Organization. It is transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. The disease is not uncommon in Sudan. A previous major outbreak left at least 700 dead and sickened about 22,000 in less than two months in 2017. Sudan was plunged into chaos in April last year when simmering tensions between the military and a powerful paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, exploded into open warfare across the country. The fighting, which wrecked the capital, Khartoum, and other urban areas has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur, according to the United Nations and international rights groups. It has killed at least 20,000 people and wounded tens of thousands others, according to the U.N. However, rights groups and activists say the toll was much higher. The war also has created the world’s largest displacement crisis. More than 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the fighting began, according to the International Organization for Migration. They include over 2.3 million who fled to neighboring countries. Devastating seasonal floods and cholera have compounded the Sudanese misery. At least 225 people have been killed and about 900 others were injured in the floods, the Health Ministry said. Critical infrastructure has been washed away, and more than 76,000 houses have been destroyed or damaged, it said. Famine was also confirmed in July in the Zamzam camp for displaced people, which is located about 15 kilometers (10 miles) from North Darfur’s embattled capital of al-Fasher, according to global experts from the Famine Review Committee. About 25.6 million people — more than half of Sudan’s population — will face acute hunger this year, they warned. Fighting, meanwhile, rages in al-Fasher, the last major city in Darfur that is still held by the military. The RSF has been attempting to retake it since the start of the year. Last week, the paramilitary force and its allied Arab militias launched a new attack on the city. The military said its forces, aided by rebel groups, managed to repel the attack and kill hundreds of RSF fighters, including two senior commanders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cholera-spreading-in-sudan-as-fighting-between-rival-generals-shows-no-sign-of-abating-/7794678.html	2024-09-23T04:34:51-07:00	
Eurozone business activity slumps after Olympics boost	Brussels, Belgium — Eurozone business activity declined for the first time in seven months in September, as France lost steam after the end of the Paris Olympic Games, a key survey said Monday. S&P Global's purchasing managers' index (PMI) — a key gauge of the overall health of the economy — dropped to 48.9 in September, down from 51 in August. Any reading below 50 indicated contraction. 'The eurozone is heading towards stagnation. After the Olympic effect had temporarily boosted France, the eurozone heavyweight economy, the Composite PMI fell in September to the largest extent in 15 months,' said Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank. 'Considering the rapid decline in new orders and the order backlog, it doesn't take much imagination to foresee a further weakening of the economy.' The survey showed that Germany and France, the eurozone's top two economies, were largely responsible for driving the slump in the 20-country single currency area. French private sector output returned to contraction after the shot in the arm from the Olympics, while German business activity dropped the fastest since February. The 'big decline' in eurozone PMI 'suggests that the economy is slowing sharply, that Germany is in recession and that France's Olympics boost was just a blip', said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at London-based research group Capital Economics. 'With France's new minority government now planning to tighten fiscal policy significantly, prospects for growth in France look increasingly poor,' he said. President Emmanuel Macron named a new government led by Prime Minister Michel Barnier Saturday, 11 weeks after an inconclusive parliamentary election. The eurozone PMI data showed the manufacturing sector was down across the board, falling for the eighteenth month in a row. 'Manufacturing is getting messier by the month,' de la Rubia said. 'Looking ahead, the sharp drop in new orders and companies' increasingly bleak outlook for future output suggest that this dry spell is far from over.' The decline in business activity could add impetus to calls for the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut its key interest rate again in October. The bank for the 20 countries that use the euro cut its deposit rate by a quarter point to 3.50% this month — the second decrease since June. The ECB had hiked rates at record pace from mid-2022 to tame surging consumer prices but has started easing the pressure as inflation drifts back down towards its 2% target.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eurozone-business-activity-slumps-after-olympics-boost-/7794666.html	2024-09-23T04:13:05-07:00	
Trump attempted assassination suspect Ryan Routh to appear in court	WEST PALM BEACH, Florida — The man accused of hiding out with a gun near Donald Trump's Florida golf course in an apparent attempt to assassinate the former U.S. president is due in court on Monday, where prosecutors will argue to keep him in jail until his trial. Ryan Routh, 58, has been charged with two gun crimes after he allegedly pointed a rifle through the tree line on Sept. 15 while the Republican presidential candidate was playing golf at his course in West Palm Beach, according to a criminal complaint. He has not yet entered a plea. U.S. prosecutors may reveal new details about the investigation at the hearing, scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), as they argue that Routh poses a danger to public safety and must remain detained pending trial. Routh has been charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. More charges could follow. A U.S. Secret Service agent spotted the weapon and fired in Routh's direction, causing the suspect to flee, according to the complaint. Routh was later arrested along a Florida highway. U.S. officials have said Routh did not fire a shot during the encounter at the golf course and did not have a line of sight to Trump, who was a few hundred meters away. Authorities have not yet divulged a motive for the incident, which the FBI has said is being investigated as an apparent attempted assassination of Trump ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election. It came about two months after another gunman wounded Trump on the ear during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. That gunman was shot and killed by the Secret Service. The pair of incidents revealed the agency's strains at a time of rising political threats and violence in the United States. Routh, a struggling roofing contractor who most recently lived in Hawaii, had a criminal history. He was a vocal supporter of Ukraine who was interviewed about his quixotic effort to recruit Afghans to fight against Russia's invasion. In a 2023 self-published book, Routh wrote that Iran was 'free to assassinate Trump' for pulling the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Teheran during his presidency. In December 2002, Routh was convicted in North Carolina of possessing a weapon of mass death and destruction. He was also convicted of possessing stolen goods in 2010, according to court records. Cellphone data showed that Routh may have been waiting in the area for nearly 12 hours — from around 2 a.m. until about 1:30 p.m. - when the gun was spotted, according to the criminal complaint. Investigators found a loaded SKS-style rifle with a scope, a digital camera and a plastic bag with food at the scene, according to the complaint.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-attempted-assassination-suspect-ryan-routh-to-appear-in-court-/7794653.html	2024-09-23T03:57:32-07:00	
EU challenges China's dairy product probe at WTO	Brussels — The European Commission launched a challenge at the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Monday against China's investigation into EU dairy products, initiated after the European Union placed import tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. This is the first time the European Union has taken such action at the start of an investigation, rather than wait for it to result in trade measures against the bloc. 'The EU's action was prompted by an emerging pattern of China initiating trade defense measures, based on questionable allegations and insufficient evidence, within a short period of time,' the commission said. Proceedings at the WTO start with a mandatory period of 60 days for the parties to consult each other. The Commission said it would ask the WTO to set up an adjudicating panel if the consultations did not lead to a satisfactory solution. WTO panels usually take more than a year to reach conclusions. China initiated its anti-subsidy investigation on Aug. 21, targeting EU liquid milk, cream with a fat content above 10% and various types of cheeses. The Commission said it was confident that EU dairy subsidy schemes are fully in line with international rules and not causing injury to China's dairy sector. The EU imposed provisional duties in July on electric vehicles built in China and EU members are expected to vote soon on final tariffs, which would apply for five years. China also has ongoing anti-dumping investigations into EU brandy and pork.

High inflation memories cloud US consumers' outlooks	Washington — Even before the Federal Reserve approved its outsized half-percentage-point interest rate cut last week, financial markets had begun making credit cheaper for households and businesses as they bid down mortgage rates, cut corporate bond yields, and chipped away at what consumers pay for personal, auto and other loans. How fast that process will continue now that the U.S. central bank's first rate cut is in the books is unclear, in particular whether easing credit conditions will become tangible to consumers in ways that shift attitudes about the economy before the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election. Recent surveys suggest that while the pace of price increases has declined dramatically, the public's mood is still marred by nearly two years of high inflation — even if falling rates signal that chapter of recent economic history is closed and will begin making it cheaper for people to borrow money. 'My daughter has been trying to buy a home for years and cannot,' said Julie Miller, who works at her son's electrical company in Reno, Nevada, a state where home prices rose fast during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of seven key battleground states in the presidential race, Nevada is being aggressively contested by Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican challenger. If housing costs are vexing Miller's daughter, higher prices at Taco Bell have caused Miller to cut back on the usual Friday night trips to the fast food retailer with her granddaughter, and left her inclined to vote for Trump because 'I don't think Biden has done a great job with inflation.' Harris supporters had similar concerns about high prices even as they vouched for her as the best candidate to address the problem. Borrowing costs decline The Fed's rate cut on Sept. 18 is likely to be followed by more, with at least another quarter-percentage-point reduction expected when policymakers begin their next two-day policy meeting a day after the U.S. election. Just as rate increases feed through to a higher cost of credit for families and businesses, discouraging them from borrowing, spending and investing in order to cool inflation, reductions in borrowing costs change the calculus for would-be homebuyers and firms, particularly small businesses wanting to finance new equipment or expand production. Looser monetary policy, which the Fed had been signaling was on the way, has already put money back into people's pockets. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate home mortgage, the most popular home loan, for example, is approaching 6% after nearing 8% just a year ago. Redfin, a real estate firm, recently estimated that the median payment on homes sold or listed in the four weeks through Sept. 15 was $300 less than the all-time high hit in April and nearly 3% lower than a year ago. But with that adjustment already done, 'mortgage rates are likely to remain relatively stable for the next couple of weeks,' Chen Zhao, an economist at Redfin, wrote in a post on the company's website. Indeed, under baseline estimates from the Fed's own staff, mortgage rates are likely to level off somewhere in the mid-5% range, meaning most of the relief there has already occurred. Banks have begun trimming the 'prime rate' they charge their most credit-worthy borrowers to match the Fed rate cut. Other forms of consumer credit - the auto and personal loans where a better deal might be available to households - have changed only marginally so far, and it may take longer for banks to give up on charging higher finance costs. Investors and economists saw last week's rate cut as less important than the message it carried of a central bank ready to loosen credit and confident that recent high inflation won't recur. Inflation in fact has registered one of its fastest ever declines, with the consumer price index's annual increase falling from more than 9% in June 2022 to 2.6% on a year-over-year basis last month. The Fed's preferred personal consumption expenditures price index rose at a 2.5% rate in July, near the central bank's 2% target. Sour sentiment The U.S. economy has been performing reasonably well despite concerns the job market might be on the brink of weakening. New claims for unemployment benefits remain low and unexpectedly fell in the most recent week, while the unemployment rate, at 4.2% in August, has risen from a year ago but is around the level the Fed feels is sustainable without generating excess wage and price pressures. A Philadelphia Fed index of manufacturing rose recently and retail sales for August grew despite expectations for a drop. But none of that has led to a decisive shift in public sentiment. The share of Americans who see the economy as heading in the right direction climbed to 25% in August from 17% in May 2022, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Yet the share that sees the economy on the wrong track has eased to 60% from 74% over the same period. A New York Fed survey that through early this year showed people feeling better off than a year ago and expecting more improvement in the year ahead has since been moving in the other direction even as inflation slowed further and rate cuts became more likely. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index had been improving but then dropped in recent months and remains below where it was before the pandemic. The most recent U.S. Census 'pulse' polls of households showed the share who reported trouble paying household expenses in the past week has ebbed from 2022, when inflation hit its peak, but has made little improvement recently. In his press conference following the rate cut last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said his aim was to keep the economy on track between the central bank's two goals of stable inflation and a healthy job market. To that end, credit will ease but at no guaranteed pace. 'This is the beginning of that process,' Powell said. 'The direction ... is toward a sense of neutral, and we'll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real-time.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/high-inflation-memories-cloud-us-consumers-outlooks-/7794639.html	2024-09-23T03:38:45-07:00	
Tanzania arrests opposition leaders, blocks protest	Dar es Salaam, Tanzania — Police arrested Tanzania's top opposition figures on Monday, their party said, as the authorities moved to block a mass protest in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam. Despite an official ban, the opposition Chadema party had vowed to go ahead with the rally over the alleged kidnapping and killing of its members by security forces. Chadema said its chairman Freeman Mbowe and his deputy Tundu Lissu were both arrested on Monday, while riot police were stationed in key areas across the city to prevent gatherings. 'Demonstration is our constitutional right and we are surprised by the magnitude of force being used by the police to threaten people and suppress our freedom,' Mbowe told supporters before being led away by police, according to a video shared by the party online. Chadema accuses President Samia Suluhu Hassan's government of returning the country to the repressive tactics of her predecessor, John Magufuli. Hassan took over following Magufuli's sudden death in March 2021 and appeared to signal a more liberal approach, reversing restrictions on opposition rallies and the media. But Chadema accuses the security forces of being behind the recent disappearance of several members and the killing of Ali Mohamed Kibao, of its national secretariat, who was found dead earlier this month. Police also blocked a youth day rally by the party in August, arresting dozens of its leaders including Mbowe and Lissu. Rights groups and Western governments, including the United States, have raised concerns about renewed repression ahead of local elections in November and a general election in late 2025. Lissu, an opposition stalwart, has been arrested countless times and suffered multiple gunshot wounds in an assassination attempt in 2017. He returned to Tanzania last year after Hassan lifted the ban on opposition rallies. Police had alleged that the Chadema protests would be violent. But in a speech broadcast on X on Sunday, Mbowe said: 'I remind Tanzanians that we are going to hold peaceful protests. We are neither carrying any weapons nor planning to violate the peace as some people allege. 'In case some of us will be arrested, hurt or even killed, pray for us and never turn back. We are doing this to make our country a peaceful place to live,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tanzania-arrests-opposition-leaders-blocks-protest/7794597.html	2024-09-23T02:24:14-07:00	
Search underway for suspects in Alabama mass shooting	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Authorities have reported no immediate arrests after a weekend mass shooting killed four people and left 17 others injured in what police described as a targeted 'hit' by multiple shooters who opened fire outside a popular Alabama nightspot. The shooting late Saturday night in the popular Five Points South entertainment district of Birmingham, rocking an area of restaurants and bars that is often bustling on weekend nights. The mass shooting, one of several this year in the major city, unnerved residents and left officials at home and beyond pleading for help to both solve the crime and address the broader problem of gun violence. 'The priority is to find these shooters and get them off our streets,' Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said a day after the shooting. The mayor planned a morning news conference Monday to provide updates on the case. The shooting occurred on the sidewalk and street outside Hush, a lounge in the entertainment district, where blood stains were still visible on the sidewalk outside the venue on Sunday morning. Birmingham Police Chief Scott Thurmond said authorities believe the shooting targeted one of the people who was killed, possibly in a murder-for-hire. A vehicle pulled up and 'multiple shooters' got out and began firing, then fled the scene, he said. 'We believe that there was a 'hit,' if you will, on that particular person,' Thurmond said. Police said approximately 100 shell casings were recovered. Thurmond said law enforcement was working to determine what weapons were used, but they believe some of the gunfire was 'fully automatic.' Investigators also were trying to determine whether anyone fired back, creating a crossfire. In a statement late Sunday, police said the shooters are believed to have used 'machine gun conversion devices' that make semi-automatic weapons fire more rapidly. Some surviving victims critically injured Officers found two men and a woman on a sidewalk with gunshot wounds and they were pronounced dead there. An additional male gunshot victim was pronounced dead at a hospital, according to police. Police identified the three victims found on the sidewalk as Anitra Holloman, 21, of the Birmingham suburb of Bessemer, Tahj Booker, 27, of Birmingham, and Carlos McCain, 27, of Birmingham. The fourth victim pronounced dead at the hospital was pending identification. By the early hours of Sunday, victims began showing up at hospitals and police subsequently identified 17 people with injuries, some of them life-threatening. Four of the surviving victims, in conditions ranging from good to critical, were being treated at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital on Sunday afternoon, according to Alicia Rohan, a hospital spokeswoman. Popular nightspot rocked by gunfire The area of Birmingham where the gunfire erupted is popular with young adults because of its proximity to the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the plethora of nearby restaurants and bars. The shooting was the 31st mass killing of 2024, of which 23 were shootings, according to James Alan Fox, a criminologist and professor at Northeastern University, who oversees a mass killings database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with the university. Three of the nation's 23 mass shootings this year were in Birmingham, including two earlier quadruple homicides. Mayor pleads for a solution to gun violence Woodfin expressed frustration at what he described as an epidemic of gun violence in America and the city. 'We find ourselves in 2024, where gun violence is at an epidemic level, an epidemic crisis in our country. And the city of Birmingham, unfortunately, finds itself at the tip of that spear,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/search-underway-for-suspects-in-alabama-mass-shooting/7794582.html	2024-09-23T01:56:19-07:00

Pope Francis cancels meetings due to mild flu, Vatican says	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis canceled his scheduled appointments for Monday due to a mild flu, the Vatican said in a statement. The Vatican said the 87-year-old pontiff made the decision as a precautionary measure in view of his planned four-day trip to Luxembourg and Belgium later this week. It gave no further details. Francis is scheduled to begin the trip, his 46th foreign visit as pope, on Thursday. It comes less than two weeks after he returned from a demanding 12-day, four-country tour of Southeast Asia and Oceania. Francis now regularly uses a wheelchair due to knee and back pain. He has also suffered bouts of ill health in recent years. Earlier this year, he canceled several appointments over what the Vatican variously described as a cold, bronchitis and influenza. The pope appeared in good form throughout his Sept. 2-13 trip to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore. He maintained a packed schedule, headlining more than 40 events, and clocked up a total of nearly 33,000 km. His trip to Luxembourg and Belgium is expected to highlight the needs of migrants in Europe and to include a meeting with survivors of abuse by Catholic clergy. Francis' agenda in Luxembourg and Belgium will be lighter than that of the Southeast Asia and Oceania trip, with the pope scheduled to take part in about a dozen events over four days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-cancels-meetings-due-to-mild-flu-vatican-says/7794559.html	2024-09-23T00:22:19-07:00	
Sri Lankan leftist leader sworn in after landslide election win	Colombo, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka's first leftist president was sworn into office Monday vowing to restore public faith in politics after anger over the island nation's unprecedented economic crisis propelled him to a landslide poll win. Self-avowed Marxist Anura Kumara Dissanayaka of the People's Liberation Front (JVP) took his oath at the colonial-era Presidential Secretariat in Colombo after trouncing his nearest rivals in Saturday's vote. The previously fringe politician, whose party led two failed uprisings that left tens of thousands dead, saw a surge of support after the country's 2022 economic meltdown forced painful hardships on ordinary Sri Lankans. Dissanayaka, 55, was sworn in by the chief justice in a ceremony attended by lawmakers, members of the Buddhist clergy and the military who sang the national anthem after the ceremony. 'I will do my best to fully restore the people's confidence in politicians,' Dissanayaka said after taking the oath. 'I am not a conjurer, I am not a magician,' he added. 'There are things I know and things I don't know, but I will seek the best advice and do my best. For that, I need the support of everyone.' Dissanayaka succeeds outgoing president Ranil Wickremesinghe, who took office at the peak of the financial crisis following the government's first-ever foreign debt default and months of punishing food, fuel and medicine shortages. Wickremesinghe, 75, imposed steep tax hikes and other austerity measures per the terms of an International Monetary Fund bailout. His policies ended the shortages and returned the economy to growth but left millions struggling to make ends meet. 'I can confidently say that I did my best to stabilize the country during one of its darkest periods,' he said in a statement after placing a distant third in Saturday's poll. Shortly before the ceremony, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena resigned, clearing the way for Dissanayaka to appoint his own cabinet. Dissanayaka's party has said he wants to have his own cabinet until a fresh parliament is elected later this year. His JVP party has only three members in the 225-member parliament. He has vowed to press ahead with the IMF rescue package negotiated by his predecessor last year but modify its terms in order to deliver tax cuts. 'It is a binding document, but there is a provision to renegotiate,' Bimal Ratnayake, a senior member of Dissanayaka's party, told AFP. Legacy of violence Dissanayaka's party led two rebellions in the 1970s and 1980s that left more than 80,000 people dead before renouncing violence. It had been a peripheral player in Sri Lankan politics in the decades since, winning less than four percent of the vote during the most recent parliamentary elections in 2020. But Sri Lanka's crisis proved an opportunity for Dissanayaka, who saw his popularity rise after pledging to change the island's 'corrupt' political culture. The 55-year-old laborer's son was a JVP student leader during the second insurrection and has described how one of his teachers sheltered him to save him from government-backed death squads that killed party activists. He counts famous Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara among his heroes. Since his rise to popularity, he has softened some policies, saying he believes in an open economy and is not totally opposed to privatization.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lankan-leftist-leader-sworn-in-after-landslide-election-win/7794541.html	2024-09-22T22:56:04-07:00	
China urges vigilance against Taiwanese cyberattacks	BEIJING/TAIPEI — China's national security ministry said on Monday a Taiwan military-backed hacking group called Anonymous 64 has been carrying out cyberattacks against targets in China, urging people to report 'anti-propaganda sabotage.' Taiwan's defense ministry denied the allegations, saying China was the real disturber of the peace with its cyber attacks and military harassment. Since the beginning of this year, Anonymous 64 - which China's national security ministry said belonged to Taiwan's cyber warfare wing - has sought to upload and broadcast 'content that denigrates the mainland's political system and major policies,' on websites, outdoor screens and network TV stations, it said in a blog post. Taiwan frequently accuses Chinese groups of seeking to spread online disinformation or carry out cyberattacks across the democratically governed island. China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has ramped up military and political pressure against over the past five years to assert its claims. The Taiwan defense ministry's Information, Communications and Electronic Force Command said China's accusations were untrue. 'The current enemy situation and cyber threats are severe,' it said in a statement. 'The Chinese communist military and forces that coordinate with it continue to use aircraft, ships and cyber attacks to harass Taiwan and are the originators of undermining regional peace.' Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims. The hacking group's X account said it was set up in June 2023 and showed screenshots of efforts to broadcast videos likening Chinese President Xi Jinping to an emperor, marking the second anniversary of protests against Beijing's strict COVID curbs and commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations. One video was an address from an Anonymous 64 member wearing the Anonymous hacking group's Guy Fawkes mask in the style of the graphic novel and film V for Vendetta. Neither the X site nor the blog post from China's national security ministry said whether Anonymous 64 had any affiliation with the international hacking group. Reuters was not immediately able to verify where the group was based or whether they had actually carried out the hacking attacks they were accused of. In the blog post published on its official WeChat account, the national security ministry said its investigation into the group had found many of the websites Anonymous 64 claimed to have accessed were fake or had little no traffic. Posts showing it having infiltrated numerous university and media websites had been photoshopped, the ministry added. The security ministry published screenshots of the group's X account with heavily redacted text. It also said it had opened a case against three members of Taiwan's cyber warfare wing. 'We advocate that netizens should not believe in or spread rumors and should promptly report cyberattacks or cases of anti-propaganda activity to the national security authorities,' the blog post said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-urges-vigilance-against-taiwanese-cyberattacks/7794532.html	2024-09-22T22:37:12-07:00

Vietnam aims for 1 semiconductor fab plant, 10 packaging plants by 2030	HANOI, VIETNAM — Vietnam aims to have at least one semiconductor fabrication plant and 10 packaging plants by 2030, and will launch a fund to help foreign investors mitigate the impacts of the global minimum business tax, the government said on the weekend. The country's semiconductor industry is targeting revenue of $25 billion by 2030, the government said in a statement after the release of its semiconductor industry development strategy on Saturday. The Southeast Asian country, a regional manufacturing hub, is seeking to move to high-tech industries from labor-intensive ones. As part of its drive, the country aims to have 50,000 semiconductor engineers by 2030, the government said. Several global electronics and semiconductor firms including Intel, Samsung, Amkor Technology, Qualcomm and Marvell Technology have facilities in the country. Beyond the initial 2030 target, the government said it plans to have at least three semiconductor fabrication plants and 20 packaging plants, with annual revenues of $100 billion, by 2050. In July, the Ministry of Planning and Investment said it was finalizing a draft plan to set up a fund to help attract foreign investment into high-tech industries and maintain the country's competitiveness.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-aims-for-1-semiconductor-fab-plant-10-packaging-plants-by-2030/7794515.html	2024-09-22T21:13:40-07:00

Micro dramas shake up China's film industry, aim for Hollywood	ZHENGZHOU, China — On a film set that resembles the medieval castle of a Chinese lord, Zhu Jian is busy disrupting the world's second-largest movie industry. The 69-year-old actor is playing the patriarch of a wealthy family celebrating his birthday with a lavish banquet. But unbeknownst to either of them, the servant in the scene is his biological granddaughter. A second twist: Zhu is not filming for cinema screens. 'Grandma's Moon' is a micro drama, composed of vertically shot, minute-long episodes featuring frequent plot turns designed to keep millions of viewers hooked to their cellphone screens — and paying for more. 'They don't go to the cinema anymore,' said Zhu of his audience, which he described as largely composed of middle-aged workers and pensioners. 'It's so convenient to hold a mobile phone and watch something anytime you want.' China's $5 billion a year micro drama industry is booming, according to Reuters' interviews with 10 people in the sector and four scholars and media analysts. The short-format videos are an increasingly potent competitor to China's film industry, some experts say, which is second in size only to Hollywood and dominated by state-owned China Film Group. And the trend is already spreading to the United States, in a rare instance of Chinese cultural exports finding traction in the West. Three major China-backed, micro-drama apps were downloaded 30 million times across both Apple's App Store and Google Play in the first quarter of 2024, grossing $71 million internationally, according to analytics company Appfigures. 'The audience only has that much attention. So obviously, the more time they spend in short videos, the less time they have for TV or other longer-format shows,' said Ashley Dudarenok, founder of a Hong Kong-based marketing consultancy. The leader in the space is Kuaishou, an app that accounted for 60% of the top 50 Chinese micro dramas last year, according to media analytics consultancy Endata. Kuaishou vice president Chen Yiyi said at a media conference in January that the app featured 68 titles that notched more than 300 million views last year, with four of them watched over a billion times. Some 94 million people -- more than the population of Germany -- watched more than 10 episodes a day on Kuaishou, she said. Reuters was not able to independently verify the data. Initial episodes on such apps are often free, but to complete a micro drama like 'Grandma's Moon,' which has 64 clips, audiences may pay tens of yuan. Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok that is owned by internet technology firm Bytedance, is also popular with micro drama fans. Alongside other major Chinese social media apps like Instagram-like Xiaohongshu and YouTube competitor Bilibili, it has announced plans to make more. In the United States, micro drama platform ReelShort, whose parent company is backed by Chinese tech giants Tencent and Baidu, has recently outranked Netflix in terms of downloads on Apple's U.S. app store, according to market researcher Sensor Tower. 'China discovered this audience first,' said Layla Cao, a Chinese producer based in Los Angeles. 'Hollywood hasn't realized that yet, but all the China-based companies are already feeding the content.' 'Low-brow and vulgar' Many popular micro dramas, including 'Grandma's Moon,' have narratives that revolve around revenge or Cinderella-like rags-to-riches journeys. Tales of how circumstances at birth are deterministic and can only be changed by near-miracles have struck a chord with viewers at a time when upward mobility in China is low and youth unemployment high. The micro dramas often 'show people who one day are lower class and the next day become upper class -- you get so rich that you get to humiliate those who used to humiliate you,' said a 26-year-old screenwriter known by her pen name of Camille Rao. Rao recently left her poorly paid job as a junior producer in the traditional film industry for what she described as the more dynamic and less hierarchical world of micro dramas. She now writes and adapts scripts for the U.S. market. 'Social mobility is actually very difficult now. Many people perceive this as a social reality,' said Xu Ting, associate professor of Chinese language and literature at Jiangnan University. This has fueled interest in stories about billionaires and wealthy families, she added: 'Everyone desires power and wealth, so it is normal for these type of stories to be popular.' In the U.S. market, by contrast, fantasy stories about werewolves and vampires are particularly popular, several creators told Reuters. The boom in micro dramas in China has brought scrutiny from the Communist Party. Between late 2022 and early 2023, the National Radio and Television Administration regulator said it organized a 'special rectification campaign' during which it removed 25,300 micro dramas, totaling close to 1.4 million episodes, due to their 'pornographic, bloody, violent, low-brow and vulgar content.' As Chinese leader Xi Jinping promotes values such as loyalty to the Communist Party and heteronormative marriages, the state-owned China Women's News outlet in April complained that some micro dramas 'portray unequal and twisted marriage and family relationships as a common phenomenon' and 'deviate from mainstream social values.' In June, the government began requiring some creators to register micro dramas with NRTA. The regulator didn't respond to Reuters' questions for this story. Key to the commercial success of these films are plot twists that keep people paying as they scroll while commuting or in line at a grocery store. Episodes often end with a hook — such as a boyfriend walking in on his partner with another man — and viewers have to pay for the next episode to find out what happened. 'The plot of these micro dramas is exaggerated,' said Zhu, the actor. 'It has plot reversals, it's nonsensical, so it catches people's attention and a large audience wants to see them.' Zhu is a lover of cinema and an avid fan of Ingrid Bergman in 'Casablanca.' Like many of his colleagues in micro dramas, he thinks the genre has limited artistic value. 'I see it as fast food: a longer drama is a kind of sumptuous meal, and a micro drama is fast food.' But its dedicated viewers disagree. Huang Siyi, a 28-year-old customer service agent, said she enjoyed watching romantic micro dramas because 'the acting is good and the male and female leads are good-looking.' 'It's easy to be obsessed with micro dramas,' she said. Explosive growth Vertical filming and distribution through social media apps mean micro dramas can be made with small overhead costs. Budgets for such films range from between $28,000 and $280,000, according to market researcher iResearch. In the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou, 'Grandma's Moon' is being made with a compressed budget and timeline. When Reuters visited the set in July, the filming day stretched until 2 a.m. The crew then moved to a new location and began shooting again at 7 a.m. The show was shot in just six days, and Zhu, a muscular man with a wide smile and boundless energy, says he plays table tennis after hours to keep up with the young crew on set. 'We'd need to take two to three years to distribute one traditional TV series of film, but we only need three months to distribute a micro drama, saving us a lot of time,' said Zhou Yi, a showrunner at Chinese gaming giant NetEase, which also makes micro dramas. As micro dramas gain in popularity, actors' salaries have also grown. Leading roles used to pay $280 a day, said Zhu, adding that main actors in big productions can now make more than double the rate, though extras earn as little as $17 daily. A retired railway employee who started acting in the 1970s in a theater troupe attached to the unit where he worked, Zhu now lives off his pension and occasional acting gigs. Many Chinese micro drama producers have their eye on Western markets, where cultural exports from China have often struggled. NetEase last year started making productions for the U.S. that it distributes via an app called LoveShots; the made-for-export films aren't typically available in China. Micro dramas designed for the West are often made by production and acting crews in Los Angeles and shot on location. The scripts, which are in English, may also revolve around themes of wealth, cheating partners and miracles. One of the latest micro dramas on LoveShots is about a woman who, after years of being paralyzed, miraculously regains her ability to move -- and walks in on her husband cheating on her.	https://www.voanews.com/a/micro-dramas-shake-up-china-s-film-industry-aim-for-hollywood/7794473.html	2024-09-22T18:16:06-07:00	
Long-forbidden French anti-riot force sent to Martinique as thousands defy bans on protests	Mexico City — France has sent a group of special anti-riot police that's been banned for 65 years to the French Caribbean island of Martinique, where protesters have gathered despite the government barring demonstrations in parts of the island. The force arrived this weekend after the local representative of France's central government in its overseas territory said in a statement that protests were forbidden in the municipalities of Fort-de-France, Le Lamentin, Ducos and Le Robert until Monday. The government also issued a curfew. The restrictions came after violent protests broke out on the island last week over the high cost of living, with gunfire injuring at least six police officers and one civilian. Police launched tear gas and government officials said several stores were also looted. Officials said the bans were meant 'to put an end to the violence and damage committed at gatherings, as well as to the numerous obstacles to daily life and freedom of movement that penalize the entire population, particularly at weekends.' But the measure was met by defiance by many on the island, with massive peaceful protests breaking out Saturday night. Videos from local media show crowds of thousands peacefully walking along highways overnight banging on drums and waiving flags. As protests wound on without violence, the force of French anti-riot police arrived on the island and were staying at a hotel in Fort-de-France on Sunday. It wasn't immediately clear how many were sent. The elite riot police, known as the Companies for Republican Security, were banned in the French territory following bloody riots in December 1959. The unit had been accused of using disproportionate force against protesters, ending in the deaths of a number of young demonstrators. The force is rarely deployed in French territories in the Caribbean but was called on during riots and strikes in Guadeloupe in 2009. Martinique's leaders requested the forces amid the recent protests in an historic shift for the island, and one met with a sharp rejection by some in the territory. Beatrice Bellay, a representative of the socialist party on the island, blasted the move, saying: 'Martinique is not in a civil war, it is a social war.' She called for an 'open and transparent dialogue' between protesters and the government. 'This measure ... only serves to aggravate tensions and distract attention from the legitimate demands of the people of Martinique,' she wrote in a statement Sunday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/long-forbidden-french-anti-riot-force-sent-to-martinique-as-thousands-defy-bans-on-protests/7794186.html	2024-09-22T16:50:50-07:00	
California governor signs law banning all plastic shopping bags at grocery stores	Sacramento, California — 'Paper or plastic' will no longer be a choice at grocery store checkout lines in California under a new law signed Sunday by Gov. Gavin Newsom that bans all plastic shopping bags. California had already banned thin plastic shopping bags at supermarkets and other stores, but shoppers could purchase bags made with a thicker plastic that purportedly made them reusable and recyclable. The new measure, approved by state legislators last month, bans all plastic shopping bags starting in 2026. Consumers who don't bring their own bags will now simply be asked if they want a paper bag. State Sen. Catherine Blakespear, one of the bill's supporters, said people were not reusing or recycling any plastic bags. She pointed to a state study that found that the amount of plastic shopping bags trashed per person grew from 3.6 kilograms per year in 2004 to 5 kilograms per year in 2021. Blakespear, a Democrat from Encinitas, said the previous bag ban passed a decade ago didn't reduce the overall use of plastic. 'We are literally choking our planet with plastic waste,' she said in February. The environmental nonprofit Oceana applauded Newsom for signing the bill and 'safeguarding California's coastline, marine life, and communities from single-use plastic grocery bags.' Christy Leavitt, Oceana's plastics campaign director, said Sunday that the new ban on single-use plastic bags at grocery store checkouts 'solidifies California as a leader in tackling the global plastic pollution crisis.' Twelve states, including California, already have some type of statewide plastic bag ban in place, according to the environmental advocacy group Environment America Research & Policy Center. Hundreds of cities across 28 states also have their own plastic bag bans in place. The California Legislature passed its statewide ban on plastic bags in 2014. The law was later affirmed by voters in a 2016 referendum. The California Public Interest Research Group said Sunday that the new law finally meets the intent of the original bag ban. 'Plastic bags create pollution in our environment and break into microplastics that contaminate our drinking water and threaten our health,' said the group's director Jenn Engstrom. 'Californians voted to ban plastic grocery bags in our state almost a decade ago, but the law clearly needed a redo. With the governor's signature, California has finally banned plastic bags in grocery checkout lanes once and for all.' As San Francisco's mayor in 2007, Newsom signed the nation's first plastic bag ban.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-governor-signs-law-banning-all-plastic-shopping-bags-at-grocery-stores/7794183.html	2024-09-22T16:18:00-07:00	
As UN meets, Haitians express hopelessness at finding international solution to gang crisis	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — As world leaders meeting in the United Nations this week discuss the future of efforts to rein in the gangs strangling Haiti, Haitians are expressing hopelessness that an international response can turn the tide of violence. Thus far, a U.N.-backed force of 400 police from Kenya and about two dozen Jamaican officers have done little to quell the country's gangs, which have terrorized the country since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. World leaders have been discussing the next steps in a convoluted effort to restore order to the Caribbean nation. The United States has floated the idea of a U.N. peacekeeping force, but the idea was considered too controversial given the introduction of cholera and sexual abuse cases that occurred the last time U.N. troops were in Haiti. The deployment of Kenyan forces was, in part, to avoid tensions that may be sparked by sending another U.N. peacekeeping mission. But in a visit to Haiti by Kenya's President William Ruto over the weekend – on his way to the United Nations General Assembly session, which began on Sunday – Ruto said he would be open to expanding Kenya's operations into a larger U.N. peacekeeping mission. 'On the suggestion to transit this into a fully U.N. Peacekeeping mission, we have absolutely no problem with it, if that is the direction the U.N. security council wants to take,' Ruto said. While Ruto hailed the successes of the Kenyan forces on Sunday, a recent report by a UN human rights expert said gang violence is spreading across Haiti and that Haitian police still lack the 'logistical and technical capacity' to fight gangs. The ongoing violence has left Haitians like 39-year-old Mario Canteve disillusioned with further international efforts to quell the gangs, saying he no longer believes promises by world leaders that they'll be able to change anything in the crisis-stricken nation. 'No one is coming to save Haiti. Nothing is changing,' he said. 'A new mission cannot save Haiti.' Canteve sells cellphone chips and repairs electronics in the capital of Port-au-Prince, 80% of which is estimated to be controlled by gangs. Facing brutal gang violence, some Haitians have organized vigilante groups to battle the gangs themselves. Such groups speak to the lack of hope many Haitians have that an international solution can mark a shift in Haiti. Moise Jean-Pierre, a 50-year-old schoolteacher, recalled past U.N. missions in Haiti and said such efforts were a 'waste of time.' 'It would not be the first time we've had U.N. missions in Haiti,' he said. 'What difference will it make?' Sentiments on the ground speak to the bind world leaders are in as they've spent years looking for a larger solution to Haiti's woes. The current security mission is expected to reach a total of 2,500 personnel, with the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin and Chad also pledging to send police and soldiers, although it wasn't clear when that would happen. Few at the U.N. have an appetite for a larger peacekeeping mission in part due to the abuses in past missions, but also because many Haitians have an aversion to foreign interventions. Experts say three previous interventions by U.S. and the U.N. have not improved crises in Haiti. Some harbor hope that elections planned next year will pave the path to a Haitian-born solution. The country has not held general elections since 2016 as the crisis has dragged on. Last week, Haiti took its first steps in creating a provisional election council to prepare the nation for elections. Haiti still has many hurdles ahead of it to get there. Chief among them is violence. While Canteve, the cellphone chip salesman, called for unity and said 'a new mission cannot save Haiti, the children of Haiti need to save themselves,' he also expressed doubts the country was safe enough to facilitate elections. 'How can you hold an election when everything is so violent. Everyone is so violent. When police cannot even go into certain areas, what kind of election are going to get?' he asked.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-un-meets-haitians-express-hopelessness-at-finding-international-solution-to-gang-crisis/7794181.html	2024-09-22T16:07:30-07:00	
In Switzerland, voters reject plan to better protect country's biodiversity	Geneva — Switzerland, known for natural beauty like pristine lakes and majestic Alpine peaks, ranks among the world's richest countries whose plant and animal life is under the greatest threat. Environmentalists were seeking better protections for the country's biodiversity in a nationwide vote that culminated Sunday. Final official results showed more than 63% of voters casting ballots had rejected the initiative that aimed to boost public funding to encourage farmers and others to set aside lands and waterways to let the wild develop more, and increase the total area allocated for green spaces that must remain untouched by human development. The contest was decided by mail-in ballots followed by a morning of in-person voting Sunday. Factors behind the weakening biodiversity in the country of rivers, lakes, valleys and mountains include intensified agriculture, soil alteration, a fragmentation of the landscape — such as the building of roads and housing that cut through wildlife habitats — and pollution and climate change, proponents of the measure said. The federal government — parliament and the executive branch — opposed the plan, as did many rural voters and the country's main right-wing party, according to polls. They called it too costly, saying 600 million Swiss francs (over $700 million) is already spent on biodiversity protection each year, and fear economic development will suffer. Passage was estimated to cost at least another 400 million francs for national and local governments, the Federal Council estimates. The initiative would also, for example, prohibit the construction of new railway lines through protected dry meadows — even if such meadow is set aside and developed elsewhere, it says. 'Passage of the biodiversity initiative would severely limit (sustainable) energy and food production, restrict the use of forests and rural areas for tourism, and make construction more expensive,' argued the campaign for a 'no' vote on its website. 'YES to biodiversity, but NO to the extreme biodiversity initiative.' Proponents, meanwhile, pointed to dwindling natural resources in Switzerland and threats to bees, frogs, birds, mosses and other wildlife. They argued that protected green spaces are 'the main capital for tourism' and more of them would support local economies. 'Diversified nature guarantees air purity, drinkable water, pollination, fertility of the soil, and our food supply,' said a committee that backed the idea. 'But in Switzerland, biodiversity is suffering. One-third of all our plant and animal species are threatened or have already disappeared.' The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank that counts 38 mostly rich countries as members, has produced a comparative look at threats to plant and animal life. Switzerland ranks among the top four countries with the highest rates of threatened species in all eight categories of wildlife. The voting was part of the latest Swiss referendums, which take place four times a year to give voters a direct say in policymaking in the country of around 9 million people. The only other nationwide issue up for consideration this time was a pension reform plan backed by the government. More than two-thirds of voters turned down the pension reform plan, the final results showed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-switzerland-voters-reject-plan-to-better-protect-countrys-biodiversity/7794178.html	2024-09-22T15:53:40-07:00	
PM Rama says Albania to grant sovereignty to Bektashi Muslims in Tirana	Tirana, Albania — Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said Sunday his country would transform the Tirana-based Bektashi Muslims, an Islamic Sufi order, into a sovereign state to promote moderation, tolerance and peaceful coexistence. Speaking at the United Nations, Rama pointed out that Albania, a tiny Western Balkan country, saved Jewish refugees from the Nazis during World War II and sheltered Afghans after the Taliban came to power three years ago. Albanians are also proud of giving to the world Mother Teresa who 'embodied love for humanity,' he said. 'She told us that not all of us can do big things, but we can all do small things with big love,' he said. 'That is our inspiration in supporting the transformation of the World Bektashi Order into a sovereign state in our capital, Tirana, as a new center of moderation, tolerance and peaceful coexistence.' Albania's 2.4-million population is about 50% Muslim with the rest of the population Catholic and Orthodox Christians and other smaller communities. The country is known for its religious harmony and co-existence. Bektashi Muslims make up about 10% of the Muslims in the country, according to the last census. It wasn't immediately clear how the order would legally be granted sovereignty. But the Bektashi Order said it considers the move the beginning of a new era promoting global religious tolerance. 'Such a historic step aims at recognizing the Beltashi Order as a sovereign, self-governing state, committed to supporting its century-old culture of moderation and spiritual involvement,' it said in a statement. The Bektashi Order will receive sovereignty similar to that of the Vatican, governing religious and administrative issues independently of Albania, the Order said. Citizenship would be provided only to the top religious members and those individuals involved in managing the state, while the leadership will run from the head of the Bektashi, Baba Mondi, and a council that will monitor its religious and administrative operation. 'The new state will aim at nothing but the spiritual leadership,' the statement said. The Bektashi Order originated in the Ottoman Empire in the 13th century. The Bektashis acquired political importance in the 15th century, when the order dominated the Janissary Corps, the elite infantry units that formed the Ottoman sultan's household troops. After the foundation of the Turkish Republic, its leader Kemal Ataturk banned religious institutions that were not part of the Directorate of Religious Affairs and the Bektashi community's headquarters relocated to Albania, where it became involved in politics. One of its members, Ismail Qemali declared Albania's independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pm-rama-says-albania-to-grant-sovereignty-to-bektashi-muslims-in-tirana/7794166.html	2024-09-22T15:19:20-07:00

Spending deal averts a possible US federal shutdown, funds government into December	Washington — Congressional leaders announced an agreement Sunday on a short-term spending bill that will fund federal agencies for about three months, averting a possible partial government shutdown when the new budget year begins Oct. 1 and pushing final decisions until after the November election. Lawmakers have struggled to get to this point as the current budget year winds to a close at month's end. At the urging of the most conservative members of his conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson had linked temporary funding with a mandate that would have compelled states to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote. But Johnson could not get all Republicans on board even as the party's presidential nominee, Donald Trump, insisted on that package. Trump said Republican lawmakers should not support a stop-gap measure without the voting requirement, but the bill went down to defeat anyway, with 14 Republicans opposing it. Bipartisan negotiations began in earnest shortly after that, with leadership agreeing to extend funding into mid-December. That gives the current Congress the ability to fashion a full-year spending bill after the Nov. 5 election, rather than push that responsibility to the next Congress and president. In a letter to Republican colleagues, Johnson said the budget measure would be 'very narrow, bare-bones' and include 'only the extensions that are absolutely necessary.' 'While this is not the solution any of us prefer, it is the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances,' Johnson wrote. 'As history has taught and current polling affirms, shutting the government down less than 40 days from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice.' Rep. Tom Cole, the House Appropriations Committee chairman, had said on Friday that talks were going well. 'So far, nothing has come up that we can't deal with,' said Cole, R-Okla. 'Most people don't want a government shutdown and they don't want that to interfere with the election. So nobody is like, ‘I’ve got to have this or we're walking.' It's just not that way.' Johnson's earlier effort had no chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate and was opposed by the White House, but it did give the speaker a chance to show Trump and conservatives within his conference that he fought for their request. The final result — government funding effectively on autopilot — was what many had predicted. With the election just weeks away, few lawmakers in either party had any appetite for the brinksmanship that often leads to a shutdown. Now a bipartisan majority is expected to push the short-term measure over the finish line. Temporary spending bills generally fund agencies at current levels, but some additional money was included to bolster the Secret Service, replenish a disaster relief fund and aid with the presidential transition, among other things.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spending-deal-averts-a-possible-us-federal-shutdown-funds-government-into-december/7794149.html	2024-09-22T14:46:08-07:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy visits Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank workers	Scranton, Pennsylvania — Under extraordinarily tight security, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday visited the Pennsylvania ammunition factory that is producing one of the most critically needed munitions for his country's fight to fend off Russian ground forces. His visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant kicked off a busy week in the United States to shore up support for Ukraine in the war. He will speak at the U.N. General Assembly annual gathering in New York on Tuesday and Wednesday and then travel to Washington for talks on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. As Zelenskyy's large motorcade made its way to the ammunition plant on Sunday afternoon, a small contingent of supporters waving Ukrainian flags assembled nearby to show their appreciation for his visit to thank the workers. The area around the ammunition plant had been sealed off since the morning, with municipal garbage trucks positioned across several roadblocks and a very heavy presence of city, regional and state police, including troopers on horseback. The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture 155 mm artillery shells and has increased production over the past year. The 155 mm shells are used in howitzer systems, which are towed large guns with long barrels that can fire at various angles. Howitzers can strike targets up to 24 kilometers to 32 kilometers away and are highly valued by ground forces to take out enemy targets from a protected distance. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of the 155 mm shells from the U.S. 'It's unfortunate that we need a plant like this, but it's here, and it's here to protect the world,' said Vera Kowal Krewsun, a first-generation Ukrainian American who was among those who greeted Zelenskyy's motorcade. 'And I strongly feel that way.' She said many of her friends' parents have worked in the ammunition plant, and she called Zelenskyy's visit 'a wonderful thing.' Laryssa Salak, 60, whose parents also immigrated from Ukraine, also said she was pleased Zelenskyy came to thank the workers. She said it upsets her that funding for Ukraine's defense has divided Americans and that even some of her friends oppose the support, saying the money should go to help Americans instead. 'But they don't understand that that money does not directly go to Ukraine, Salak said. 'It goes to American factories that manufacture, like here, like the ammunition. So that money goes to American workers as well. And a lot of people don't understand that.' With the war now well into its third year, Zelenskyy has been pushing the U.S. for permission to use longer range missile systems to fire deeper inside of Russia. So far he has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would be 'at war' with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. At one point in the war, Ukraine was firing between 6,000 and 8,000 of the 155 mm shells per day. That rate started to deplete U.S. stockpiles and drew concern that the level on hand was not enough to sustain U.S. military needs if another major conventional war broke out, such as in a potential conflict over Taiwan. In response the U.S. has invested in restarting production lines and is now manufacturing more than 40,000 155 mm rounds a month, with plans to hit 100,000 rounds a month. Two of the Pentagon leaders who have pushed that increased production through — Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology, and Bill LaPlante, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer — were expected to join Zelenskyy at the plant, as was Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. The 155 mm rounds are just one of the scores of ammunition, missile, air defense and advanced weapons systems the U.S. has provided Ukraine — everything from small arms bullets to advanced F-16 fighter jets. The U.S. has been the largest donor to Ukraine, providing more than $56 billion of the more than $106 billion NATO and partner countries have collected to aid in its defense. Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, commitment to its defense is seen by many of the European nations as a must to keep Putin from further military aggression that could threaten bordering NATO-member countries and result in a much larger conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-zelenskyy-visits-pennsylvania-ammunition-factory-to-thank-workers/7794139.html	2024-09-22T14:18:49-07:00	
Republicans in swing states say they see scant signs of groups door-knocking for Trump	Lansing, Michigan — Republican activists in swing states say they have seen little sign of the teams tasked with knocking on doors and turning out infrequent voters on behalf of Donald Trump, raising concerns about the party's presidential nominee relying on outside groups for an important part of his campaign operations. Trump and the Republican National Committee he controls opted to share get-out-the-vote duties in key parts of the most competitive states this year with groups such as America PAC, the organization supported by billionaire Elon Musk. It is difficult to demonstrate that something is not happening. But with fewer than 50 days until the Nov. 5 election, dozens of Republican officials, activists and operatives in Michigan, North Carolina and other battleground states say they have rarely or never witnessed the group's canvassers. In Arizona and Nevada, the Musk-backed political action committee replaced its door-knocking company just this past week. 'I haven't seen anybody,' said Nate Wilkowski, field director for the Republican Party in vote-rich Oakland County, Michigan, which includes crucial Detroit suburbs. He was speaking specifically of America PAC. 'Nobody's given me a heads-up that they're around in Oakland County areas.' Trump has relied on the loyalty of his fervent base, in an election expected to pivot on turnout. The spotty evidence, however, of what was portrayed as a sophisticated operation has some party activists questioning the operation's value. Trump's campaign views the race with Vice President Kamala Harris as a toss-up among likely voters but believes it has the edge among people who stayed away in 2016 and 2020, making it even more essential to reach them. The work is particularly important in Michigan, where Trump lost by fewer than 160,000 votes in 2020, and where the Republican Party began the year mired in debt and fighting an ugly contest over the rightful state party leader. Michigan's Republican chairman, Pete Hoekstra, said he was told that America PAC canvassers had arrived in late August and were at work. A spokesperson for the PAC said canvassers were in Michigan, as well as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — the seven most competitive states. The spokesperson declined to say how many canvassers there were across the states. Meghan Reckling, a Republican canvassing firm owner in Michigan, said she spotted two America PAC canvassers Tuesday in Oakland County. Identifiable in blue polo shirts emblazoned with 'America,' they were working an area that Reckling's own data showed to be one with low-propensity voters, she said. 'They had, you could tell, a very pleasant exchange with the lady who answered the door, and probably talked to her for five minutes,' Reckling said. 'From what I observed, they were obviously engaging in direct conversations.' But in interviews with more than two dozen activists and party officials across the seven battleground states, such reports were rare. 'I don't know what the PACs are doing,' said Mark Forton, the Republican chair in Macomb County, Michigan, a populous, suburban area northeast of Detroit. 'I don't know if they are going door to door.' Trump aides say the campaign has an estimated 30,000 volunteer captains who are identifying less likely voters at the local level, including through neighborhood canvassing. Campaign political director James Blair also estimates that close to 2,500 paid canvassers, with America PAC making up a significant chunk, are working in the seven states. The PAC has paid canvassing firms more than $14 million since mid-August for work on the presidential campaign, according to Federal Election Commission spending reports filed by the group. Blair dismissed the statement that the campaign was ceding work to outside groups. Instead, he said, the campaign was making use of 'the resources within those groups to bolster the frequency of contacts and the total coverage within the universe of where we would want them.' 'We very much are focused on low-propensity voters, because it's what makes strategically the most sense in terms of how the president is going to win these states, and these groups' efforts have helped reach them,' Blair said. America PAC is run by former top aides to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' failed presidential campaign. Trump's team also is sharing the responsibility of reaching less-frequent voters with groups that include Turning Point USA, led by conservative millennial personality Charlie Kirk, and the Faith and Freedom Coalition, headed by Christian conservative figure Ralph Reed. Part of the reason for the campaign's move was the result of an FEC ruling this year that a candidate's campaign and outside groups could coordinate their canvassing efforts with super PACs, and specifically share voter lists and data that they collect door to door. It means campaigns could share much of their labor- and cost-heavy ground efforts with groups that can take unlimited donations. Harris' outreach on the ground in the seven states is being led by campaign-paid staff, a number the campaign puts at nearly 2,200 in more than 328 offices. Campaign aides said groups affiliated with labor organizations were canvassing independent of the campaign. The vast majority of what outside groups that support Harris are doing is advertising. Based on ad reservations for Harris and the leading super PAC supporting her, they are on track to spend nearly $175 million more than Trump's campaign and the leading super PACs supporting him by Election Day. Harris' campaign has outspent Trump's on advertising by 2-to-1 since she entered the race on July 23, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Over the past week, there were complications for America PAC, the most high-profile of the groups helping Trump in 2024. America PAC fired Nevada-based canvassing company September Group, according to two people familiar with the matter. America PAC had paid the company almost $2.7 million a month ago, according to FEC reports. The people familiar with September Group's dismissal spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private business decisions. A spokesman for America PAC declined to confirm the move. Trump is not the first candidate to delegate some typical campaign-managed duties to outside groups. But the arrangement has not gone smoothly for some of the others who have tried it. Last year, DeSantis entrusted much of the political outreach for his Republican presidential campaign to a super PAC called Never Back Down, with conflict between its board and top campaign personnel late in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses. Despite starting the campaign with roughly $100 million, DeSantis dropped out after losing the first contest in Iowa. In his unsuccessful quest for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush attempted something very similar, ceding much of the political infrastructure work to a super PAC called Right to Rise, which raised more than $114 million in 2015.	https://www.voanews.com/a/republicans-in-swing-states-say-they-see-scant-signs-of-groups-door-knocking-for-trump/7794135.html	2024-09-22T14:00:08-07:00	
On New York visit, India's Modi celebrates cultural ties	Uniondale, New York — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, continuing a multiday U.S. visit, addressed a cultural celebration on Long Island Sunday, where he praised the United States' return of nearly 300 antiquities to India and relayed news of his country's dual win at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest, Hungary, to an enthusiastic crowd. 'I just got some very good news,' Modi told an estimated 13,000 people inside Nassau Veterans Coliseum for an event billed as a celebration of cultural ties between India and the United States. 'In the Chess Olympiad, in both the men's and women's tournament, India has won gold medals,' he said to applause in a speech that was translated into English for an online audience. Modi was reelected in June following a marathon election in which more than 640 million votes were cast over a span of six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise. 'This year, 2024, is a very important one for the entire world,' he said. 'On the one hand, there are conflicts raging between several countries in the world, there is tension. And on the other, democracy is being celebrated in several countries of the world. India and America are also together in this celebration of democracy.' Modi's appearance in New York came a day after he attended a summit hosted by President Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware, for leaders of the so-called Quad that also included Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan. Also Saturday, Modi accepted the return of 297 antiquities spanning thousands of years that had been stolen or trafficked from India. The U.S. has returned nearly 600 such cultural artifacts to India since 2016, according to India's Ministry of External Affairs. On Monday, the prime minister is expected to attend a United Nations summit in advance of this week's General Assembly. Sunday's event was sponsored by the not-for-profit Indo American Community of USA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-new-york-visit-india-s-modi-celebrates-cultural-ties/7794129.html	2024-09-22T13:39:38-07:00	
US to propose ban on Chinese software, hardware in connected vehicles, sources say	Washington — The U.S. Commerce Department is expected on Monday to propose prohibiting Chinese software and hardware in connected and autonomous vehicles on American roads due to national security concerns, two sources told Reuters. The Biden administration has raised serious concerns about the collection of data by Chinese companies on U.S. drivers and infrastructure as well as the potential foreign manipulation of vehicles connected to the internet and navigation systems. The proposed regulation would ban the import and sale of vehicles from China with key communications or automated driving system software or hardware, said the two sources, who declined to be identified because the decision had not been publicly disclosed. The move is a significant escalation in the United States' ongoing restrictions on Chinese vehicles, software and components. Last week, the Biden administration locked in steep tariff hikes on Chinese imports, including a 100% duty on electric vehicles as well as new hikes on EV batteries and key minerals. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in May the risks of Chinese software or hardware in connected U.S. vehicles were significant. 'You can imagine the most catastrophic outcome theoretically if you had a couple million cars on the road and the software were disabled,' she said. President Joe Biden in February ordered an investigation into whether Chinese vehicle imports pose national security risks over connected-car technology -- and if that software and hardware should be banned in all vehicles on U.S. roads. 'China's policies could flood our market with its vehicles, posing risks to our national security,' Biden said earlier. 'I’m not going to let that happen on my watch.' The Commerce Department plans to give the public 30 days to comment before any finalization of the rules, the sources said. Nearly all newer vehicles on U.S. roads are considered 'connected.' Such vehicles have onboard network hardware that allows internet access, allowing them to share data with devices both inside and outside the vehicle. The department also plans to propose making the prohibitions on software effective in the 2027 model year and the ban on hardware would take effect in January 2029 or the 2030 model year. The prohibitions in question would include vehicles with certain Bluetooth, satellite and wireless features as well as highly autonomous vehicles that could operate without a driver behind the wheel. A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers in November raised alarm about Chinese auto and tech companies collecting and handling sensitive data while testing autonomous vehicles in the United States. The prohibitions would extend to other foreign U.S. adversaries, including Russia, the sources said. A trade group representing major automakers including General Motors, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai and others had warned that changing hardware and software would take time. The carmakers noted their systems 'undergo extensive pre-production engineering, testing, and validation processes and, in general, cannot be easily swapped with systems or components from a different supplier.' The Commerce Department declined to comment on Saturday. Reuters first reported, in early August, details of a plan that would have the effect of barring the testing of autonomous vehicles by Chinese automakers on U.S. roads. There are relatively few Chinese-made light-duty vehicles imported into the United States. The White House on Thursday signed off on the final proposal, according to a government website. The rule is aimed at ensuring the security of the supply chain for U.S. connected vehicles. It will apply to all vehicles on U.S. roads, but not for agriculture or mining vehicles, the sources said. Biden noted that most cars are connected like smartphones on wheels, linked to phones, navigation systems, critical infrastructure and to the companies that made them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-propose-ban-on-chinese-software-hardware-in-connected-vehicles-sources-say/7794115.html	2024-09-22T13:16:40-07:00	
Angry French cognac makers see red over Chinese tariffs threat	Cognac, France — Frustrated cognac producers in southwestern France are growing increasingly anxious over the looming threat of Chinese tariffs on European brandy, a move industry representatives worry could force French liquor from the Chinese market. Some 800 protesters riding on tractors and carrying signs gathered in France's southwestern town of Cognac this week demanding a delay to an upcoming European Union vote to impose duties on Chinese electric vehicles. This protest -- the first since 1998 -- comes after Beijing refused to rule out future tariffs following an anti-dumping investigation into brandy imported from the European Union. The probe was launched months after the EU undertook an investigation into Chinese electric vehicle (EV) subsidies. And with the EU set to vote next week on introducing tariffs on Chinese EVs, France's brandy makers are worried about the consequences that vote could have on their livelihood. 'The situation is urgent,' said Anthony Brun, the union head for Cognac's brandy makers, adding that a decision to levy tariffs on Chinese EVs 'will jeopardize the entire industry.' Cognac's interprofessional association BNIC said it was recently notified that China intends to impose tariffs of around 35% on European brandy, a move seen as targeting France. This comes despite repeated assurances from Beijing it would not implement provisional tariffs after it found European brandy had been dumped into China, threatening the country's domestic industry with 'substantial damage.' 'For a year now, we have been warning French and European authorities about this risk and the need to stop this downward spiral,' wrote Brun in a letter addressed to new French Prime Minister Michel Barnier about the tariff threat. 'We are the victims without being in any way responsible. ... We have not been listened to,' Brun said, writing on behalf of the cognac union. In May, French President Emmanuel Macron thanked his Chinese counterpart for not imposing customs duties on French cognac amid the probe, presenting Xi Jinping with bottles of the expensive drink. But cooperating with Chinese authorities has produced 'no results' and incurred millions in costs, said Florent Morillon, head of BNIC. Tariffs could force French brandy to 'disappear from the Chinese market,' which accounts for a quarter of exports, added Morillon. The threat of losing the Chinese market could be existential for some brandy makers, who count on overseas consumers for up to 60% of their profits. China imported more brandy than any other spirit in 2022, with most of it coming from France, according to a report by research group Daxue Consulting. Cognac producers are calling on the EU to postpone its September 25 vote on imposing tariffs on EVs imported from China, fearing China will respond with customs duties on European brandy. 'We have no way out,' said Rodolphe Texier, a member of a farmers' union in France's western Charente region. 'If Europe doesn't follow us, we're dead,' said Texier, adding he is concerned about widespread repercussions throughout the industry which could impact everyone from distillers to barrel makers to truck drivers. With more than 4,400 farms and some 85,000 jobs, France's cognac industry is already in trouble after it saw a 22% drop in sales in 2023 and dramatically reduced new vine planting zones. France's brandy makers are not the only ones under pressure, as Beijing launched a probe into EU subsidiaries on some dairy products in August. Even though a meeting is set 'in principle' between BNIC and the prime minister's office, Florent Morillon told AFP there is a feeling of being 'taken hostage' by Paris and Brussels. 'The French and European authorities have decided to sacrifice us,' wrote union head Anthony Brun. 'Never mind our jobs, our weight in the local economy, our contribution to trade, and to France's image,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/angry-french-cognac-makers-see-red-over-chinese-tariffs-threat/7794107.html	2024-09-22T13:02:35-07:00	
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice' scares off 'Transformers' for third week as box office No. 1	Los Angeles — It's a three-peat for 'Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.' The Tim Burton legacy sequel to his 1988 horror comedy topped the North American box office charts for the third straight weekend with $26 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. It edged out the animated new release 'Transformers: One,' which brought in $25 million. The Optimus Prime origin story from Paramount Pictures features the voices of Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry and Scarlett Johansson. 'Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,' a Warner Bros. release with Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder returning as stars, has earned more than $226 million domestically in its three weeks after a monster opening of $110 million — the third best of the year — and a second weekend of $51.6 million. Third place went to the James McAvoy horror 'Speak No Evil,' which came in at $5.9 million in its second week for a total of $21.5 million. On the whole, the box office was in a quiet phase that is expected to break when ' Joker: Folie à Deux ' dances its way onto the big screen on Oct. 4. The year's second-highest grosser ' Deadpool & Wolverine ' remained in the top 5 in its ninth weekend with another $3.9 million and a domestic total of $627 million. Only Pixar's 'Inside Out 2' has earned more. The Demi Moore-starring, Coralie Fargeat-directed body horror 'The Substance,' which made a splash at the Cannes Film Festival, brought in $3.1 million on limited screens in its first weekend for the sixth spot. The Daily Wire movie 'Am I Racist?' — in which conservative columnist Matt Walsh goes undercover as a 'DEI trainee' — stayed in the top 10 after a fourth place finish last week, earning $2.9 million for seventh place and a two-week total of $9 million.

Iran arrests 12 people for collaborating with Israel, Revolutionary Guards say	Dubai, UAE — Iran's Revolutionary Guards said on Sunday that 12 people had been arrested for being operatives collaborating with Israel and planning acts against Iran's security. 'As the Zionist regime (Israel) and their Western backers, most notably the United States, have not succeeded in their sinister goals against the people of Gaza and Lebanon, they are now seeking to spread the crisis to Iran with a series of actions planned against our country's security,' the statement said. Tensions in the Middle East have shot up since thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Lebanon's Hezbollah members exploded in an attack widely blamed on Israel. Hezbollah and Israel have exchanged some of the heaviest cross-border fire in a conflict running in parallel to the almost year-long Gaza war. The Revolutionary Guards added that members of the network of 12 operatives were arrested in six different Iranian provinces, but did not say when. In late July, the political leader of Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in Tehran in an assassination blamed on Israel by Iranian authorities. Israel has made no claim of responsibility.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-arrests-12-people-for-collaborating-with-israel-revolutionary-guards-say/7794090.html	2024-09-22T12:26:39-07:00

Wall St week ahead - Investor focus turns to data, election, earnings after Fed cut	NEW YORK — A roaring rally in U.S. stocks will face a gauntlet of economic data, looming political uncertainty and a corporate earnings test in coming weeks as investors navigate one of the most volatile periods of the year for equity markets. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX last week hit its first closing all-time high in two months after the Federal Reserve unveiled a hefty 50-basis point rate cut, kicking off the first U.S. monetary easing cycle since 2020. The index is up 0.8% so far in September, historically the weakest month for stocks, and has gained 19% year-to-date. But the rocky period could carry over until the Nov 5 election, strategists said, leaving the S&P 500 vulnerable to market swings. 'We're entering that period where seasonality has been a bit less favorable,' said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. 'Despite the excitement about the start of the new rate-cutting cycle, it could still be a bumpy road ahead.' The second half of September is historically the weakest two-week period of the year for the S&P 500, according to a Ned Davis Research analysis of data since 1950. The index has also logged an average 0.45% decline in October during presidential years, data from CFRA going back to 1945 showed. Volatility also tends to pick up in October in election years, with the Cboe Market Volatility index .VIX rising to an average level of 25 at the start of the month, as opposed to its long-term average of 19.2, according to an Edward Jones analysis of the past eight presidential election years. The VIX was recently at 16.4. The market could be particularly sensitive to this year's close election between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. Recent polls show a virtually tied race. 'Unless the data deteriorates considerably, we think U.S . elections will start to be more at the forefront,' UBS equity derivative strategists said in a note. Investors are also looking for data to support expectations that the economy is navigating a 'soft landing,' during which inflation moderates without badly hurting growth. Stocks fare much better after the start of rate cuts in such a scenario, as opposed to when the Fed cuts during recessions. The coming week includes reports on manufacturing, consumer confidence and durable goods, as well as the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation measure. Attention will be squarely on employment after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank wanted to stay ahead of any weakening in the job market as the Fed announced its cut last week. The closely-watched monthly U.S. jobs report is due on Oct 4. 'We're going to have hyper-focus on anything that speaks to the strength of the labor force,' said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. Meanwhile, the rally in stocks has pushed up valuations. The S&P 500 has a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.4 times expected 12-month earnings, well above its long-term average of 15.7, according to LSEG Datastream. With the scope for valuations to go higher now more limited, investors said that puts a greater burden on corporate earnings to be strong in order to support stock gains. Third-quarter reporting season kicks off next month. S&P 500 earnings for the period are expected to have climbed 5.4% from the prior year, and then jump nearly 13% in the fourth quarter, according to LSEG IBES. FedEx FDX.N shares tumbled on Friday after the delivery giant reported a steep quarterly profit drop and lowered its full-year revenue forecast. 'Extended multiples put pressure on macro data and fundamentals to support S&P 500 prices,' Scott Chronert, head of U.S. equity strategy at Citi, said in a report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wall-st-week-ahead---investor-focus-turns-to-data-election-earnings-after-fed-cut-/7793887.html	2024-09-22T10:45:03-07:00

Classes resume at Bangladesh university at heart of protests	Dhaka, Bangladesh — Students returned to classes at Bangladesh's Dhaka University on Sunday after a weeks-long shutdown sparked by a student-led uprising that toppled autocratic prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Tens of thousands demonstrated on campus and in the surrounding Shahbagh neighborhood as protests against job quotas morphed into a nationwide struggle to end Hasina's 15 years of iron-fisted rule. As the protests swelled in July, authorities shuttered the campus as part of a crackdown on the demonstrations that killed hundreds. Several of the top student protest leaders were enrolled at the university, some of whom were snatched by plainclothes police and held in custody for several days. On Sunday the lecture halls were full again, with students chatting in groups along tree-covered walkways and buying drinks and snacks at canteens. 'I feel so much better coming back to class after a long time,' said Arpita Das, who studies political science. 'It was like a new students' reception as our teacher welcomed us in class with flowers.' Das said she was present during a pitched battle on campus in July, when protesters and students backing Hasina's Awami League party fought each other with rocks, sticks and iron rods. 'We were used to the routine of going to classes, study and exams,' she said. 'We were in so much uncertainty about whether we could resume class again and complete our studies,' she added. Classes had started again in all but four or five departments said assistant proctor Mohammad Mahbub Quaisar, who was appointed after previous administrators loyal to Hasina resigned. 'Students are attending in a joyous mood,' he said. Hasina's government was accused of widespread abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killing of political rivals. More than 600 people were killed in the weeks leading up to Hasina's ouster in early August, according to a preliminary United Nations report that said the toll was 'likely an underestimate.' Since her departure for exile in neighboring India, cabinet ministers and other senior members of Hasina's party have been arrested, and her government's appointees have been purged from courts and the central bank. In the leafy streets of the Shahbagh neighborhood, colorful new murals exhort the public to 'destroy the iron doors of prison' and celebrate Bangladesh's 'rebirth.' 'It was like we were in an oppressive era when we could not say anything,' said masters student Kalimulla Al Kafi, 25, of the crackdown ordered by Hasina. 'Today it feels like I am attending classes with freedom.' 'We can express ourselves freely.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/classes-resume-at-bangladesh-university-at-heart-of-protests-/7793994.html	2024-09-22T09:20:28-07:00	
Deadly bomb hits Pakistan police escorting convoy of foreign diplomats	Islamabad — A roadside bomb detonated near a convoy of foreign diplomats visiting Pakistan's scenic Swat district Sunday, killing at least one police officer and injuring several others. Police officials in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the district is located, confirmed the casualties, saying the victims were part of the squad leading the convoy of about a dozen countries. They noted that all the foreign dignitaries were unharmed. The foreigners were mostly ambassadors from Russia, Portugal, Iran, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Turkmenistan, Vietnam, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. 'All the ambassadors remained safe in the attack and had been shifted to a safe place before their departure to Islamabad,' said Mohammad Ali Gandapur, a senior provincial police officer. In a late evening statement, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry reported that 'the group of diplomats has returned safely to Islamabad.' Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s office stated that he condemned the attack as a 'cowardly terrorist' act. Russian Ambassador Albert Khorev’s office in Islamabad confirmed his presence in the convoy, along with several other ambassadors, saying they took part in a tourism summit in Swat. 'On the way to the hotel from the town of Mingora in Khyber-Pakhtunkwa, an escort vehicle hit a mine. Several policemen were injured, [but] diplomats were not harmed,' the Russian embassy wrote on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. No group claimed responsibility for Sunday’s rare attack in Swat, a former stronghold of the Terik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, an Islamist insurgent militant group waging deadly attacks against military and police forces in the province and elsewhere in the country. Pakistani Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, a resident of Swat, was shot and seriously wounded by TTP militants in 2012, apparently in retaliation for her campaign to promote girls’ education in the largely conservative district. Malala was swiftly airlifted to Britain for treatment. TTP’s intensified attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which borders Afghanistan, have killed more than 100 police and an equal number of civilians since the start of the year. Pakistan alleges that the extremist group is orchestrating the violence from Afghan sanctuaries and is being facilitated by Taliban rulers of the neighboring country. The Taliban government in Kabul, which is officially not recognized by any country, rejects the allegations, saying no foreign group, including TTP, is being allowed to use Afghan soil against other countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-bomb-hits-pakistan-police-escorting-convoy-of-foreign-diplomats-/7793957.html	2024-09-22T08:50:00-07:00

More shelter beds and a crackdown on tents mean fewer homeless encampments in San Francisco	SAN FRANCISCO — Sidewalks once teeming with tents, tarps and people passed out next to heaps of trash have largely disappeared from great swaths of San Francisco, a city widely known for its visible homeless population. The number of people sleeping outdoors dropped to under 3,000 in January, the lowest the city has recorded in a decade, according to a federal count. And that figure has likely dropped even lower since Mayor London Breed — a Democrat in a difficult reelection fight this November — started ramping up enforcement of anti-camping laws in August following a U.S. Supreme Court decision. Homelessness in no way has gone away, and in fact grew 7%, to 8,300 in January, according to the same federal count. But the problem is now notably out of the public eye, raising the question of where people have gone and whether the change marks a turning point in a crisis long associated with San Francisco. 'We’re seeing much cleaner sidewalks,' said Terry Asten Bennett, owner of Cliff’s Variety store in the city’s historically gay Castro neighborhood, adding that she hates to see homeless people shuffled around. 'But also, as a business owner, I need clean, inviting streets to encourage people to come and shop and visit our city,' she said. Advocates for homeless people say encampment sweeps that force people off the streets are an easy way to hide homelessness from public view. 'Shelter should always be transitional,' said Lukas Illa, an organizer with San Francisco's Coalition on Homelessness. 'We shouldn’t have folks be in there as the long-lasting solution.' Other California cities have also reported a drop in visible homelessness, thanks to improved outreach and more temporary housing. The beach city of Santa Cruz reported a 49% decline in people sleeping unsheltered this year, while Los Angeles recorded a 10% drop. San Francisco has increased the number of shelter beds and permanent supportive housing units by more than 50% over the past six years. At the same time, city officials are on track to eclipse the nearly 500 sweeps conducted last year, with Breed prioritizing bus tickets out of the city for homeless people and authorizing police to do more to stamp out tents. San Francisco police have issued at least 150 citations for illegal lodging since Aug. 1, surpassing the 60 citations over the entire previous three years. City crews also have removed more than 1,200 tents and structures. Tracking homeless people is extremely difficult and where all the people once living on San Francisco’s streets have gone is impossible to know. There are still people sleeping on sidewalks, some with just a blanket, and tents continue to crop up under freeway overpasses and more isolated corners of the city. But tents that once sprouted outside libraries and subway stations, and went on endlessly for blocks in the Mission, downtown and South of Market districts, are gone. Even the troubled Tenderloin district has seen progress. Steven Burcell, who became homeless a year ago after a shoulder injury cost him his job, moved into one of 60 new, tiny cabins in May after the car he was living in caught fire. Mission Cabins is a new type of emergency shelter that offers privacy and allows pets. But like all shelters, it has rules. No drugs, weapons or outside guests are allowed. Residents must consent to their rooms being searched. 'At the beginning, it was rough, you know, going in and just getting adjusted to being searched and having them look through your bags,' acknowledged Burcell, 51. His tidy 65-square-foot (6-square-meter) room contains a twin bed, pairs of shoes lined by a door that locks and opens onto a sunny courtyard that, on a recent morning, was filled with the voices of children playing at the elementary school next door. 'To have your own space inside here and close the door, not sharing anything with anybody,' he said, 'it’s huge.' But Burcell opposes encampment sweeps. He said two friends rejected beds because they thought — inaccurately, he said — the shelter would be infested with rodents. That did not stop crews from taking their tent and everything inside it. 'Now they have nothing. They don’t have any shelter at all,' he said. 'They just kind of wander around and take buses, like a lot of people do.' Since 2018, San Francisco has added 1,800 emergency shelter beds and nearly 5,000 permanent supportive housing units, where people pay 30% of their income toward rent and the rest is subsidized, bringing the total to more than 4,200 beds and 14,000 units. Breed, who first won office in June 2018, can claim credit for the expansion, although some plans were in place before she became mayor and her administration had huge financial help. The money came from the federal government battling the pandemic and a California governor — and onetime San Francisco mayor — who made fighting homelessness and tent encampments his priority. Gov. Gavin Newsom has pumped at least $24 billion into the effort since taking office in 2019, including a program to turn hotels into housing. San Francisco also benefited from a controversial 2018 wealth tax on the city’s tech titans that Breed opposed, saying companies would leave. There was no exodus and the pandemic overshadowed any fallout. The funds have helped get people off the streets and tripled the annual budget of the San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing from nearly $300 million in 2018 to $850 million this year. But the department's budget is expected to dip below $700 million next year, and that worries experts who say more is needed in a city where the median price of a home is $1.4 million. 'We still have a housing market that is way too expensive for way too many people. And as long as that continues to be the case, we’re going to see folks falling into homelessness,' said Alex Visotzky, a policy fellow with the National Alliance to End Homelessness. Advocates for the homeless say that's why city officials need to invest in more affordable housing. One such place is 835 Turk Street, a former hotel the city purchased and reopened two years ago as supportive housing. It's home to David Labogin, who lost his housing after his mother died. 'Of course, things could be a whole lot better,' he said, sitting on a single bed, 'but from where I came from, I got no complaints.' But housing takes longer to build, and converting old properties is not cheap. The city purchased 835 Turk for $25 million and spent $18 million — twice the estimated amount — rehabilitating it. Until then, shelters are adapting, accommodating couples and people with pets. It takes new residents about two weeks to adjust to the rules at Mission Cabins, said Steve Good, CEO of operator Five Keys. 'A few rules to keep them safe is better than living on the street, where there aren’t any rules,' he said. 'Amen,' said Patrick Richardson, 54, who stopped by to watch as Good was interviewed. He was on his way to a two-year college in Oakland where he is studying to be an X-ray technician. Richardson had been sleeping on couches and pavement when an outreach worker offered him a cabin. His new home, he said, 'rescued me.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-shelter-beds-and-a-crackdown-on-tents-mean-fewer-homeless-encampments-in-san-francisco-/7793900.html	2024-09-22T07:19:50-07:00	
Russian strike on Ukraine's Kharkiv wounds 21	Kharkiv, Ukraine — A Russian strike on a residential neighborhood in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv wounded 21 people including three minors, the regional governor said Sunday. Oleg Synegubov posted on Telegram that eight of the victims were hospitalized, two in critical condition, after the strike late Saturday, when dozens of people were asleep in the two multistory buildings that were hit. Russia has repeatedly targeted Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, near the Russian border in the country's east that counted 1.4 million inhabitants before Moscow launched its war in February 2022. Rescue workers used torches to search through the rubble, while one girl shook with sobs and held fast to a corridor wall, too scared to descend the stairs, and calling for her mother, an AFP reporter saw at the scene. A rescuer took her by the hand, saying, 'Everything is OK,' and guided her down to her mother, Oleksandra. 'It has just blown up. It's terrible in there, the place is a wreck,' she said. The city's mayor, Igor Terekhov, said at the site that 'As you can see, there are no military here.' 'Every day and every night Kharkiv suffers the hits,' he said. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the attack showed why his forces needed to use weapons supplied by Western allies to strike deeper into Russian territory, which, so far, they have refused. 'We must reinforce our capabilities to better protect lives and ensure our security,' he said in a statement ahead of a U.S. trip this week, where he will address the U.N. General Assembly and hold talks in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-strike-on-ukraine-s-kharkiv-wounds-21-/7793797.html	2024-09-22T03:17:08-07:00	
Sri Lanka's Dissanayake and Premadasa head to presidential race runoff	COLOMBO, SRI LANKA — Marxist-leaning Anura Kumara Dissanayake and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa headed to a run-off for Sri Lanka's presidency on Sunday, the election body said, with a second round of counting to determine the winner using preferential votes. It is the first time in Sri Lanka's history that the presidential race is to be decided by a second round of counting after the top two candidates failed to win the mandatory 50% of votes to be declared winner. All remaining candidates, including incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, have been disqualified, the Election Commission told reporters. Dissanayake polled 39.5% of the counted ballots with Premadasa finishing second at 34%. Wickremesinghe, who led the heavily indebted nation's fragile economic recovery from a debilitating crisis in 2022, trailed in third with 17%. This is Sri Lanka's first election since the Indian Ocean nation's economy buckled in 2022 under a severe foreign exchange shortage, leaving it unable to pay for imports of essentials including fuel, medicine and cooking gas. Protests forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee and later resign. 'The election result clearly shows the uprising that we witnessed in 2022 is not over,' said Pradeep Peiris, a political scientist at University of Colombo. 'People have voted in line with those aspirations to have different political practices and political institutions. AKD (as Dissanayake is known) reflects these aspirations and people have rallied around him.' Dissanayake, 55, presented himself as the candidate of change for those reeling under austerity measures linked to a $2.9 billion International Monetary Fund bailout, promising to dissolve parliament within 45 days of taking office for a fresh mandate for his policies in general elections. He has worried investors with a manifesto pledging to slash taxes in the island nation, which could impact IMF fiscal targets, and a $25 billion debt rework. But during the campaign, he took a more conciliatory approach, saying any changes would be undertaken in consultation with the IMF and that he was committed to ensuring repayment of debt. Premadasa also pledged to renegotiate the contours of the IMF deal. Grinding poverty for millions Buttressed by the IMF deal, Sri Lanka's economy has posted a tentative recovery. It is expected to grow this year for the first time in three years and inflation has collapsed to 0.5% from a crisis peak of 70%. But the continued high cost of living was a critical issue for many voters, and millions remain mired in poverty, with many pinning hopes of a better future on the next leader. Voting was peaceful, although police declared a curfew across the island nation until noon (0630 GMT) as a precaution while vote counting continued. About 75% of the 17 million eligible voters cast their ballots, according to the commission. Dissanayake, known for stirring speeches, ran as a candidate for the National People's Power alliance, which includes his Marxist-leaning Janatha Vimukthi Peremuna party. Traditionally, Dissanayake's party has backed stronger state intervention, lower taxes and more closed market economic policies. Although JVP has just three seats in parliament, Dissanayake was boosted by his promises of tough anti-corruption measures and more pro-poor policies. He drew big crowds at rallies, calling on Sri Lankans to leave behind the suffering of the crisis. Premadasa, 57, entered politics after his father, President Ranasinghe Premadasa, was killed in a suicide bombing in 1993. The younger Premadasa polled 42% of the votes in 2019 to finish second, behind Rajapaksa, in the last presidential election. Premadasa's center-left party has promised tax changes to reduce living costs. Support from farming communities in north and central Sri Lanka helped him close the gap on Dissanayake as counting progressed. The winner will have to ensure Sri Lanka sticks with the IMF program until 2027 to get its economy on a stable growth path, reassure markets, repay debt, attract investors and help a quarter of its people climb out of poverty.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-s-dissanayake-and-premadasa-head-to-presidential-race-runoff/7793790.html	2024-09-22T02:43:41-07:00	
Alabama shooting leaves 4 dead, police say	BIRMINGHAM, Alabama — Four people have died and more than 20 were wounded in a shooting in a nightlife area in the U.S. state of Alabama, according to police and news reports. There were multiple people shot in Birmingham, the Birmingham Police Department said in a social media post. Birmingham Officer Truman Fitzgerald said the shooting, with up to 21 people wounded, happened shortly after 11 p.m., AL.COM reported. Fitzgerald said there were 'dozens of gunshot victims' and at least four had 'life-threatening' injuries, AL.COM reported. Birmingham Fire and Rescue Service pronounced the three victims dead on the scene and a fourth person was pronounced dead at University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, AL.COM reported. Police said the victims found dead at the scene included two men and a woman, WBMA-TV reported. Other victims were transported to hospitals in private vehicles, police told WBMA. The Birmingham police did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking additional information. The Five Points South area of Birmingham has numerous entertainment venues, restaurants and bars and often is crowded on Saturday nights. Police said there were no immediate arrests. 'We will do everything we possibly can to make sure we uncover, identify and hunt down whoever is responsible for preying on our people this morning,' Fitzgerald told WBMA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/alabama-shooting-leaves-4-dead-police-say/7793779.html	2024-09-22T01:21:04-07:00	
Japan cracks down on bad-faith buyers as temple, shrine sales surge	SANBAGAWA, Japan — Benmou Suzuki's dilapidated 420-year-old temple, located deep in the forest near a tiny Japanese mountain village, hardly looks like prized real estate. Yet the monk was recently approached by two men, who said they were real estate brokers and wanted to know if he was interested in selling. He suspects they weren't really interested in the ornate building at the trailhead of a sacred mountain, but the special tax status that comes with running a religious property. 'There are people out there who want a temple, even a mountain temple like this. In fact, considering the value of the religious corporation status, this temple could fetch quite a lot of money,' said 52-year-old Suzuki. As Japan's population falls and interest in religion declines, there are fewer people to contribute to the upkeep of the country's numerous temples and shrines. Suzuki's Mikaboyama temple, for example, is located in Sanbagawa -- an area a three-hour drive from Tokyo with only 500 residents and which also has three other Buddhist temples, one Shinto shrine and a church. A surge in religious properties coming up for sale has Japanese authorities worried that prospective buyers are not interested in them for heavenly purposes. Rather they fear many are out to dodge taxes or possibly even launder money. 'It's already a sense of crisis for us and the religious community,' said an official at Japan's Agency for Cultural Affairs, which oversees religious sites. Cases of temple or shrine properties being extensively repurposed have triggered public outrage. In Osaka, a temple sold in 2020 was later razed and dozens of graves were relocated to make way for a property development. In Kyoto, a case about a temple that was demolished and turned into a parking lot made headlines this year. Owning a temple, shrine or church recognized as a religious corporation in Japan can confer sizeable tax benefits. Businesses under such corporations that offer religious services such as funerals do not have to pay taxes while other non-religious businesses also enjoy preferential tax rates. A wide range of undertakings are allowed from restaurants to hair salons to hotels. Japan had about 180,000 religious sites with corporation status as end-2023, according to the agency's data. The number of so-called inactive corporations -- such as those with no religious events for more than a year -- jumped by a third to more than 4,400. When monks or priests die without a successor, the overseeing religious group will usually appoint someone to take over or voluntarily relinquish the site's corporation status. However, there are around 7,000 religious sites that operate independently of these groups and are considered easy to acquire, according to the agency and specialist brokers. The cultural affairs agency said it has stepped up efforts to dissolve the corporation status of inactive religious sites to stop them from being targeted by dubious buyers. And when big earthquakes hit, often damaging temples and shrines, agency officials visit religious groups in those areas, warning them about falling prey to such buyers. Last year, 17 religious corporations were voluntarily dissolved and six were ordered to dissolve. The agency said the number would increase this year and next year as it ratchets up scrutiny. It might seem easier for Japan to change its laws to more strictly control the criteria for purchasing religious sites. But the agency said the government is wary about amending laws related to religion as that could be seen as impinging on religious freedom which is guaranteed by Japan's constitution. Reuters checks of six websites specializing in brokering the sale of religious properties showed hundreds on the market. Most are only obliquely described online with brokers saying sellers prefer to conduct sales as privately as possible. Osaka-based broker Takao Yamamoto told Reuters interest is surging. A religious corporation license alone can fetch 30 million yen ($210,000), he adds. Some religious sites, especially those with profitable graveyards, are advertised for millions of dollars. 'Anyone can buy independent sites as long as you have money...even foreigners can buy them. Recently, a lot of Chinese people are trying to buy them,' Yamamoto said. For his part, Suzuki says he has no intention to sell Mikaboyama temple and is working on ideas to raise funds to maintain it. 'Temples are places for local people to gather and forge connections. We just can't get rid of them,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-cracks-down-on-bad-faith-buyers-as-temple-shrine-sales-surge/7793040.html	2024-09-22T00:03:53-07:00	
Dolphins dying in Amazon lake made shallow by drought	TEFE, Brazil — The carcass of a baby dolphin lay on the sand bank left exposed by the receding waters in an Amazon lake that has been drying up during the worst drought on record. Researchers recovered the dead animal on Wednesday and measured water temperatures that have been rising as the lake's level drops. In last year's drought, more than 200 of the endangered freshwater dolphins died in Lake Tefe from excessive water temperatures. 'We've found several dead animals. Last week, we found one a day on average,' said Miriam Marmontel, head of the dolphin project at the Mamiraua Institute for Sustainable Development. 'We're not yet associating the deaths with changes in water temperatures, but with the exacerbation of the proximity between human populations, mainly fishermen, and the animals,' she said. With branches of major rivers in the Amazon basin drying up in this year's critical drought, the lake connected to the Solimoes River has shrunk, leaving less room for the dolphins in their favorite habitat. The lake's main channel is 2 meters deep and roughly 100 meters wide, and it is used by all the boat traffic, from canoes to heavy ferries, Marmontel said. Two dolphins were killed recently when boats ran into them in the shallow water. 'Nobody thought this drought would come so quickly or imagine that it would surpass last year's drought,' fisherman Clodomar Lima said. While the dolphin deaths are nowhere close to last year's toll, the dry season has more than a month to go and water levels will continue to decline, the researcher said. And it is not just the rare dolphin species that are suffering. Riverine communities across the Amazon are stranded by the lack of transport on waters too shallow for boats, and their floating houses are now on solid ground. Even houses built on stilts over water are now high and dry a distance from the river shore. Lake Tefe resident Francisco Alvaro Santos said it was the first time ever that his floating house was out of the water. 'Water is everything to us. It is part of our daily lives, the means of transportation for everyone who live here,' said Santos. 'Without water we are nobody!'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dolphins-dying-in-amazon-lake-made-shallow-by-drought-/7793000.html	2024-09-22T00:03:13-07:00	
Kenyan church cult massacre that killed hundreds haunts survivors	MALINDI, Kenya — Shukran Karisa Mangi always showed up drunk at work, where he dug up the bodies of doomsday cult members buried in shallow graves. But the alcohol couldn't numb his shock the morning he found the body of a close friend, whose neck had been twisted so severely that his head and torso faced opposite directions. This violent death upset Mangi, who had already unearthed children's bodies. The number of bodies kept rising in this community off Kenya's coastline where extremist evangelical leader Paul Mackenzie is accused of instructing his followers to starve to death for the opportunity to meet Jesus. While he sometimes sees the remains of others when he tries to sleep, Mangi said recently, the recurring image of his friend's mutilated body torments him when he's awake. 'He died in a very cruel manner,' said Mangi, one of several gravediggers whose work was suspended earlier in the year as bodies piled up in the morgue. 'Most of the time, I still think about how he died.' In one of the deadliest cult-related massacres ever, at least 436 bodies have been recovered since police raided Good News International Church in a forest some 70 kilometers inland from the coastal town of Malindi. Seventeen months later, many in the area are still shaken by what happened despite repeated warnings about the church's leader. Mackenzie pleaded not guilty to charges in the murders of 191 children, multiple counts of manslaughter and other crimes. If convicted, he would spend the rest of his life in prison. Some in Malindi who spoke to The Associated Press said Mackenzie's confidence while in custody showed the wide-ranging power some evangelists project even as their teachings undermine government authority, break the law, or harm followers desperate for healing and other miracles. It's not only Mackenzie, said Thomas Kakala, a self-described bishop with the Malindi-based Jesus Cares Ministry International, referring to questionable pastors he knew in the capital, Nairobi. 'You look at them. If you are sober and you want to hear the word of God, you wouldn't go to their church,' he said. 'But the place is packed.' A man like Mackenzie, who refused to join the fellowship of pastors in Malindi and rarely quoted Scripture, could thrive in a country like Kenya, said Kakala. Six detectives have been suspended for ignoring multiple warnings about Mackenzie's illegal activities. Kenya, like much of East Africa, is dominated by Christians. While many are Anglican or Catholic, evangelical Christianity has spread widely since the 1980s. Many pastors style their ministries in the manner of successful American televangelists, investing in broadcasting and advertising. Many of Africa's evangelical churches are run like sole proprietorships, without the guidance of trustee boards or laity. Pastors are often unaccountable, deriving authority from their perceived ability to perform miracles or make prophecies. Some, like Mackenzie, can seem all-powerful. Mackenzie, a former street vendor and cab driver with a high school education, apprenticed with a Malindi preacher in the late 1990s. There, in the laid-back tourist town, he opened his own church in 2003. A charismatic preacher, he was said to perform miracles and exorcisms, and he could be generous with his money. His followers included teachers and police officers. They came to Malindi from across Kenya, giving Mackenzie national prominence that spread the pain of the deaths across the country. The first complaints against Mackenzie concerned his opposition to formal schooling and vaccination. He was briefly detained in 2019 for opposing the government's efforts to assign national identification numbers to Kenyans, saying the numbers were satanic. He closed his Malindi church premises later that year and urged his congregation to follow him to Shakahola, where he leased 800 acres of forest inhabited by elephants and big cats. Church members paid small sums to own plots in Shakahola, and were required to build houses and live in villages with biblical names like Nazareth, according to survivors. Mackenzie grew more demanding, with people from different villages forbidden from communicating or gathering, said former church member Salama Masha. 'What made me (realize) Mackenzie was not a good person was when he said that the children should fast to die,' said Masha, who escaped after witnessing the starvation deaths of two children. 'That's when I knew that it's not something I can do.' Mbatha Mackenzie, a mason who lives with his family and goats in a tin shack in Malindi, said that while Mackenzie was generous to his followers, he never treated his extended family with similar kindness. 'My brother — he seemed like a politician,' he said. 'They have a sweet tongue, and when he talks something to the people, people believe him.' A former church member who escaped Shakahola said she lost faith in Mackenzie when she saw how his men handled people on the verge of dying from starvation. She said Mackenzie's bodyguards would take the starving person away, never to be seen again. The woman said it was 'like a routine' for the bodyguards to rape women in the villages. She says she, too, was sexually assaulted by four men while she was pregnant with her fourth child. The Associated Press does not identify victims of alleged sexual assault unless they choose to publicly identify themselves. Those who tried to the leave the forest without Mackenzie's permission faced beatings, as did those who were caught breaking fast, according to former church members. Autopsies on more than 100 bodies showed deaths from starvation, strangulation, suffocation, and injuries from blunt objects. Mangi, the gravedigger, said he believed more mass graves were yet to be discovered in Shakahola. At least 600 people are reported missing, according to the Kenya Red Cross.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-church-cult-massacre-that-killed-hundreds-haunts-survivors/7791589.html	2024-09-22T00:02:17-07:00	
This US city is hailed as a vaccination success. Can it be sustained?	LOUISVILLE, Kentucky — On his first day of school at Newcomer Academy, Maikel Tejeda was whisked to the school library. The 7th grader didn't know why. He soon got the point: He was being given make-up vaccinations. Five of them. 'I don't have a problem with that,' said the 12-year-old, who moved from Cuba early this year. Across the library, a group of city, state and federal officials gathered to celebrate the school clinic, and the city. With U.S. childhood vaccination rates below their goals, Louisville and the state were being praised as success stories: Kentucky's vaccination rate for kindergarteners rose 2 percentage points in the 2022-23 school year compared with the year before. The rate for Jefferson County — which is Louisville — was up 4 percentage points. 'Progress is success,' said Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But that progress didn't last. Kentucky's school entry vaccination rate slipped last year. Jefferson County's rate slid, too. And the rates for both the county and state remain well below the target thresholds. It raises the question: If this is what success looks like, what does it say about the nation's ability to stop imported infections from turning into community outbreaks? Local officials believe they can get to herd immunity thresholds, but they acknowledge challenges that includes tight funding, misinformation and well-intended bureaucratic rules that can discourage doctors from giving kids shots. 'We're closing the gap,' said Eva Stone, who has managed the county school system's health services since 2018. 'We're not closing the gap very quickly.' Falling vaccination rates Public health experts focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners because schools can be cauldrons for germs and the launching pad for community outbreaks. For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to mandates that required key vaccinations as a condition of school attendance. But they have slid in recent years. When COVID-19 started hitting the U.S. hard in 2020, schools were closed, visits to pediatricians declined and vaccination record-keeping fell off. Meanwhile, more parents questioned routine childhood vaccinations that they used to automatically accept, an effect that experts attribute to misinformation and the political schism that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines. A Gallup survey released last month found that 40% of Americans said it is extremely important for parents to have their children vaccinated, down from 58% in 2019. Meanwhile, a recent University of Pennsylvania survey of 1,500 people found that about 1 in 4 U.S. adults think the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism — despite no medical evidence for it. All that has led more parents to seek exemptions to school entry vaccinations. The CDC has not yet reported national data for the 2023-24 school year, but the proportion of U.S. kindergartners exempted from school vaccination requirements the year before hit a record 3%. Overall, 93% of kindergartners got their required shots for the 2022-23 school year. The rate was 95% in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic. Officials worry slipping vaccination rates will lead to disease outbreaks. The roughly 250 U.S. measles cases reported so far this year are the most since 2019, and Oregon is seeing its largest outbreak in more than 30 years. Kentucky has been experiencing its worst outbreak of whooping cough — another vaccine-preventable disease — since 2017. Nationally, nearly 14,000 cases have been reported this year, the most since 2019. Persuading parents The whooping cough surge is a warning sign but also an opportunity, said Kim Tolley, a California-based historian who wrote a book last year on the vaccination of American schoolchildren. She called for a public relations campaign to 'get everybody behind' improving immunizations. Much of the discussion about raising vaccination rates centers on campaigns designed to educate parents about the importance of vaccinating children — especially those on the fence about getting shots for their kids. But experts are still hashing out what kind of messaging work best: Is it better, for example, to say 'vaccinate' or 'immunize''? A lot of the messaging is influenced by feedback from small focus groups. One takeaway is some people have less trust in health officials and even their own doctors than they once did. Another is that they strongly trust their own feelings about vaccines and what they've seen in Internet searches or heard from other sources. 'Their overconfidence is hard to shake. It's hard to poke holes in it,' said Mike Perry, who ran focus groups on behalf of a group called the Public Health Communications Collaborative. But many people seem more trusting of older vaccines. And they do seem to be at least curious about information they didn't know, including the history of research behind vaccines and the dangers of the diseases they were created to fight, he said. Improving access Dolores Albarracin has studied vaccination improvement strategies in 17 countries, and repeatedly found that the most effective strategy is to make it easier for kids to get vaccinated. 'In practice, most people are not vaccinating simply because they don't have money to take the bus' or have other troubles getting to appointments, said Albarracin, director of the communication science division within Penn's Annenberg Public Policy Center. That's a problem in Louisville, where officials say few doctors were providing vaccinations to children enrolled in Medicaid and fewer still were providing shots to kids without any health insurance. An analysis a few years ago indicated 1 in 5 children — about 20,000 kids — were not current on their vaccinations, and most of them were poor, said Stone, the county school health manager. A 30-year-old federal program called Vaccines for Children pays for vaccinations for children who Medicaid-eligible or lack the insurance to cover it. But in a meeting with the CDC director last month, Louisville health officials lamented that most local doctors don't participate in the program because of paperwork and other administrative headaches. And it can be tough for patients to get the time and transportation to get to those few dozen Louisville providers who do take part. The school system has tried to fill the gap. In 2019, it applied to become a VFC provider, and gradually established vaccine clinics. Last year, it held clinics at nearly all 160 schools, and it's doing the same thing this year. The first was at Newcomer Academy, where many immigrant students behind on their vaccinations are started in the school system. It's been challenging, Stone said. Funding is very limited. There are bureaucratic obstacles, and a growing influx of children from other countries who need shots. It takes multiple trips to a doctor or clinic to complete some vaccine series. And then there's the opposition — vaccination clinic announcements tend to draw hateful social media comments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/this-us-city-is-hailed-as-a-vaccination-success-can-it-be-sustained-/7791570.html	2024-09-22T00:01:24-07:00	
Refugees in New Hampshire turn to farming for income and a taste of home	DUNBARTON, New Hampshire — It's harvest time in central New Hampshire, and one farm there appears to have been transplanted from a distant continent. Farmers balance large crates laden with vegetables on their heads while chatting in Somali and other languages. As the sun burns away the early morning mist, the farmers pick American staples like corn and tomatoes as well as crops they grew up with, like okra and sorrel. Many of the women wear vibrant orange, red and blue fabrics. Most workers at this Dunbarton farm are refugees who have escaped harrowing wars and persecution. They come from the African nations of Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia and Congo, and they now run their own small businesses, selling their crops to local markets as well as to friends and connections in their ethnic communities. Farming provides them with both an income and a taste of home. 'I like it in the USA. I have my own job,' says Somali refugee and farmer Khadija Aliow as she hams it up by sashaying past a reporter, using one hand to steady the crate of crops on her head and the other to give a thumbs-up. 'Happy. I'm so happy.' The farm is owned by a New Hampshire-based nonprofit, the Organization for Refugee and Immigrant Success, which lets the farmers use plots of land and provides them with training and support. The organization runs similar farms in Concord and the nearby town of Boscawen. In all, 36 people from five African countries, including South Sudan, and the Asian nation of Nepal work on the farms. Many were farmers in their home countries before coming to the U.S. or had previous experience with agriculture, said Tom McGee, a program director with the nonprofit. 'These are farmers who are basically independent business owners, who are working in partnership with our organization to be able to bring this produce to life in this country,' he said. 'And to have another sense of purpose, and a way that they can bring themselves into the community and belong. And really participate in the American dream.' The nonprofit runs a food market in Manchester, where people can buy fresh produce or sign up to have boxes delivered. McGee said there are a few other programs with similar aims scattered throughout the U.S. but that the model remains relatively rare. He said his organization relies on state and federal funding, as well as private donations. Farmer Sylvain Bukasa said he escaped in 2000 from the decades-long conflict in Congo that has resulted in millions of deaths. He spent six years with his wife and son in a refugee camp in Tanzania before being accepted into the U.S. in 2006. 'I was worried for my safety,' he said. 'I decided to just go somewhere where it's a little bit safer.' Bukasa said he has worked hard since arriving in the U.S. and relishes his new life. But at first he missed the foods he grew up with. He could only find them in specialized markets, where they tended to be expensive and of poor quality. 'Back home we ate more vegetables and less meat,' he said. 'When we came here, it's more chicken, more pizza, things like that. They taste good, but it's not good for you.' Bukasa started growing crops on the farm in 2011. The initial plan on the Dunbarton farm was to allow migrants like him to grow traditional crops for themselves and their families. But demand grew, particularly during the pandemic, prompting the farm's evolution into a commercial operation. For a few of the farmers, the harvest provides their primary income. For most, like Bukasa, it's a side gig. He works fulltime as a service agent for a rental car company and travels whenever he can to tend his plot of just over 0.4 hectares. The biggest challenges are making sure his crops are adequately watered and stopping the weeds from taking over, he said. Mondays are harvest days, and on a recent Monday, Bukasa listed the crops he was picking: tomatoes, summer squash, zucchini, kale, corn, okra, and the leaves from pumpkins and sorrel — which he and the other migrants call sour-sour because of its taste. He said there's a surprisingly large Congolese community throughout New England, and they appreciate what he grows. 'It's a hard job, but hard work is good work,' Bukasa said. 'It's fun and it helps people. I like when I satisfy people with the food that they eat.' His dream is to one day buy his own farm with a couple of acres of land, so he can walk out his front door to tend to his crops rather than driving 20 minutes like he does now. A more immediate challenge, he said, is to work on the marketing side of his business. He's got to the point where he now grows more food than he's able to sell, and he hates seeing any of it go to waste. One idea is to buy a van, so he can deliver more produce himself. 'You see the competition in there,' he says with a grin, motioning toward the tent where other refugee farmers wash and pack their crops. 'See how many farmers are trying to sell their produce.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/refugees-in-new-hampshire-turn-to-farming-for-income-and-a-taste-of-home/7791526.html	2024-09-21T23:56:52-07:00	
Fortified bouillon cubes are seen as way to curb malnutrition in Africa	IBADAN, Nigeria — In her cramped, dimly lit kitchen, Idowu Bello leans over a gas cooker while stirring a pot of eba, the thick, starchy West African staple made from cassava root. Kidney problems and chronic exhaustion forced the 56-year-old Nigerian woman to retire from teaching, and she switches between cooking with gas or over a wood fire depending on the fuel she can afford. Financial constraints also limit the food Bello has on hand even though doctors have recommended a nutrient-rich diet both to improve her weakening health and to help her teenage daughter, Fatima, grow. Along with eba, on the menu today is melon soup with ponmo, an inexpensive condiment made from dried cowhide. 'Fish, meat, eggs, fruits, vegetables and even milk are costly these days,' Bello, 56, said, her lean face etched with worry. If public health advocates and the Nigerian government have their way, malnourished households in the West African nation soon will have a simple ingredient available to improve their intake of key vitamins and minerals. Government regulators on Tuesday are launching a code of standards for adding iron, zinc, folic acid and vitamin B12 to bouillon cubes at minimum levels recommended by experts. While the standards will be voluntary for manufacturers for now, their adoption could help accelerate progress against diets deficient in essential micronutrients, or what is known in nutrition and public health circles as 'hidden hunger.' Fortified bouillon cubes could avert up to 16.6 million cases of anemia and up to 11,000 deaths from neural tube defects in Nigeria, according to a new report from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. 'Regardless of economic situation or income level, everyone uses seasoning cubes,' Bello said as she unwrapped and dropped one in her melon soup. A growing and multipronged problem Making do with smaller portions and less nutritious foods is common among many Nigerian households, according to a recent government survey on dietary intake and micronutrients. The survey estimated that 79% of Nigerian households are food insecure. The climate crisis, which has seen extreme heat and unpredictable rainfall patterns hobble agriculture in Africa's troubled Sahel region, will worsen the problem, with several million children expected to experience growth problems due to malnutrition between now and 2050, according to the Gates Foundation report released Tuesday. 'Farmlands are destroyed, you have a shortage of food, the system is strained, leading to inflation making it difficult for the people to access foods, including animal-based proteins,' Augustine Okoruwa, a regional program manager at Helen Keller Intl, said, highlighting the link between malnutrition and climate change. Dietary deficiencies of the micronutrients the government wants added to bouillon cubes already have caused a public health crisis in Nigeria, including a high prevalence of anemia in women of child-bearing age, neural tube defects in newborn babies and stunted growth among children, according to Okoruwa. Helen Keller Intl, a New York-based nonprofit that works to address the causes of blindness and malnutrition, has partnered with the Gates Foundation and businesses and government agencies in Africa to promote food fortification. In Nigeria, recent economic policies such as the cancellation of gasoline subsidies are driving the country's worst cost-of-living crisis in generations, further deepening food hardship for the low-income earners who form the majority of the country's working population. Globally, nearly 3 billion people are unable to access healthy diets, 71% of them in developing countries, according to the World Health Organization. The large-scale production of fortified foods would unlock a new way to 'increase micronutrients in the food staples of low-income countries to create resilience for vulnerable families,' the Gates Foundation said. Bouillon cubes as the vehicle Bouillon cubes — those small blocks of evaporated meat or vegetable extracts and seasonings that typically are used to flavor soups and stews — are widely consumed in many African countries, nearing 100% household penetration in countries like Nigeria, Senegal, Ivory Coast, and Cameroon, according to a study by Helen Keller Intl. That makes the cubes the 'most cost-effective way' to add minerals and vitamins to the diets of millions of people, Okoruwa said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fortified-bouillon-cubes-are-seen-as-way-to-curb-malnutrition-in-africa/7790087.html	2024-09-21T23:53:42-07:00	
Dedicated artists keep Japan's ancient craft of temari alive	KAWARAMACHI, Japan — Time seems to stop here. Women sit in a small circle, quietly, painstakingly stitching patterns on balls the size of an orange, a stitch at a time. At the center of the circle is Eiko Araki, a master of the Sanuki Kagari Temari, a Japanese traditional craft passed down for more than 1,000 years on the southwestern island of Shikoku. Each ball — known as a 'temari' ball — is a work of art, with colorful geometric patterns carrying poetic names like 'firefly flowers' and 'layered stars.' A temari ball takes weeks or months to finish. Some cost hundreds of dollars (tens of thousands of yen), although others are much cheaper. These kaleidoscopic balls aren't for throwing or kicking around. They're destined to be heirlooms, carrying prayers for health and goodness. They might be treasured like a painting or piece of sculpture in a Western home. The concept behind temari is an elegant otherworldliness, an impractical beauty that is also very labor-intensive to create. 'Out of nothing, something this beautiful is born, bringing joy,' said Araki. 'I want it to be remembered there are beautiful things in this world that can only be made by hand.' Natural materials The region where temari originated was good for growing cotton, warm with little rainfall, and the spherical creations continue to be made out of the humble material. At Araki's studio, which also serves as head office for temari's preservation society, there are 140 hues of cotton thread, including delicate pinks and blues, as well as more vivid colors and all the subtle gradations in between. The women dye them by hand, using plants, flowers and other natural ingredients, including cochineal, which is a bug living in cacti that produces a red dye. The deeper shade of indigo is dyed again and again to turn just about black. Yellow and blue are combined to form gorgeous greens. Soy juice is added to deepen the tints, a dash of organic protein. Outside the studio, loops of cotton thread, in various tones of yellow today, hang outside in the shade to dry. Creating and embroidering the balls The arduous process starts with making the basic ball mold on which the stitching is done. Rice husks that are cooked then dried are placed in a piece of cotton, then wound with thread, over and over, until, almost magically, a ball appears in your hands. Then the stitching begins. The balls are surprisingly hard, so each stitch requires a concentrated, almost painful, push. The motifs must be precise and even. Each ball has lines to guide the stitching — one that goes around it like the equator, and others that zigzag to the top and bottom. Appealing to a new generation These days, temari is getting some new recognition, among Japanese and foreigners as well. Caroline Kennedy took lessons in the ball-making when she was United States ambassador to Japan a decade ago. Yoshie Nakamura, who promotes Japanese handcrafted art in her duty-free shop at Tokyo's Haneda airport, says she features temari there because of its intricate and delicate designs. 'Temari that might have been everyday in a faraway era is now being used for interior decoration,' she said. 'I really feel each Sanuki Kagari Temari speaks of a special, one-and-only existence in the world.' Araki has come up with newer designs that feel both modern and historical. She is trying to make the balls more accessible to everyday life — for instance, as Christmas tree ornaments. A strap with a dangling miniature ball, though quite hard to make because of its size, is affordable at about 1,500 yen ($10) each. Another of Araki's inventions is a cluster of pastel balls that opens and closes with tiny magnets. Fill it with sweet-smelling herbs for a kind of aromatic diffuser. A tradition passed down through generations Araki, a graceful woman who talks very slowly, her head cocked to one side as though always in thought, often travels to Tokyo to teach. But mostly she works and gives lessons in her studio, an abandoned kindergarten with faded blue paint and big windows with tired wooden frames. She started out as a metalwork artist. Her husband's parents were temari masters who worked hard to resurrect the artform when it was declining in the modern age, at risk of dying out. They were stoic people, rarely bestowing praise and instead always scolding her, she remembers. It's a tough-love approach that's common in the handing down of many Japanese traditional arts, from Kabuki acting to hogaku music, that demand lifetimes of selfless devotion. Today, only several dozen people, all women, can make the temari balls to traditional standards. 'The most challenging aspect is nurturing successors. It typically takes over 10 years to train them, so you need people who are willing to continue the craft for a very long time,' Araki said. 'When people start to feel joy along with the hardship that comes with making temari, they tend to keep going.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dedicated-artists-are-keeping-japan-s-ancient-craft-of-temari-alive-/7790066.html	2024-09-21T23:53:00-07:00	
At least 30 dead after explosion at Iran coal mine, state TV says	TEHRAN, Iran — A methane leak sparked an explosion at a coal mine in eastern Iran, killing at least 30 people and injuring 17 others, Iranian state media reported Sunday. Another 24 miners are believed to be trapped inside. The report said the deaths happened at a coal mine in Tabas, some 540 kilometers southeast of the capital, Tehran. Authorities were sending emergency personnel to the area after the blast late Saturday, it said. Around 70 people had been working there at the time of the blast. State TV later said 24 were believed to be trapped inside. Provincial Governor Mohammad Javad Qenaat told state TV that 30 miners had been killed and 17 injured. Iran's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, preparing to travel to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, said he ordered all efforts be made to rescue those trapped and aid their families. He also said an investigation into the incident had begun. Oil-producing Iran is also rich in a variety of minerals. Iran annually consumes some 3.5 million tons of coal but only extracts about 1.8 million tons from its mines per year. The rest is imported, often consumed in the country's steel mills. This is not the first disaster to strike Iran's mining industry. In 2013, 11 workers were killed in two separate mining incidents. In 2009, 20 workers were killed in several incidents. In 2017, a coal mine explosion killed at least 42 people. Lax safety standards and inadequate emergency services in mining areas are often blamed for the fatalities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-30-dead-after-explosion-at-iran-coal-mine-state-tv-says/7793769.html	2024-09-21T23:48:57-07:00	
Over 100 rockets fired from Lebanon into Israel	NAHARIYA, Israel — Over 100 rockets were fired into Israel from Lebanon early Sunday, with some landing near the northern city of Haifa, as Israel and the Hezbollah militant group appeared to be spiraling toward all-out war following months of escalating tensions. The rockets streaked over a wider and deeper area of northern Israel than previous volleys and set off air raid sirens across the region. The Israeli military said rockets had been fired 'toward civilian areas,' pointing to a possible escalation after previous barrages had mainly been aimed at military targets. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said it treated four people for shrapnel wounds, including a 76-year-old man who was moderately wounded near Haifa, where buildings were damaged and cars set on fire. It was not immediately clear if the damage was caused by a rocket or an Israeli interceptor. The barrage came after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut killed at least 37 people, including one of Hezbollah's top leaders as well as women and children. Hezbollah was already reeling from a sophisticated attack that caused thousands of personal devices to explode just days earlier. The Israeli military said it carried out a wave of strikes across southern Lebanon over the past 24 hours, hitting some 400 militant sites, including rocket launchers. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire since the outbreak of the war in Gaza nearly a year ago, when the militant group began firing rockets in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed ally Hamas. The low-level fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the frontier. Neither side is believed to be seeking a war. But in recent weeks, Israel has shifted its focus from Gaza to Lebanon and vowed to bring back calm to the border so that its citizens can return to their homes. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly elusive as long-running negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly bogged down. The war in Gaza began with Hamas' October 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people and took around 250 hostage. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Gaza's Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed. It does not say how many were fighters but says women and children make up over half of the dead. Israeli media reported that rockets fired from Lebanon early Sunday were intercepted in the areas of Haifa and Nazareth, which are further south than most of the rocket fire to date. Israel canceled school across the north, deepening the sense of crisis. Hezbollah said it had launched dozens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles — a new type of weapon the group had not used before — at the Ramat David airbase, southeast of Haifa, 'in response to the repeated Israeli attacks that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs.' In July, the group released a video with what it said was footage it had filmed of the base with surveillance drones. Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel for a wave of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people — including two children — and wounding around 3,000. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed or denied responsibility. On Friday, an Israeli airstrike took down an eight-story building in a densely populated neighborhood in Beirut's southern suburbs as Hezbollah members were meeting in the basement, according to Israel. Among those killed was Ibrahim Akil, a top Hezbollah official who commanded the group's special forces unit, known as the Radwan Force. Lebanon's health minister, Firass Abiad, told reporters Saturday that at least seven women and three children were killed in Friday's airstrike on the building. He said another 68 people were injured, including 15 who were hospitalized. It was the deadliest strike on Beirut since the bruising monthlong war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah, and the casualty count could grow, with 23 people still missing, a government official said. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the attack broke up the group's chain of command while taking out Akil, who he said was responsible for Israeli deaths. He had been on the U.S. most wanted list for years, with a $7 million reward, over his alleged role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the taking of American and German hostages in Lebanon during the civil war in the 1980s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-100-rockets-fired-from-lebanon-into-israel/7793765.html	2024-09-21T23:05:41-07:00	
Rescue workers search for at least 6 people missing after Japan flooding	TOKYO — Rescue workers searched for at least six people missing Sunday after heavy rain pounded Japan's northcentral region of Noto, triggering landslides and floods and leaving one person dead in a region still recovering from a deadly January 1 earthquake. The Japan Meteorological Agency on Saturday issued the highest alert level for heavy rain across several cities in the Ishikawa prefecture, including hard-hit cities Suzu and Wajima on the northern coast of the Noto peninsula. The agency has since downgraded the heavy rain alert and kept landslide and flooding warnings in place. In Suzu, one person died and another was missing after being swept in floodwaters. Another went missing in the nearby town of Noto, according to the prefecture. In Wajima, rescue workers were searching for four people missing following a landslide at a construction site. They were among 60 construction workers repairing a tunnel damaged by January's quake. The FDMA said another person was missing due to floods at a different location in the city. NHK footage at a coastal area of Wajima showed a wooden house torn and tilted after it was apparently hit by a landslide. No injuries were reported from the site. In Noto town, two people were seriously injured by a landslide while visiting their quake-damaged home. At least 16 rivers in Ishikawa breached their banks as of Saturday afternoon, according to the Land and Infrastructure Ministry. Residents were urged to use maximum caution against possible mudslides and building damage. By late afternoon Saturday, about 1,350 residents were taking shelter at designated community centers, school gymnasiums and other town facilities, authorities said. About 50 centimeters of rain has fallen in the region over the last three days, due to the rainbands that cause torrential rain above the Hokuriku region, JMA said. 'Heavy rain is hitting the region that had been badly damaged by the Noto earthquake, and I believe many people are feeling very uneasy,' said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi. Hayashi said the government 'puts people's lives first' and its priority was search and rescue operations. He also called on the residents to pay close attention to the latest weather and evacuation advisories and take precautions early, adding that the Self Defense Force troops have been dispatched to Ishikawa to join rescue efforts. A resident in Wajima told NHK that he has just finished cleaning his house from the quake damage and it was depressing to now see it flooded by muddy water. A number of roads flooded by muddy water were also blocked. Hokuriku Electric Power Co. said more than 5,000 homes were still without power Sunday. Traffic lights were out in the affected areas. Many homes were also without water supply. Heavy rain also fell in nearby northern prefectures of Niigata and Yamagata, threatening flooding and other damages and suspending train operations, including the Yamagata Shinkansen bullet trains, officials said. A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the region on January 1, killing more than 370 people and damaging roads and other key infrastructure. Its aftermath still affects the local industry, economy and daily lives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rescue-workers-search-for-at-least-6-people-missing-after-japan-flooding/7793756.html	2024-09-21T21:53:11-07:00	
Germany's far-right AfD on track for another state election win	berlin — The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is predicted to come first in an election in Brandenburg on Sunday, seeking to build on gains in other eastern states this month and beat Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats in a traditional stronghold. The AfD became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since World War II, in Thuringia, on September 1 and just missed first place in Saxony. It is one of several far-right groups in Europe capitalizing on worries over an economic slowdown, immigration and the Ukraine war -- concerns that are particularly strong in formerly Communist-run eastern Germany. The party, which is unlikely to be able to govern because it is polling short of a majority and other parties would refuse to work with it, is also seeking to gain from discontent over infighting in Scholz's three-party federal coalition. 'We urgently need a thorough course correction so the country does not go to the dogs,' the AfD's lead candidate in Brandenburg, Hans-Christoph Berndt, said at a campaign event earlier this month. An AfD victory in the state election would be a particular embarrassment for the Social Democrats (SPD), which has won elections in Brandenburg and governed the state of 2.5 million people since reunification in 1990. It would also raise further questions about the suitability of Scholz, the least popular German chancellor on record, to lead the party into next year's election. Brandenburg's popular SPD premier Dietmar Woidke has mostly shunned campaigning with Scholz, who lives in the state's capital, Potsdam. In an unusual move, Woidke has also criticized the behavior and policies of the ruling coalition. Instead, he has sought to highlight economic success stories during the five years since the last state election such as the opening of a TeslaTSLA.O factory and Brandenburg airport -- which serves Berlin and is now Germany's third most important aviation hub. Narrow the gap In recent weeks, the SPD has managed to narrow the gap with the AfD, opinion polls have shown. A poll published by pollster Forschungsgruppe Wahlen on Thursday put the AfD on 28% in Brandenburg with the SPD just one point behind on 27%, followed by the conservatives on 14% and the new leftist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) on 13%. 'My greatest challenge in this legislative period ... to not allow right-wing extremists to have anything to say in this country ever again,' Woidke said at a campaign event on Tuesday. He has threatened to resign if his party comes in behind the AfD. AfD party leader Tino Chrupalla said Scholz should do the same. 'It is high time this government suffer the consequences after this state election,' Chrupalla said. Both of Scholz's junior coalition partners, the Free Democrats and the Greens, look set to struggle to win the 5% needed to enter the state parliament, polls show. At a national level, the three parties in Scholz's coalition are now collectively polling less than the opposition conservatives although political analysts say much could change before the federal election due in September 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-s-far-right-afd-on-track-for-another-state-election-win/7793751.html	2024-09-21T21:12:46-07:00	
Sri Lanka's Marxist-leaning Dissanayake takes early lead in presidential race	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka's Marxist-leaning leader, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, grabbed a commanding early lead on Sunday in his bid to become the next president of the debt-ridden country seeking to elect a leader to bolster its fragile economic recovery. Dissanayake won about 53% of a million votes counted so far in the election, Sri Lanka's Election Commission data showed. Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa was second at 22%, ahead of President Ranil Wickremesinghe in third place. About 75% of the eligible 17 million people in the Indian Ocean island nation cast their votes in Saturday's election, according to the poll body. Dissanayake contested as candidate for the National People's Power alliance, which includes his Marxist-leaning Janatha Vimukthi Peremuna party that has traditionally backed stronger state intervention, lower taxes and more closed market economic policies. Although JVP has just three seats in parliament, the 55-year-old Dissanayake has been boosted by his promises of tough anti-corruption measures and more pro-poor policies. He presented himself as the candidate of change, promising to dissolve parliament within 45 days of coming to power in order to seek a fresh mandate for his policies in the general elections. 'After a long and arduous campaign, the results of the election are now clear,' Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said on X. 'Though I heavily campaigned for President Ranil Wickremasinghe, the people of Sri Lanka have made their decision, and I fully respect their mandate for Anura Kumara Dissanayake.' This was Sri Lanka's first election since the economy buckled in 2022 under a severe foreign exchange shortage, leaving the country unable to pay for imports of essentials including fuel, medicine and cooking gas. Thousands of protesters marched in Colombo in 2022 and occupied the president's office and residence, forcing then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee and later resign. Buttressed by a $2.9 billion bailout program from the International Monetary Fund, the economy has posted a tentative recovery, but the high cost of living was still a critical issue for many voters. Although inflation cooled to 0.5% last month from a crisis high of 70%, and the economy is forecast to grow in 2024 for the first time in three years, millions remain in poverty, with many pinning hopes of a better future on the next leader. The winner will have to ensure Sri Lanka sticks with the IMF program until 2027 to get its economy on a stable growth path, reassure markets, repay debt, attract investors and help a quarter of its people climb out of poverty. In his manifesto, Dissanayake, known for his ability to deliver stirring speeches, has pledged to slash taxes that would impact fiscal targets, leaving investors and market participants worried about his economic policies. However, during campaign speeches he has taken a more conciliatory approach, saying any changes would be undertaken in consultation with the IMF and that he is committed to ensuring repayment of debt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-s-marxist-leaning-dissanayake-takes-early-lead-in-presidential-race/7793734.html	2024-09-21T19:41:12-07:00	
Israeli forces raid Al Jazeera West Bank office, order 45-day closure	Jerusalem — Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera said that Israeli forces raided its office in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank on Sunday and issued a 45-day closure order. 'There is a court ruling for closing down Al Jazeera for 45 days,' an Israeli soldier told Al Jazeera's West Bank bureau chief Walid al-Omari, the network reported, citing the conversation which was broadcast live. 'I ask you to take all the cameras and leave the office at this moment,' the soldier said. Footage showed heavily armed and masked troops entering the office. The broadcaster said the soldiers did not provide a reason for the closure order. The move was the latest Israeli action against Al Jazeera. Last week Israel's government announced it was revoking the press credentials of Al Jazeera journalists in the country, four months after banning the channel from operating inside Israel. The shutdown had not affected broadcasts from the West Bank or the Gaza Strip, from which Al Jazeera still covers Israel's war with Palestinian militants. The Israeli military has repeatedly accused journalists from the Qatari network of being 'terrorist agents' in Gaza affiliated with Hamas or its ally, Islamic Jihad. Al Jazeera denies the Israeli government's accusations and claims that Israel systematically targets its employees in the Gaza Strip.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-forces-raid-al-jazeera-west-bank-office-order-45-day-closure/7793731.html	2024-09-21T19:23:35-07:00

Biden tells Quad leaders Beijing is testing region at turbulent time for Chinese economy	CLAYMONT, Delaware — President Joe Biden told Indo-Pacific allies on Saturday that he believes China's increasing military assertiveness is an effort to test the region at a turbulent moment for Beijing. Biden's comments were caught by a hot mic after he and fellow leaders of the so-called Quad delivered opening remarks before the press at a summit he's hosting near his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. He said his administration sees Beijing's actions as a 'change in tactic, not a change in strategy.' China is struggling to pull up an economy pummeled by the coronavirus pandemic and has seen an extended slowdown in industrial activity and real estate prices as Beijing faces pressure to ramp up spending to stimulate demand. 'China continues to behave aggressively, testing us all across the region, and it's true in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, South China, South Asia and the Taiwan Straits,' Biden told Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. 'At least from our perspective, we believe (Chinese President) Xi Jinping is looking to focus on domestic economic challenges and minimize the turbulence in China's diplomatic relationships, and he's also looking to buy himself some diplomatic space, in my view, to aggressively pursue China's interest,' Biden added. Starting with a trade war that dates back to 2018, China and the United States have grown at odds over a range of issues, from global security, such as China's claims over the South China Sea, to industrial policy on electric vehicle and solar panel manufacturing. The administration has repeatedly voiced concerns about Chinese aggression toward Taiwan and more recently on the frequent clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in disputed areas of the South China Sea. At the summit, the leaders agreed to expand the partnership among the coast guards of the Quad nations to improve interoperability and capabilities, with Indian, Japanese and Australian personnel sailing on U.S. ships in the region. But U.S. officials would not say if those transits would include the contested South China Sea. China also has longtime territorial disputes involving other claimants including Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. U.S. officials worry about China's long-stated goals of unifying Taiwan with China's mainland and the possibility of war over Taiwan. The self-ruled island democracy is claimed by Beijing as part of its territory. The leaders in a joint declaration issued following their talks expressed 'serious concern about the militarization ... and coercive and intimidating maneuvers in the South China Sea.' Biden last month dispatched his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to Beijing for three days of talks with Chinese officials. Sullivan during that visit also met with Xi. Both governments are eager to keep relations on an even keel ahead of a change in the U.S. presidency in January. And both sides have said they remain committed to managing the relationship, following up on a meeting between Xi and Biden in San Francisco last November. The concerns about China were raised as Biden showed off a slice of his Delaware hometown to the leaders of Australia, Japan and India. When Biden began his presidency, he looked to elevate the Quad to a leader-level partnership as he tried to pivot U.S. foreign policy away from conflicts in the Middle East and toward threats and opportunities in the Indo-Pacific. This weekend's summit is the fourth in-person and sixth overall gathering of the leaders since 2021. 'It will survive way beyond November,' Biden told the leaders. The president, who has admitted to an uneven track record as a scholar, also seemed tickled to get to host a gathering with three world leaders at the school he attended more than 60 years ago. He welcomed each of the leaders individually for one-on-one talks at his nearby home before they gathered at the school for talks and a formal dinner. 'I don't think the headmaster of this school thought I'd be presiding over a meeting like this,' Biden joked to fellow leaders. Albanese, Modi and Kishida came for the summit before their appearances at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. 'This place could not be better suited for my final visit as prime minister,' said Kishida, who like Biden, is set to soon leave office. Earlier, the president warmly greeted Kishida when he arrived at the residence on Saturday morning and gave the prime minister a tour of the property before they settled into talks. White House officials said holding the talks at the president's house, which sits near a pond in a wooded area several miles west of downtown, was intended to give the meetings a more relaxed feel. Sullivan described the vibe of Biden's one-on-one meeting with Albanese, who stopped by the house on Friday, as 'two guys — one at the other guy's home — talking in broad strokes about where they see the state of the world.' He said Biden and Albanese also swapped stories about their political careers. The Australian leader remarked that the visit had given him 'insight into what in my view makes you such an extraordinary world leader.' Modi also stopped by the house on Saturday to meet with Biden before the leaders gathered for their joint talks. 'There cannot be a better place than President Biden's hometown of Wilmington to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Quad,' Modi said. Biden and Modi discussed Modi's recent visits to Russia and Ukraine as well as economic and security concerns about China. Modi is the most prominent leader from a nation that maintains a neutral position on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-tells-quad-leaders-beijing-is-testing-region-at-turbulent-time-for-chinese-economy-/7793722.html	2024-09-21T18:17:35-07:00	
Chad floods kill 503, affect 1.7 million people, UN says	N'Djamena, Chad — Severe flooding in Chad since July has claimed 503 lives and affected around 1.7 million people since July, the United Nations said Saturday in its latest assessment of the disaster. The floods have destroyed 212,111 houses, flooded 357,832 hectares of fields, and drowned 69,659 heads of cattle, said the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Chad. All of the country's provinces have been hit, Chad's water and energy minister Marcelin Kanabe Passale told journalists Saturday morning, warning of more trouble to come. 'The waters of the Logone and Chari rivers have reached a critical height likely to cause obvious serious flooding in the coming days,' Passale said. N'Djamena, Chad's capital, is located where the Logone and Chari rivers flow into each other. Passale recommended that all water from private wells be treated with chlorine before consumption. A flood-monitoring committee had been set up to 'assess the risks associated with the pollution of drinking water supplies and rising river levels,' he added. The U.N. warned in early September of the impact of 'torrential rains and severe flooding' in the wider region, particularly in Chad, calling for immediate action and funding to tackle climate change. This summer has been the hottest recorded globally since records have been kept, with a slew of record temperatures, heatwaves, drought and severe flooding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-floods-kill-503-affect-1-7-million-people-un-says-/7793700.html	2024-09-21T17:23:02-07:00	
FBI agents board vessel managed by company whose ship crashed into US bridge	BALTIMORE — Federal agents on Saturday boarded a vessel managed by the same company that managed a cargo ship that caused a deadly bridge collapse in Baltimore, Maryland, the FBI confirmed. In statements, spokespeople for the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland confirmed that authorities boarded the Maersk Saltoro. The ship is managed by Synergy Marine Group. 'The Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Criminal Investigation Division and Coast Guard Investigative Services are present aboard the Maersk Saltoro conducting court authorized law enforcement activity,' statements from both the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office said Saturday morning. Authorities did not offer further specifics. The Washington Post first reported on federal authorities boarding the ship. The raid came several months after investigators conducted a similar search of the Dali, the cargo ship that crashed into the bridge. In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department alleged that Dali owner Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and manager Synergy Marine, both of Singapore, recklessly cut corners and ignored known electrical problems on the vessel, which lost power multiple times minutes before it crashed into a support column on the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March. The Justice Department said mechanical and electrical systems on the massive ship had been 'jury-rigged' and improperly maintained, culminating in the power outages and a cascade of other failures that left its pilots and crew helpless in the face of looming disaster. The ship was leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka when its steering failed because of the power loss. Six members of a road work crew were killed when the bridge crumbled into the water. The collapse also snarled commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore for months before the channel was fully reopened in June. The Justice Department is seeking to recover more than $100 million the government spent to clear the underwater debris and reopen the city’s port. The companies filed a court petition days after the collapse seeking to limit their legal liability in what could become the most expensive marine casualty case in history. Justice Department officials said there is no legal support for that bid to limit liability and pledged to vigorously contest it. In its lawsuit, which also seeks punitive damages, the Justice Department argued that vessel owners and operators need to be 'deterred from engaging in such reckless and exceedingly harmful behavior.' That includes Grace Ocean and Synergy themselves because the Dali has a 'sister ship,' authorities wrote in the claim. The two companies 'need to be deterred because they continue to operate their vessels, including a sister ship to the Dali, in U.S. waters and benefit economically from those activities,' the lawsuit says. Darrell Wilson, a Grace Ocean spokesperson, confirmed that the FBI and Coast Guard boarded the Maersk Saltoro in the Port of Baltimore on Saturday morning. Wilson has previously said the owner and manager 'look forward to our day in court to set the record straight.' Like the Dali, the Singapore-flagged Saltoro was built by Hyundai in 2015. According to the Justice Department lawsuit, major issues with the Dali’s electrical system might have resulted from excessive vibrations on the ship that can loosen wires and damage connections. A prior captain of the vessel had reported 'heavy vibration' in his handover notes in May 2023, saying he had made similar reports to Synergy in the past, according to the complaint. The lawsuit noted cracked equipment in the engine room and pieces of cargo shaken loose. The ship’s electrical equipment was in such bad condition that an independent agency stopped further electrical testing because of safety concerns, according to the lawsuit. The ship had also experienced power outages while it was still docked in Baltimore. Those blackouts are considered 'reportable marine casualties' that must be reported to the U.S. Coast Guard, which authorities say never happened. The Dali, which was stuck amid the wreckage of the collapse for months before it could be extricated and refloated, departed Norfolk, Virginia, on Thursday afternoon en route to China on its first international voyage since the March 26 disaster. Justice Department officials refused to answer questions Wednesday about whether a criminal investigation into the bridge collapse remains ongoing. FBI agents boarded the Dali in April.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-agents-have-boarded-vessel-managed-by-company-whose-ship-collapsed-baltimore-bridge-/7793702.html	2024-09-21T17:19:59-07:00	
Hong Kong diaspora media in Britain reports 'government-backed attacks'	london — The Chaser, a news website run by Hong Kong journalists in Britain, says Google informed the diaspora media outlet that its company email was being targeted by 'government-backed attacks.' China is presumed to be behind the attacks, something Beijing denies. Analysts say the case highlights the growing difficulties Hong Kong journalists face both at home and overseas. On Tuesday, The Chaser published a report about the incident on its website, including a screenshot of the email from Google about the government-backed attack. The email listed the severity of the attack as high. According to Google, only 0.1% of users worldwide have been subjected to similar attacks. Google also pointed out that it cannot rule out that the warning may be a false alarm, but the company believes it has detected suspicious activities. These could include attempts to steal passwords or personal information through emails containing harmful attachments, harmful software download links or links to fake websites. VOA reached out to Google for more details on the attack but has yet to receive a response. 'There is no way out' The Chaser said it immediately reviewed all online security measures after receiving the notice and has taken the necessary protective actions. The Chaser said in a statement, 'At a time when Hong Kong's press is mired in the White Terror, the invisible black hand has unscrupulously reached out to the diaspora media overseas. 'Our team members are from Hong Kong and came to the UK three years ago, hoping to continue chasing news on free soil. In today's turbulent world of press freedom in Hong Kong, there is no way out. Our team strongly condemns all threats to press freedom and pledges to remain at our posts.' VOA efforts to seek a response from China's Embassy in Britain were unsuccessful, but the Chinese Embassy in Washington denied that China was involved in the cyberattack. 'China firmly opposes and cracks down on all forms of cyberattacks in accordance with law. Without valid evidence, they jumped to an unwarranted conclusion and made groundless accusations against China,' the embassy said in an emailed statement Thursday. 'It is extremely irresponsible and is a complete distortion of facts. China firmly opposes this.' Last month, The Chaser released an investigative report that said the Chinese Embassy in Britain had pressured Dragons Teaching, a British publishing house, in 2018 to remove the phrase 'Republic of China' from chapters about Taiwan in Chinese textbooks. The Republic of China is Taiwan's official name. Beijing is relentless in its global campaign to quash any recognition of the democratically ruled island — no matter how small. The publishing house eventually gave in to pressure from Beijing, according to the report from The Chaser. The textbooks are used in exams for secondary school courses in Britain. The Chinese Embassy in Britain has declined to comment on the incident and report, though other British media picked up the story. Journalists report harassment The cyberattack comes as journalists in Hong Kong are under increasing pressure. Last week, the Hong Kong Journalists Association said that from June to August of this year, dozens of journalists, their families, employers, landlords or neighbors were harassed and intimidated in different ways on the internet and in their daily lives, which was unprecedented. Benson Wong, a Hong Kong political scholar living in Britain, doesn't believe the attacks on The Chaser and other Hong Kong journalists are purely coincidental, especially as China's National Day is approaching. 'From their point of view, it is understandable that the national security and intelligence units would do some things or do some 'homework' as part of their performance,' he said. He said he believes the attack is meant to send a signal that Hong Kong journalists who make critical remarks about China cannot expect to be safe from interference or even attacks just because they move overseas. VOA reached out to Britain's National Cyber Security Center for comment on the attack but has yet to receive a response.

Japanese boy’s death sparks worry, debate	washington — The killing of a Japanese schoolboy in southern China has sparked worry among Japanese expatriots living in China, while online comments from Chinese people show reactions ranging from shock to cynicism. The 10-year-old boy, surnamed Shen, was stabbed by a 44-year-old man while the boy was on his way to class on the morning of September 18 near a Japanese school in the southern city of Shenzhen, according to China’s Foreign Ministry. The child, whose father is Japanese and mother is Chinese, was a Japanese national, according to the ministry. He was taken to a hospital and later died of his injuries. The boy was attending Shenzhen Japanese School, an international school built to serve the children of Japanese expatriots living in the region, an industrial hub where many Japanese firms, especially auto companies, set up factories decades ago. Only Japanese citizens are qualified to go to this school. A Shenzhen local newspaper said the suspect, surnamed Zhong, acted alone and was arrested by police on site. The same report said Zhong has confessed to stabbing the boy. Zhong, who has a previous criminal record, was released on bail by local police on suspicion of 'damaging public telecommunications facilities' in 2015 and was detained on suspicion of 'fabricating facts and disturbing public order' in 2019, according to the report. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida expressed his condolences in a tweet on X, calling it 'an extremely despicable crime,' and strongly urged China 'to provide an explanation of the facts of the situation.' The stabbing was the third high-profile attack on a foreigner in China in recent months. In June, a Chinese man wounded a Japanese woman and her child in a stabbing attack in front of a school bus in the eastern city of Suzhou. The man also stabbed a Chinese bus attendant who tried to intervene, and the attendant later died of her injuries. Also in June, four U.S. college instructors teaching in the northeastern city of Jilin were stabbed while visiting a public park. The American teachers suffered minor injuries and have since returned to the United States. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said these attacks are 'isolated incidents' and said they would safeguard expatriots’ security in China. However, the Chinese government is notoriously secretive about criminal investigations. Very little information has been published about the two attacks in June beyond the suspects’ last names and their employment status. Nicholas Burns, the United States ambassador to China, criticized Beijing’s limited release of specifics and said that he was actively pressing for more details. Japanese firms, especially auto companies with a presence in China, have warned their workers to stay vigilant. Toshiba and Toyota have told their staff to take precautions against any possible violence. Panasonic is offering its employees free flights home. Mitsubishi and Nissan have communicated with their Japanese employees in China to ease their worries and offered counseling services. Consequence of xenophobia propaganda Meanwhile, Chinese people have shown contrasting reactions in their online comments about the latest stabbing incident. Some expressed shock, sadness and anger. A few local residents in Shenzhen laid flowers and notes of apology to the deceased child outside the Japanese school. A user called 'sara jon' said on X, 'Aren’t you heartbroken when you hear the boy’s mother cry. This is a terrorist attack, this is Hamas.' Another X user called 'Jamy felando' said, 'Poor child, hope he gets peace now and hope the devil goes to hell!' On China’s X-like but censored social platform Weibo, many expressed cynicism and indifference, viewing the attack in light of atrocities committed during Japan's invasion of China 80 years ago. 'The boomerang of the Japanese invaders finally came back to their own people,' wrote a Weibo user called yaxuefensitangtaijia. 'If they had not invaded China and massacred the Chinese, perhaps there would be less extreme anti-Japanese sentiment today.' Someone else said in agreement: 'How many Chinese children died when Japan invaded China?' It’s not clear if Zhong deliberately chose to commit his crime on September 18, a date considered by many Chinese as 'national humiliation day.' The Japanese army officially launched its invasion of China on September 18, 1931, leading to a 14-year-long war and estimated casualties of 10 million military and civilians. Some Chinese say long-lasting anti-Japan propaganda by the Chinese government led to the violence toward Japanese people. A user called 'still typhoon' compared the propaganda to poison on Weibo: 'The poison has backfired. Xenophobia and extreme nationalism are rampant online now.' On Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that 'China and Japan reached a consensus' on the discharge of radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant, bringing to an end a diplomatic dispute that had rumbled on for more than two years. Beijing had been bashing Tokyo for causing 'a major nuclear safety issue with cross-border implications,' when Tokyo started discharging treated radioactive water from the site in August 2023. It also announced a blanket ban on all aquatic products from Japan. The anti-Japan sentiment reached a climax in August when official Chinese news media lashed out against Japan relentlessly.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japanese-boy-s-death-sparks-worry-debate-/7793024.html	2024-09-21T16:20:47-07:00	
Russia, China start naval exercises in Sea of Japan, report agencies	moscow — Russia and China started naval exercises in the Sea of Japan on Saturday, Russian news agencies cited Russia's Pacific Fleet as saying. 'A joint detachment of warships of the Pacific Fleet and Chinese Navy set out from Vladivostok to conduct the joint Russian-Chinese 'Beibu/Interaction - 2024' naval exercise,' the RIA news agency quoted the Pacific Fleet as saying. The exercises will include anti-aircraft and anti-submarine weapons, RIA reported. Russia and China practiced missile and artillery firing this month as part of Ocean-2024 naval drills, which Russian President Vladimir Putin cast as a bid to counter the United States in the Pacific.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-china-start-naval-exercises-in-sea-of-japan-agencies-report-/7793505.html	2024-09-21T16:14:13-07:00	
2 months after divisive elections, France announces center-right government	paris — The French presidential palace unveiled a new center-right government Saturday, more than two months after elections that produced a hung parliament and deepened political divisions as France grapples with economic and diplomatic challenges. Conservative French Prime Minister Michel Barnier put together the government after weeks of difficult negotiations, and President Emmanuel Macron approved it. The new government was announced at the presidential palace. A left-wing coalition secured the most seats in June-July elections but failed to win an outright majority. The 38-member Cabinet announced Saturday includes primarily ministers from Macron's centrist alliance and the conservative Republicans party. Jean-Noel Barrot is the new foreign minister, a centrist politician from MoDem known for his work in digital transformation and European affairs. He brings extensive experience in navigating complex international issues, notably within the European Union. The new finance minister is Antoine Armand, an emerging figure in French politics now tasked with steering France's fiscal policies and managing the upcoming 2025 budget amid pressure from Brussels to address France's mounting debt. Sebastien Lecornu retains his post as defense minister. He has been instrumental in bolstering France's military capabilities, including modernizing defense systems and managing military aid to Ukraine. His leadership in defense will be crucial as France navigates its role within NATO and handles rising geopolitical tensions over the wars in Ukraine and the Mideast. The interior minister’s job goes to Bruno Retailleau, a staunch conservative who will now handle critical domestic issues such as national security, immigration, and law enforcement. Barnier's ability to govern effectively is under scrutiny, with his political opponents on the left vowing to challenge him at every turn. The party of far-left Jean-Luc Melenchon, France Unbowed, held protests Saturday against his government and calls Barnier's appointment a rejection of the voters' will. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally said it would monitor the government closely and has enough votes in parliament to bring it down but expressed willingness to cooperate on key budgetary issues.	https://www.voanews.com/a/months-after-divisive-elections-france-announces-center-right-government/7793501.html	2024-09-21T16:02:39-07:00	
Biden and Japan's Kishida discuss shared concerns over South China Sea	washington — President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida discussed diplomacy with China and their shared concerns over 'coercive and destabilizing activities' in the South China Sea during a meeting on Saturday at the Quad Leaders Summit in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said. Biden and Kishida also reiterated their resolve to maintain peace across the Taiwan strait and commitment to developing and protecting technologies such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors, the White House said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-and-japan-s-kishida-discuss-shared-concerns-over-south-china-sea/7793498.html	2024-09-21T15:43:57-07:00	
In final months in office, Biden puts personal touch on Asia-Pacific diplomacy	WILMINGTON, Delaware — U.S. President Joe Biden is showcasing the Indo-Pacific partnership he has nurtured since taking office as he hosts the leaders of Australia, Japan and India in his hometown Saturday with an eye on his legacy as well. When Biden entered the White House, he looked to elevate the so-called Quad, which until then had only met at the foreign minister level, to a leader-level partnership as he tried to pivot U.S. foreign policy away from conflicts in the Middle East and toward threats and opportunities in the Indo-Pacific. This weekend's summit is the fourth in-person and sixth overall gathering of the leaders since 2021. Biden put a personal touch on the engagement — potentially the last of the group before he leaves office on January 20 — by opening his home in Wilmington, Delaware, to each of the leaders and hosting a joint meeting and formal dinner at the high school he attended more than 60 years ago. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida came for the meetings before their appearances at the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week. 'You guys have heard the president say many times that all politics is personal, all diplomacy is personal,' White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters as meetings were set to get underway. 'And developing personal relationships has been core to his approach to foreign policy as president. So, opening his home to the leaders of India, Japan and Australia is a way of him showing, not just saying, but these leaders matter to him.' Biden welcomes Albanese to his home On Friday afternoon, Biden welcomed Albanese to his home on a pond in a wooded area several miles west of downtown. Saturday's agenda included hosting Kishida and Modi and bringing all the leaders together for talks at Archmere Academy in nearby Claymont. Sullivan described the vibe of the meeting with Albanese as 'two guys — one at the other guy’s home — talking in broad strokes about where they see the state of the world.' He said Biden and Albanese also swapped stories about their political careers. Reporters and photographers were prohibited from covering Biden’s individual meetings with the leaders, and Biden does not plan to do a news conference — a question-and-answer appearance that is typical at such international summits. As part of the summit, the leaders were set to announce new initiatives to bolster maritime security in the region — with enhanced coast guard collaboration through the Pacific and Indian oceans — and improve cooperation on humanitarian response missions. The measures are meant to serve as a counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. Sullivan said he expected Biden and Modi would discuss Modi's recent visits to Russia and Ukraine as well as economic and security concerns about China. Modi is the most prominent leader from a nation that maintains a neutral position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sullivan said Biden would underscore 'that countries like India should step up and support the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity' and that 'every country, everywhere, should refrain from supplying inputs to Russia’s war machine.' Biden, Kishida say farewell The gathering was also an opportunity for Biden and Japan's Kishida to bid each other farewell. Biden and Kishida, who are both stepping away from office amid sliding public support, count the tightening of security and economic ties among the U.S., Japan and South Korea as one of their most significant accomplishments. The two leaders sat down for their wide-ranging, one-on-one conversation on Saturday morning. The improved relations between Japan and South Korea, two nations with a deep and complicated history that have struggled to stay on speaking terms, have come amid worrying developments in the Pacific, including strides made by North Korea in its nuclear program and increasing Chinese assertiveness. Biden commended Kishida for demonstrating 'courage and conviction in strengthening ties' with South Korea, according to the White House. They also discussed China's 'coercive and destabilizing activities' in the Pacific, Russia's war against Ukraine, and emerging technology issues. The U.S. and Japan are negotiating through a rare moment of tension in the relationship. Biden, as well as presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, have opposed a $15 billion bid by Japan’s Nippon Steel to take over American-owned U.S. Steel. Biden administration officials indicated this week that a U.S. government committee's formal assessment of the proposed deal has yet to be submitted to the White House and may not come until after the November 5 election. Sullivan pushed back against speculation that the expected timing of the report could suggest Biden is having second thoughts about his opposition to the deal. The Biden administration promised that the leaders would issue a joint statement containing the strongest-ever language on China and North Korea to be agreed upon by the four countries. The White House said the leaders would also roll out an announcement related to Biden’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative, a long-running passion project of the president and his wife, Jill Biden, aimed at reducing cancer deaths. The Bidens’ son Beau died in 2015 at age 46 of brain cancer. White House officials said the leaders will unveil details about a new collaboration aimed at reducing cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific. As Biden’s time in office draws down, the White House also was celebrating the bipartisan, bicameral formation of a 'Quad Caucus' in Congress meant to ensure the longevity of the partnership regardless of the outcome of the November election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-final-months-in-office-biden-puts-personal-touch-on-asia-pacific-diplomacy/7793491.html	2024-09-21T15:32:39-07:00	
Kenya's president visits Haiti as UN considers future of peacekeeping efforts	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Kenyan President William Ruto arrived in Haiti on Saturday as the United Nations considers how to best support a peacekeeping mission of resource-strapped Kenyan and Jamaican forces that are struggling to contain the gangs terrorizing the Caribbean nation. Ruto stepped off the plane, walking past armed officers on a small patch of red carpet flanked by other officials. He headed to a Kenyan base at the airport where he was expected to meet with some of the police officers who are battling the gangs. Kenya was the first nation to send forces as part of a larger effort by the U.N. to offer international support to Haiti, which descended into turmoil following the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. About 400 Kenyan police are in Haiti. Earlier this month, about two dozen police officers and soldiers from Jamaica arrived in the country. But the United States and other countries have said that the forces aren't enough and lack resources to take on gangs, which control about 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. The mission is expected to have a total of 2,500 personnel, with the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin and Chad also pledging to send police and soldiers, although it wasn't clear when that would happen. While the U.S. has suggested a U.N. peacekeeping force, the idea would be far-fetched and controversial given the cholera and sexual abuse cases that occurred when United Nations troops were last in Haiti. Meanwhile, a U.N. human rights expert warned on Friday that gang violence is spreading across Haiti and that Haiti's National Police still lack the 'logistical and technical capacity' to fight gangs, which continue to expand into new territory. Ruto's visit also comes days after Haiti created a provisional electoral council long sought by the international community to facilitate the first general election held in the country since 2016. In the power vacuum left by Moise's assassination, gangs have seized more and more power. Many hope a general election will also help restore order to Haiti alongside the peacekeeping mission.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-s-president-visits-haiti-as-un-considers-future-of-peacekeeping-efforts/7793479.html	2024-09-21T14:38:30-07:00	
Iran's supreme leader says Israel is committing 'shameless crimes' against children		https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-supreme-leader-says-israel-is-committing-shameless-crimes-against-children-/7793470.html	2024-09-21T14:17:35-07:00	
Zelenskyy will visit US ammunition factory to thank workers	washington — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday will visit the U.S. ammunition factory that is producing one of the most critically needed munitions for Ukraine's fight to fend off Russian ground forces. Zelenskyy is expected to go to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in the state of Pennsylvania to kick off a busy week in the United States shoring up support for Ukraine in the war, according to two U.S. officials and a third familiar with Zelenskyy's schedule who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that were not yet public. The Ukrainian leader also will address the United Nations General Assembly annual gathering in New York and travel to Washington for talks on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture 155 mm artillery shells. They are used in howitzer systems, which are towed large guns with long barrels that can fire at various angles. Howitzers can strike targets up to 15- 20 miles (24-32 kilometers) away and are highly valued by ground forces to take out enemy targets from a protected distance. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of the 155 mm shells from the U.S. Still pushing for permission With the war now well into its third year, Zelenskyy has been pushing the U.S. for permission to use longer range missile systems to fire deeper inside of Russia. So far he has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would be 'at war' with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. At one point in the war, Ukraine was firing between 6,000 and 8,000 of the 155 mm shells per day. That rate started to deplete U.S. stockpiles and drew concern that the level on hand was not enough to sustain U.S. military needs if another major conventional war broke out, such as a potential conflict over Taiwan. In response, the U.S. has invested in restarting production lines and is now manufacturing more than 40,000 155 mm rounds a month, with plans to hit 100,000 rounds a month. During his visit, Zelenskyy is expected meet and thank workers who have increased production of the 155 mm rounds over the past year. Two of the Pentagon leaders who have pushed that increased production through — Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology, and Bill LaPlante, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer — are also expected to join Zelenskyy at the plant, as is Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania. US largest donor of aid The 155 mm rounds are among the scores of ammunition, missile, air defense and advanced weapons systems the U.S. has provided Ukraine — everything from small arms bullets to advanced F-16 fighter jets. The U.S. has been the largest donor to Ukraine, providing more than $56 billion of the more than $106 billion NATO and partner countries have collected to aid in its defense. Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, commitment to its defense is seen by many European nations as a must to keep Putin from further military aggression that could threaten bordering NATO-member countries and result in a much larger conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-president-zelenskyy-will-visit-a-pennsylvania-ammunition-factory-to-thank-workers-/7793462.html	2024-09-21T13:57:34-07:00

Toll from Israeli airstrike on Beirut rises to 37, Lebanese ministry says	BEIRUT/JERUSALEM — An Israeli airstrike that targeted Hezbollah commanders in a Beirut suburb on Friday killed at least 37 people, including three children and seven women, the Lebanese health ministry said, as rescuers continue to search on Saturday for people missing in the rubble. Hezbollah said overnight that 16 of its members including senior leader Ibrahim Aqil and another top commander, Ahmed Wahbi, were among those killed in the deadliest strike in nearly a year of conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed group. The Israeli army, in posts on X, said the strike hit an underground gathering of Aqil and senior commanders of Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces, and had 'almost completely dismantled' Hezbollah's military chain of command. The attack leveled a multistory residential building in the crowded suburb and a nursery next door was damaged, a security source said. Heavy cross-border strikes continued on Saturday, with Israeli warplanes carrying out some of the heaviest bombings in 11 months of fighting across Lebanon's south and Hezbollah claiming rocket attacks on military targets in Israel's north. The Israeli army said it hit around 180 targets, destroying thousands of rocket launch barrels. Friday's strike sharply escalated the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, and inflicted another blow on Hezbollah after two days of attacks this week in which pagers and walkie-talkies used by its members exploded. The total death toll in those attacks has risen to 39, and more than 3,000 were injured. The attacks on communications devices were widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati canceled a planned trip to the United Nations General Assembly in New York over the escalating conflict, his office said in a statement. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said he was worried about an escalation between Israel and Lebanon but that the Israeli killing of a top Hezbollah leader may lead to a cease-fire with the group, which Washington designates as a terrorist group. 'While the risk of escalation is real, we actually believe there is also a distinct avenue to getting to a cessation of hostilities and a durable solution that makes people on both sides of the border feel secure,' Sullivan told reporters Saturday. Hezbollah has said it will keep fighting Israel until it agrees to a cease-fire in its war against Hamas in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. The war was triggered by a Hamas-led rampage in southern Israel on October 7. Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages. Israel believes Hamas is still holding about 100 hostages, the military believes about a third are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Israel hasn’t estimated the death toll recently but says that most of the dead are combatants. U.S. officials say a truce is unlikely to come anytime soon. Israel wants Hezbollah to cease fire and withdraw its forces from the border region irrespective of any Gaza deal. Hezbollah said overnight that 15 more of its members were killed, including senior commander Wahbi, who oversaw the military operations of the Radwan forces during the Gaza war until early 2024. In a brief statement on Friday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's goals were clear and its actions spoke for themselves. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who said this week Israel was launching a new phase of war on the northern border, posted on X: 'The sequence of actions in the new phase will continue until our goal is achieved: the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes.' Tens of thousands of people have left their homes on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border since Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel in October in sympathy with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel's military said on Saturday that airspace in northern Israel — from the city of Hadera north — was closed to private flights, but that the measure did not affect international flights. With at least 70 people killed in Lebanon this week, the death toll in the country since October has surpassed 740. The current conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is the worst since they fought an all-out war in 2006. While the current conflict has largely been contained to areas at or near the frontier, this week's escalation has heightened concerns that it could widen and further intensify.	https://www.voanews.com/a/toll-from-israel-s-airstrike-on-beirut-rises-to-37-lebanese-ministry-says-/7793448.html	2024-09-21T13:08:58-07:00	
Cambodia pulls out of regional development pact after protests	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said he was pulling his country out of a development agreement with neighboring Vietnam and Laos following protests that it was benefiting foreign interests. Critics on social media have focused on land concessions in border areas particularly with Vietnam, a highly sensitive issue because of Cambodia's historical antagonism toward its larger eastern neighbor. Authorities had arrested at least 66 people ahead of a planned August rally to condemn the Cambodia-Laos-Vietnam Development Triangle Area — or CLV-DTA. Most were later released but leaders are facing charges. The agreement, formalized in 2004, intended to facilitate cooperation on trade and migration in four northeastern provinces of Cambodia and border areas in Laos and Vietnam. Hun Manet called groups that opposed the agreement extremists and said they were using the issue to slander and attack the government and confuse the public. 'For instance, allegations that the government ceded the territory of the four northeastern provinces to foreign countries, etc,' he wrote in a post late Friday. He said that in the past 25 years Cambodia had built many achievements for the development of the four provinces but his government decided to pull out of the agreement, 'taking into account people's concern on territory and the need to withdraw weapons out of the hands of extremists to prevent them from using CLV-DTA to further cheat people.' Cambodia's government has long been accused of silencing critics and political opponents. Hun Manet succeeded his father last year after Hun Sen ruled for four decades, but there have been few signs of political liberalization.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodia-pulls-out-of-regional-development-pact-after-protests-/7793441.html	2024-09-21T12:40:59-07:00	
Israeli strike in Gaza City kills 22; military says Hamas targeted	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike on a school in northern Gaza on Saturday killed at least 22 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, while the Israeli army said that it targeted a Hamas command center in what used to be a school. Another 30 were wounded in the strike on the school in the Zeitoun area of Gaza City, the ministry said in a statement. Most of the casualties were women and children, it said. It wasn't immediately clear to which hospital the dead and injured were taken. Dozens of people, including children, dug through the rubble of the building — its ceilings caved in, walls knocked out and a mess of wires and metal rods visible. Outside, others gathered around shrouded bodies. Some covered their faces as they wept for relatives killed in the strike. 'A missile, a missile from the plane hit us, and another missile,' said Ferial Deloul, who is displaced. 'We saw the whole world covered with smoke and stones and we saw people and children cut up. … What should we do? What is our fault for this to happen to us?' The Israeli army said earlier Saturday that it struck Hamas' 'command and control center, which was embedded inside a compound that previously served' as a school. It said steps were taken to limit harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions and aerial surveillance. 5 Gaza ministry workers killed, it says Also on Saturday, the Gaza Health Ministry said five of its workers were killed and five others wounded by Israeli fire that struck the ministry's warehouses in the southern Musbah area. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, the Israeli army has struck several schools packed with tens of thousands of Palestinians driven from their homes by Israeli offensives and evacuation orders. The conflict has left 90% of Palestinians in Gaza displaced, according to figures from the United Nations. The military has accused Hamas of operating from within civilian infrastructure in Gaza, including schools, U.N. facilities and hospitals. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the U.S., U.K., EU and others. Israel targets Hamas, strikes school The contesting narratives over the use of schools and hospitals go to the heart of the nearly yearlong conflict. Earlier this month, an Israeli strike hit a school in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing 14, according to Palestinian medical officials. The Israeli military said that it was targeting Hamas militants planning attacks from inside the school. In July, Israeli airstrikes hit a girls' school in Deir al-Balah, killing at least 30 people sheltering inside. Israel's military said that it targeted a Hamas command center used to direct attacks against its troops and store 'large quantities of weapons.' The war began when Hamas-led fighters killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in an October 7, 2023, terror attack on southern Israel. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding about 100 hostages. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed at least 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between fighters and civilians. Israel has not recently estimated the death toll but says that most of the dead are combatants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strike-in-gaza-city-kills-22-military-says-hamas-targeted/7793404.html	2024-09-21T11:46:07-07:00	
Deadly mob violence underscores Bangladesh's security breakdown	Washington — A brutal mob lynching at Bangladesh’s oldest university has put a spotlight on the country's crumbling law and order, just as its fledgling interim government tries to assert control and push through sweeping institutional reforms. Late Wednesday, Tofazzal Hossein, a man known for struggling with mental health issues and roaming around the 102-year-old University of Dhaka, wandered into a residential hall. Accusing him of theft, a mob of students grabbed and savagely beat him over the course of several hours. By Thursday morning, Hossein, 35, was dead, the latest casualty in a wave of mob violence that has gripped Bangladesh since student protests ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and sent her fleeing the country last month. Mob violence and student vigilantism were commonplace during Hasina’s 15-year reign. Rights group Ain o Salish Kendra documented 32 mob killings between January and June, even before student protests toppled her government and left more than 1,000 people dead. But the lawlessness has spiraled out of control since the August 5 fall of the government. In the days that followed, police officers, fearful of student reprisals, vanished from the streets, creating a vacuum that has yet to be filled. In just five weeks since early August, 21 people were lynched across the country, according to a tally by the Daily Star, a leading Bangladeshi newspaper. One of the victims, a former student leader accused of attacking protesters in July, was himself beaten to death at another major university on Wednesday. University students, once hailed as democratic heroes, now stand accused of committing mob violence. Six face charges over Hossein's murder, with seven more implicated in the second case. The lawlessness has spread nationwide, leading to numerous incidents of extortion, harassment, intimidation and courtroom violence, sometimes triggering larger conflicts. In Bangladesh’s southern Chittagong Hill Tracts region, the lynching on Wednesday of a man accused of stealing a bike reignited long-simmering tensions between ethnic Bengalis and indigenous people. The ensuing violence has already claimed at least four lives, according to media reports. The unrest comes just days after the interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, granted the army sweeping law enforcement powers to restore order. At stake are more than domestic peace and the stability of the country's industrial regions. Yunus' six-week-old government has set up six commissions to advance democratic reforms, including a panel tasked with changing the country’s 51-year-old Constitution. The instability in Bangladesh, South Asia's third-most-populous country, is also drawing regional scrutiny, with Indian politicians voicing concern about reports of attacks on Hindus. The Bangladeshi army's 60-day new powers, announced Tuesday, allow commissioned officers to act as 'executive magistrates,' making arrests, conducting searches, dispersing unlawful assemblies and opening fire in extraordinary circumstances. Asif Nazarul, the interim government’s law adviser, said the government acted in response to 'subversive acts' and instability, particularly in the country's industrial areas. 'Given the situation, army personnel have been given magistracy power,' Nazarul was quoted in the Daily Star. Rattled by growing insecurity, many Bangladeshis have welcomed the army’s new power. Noting that security remains a 'big challenge' for the interim government, Badiul Alam Majumdar, editor of Citizens for Good Governance, told VOA, 'It has been done to maintain law and order in view of the overall situation. It has been done temporarily. I hope the position will change.' Accused of using violence during the anti-government protests, Bangladeshi police became targets of student anger after Hasina’s ouster. Police stations were looted, and several officers were killed or burned to death, their bodies hanged from overpasses. With no one held accountable in those cases, police fear for their safety. Many have yet to return to their posts, leaving the police forces understaffed and barely functioning. Julia Bleckner, a senior Bangladesh researcher at Human Rights Watch, said while the government has a responsibility to maintain law and order, giving the army 'unchecked' powers raises concerns about abuse. 'They've been given a mandate to carry out pretty widespread and arbitrary searches, detentions and arrests,' Bleckner said in a phone interview with VOA. The army can now arrest anyone on the spot for 'disturbing the peace' and use civilian personnel to disperse 'illegal assemblies,' Bleckner noted. 'We are under a new government that has made massive commitments and very important commitments to human rights, but these are the same security forces that have carried out abuses for decades,' Bleckner said. The Bangladeshi army last wielded similar law enforcement powers during the country’s 2006-2008 political crisis. At the time, military personnel were accused of making arbitrary arrests and other human rights abuses. Nazarul, the law adviser, said he did not believe the army would 'misuse this authority,' according to the Daily Star. But critics remain unconvinced. 'It is not right,' ZI Khan Panna, a veteran lawyer, said of the army’s magistracy power, according to the Daily Star. 'Has the government lost confidence in the magistrates? It is not right for army personnel to perform magistrate's duties under the deputy commissioners. It would not be wise to mix army personnel with the general public.' In the three days since receiving policing powers, the army has not announced any arrests. However, it has faced criticism for failing to quell violence. Nolen Deibert, head of Freedom House’s Asia Religious and Ethnic Freedom Program, noted that the attacks against indigenous communities in the Chittagong Hill Tracks region came as 'the army allegedly stood by and watched.' The interim government's home affairs adviser, Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, said a high-level committee will be formed to investigate the violence, Reuters reported. 'The country faces real risks of heightened conflict and threats of violence toward minority groups,' Deibert said via email. 'The interim government must come up with a plan to return policing powers to civilian authorities who will fairly protect and serve all Bangladeshis, regardless of race or creed.' VOA’s Bangla Service contributed to this article.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-mob-violence-underscores-bangladesh-s-security-breakdown/7793384.html	2024-09-21T10:37:44-07:00	
Humanitarian crisis in Syria threatens to spiral out of control	GENEVA — U.N. investigators are warning the humanitarian crisis in Syria threatens to spiral out of control as violence increases and the collapsing economy keeps the population mired in poverty and hopelessness 13 years after civil war erupted in the country. 'As world attention and resources shift to other grave political or humanitarian crises, Syria descends further into a quagmire of misery and despair,' Paulo Pinheiro, chair of the U.N. Syria Commission of Inquiry, told the U.N. human rights council Friday. In presenting the latest report by the three-member commission, Pinheiro painted a dark picture of a society that has fallen into an abyss of 'multiple failures and missed opportunities.' 'We have seen 13 years of internal armed conflict brought about by the Syrian state’s violent and repressive response to peaceful demonstrations,' he said. 'Our report to you documents continuing arbitrary detentions with state officials continuing to forcibly disappear, torture and ill-treat detainees in their custody.' The report says that fighting has intensified along multiple front lines, as disparate military forces use heavy artillery to maintain territorial control and resort to intensified violence against their perceived political opponents. It accuses these militias of committing a litany of human rights violations and abuses against the civilian population, increasing the fear 'of a large-scale war' breaking out. For example, the report says that in the northwest of the country, conflict between a Syrian terrorist organization, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, and some factions of the Syrian National Army continue to 'arbitrarily detain, torture and disappear civilians and those perceived as political opponents.' The report cites intensified fighting by Syrian government forces in the Idlib area of northwest Syria, where civilians have been killed, injured and maimed 'in unlawful attacks' with cluster munitions in densely populated urban centers. In the incidents investigated by the commission, the report finds more than 150 civilians, half of them women and children, were killed and injured by government forces. The vast majority were in indiscriminate ground attacks near frontline villages and towns 'in violation of international humanitarian law.' 'Such attacks may amount to war crimes,' it says, noting that 'airstrikes by Syria’s ally, Russia, again led to casualties.' 'Aerospace forces of the Russian Federation may have failed to take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians, in violation of international humanitarian law,' authors of the report say. Syria’s ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, Haydar Ali Ahmad, responded to the report by calling the commission’s mandate into question and branding the commissioners as 'nothing but tools designed to implement specific agendas' of certain Western powers. 'What is the benefit of such mandates when we are faced with a commission of inquiry whose task is not to investigate but establish the misleading Western narrative on the situation in Syria?' he said. 'Regrettably, it has betrayed the principles of impartiality, objectivity, independence and transparency.' Commission Chair Pinheiro expressed particular alarm at 'the heightened regional tensions stemming from the conflict' in Israel and Lebanon. 'These have led to intensified Israeli airstrikes — and last week a raid into Syria —targeting Iranian officials and militias across Syria, causing civilian casualties on at least three occasions,' he said. 'Iranian-affiliated groups and the U.S. have stepped up attacks on each other in northeast Syria since the start of the Gaza war.' He warned of the dangers to the system of international law itself 'if the member states charged with upholding it are seen to be failing in this obligation,' a sentiment shared by Geir O. Pedersen, U.N. special envoy for Syria. In a briefing Friday to the Security Council, Pedersen said he was deeply alarmed at the reports of 'a large number of communication devices exploding across Lebanon as well as in Syria … resulting in casualties, including children, and subsequent Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon and Hezbollah rocket fire into Israel.' 'There is a clear and present danger of a wider regional war that drags the Syrian people into its crosshairs,' he said. Pinheiro cited multiple other ongoing military operations in different parts of Syria by various military groups intent on seizing land, extorting money and other possessions for personal gain, regardless of the costs. 'Civilians continue to be killed on a daily basis in a senseless war that has left the country economically and politically broken, dramatically eroding the social fabric,' he said. The United Nations reports more than 306,000 civilians have been killed in Syria since civil war broke out in 2011, and nearly 14 million have been forcibly displaced, 7.2 million inside Syria and 5.6 million as refugees in neighboring countries, across Europe and beyond. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports 16.7 million people, or 3 in every 4 people in Syria, need humanitarian assistance. Of those, 13 million face acute food insecurity, and upwards of 650,000 children under the age of 5 are stunted from severe malnutrition. 'Living conditions are increasingly desperate, and we note the failure of the international community to fund more than a quarter of the U.N.’s [$4.9 billion] 2024 humanitarian response plan,' Pinheiro said. 'Overall, Syria’s GDP has shrunk by more than half since 2011, a result of the combined effect of destruction of infrastructure and economic networks, forced displacement of more than half the population, predatory practices and rampant corruption,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/humanitarian-crisis-in-syria-threatens-to-spiral-out-of-control/7793374.html	2024-09-21T10:14:48-07:00	
California governor signs law to protect children from social media addiction	SACRAMENTO, California — California will make it illegal for social media platforms to knowingly provide addictive feeds to children without parental consent beginning in 2027 under a new law Governor Gavin Newsom signed Friday. California follows New York state, which passed a law earlier this year allowing parents to block their kids from getting social media posts suggested by a platform's algorithm. Utah has passed laws in recent years aimed at limiting children's access to social media, but those have faced challenges in court. The California law will take effect in a state home to some of the largest technology companies in the world. Similar proposals have failed to pass in recent years, but Newsom signed a first-in-the-nation law in 2022 barring online platforms from using users' personal information in ways that could harm children. It is part of a growing push in states across the country to try to address the impact of social media on the well-being of children. 'Every parent knows the harm social media addiction can inflict on their children — isolation from human contact, stress and anxiety, and endless hours wasted late into the night,' Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement. 'With this bill, California is helping protect children and teenagers from purposely designed features that feed these destructive habits.' The law bans platforms from sending notifications without permission from parents to minors between midnight and 6 a.m., and between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. on weekdays from September through May, when children are typically in school. The legislation also makes platforms set children's accounts to private by default. Opponents of the legislation say it could inadvertently prevent adults from accessing content if they cannot verify their age. Some argue it would threaten online privacy by making platforms collect more information on users. The law defines an 'addictive feed' as a website or app 'in which multiple pieces of media generated or shared by users are, either concurrently or sequentially, recommended, selected, or prioritized for display to a user based, in whole or in part, on information provided by the user, or otherwise associated with the user or the user's device,' with some exceptions. The subject garnered renewed attention in June when U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms and their impacts on young people. Attorneys general in 42 states endorsed the plan in a letter sent to Congress last week. State Senator Nancy Skinner, a Democrat representing Berkeley who wrote the California law, said that 'social media companies have designed their platforms to addict users, especially our kids.' 'With the passage of SB 976, the California Legislature has sent a clear message: When social media companies won't act, it's our responsibility to protect our kids,' she said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-governor-signs-law-to-protect-children-from-social-media-addiction/7793355.html	2024-09-21T09:32:40-07:00	
US, UK, Norway say South Sudan poll delay shows leadership 'failure'	Washington — The United States, the United Kingdom and Norway expressed 'deep concern' on Saturday at the announcement of a two-year delay in elections in South Sudan, terming the extension of a transitional government a 'failure.' 'This announcement demonstrates the persistent and collective failure of South Sudan’s leaders to create the conditions necessary to hold credible and peaceful elections,' said a joint statement from the three governments. South Sudan won independence from Sudan in 2011 but was plunged into a civil war two years later that killed an estimated 400,000 people. A 2018 peace deal brought together President Salva Kiir and bitter rival Vice President Riek Machar, but efforts to write a constitution and hold the country's first elections have been repeatedly delayed. Last week, Kiir's office announced that voting planned for December would be pushed back by another two years, ahead of a Sunday deadline for the transitional government to be dissolved. Cabinet Affairs Minister Martin Elia Lomuro said the extension was 'in response to the recommendations from both electoral institutions and the security sector.' The three countries 'acknowledged' that polls could not be held as scheduled in December and blamed 'a lack of political will.' 'Responsibility for this failure is shared by all parties in the transitional government,' said the statement. 'As South Sudan's leaders vie for power and fail to organize credible and peaceful elections, the people of South Sudan suffer the consequences.' Earlier this week, the United Nations expressed 'regret and disappointment' at the delay. 'Two years ago, we were in a similar situation, as we are today, and gave our support specifically under the condition that there would be no more extensions,' U.N. special representative Nicholas Haysom said in a statement. South Sudan has battled flooding, hunger and violence, while its leaders have appeared reluctant to risk going to the polls and are accused of massive corruption. Earlier this month, the U.N.'s humanitarian agency warned that more than 700,000 people had been affected by flooding, with aid failing to meet many in need. South Sudan boasts plentiful oil resources, but the vital source of revenue was cut in February when an export pipeline was damaged in war-torn Sudan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-uk-norway-say-south-sudan-poll-delay-shows-leadership-failure-/7793349.html	2024-09-21T09:21:15-07:00	
Parts of US Midwest could offer fall's most vibrant foliage	PORTLAND, Maine — Fall is back, and bringing with it jack-o'-lanterns, football, pumpkin spice everything and — in some parts of the country — especially vibrant foliage. Leaves around the northern United States are starting to turn orange, yellow and red, inspiring legions of leaf lovers to hop in their cars and travel to the countryside for the best look at fall's fireworks. Leaf peeping — the act of traveling to witness nature's annual kaleidoscope — contributes billions of dollars to the economy, especially in New England and New York. But this year, some of the most colorful displays could be in the Midwest. AccuWeather, the commercial forecasting service, said in early September that it expects especially vibrant foliage in states such as Michigan and Illinois. The service also said powerful, popping colors are expected in upstate New York and parts of Pennsylvania, while New England will follow a more typical color pattern. But that doesn't mean New England travelers will miss out. Maine, the most forested state in the country, had 'an abundance of daily sunshine with just the right amount of rainfall to set the stage for a breathtaking foliage season,' said Gale Ross, the state's fall foliage spokesperson. Color change and timing depend on the weather in the fall, but cooler nighttime temperatures and shorter days should enhance the colors, Ross said. 'The growing season of 2024 has been excellent for trees, supporting tree health and resilience that should lead to brilliant fall colors throughout Maine,' said Aaron Bergdahl, the state's forest pathologist. Fall colors peak at different times around the U.S., with the foliage season sometimes starting not long after Labor Day in the far northern reaches of the country and extending into November further to the south. In Maine alone, peak foliage can arrive in the northern part of the state in late September and not arrive in coastal areas until close to Halloween. Leaf turn happens when summer yields to fall and temperatures drop and the amount of sunlight decreases. Chlorophyll in leaves then breaks down, and that allows their fall colors to shine through before leaf drop. However, weather conditions associated with climate change have disrupted some recent leaf peeping seasons. A warming planet has brought drought that causes leaves to turn brown and wither before reaching peak colors. Other enemies of leaf peeping include heat waves that cause leaves to fall before autumn arrives and extreme weather events like hurricanes that strip trees of their leaves. A summer heatwave in the Pacific Northwest in 2021 caused a condition called 'foliage scorch' that prematurely browned leaves. This year in Maine, leaf turn was still very sparse in most of the state as late September approached, but the state office of tourism was already gearing up for an influx of tourists. Northern Maine was already experiencing moderate color change. And neighboring New Hampshire was expecting about 3.7 million visitors — more than twice the state's population. 'It's no surprise people travel from all over the world to catch the incredible color,' said New Hampshire Travel and Tourism Director Lori Harnois.	https://www.voanews.com/a/parts-of-us-midwest-could-offer-fall-s-most-vibrant-foliage/7793339.html	2024-09-21T09:11:44-07:00	
Climate protesters say pace of change isn't fast enough	NEW YORK — Six years after a teenage Greta Thunberg walked out of school in a solitary climate protest outside of the Swedish parliament, people around a warming globe marched in youth-led protest, saying their voices are being heard but not sufficiently acted upon. Emissions of heat-trapping gases and temperatures have been rising and oil and gas drilling has continued, even as the protests that kicked off major weeklong climate events in New York City have become annual events. This year, they come days before the United Nations convenes two special summits, one concentrating on sea level rise and the other on the future. The young people who organized these marches with Fridays for Future said there is frustration with inaction but also hope. People marched in Berlin, Rio de Janeiro, New Delhi and elsewhere, but the focus often is in New York City because of Climate Week NYC. Diplomats, business leaders and activists are concentrating their discussions on the money end of fighting climate change — something not lost on protesters. 'We hope that the government and the financial sector make polluters pay for the damage that they have imposed on our environment,' said Uganda Fridays for Future founder Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, who was among a few hundred marching in New York Friday, a far cry from the tens of thousands that protested in a multigroup mega-rally in 2023. The New York protest wants to take aim at 'the pillars of fossil fuels' — companies that pollute, banks that fund them and leaders who are failing on climate, said Helen Mancini, an organizer and a senior at the city's Stuyvesant High School. 'A lot of older people want to make sure the economy is intact, and that's their main concern,' said Julia Demairo, a sophomore at Pace University. 'I think worrying about the future and the environment is worrying about the economy.' On a day that was at least 8 degrees warmer than average, protest signs included 'This is not what we mean by Hot Girl Summer,' while others focused on the theme of fighting the coal, oil and gas industries: 'Youth Didn't Vote for Fossil Fuels,' 'Don't Be a Fossil Fool' and 'Climate Crisis = Extermination By Capitalism.' Nakabuye said she was in New York to represent Uganda 'that is bearing the brunt of the climate crisis.' 'We feel like we are creating an impact in the community. However, we are not listened to enough; there is more that needs to be done, especially right now when the climate catastrophes are intensifying,' said Nakabuye. 'We need to even raise our voices more to demand change and to demand that fuels should end.' In the six years since Thunberg founded what became Fridays for Future, global carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels have increased by about 2.15%, according to Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who monitor carbon pollution. The growth of emissions has slowed compared with previous decades and experts anticipate peaking soon, but that's a far cry from the 43% reduction that a U.N. report said is needed to keep temperature increases to an agreed-upon limit. Since 2019, carbon dioxide emissions from coal have increased by nearly 900 million metric tons, while natural gas emissions have increased slightly and oil pollution has dropped a tiny amount, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. That growth has been driven by China, India and developing nations. But emissions from advanced or industrialized economies have been falling and in 2023 were the lowest in more than 50 years, according to the IEA. Coal emissions in rich countries are down to levels seen around the year 1900, and the United Kingdom next month is set to shutter its last coal plant. In the past five years, clean energy sources have grown twice as fast as fossil fuels, with solar and wind individually growing faster than fossil fuel-based electricity, according to the IEA. Developing countries — where more than 80% of the world population lives — say that they need financial help to curb their increasing use of fossil fuels. Since 2018, the globe has warmed more than 0.29 degrees Celsius, with last year setting a record for the hottest year and this year poised to break that mark, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the European climate agency Copernicus. 'We're making progress, even if it's slow progress,' said 17-year-old Ashen Harper of Connecticut, a veteran protester turned organizer. 'Our job right now is to accelerate that progress.' In Berlin, hundreds of people took to the streets, although in fewer numbers than in previous years. Activists held up signs saying, 'Save the Climate' and 'Coal is Over!' as they watched a gig put on outside the German Chancellor's Office. Protesters in London held up letters spelling out 'Pay Up,' calling for the country to pay more to adapt to climate change and transition away from fossil fuels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/climate-protesters-say-pace-of-change-isn-t-fast-enough/7793326.html	2024-09-21T09:02:01-07:00	
Czechs vote in Senate, regional elections in aftermath of flooding	PRAGUE — Czechs went to the polls on Friday in a two-day vote for a third of the seats in Parliament's upper house, which is the Senate, and to select their representatives in regional elections. The elections took place as the Czech Republic was recovering from massive floods that hit Central Europe in recent days. The floods claimed at least 24 lives in the region, five of them in the Czech Republic. State officials helped dozens of the hardest-hit towns organize the ballot in the northeast of the country, where schools and various other buildings that serve as polling stations were submerged and damaged. Interior Ministry officials took over the organization of the vote in five towns where local authorities were preoccupied with cleanup and recovery efforts. In some places, voting took place in tents, shipping containers or outside. The current ruling five-party coalition led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala has a clear majority in the 81-seat Senate, where 27 seats are up for grabs in the two-round election. The runoffs take place next week. Parliament's lower house dominates the legislative process, but the Senate plays an important role in passing constitutional amendments and approving Constitutional Court judges. In separate regional elections, a political movement led by former populist Prime Minister Andrej Babis is the favorite to win for the third straight time. Babis' ANO (YES), which is currently in opposition, is also favored to win the next general election, scheduled for next year. The results of the elections will be known late Saturday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/czechs-vote-in-senate-regional-elections-in-aftermath-of-flooding/7793302.html	2024-09-21T08:36:42-07:00

Striking Indian doctors set to resume essential services	KOLKATA, INDIA — Striking junior doctors in India's West Bengal state agreed to resume essential services, in a partial resumption of medical facilities, but they will continue their strike over the rape and murder of a colleague over a month ago. The rape and murder of the 31-year-old female doctor in West Bengal in August set off a wave of protests by doctors demanding greater workplace safety for women and justice for their slain colleague, prompting India's Supreme Court to create a hospital safety task force. The junior doctors will resume essential duties from Saturday, the West Bengal Junior Doctors' Front, which represents about 7,000 physicians in the state, said in a statement on Thursday. 'The movement for ‘justice’ will continue in each state-run hospital but we have decided to resume essential services in hospitals due to the flood situation in parts of the state,' said Aniket Mahato of the West Bengal Junior Doctors' Front. Doctors are demanding better security, included additional CCTV coverage, deployment of female security personnel and adequate lighting, toilets and resting spaces. A police volunteer has been arrested in connection with the doctor's rape and death in the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata. The former principal of the college has been arrested over accusations of evidence tampering and graft, and the Kolkata police chief has been replaced. Although tougher laws were introduced after the 2012 gruesome gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in national capital New Delhi, activists say the Kolkata case shows how women in the country continue to suffer from sexual violence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/striking-indian-doctors-set-to-resume-essential-services/7793273.html	2024-09-21T08:04:56-07:00	
Nigeria’s inflation rate dips, but Nigerians still feel the pinch	ABUJA, NIGERIA — The high inflation rate in Nigeria dropped slightly in August, but a decline in the value of the nairia and a continued increase in fuel prices are eroding the slight gains and threatening to reignite the inflationary trend. Michael Anthony, an engineer and father of four, still faces high costs despite the small drop in inflation, which fell from 33.40% in July to 32.15% in August. His household expenses remain steep, with no real relief in sight. 'In the month of July, I bought a bag of rice at the rate of 65,000 naira, but ... three days ago, I bought a bag of rice for 95,000 naira,' he said. 'If you want to buy anything, price has risen because of the price of fuel. I'm worried that inflation rate might rise again.' At a market in a suburb of Abuja, food trader Blessing Ochuba is also struggling. With customers unable to buy in bulk, she’s cutting back her stock and adjusting prices to stay in business. Ochuba said patronage has been slow despite the reported dip in inflation rate. 'People that normally buy in bags, they now buy like half or quarter ... because they can no longer afford to buy for now,' she said. 'I used to buy like 10 bags of rice, but now I cannot afford to buy five. Honestly, I did not see the coming down, everything is going higher. 'It's on the high side, and it is really affecting us.' Despite lower inflation, Nigeria’s currency has weakened from 1,200 to 1,600 to the dollar, and gasoline prices have soared from 620 to nearly 1,000 naira per liter over the past three months. Development economist Hauwa Mustapha credited a government policy in which food imports were not subject to excise duty for 90 days for the slight inflation drop. 'I think that helped a lot, and that also helped for them to boost the supply of food. ... It does not indicate a long-term recovery,' she said, adding that a lasting recovery will depend on government measures. 'What the government can do to manage inflationary pressure for both short term and long term, I think for now, is to concentrate policy action in the area of food supply,' Mustapha said. 'Thankfully, we are approaching the harvest season. Typically, in Nigeria, we also know that we experience a lot of post-harvest loss. This is ... the time for the country to manage the harvest, particularly control [and] minimize post-harvest losses, so that we can keep the food supply steady.' Experts say the government’s next steps will determine whether this inflation dip signals a recovery or just temporary relief.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-s-inflation-rate-dips-but-nigerians-still-feel-the-pinch/7793219.html	2024-09-21T06:35:50-07:00

Rights group says Myanmar military to execute activists	MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA/BANGKOK — A prominent Southeast Asian rights group said Friday that Myanmar’s ruling State Administration Council reportedly intends to execute five democracy activists Tuesday following their May 2023 conviction and sentencing for alleged involvement in a deadly 2021 shooting on a train in Yangon. The ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights said it was deeply troubled after receiving a report from what it called a reliable source about the pending executions, which were ordered when a civilian court delivered a verdict in a closed-door hearing held in Insein Prison. It said Zaryaw Phyo, 32; San Min Aung, 24; Kyaw Win Soe 33; Kaung Pyae Sone Oo, 27; and Myat Phyo Pwint, age unknown, were charged with murder and illegal weapons possession under several statutes, including the 1949 Arms Act and a 2014 counterterrorism law. 'The use of capital punishment as a tool to suppress dissent is unacceptable and must be condemned in the strongest terms,' Wong Chen, a Malaysian member of the parliamentarians group’s board, said in the group’s statement. The organization demanded the State Administration Council halt the executions and immediately release the five activists. The SAC is the official name of the military government formed in February 2021 when the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi was ousted by a coup d’etat, tipping the country into civil war. It said such actions represented a grievous infringement of human rights and a blatant disregard for international legal standards. 'We call upon the SAC to immediately release them and ensure that, pending their release, the detention conditions comply with international standards, including access to legal representation, medical care and contact with their family,' said Mercy Chriesty Barends, the chairperson of the parliamentarians group. Lawyers, families of the condemned and prison authorities contacted by VOA could not confirm whether the executions were scheduled to proceed Tuesday; however, one prison authority noted their bodies and necks had been measured regularly. Myanmar’s ruling military hanged four democracy activists in July 2022 after the SAC accused them of carrying out 'terror acts.' They were the first people to be executed in Myanmar in more than 40 years, leading to widespread international condemnation. Shortly after the executions, the G7 leading economies called on the ruling military to 'refrain from further arbitrary executions' and to free all political prisoners, warning the absence of fair trials showed the junta’s contempt for the democratic aspirations of the people of Myanmar. The parliamentarians group said it was 'particularly disconcerting' that the five executions would be carried out under the first death sentences ordered by a civilian judiciary — rather than a military tribunal — since the coup, signaling a disturbing shift in judicial proceedings in Myanmar. Jason Tower, country director for the Burma Program at the United States Institute of Peace, said the death sentences marked a hardening of attitudes by the junta, which has suffered a litany of losses on the battlefield since anti-regime forces launched an offensive last October. 'This is very concerning, and there’s not enough action on this internationally. The junta is out of control — atrocities are everywhere,' he told VOA, adding the broader international community had not done enough to counter an 'illegitimate regime that is perpetrating horrific violence.' He also said a recent shift in China’s posture toward Myanmar’s military regime had sent a signal that the junta can get away with mass atrocities and executing human rights defenders and political opponents without consequences. 'China has blatantly ignored a dramatic increase in junta airstrikes targeting civilians, IDP camps, schools and hospitals, moving forward with inviting senior junta officials to Chinese-led multilateral platforms,' he said. Those platforms include the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Xiangshan Forum and the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation. 'Participants in these platforms have failed to push back, and there are worrying signs the Association of Southeast Asian Nations could be tilting toward closer relations with the military regime despite the dramatic increase in atrocities and war crimes,' Tower said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rights-group-says-myanmar-military-to-execute-activists/7793140.html	2024-09-21T03:38:53-07:00

Thailand grants few asylum claims in first year of program	BANGKOK — Amid a reported surge in cross-border repression across Southeast Asia, rights advocates say Thailand is making promising but very slow progress rolling out an asylum program meant to protect the most vulnerable refugees. They say many who might be eligible for the program are reluctant to apply for fear of exposing themselves to the police and that coming forward could backfire. Thailand does not officially recognize refugees and deems anyone in the country without a valid visa or passport an illegal migrant. Last September, though, the government introduced a National Screening Mechanism to give 'protected persons status' to those from other countries who can prove they are 'unable or unwilling' to return home 'due to a well-founded fear of persecution.' Neither the Royal Thai Police – whose Immigration Bureau is leading the program – nor the National Security Council or Foreign Affairs Ministry, which both participate, replied to VOA’s repeated requests for comment on the NSM, which took effect September 22 of last year. At a meeting with aid groups last week, though, immigration officials said fewer than 10 people, including adults and their children, have been fully vetted and granted asylum under the program to date, participants from the aid groups told VOA. They say officials said one applicant had been rejected and that about 200 were still having their claims assessed. 'In terms of implementation, it’s not proportionate yet with the overall population of asylum seekers and refugees in Thailand,' said Krittaporn Semsantad, program director for Thailand’s Peace Rights Foundation, after attending last week’s meeting. 'I’d say they’re … trying to do their best,' she said of the government. 'However, there’s a lot of limitation.' The United Nations estimates some 5,000 asylum seekers are living in Thailand, though rights groups say the true number is likely higher. Human Rights Watch reported in May that Thailand had made itself increasingly dangerous for asylum seekers over the past decade through what rights groups claim is an arrangement with its neighbors to forcibly return each other’s dissidents, regardless of potential persecution, including arrest, torture and death. In recent years, Thailand has arrested and forced dozens of dissidents and members of persecuted ethnic minorities back to their home countries, including China. A rights activist from Vietnam, Y Quynh Bdap, was arrested in Bangkok in June and is now on trial for possible extradition back to Vietnam, where he is wanted for fomenting a deadly riot he says he had nothing to do with. Once accepted into Thailand’s new asylum program, refugees should be safe from a forced return home, but rights advocates say the NSM is moving far too slowly to cope with the need. They say the screening commission is struggling to verify the biographies of applicants, has too few interpreters to bridge language barriers, and that many potential applicants still don’t know the program even exists. Those who do, they add, can be put off by having to be formally charged with an immigration offense to go through the process. They say many also don’t trust the government to vet them fairly and fear that if their applications are rejected they could end up back in the countries they fled. 'They’re afraid that if they apply for NSM, they reveal themselves to the government, and if they [do] not meet the criteria of the NSM they will need to [be] deport[ed] back to their … home country,' said Tanyakorn Thippayapokin, policy advocacy coordinator for Asylum Access Thailand, who also attended last week’s meeting. Advocates say as well that the eligibility rules are too narrow by barring legal migrant workers — who may also be asylum seekers who need protection — from applying, and that the power the rules give the government to reject applicants over unspecified national security risks are too broad. By not having to explain the security risks, some worry, the government may turn worthy applicants down to either build or maintain good relations with neighboring countries. Opposition lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang, who chairs the House of Representatives subcommittee on sustainable solutions for migrants in the country illegally, cited the case of the four dozen ethnic Uyghurs from China who Thailand has been holding in detention without charges since arresting them for illegal entry over a decade ago. 'When they [use] the justification of the national security concern, it can [mean] everything in this world,' said Kannavee, who worked for the United Nations refugee agency for over a dozen years. 'For example, the Uyghurs. If they said it is a national security concern, we cannot put the 48 cases of the Uyghur refugees who’ve been put in the immigration detention center [through] the NSM, it can be like that,' he said. Krittaporn said she was told by immigration officials that the detained Uyghurs were eligible for the NSM, but she added that nongovernment groups have not been able to meet with them to check whether they have been given the chance to apply. Advocates suggest the government do more to inform asylum seekers and refugees about the program, hire more interpreters, and scale back the share of security agency officials on the screening commission. Some suggest it also scrap the need for applicants to be formally charged. As it is now, the program seems designed more for finding reasons to turn down applicants than to approve them, said Pornsuk Koetsawang, founder of Friends Without Borders, another local refugee aid group. 'The security agencies work for Thailand’s national security, not for protection of refugees, and they [refugees] worry that Thai security agencies … think that refugees are a threat,' she said. 'That’s the thing that has been happening for the past few decades.' Kannavee said transferring primary responsibility for the program from the police to the Interior Ministry would help give it a more humanitarian focus. He says the program may yet collapse from all its faults, though, and has been working on legislation that would give Thailand an entirely new refugee program. On the whole, though, most advocates say the NSM is at least a modest step in the right direction for Thailand and may still be able to spare some refugees from arrest and a forced return to the countries they have fled. Once vetted and approved, said Tanyakorn, 'they’re here legally at least and with the protection of the government authorities.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-grants-few-asylum-claims-in-first-year-of-program/7793119.html	2024-09-21T02:18:11-07:00	
Rapidly escalating Israel-Hezbollah conflict stirs fears of wider war	CAIRO — This week saw a dizzying escalation in the 11-month conflict between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. First came two days of exploding pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah — deadly attacks pinned on Israel that also maimed civilians around Lebanon. Hezbollah's leader vowed to retaliate and, on Friday, the militant group launched dozens of rockets into northern Israel. Later in the day, Israel said it killed the commander of Hezbollah’s most elite unit with a strike in Beirut that left at least 14 dead. Many fear the events are the prelude to an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite group that is Lebanon’s most powerful armed force. A war threatens to bring devastation in Lebanon, heavy missile fire into Israeli cities and further destabilization to a region already shaken by the Gaza war. During 11 months of exchanges of fire over the Lebanese-Israeli border, both sides have repeatedly pulled back when the spiral of reprisals appeared on the verge of going out of control, under heavy pressure from the U.S. and its allies. But in recent weeks, Israeli leaders have warned of a possible bigger military operation with the goal of stopping attacks from Lebanon to allow tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by the fighting to return to homes near the border. Here are some things to know about the situation: What were the latest strikes? An Israeli airstrike Friday brought down a high-rise building in Beirut’s southern suburbs, a Shi’ite-majority area known as Dahiyeh where Hezbollah has a strong presence. At least 14 people were killed and more than 60 wounded, the deadliest Israeli strike in the Lebanese capital since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. The Israeli military said the strike killed Ibrahim Akil, the commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan unit, as well as other top leaders of the unit. Hezbollah later confirmed Akil was killed, a heavy blow to Hezbollah’s most effective fighters. Israel said Akil led the group’s campaign of rocket, drone and other fire into northern Israel. The strike came after the shock of the electronic device bombings, in which hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated on Tuesday and Wednesday. At least 37 people were killed, including two children, and some 3,000 wounded. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. The casualties included some fighters from the group, but many of the wounded were civilians connected to Hezbollah’s social branches. Analysts say the attack has little effect on Hezbollah’s manpower, but could disrupt its communications and force it to take tighter security measures. What is the situation on the border? Hezbollah fired 140 rockets into northern Israel on Friday, saying it was targeting military sites in retaliation for overnight Israeli strikes into southern Lebanon. There was no immediate report of casualties. It was a continuation of the near daily drumbeat of exchanges over the border since the Gaza war began in October. The exchanges have killed some 600 people in Lebanon – mostly fighters but including around 100 civilians — and some 50 soldiers and civilians in Israel. It has also forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate homes near the border in both Israel and Lebanon. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has promised retaliation for the electronic device bombings, raising fears of an escalation from the group. But Hezbollah has also proved wary of further stoking the crisis – it has not carried out its vows of revenge from Israel’s killing of a top commander, Fouad Shukur, in July. Hezbollah says its attacks against Israel are in support of Hamas. This week, Nasrallah said the barrages won’t end – and Israelis won’t be able to return to homes in the north – until Israel’s campaign in Gaza ends. As fighting in Gaza has slowed, Israel has fortified forces along the border with Lebanon, including the arrival this week of a powerful army division that took part in some of the heaviest fighting in Gaza. It is believed to include thousands of troops, including paratrooper infantry units and artillery and elite commando forces specially trained for operations behind enemy lines. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant this week declared the start of a 'new phase' of the war as Israel turns its focus toward Hezbollah. 'The center of gravity is shifting to the north by diverting resources and forces,' he said. What is Israel planning? Israeli officials say they have not yet made an official decision to expand military operations against Hezbollah – and have not said publicly what those operations might be. This week, the head of Israel’s Northern Command was quoted in local media as advocating for a ground invasion of Lebanon. A U.N.-brokered truce to their 2006 war called on Hezbollah to pull back 29 kilometers from the border, but it has refused to, accusing Israel of also failing to carry out some provisions. Israel is now demanding Hezbollah withdraw eight to 10 kilometers from the border – the range of Hezbollah’s anti-tank guided missiles. Israel and Hezbollah’s 2006 war was a devastating monthlong fight triggered when Hezbollah fighters kidnapped two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid. In that war, Israel heavily bombarded southern Lebanon and Beirut and sent a ground invasion into the south. The strategy, later explained by Israeli commanders, was to inflict the maximum damage possible in towns and neighborhoods where Hezbollah operated to deter them from launching attacks. It became known as the 'Dahiyeh Doctrine,' named after Beirut suburbs where large areas were levelled during the war. But Israel could have a more ambitious and controversial goal this time: to seize a buffer zone in south Lebanon to push back Hezbollah fighters from the border. A fight to hold territory threatens a longer, even more destructive and destabilizing war – recalling Israel’s 1982-2000 occupation of southern Lebanon. What would be the impact of a full-blown war? The fear is that it could turn out even worse than the 2006 war, which was traumatic enough for both sides to serve as a deterrent ever since. The 2006 fighting killed hundreds of Hezbollah fighters and an estimated 1,100 Lebanese civilians and left large swaths of the south and even parts of Beirut in ruins. More than 120 Israeli soldiers were killed and hundreds wounded. Hezbollah missile fire on Israeli cities brought the war to the public, killing dozens of civilians. Now, Israel estimates that Hezbollah possesses some 150,000 rockets and missiles, some of which are precision-guided, putting the entire country within range of Hezbollah fire. Israel has beefed up air defenses, but it is unclear whether it can defend against the intense barrages expected in a new war. Israel has vowed it could turn all of southern Lebanon into a battle zone, saying Hezbollah has embedded rockets, weapons and forces along the border. And in the heightened rhetoric of the past months, Israeli politicians have spoken of inflicting the same damage in Lebanon that the military has wreaked in Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rapidly-escalating-israel-hezbollah-conflict-stirs-fears-of-wider-war/7793116.html	2024-09-21T01:56:13-07:00

Ukraine says Russian missile strike kills 3	Kyiv, Ukraine — An overnight Russian missile strike on the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih killed a 12-year-old boy and two elderly women, regional governor Serhiy Lysak said Saturday. 'Again, a terrifying enemy attack on Kryvyi Rih. In the middle of the night, when the city slept,' Lysak wrote on Telegram. He said three more people were injured and were taken to a hospital with injuries of medium severity. The two women killed by the attack were 75 and 79 years old. Lysak also said two buildings were destroyed and 20 more damaged. Kryvyi Rih, a major steel-producing city, is near Russian-occupied territory. It is regularly hit by air strikes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-russian-missile-strike-kills-3-/7793101.html	2024-09-21T00:49:25-07:00

Volunteer network of interpreters hopes to make refugees' languages more accessible via AI	NEW YORK — They may be Tigrinya speakers fleeing the authoritarian Eritrean government's indefinite military service policy. Or Rohingya people escaping ethnic violence in Myanmar. But refugees navigating resettlement often face a shared hurdle: poor machine translations and a short supply of interpreters knowledgeable in their less-serviced languages. Tarjimly, a Google-backed nonprofit described as 'Uber for translators,' aims to help asylum seekers clear that hurdle. Through a new artificial intelligence partnership, Tarjimly trains outside large language models while allowing its volunteers to respond more urgently to needs for translators. It's a feedback loop where humans teach the nuances of each language to the machines by sharing data from one-on-one calls and correcting automated translations. And it's this uniquely human realm of language that Tarjimly co-founder Atif Javed believes exemplifies the ever-tricky balance between individuals' ingenuity and technological advancement. He says it's the needed personal touch that shows why AI's rapid development shouldn't generally stoke widespread fears. Languages popular in the Global South — such as the Dari and Pashto commonly spoken in Afghanistan, home to one of the world's largest protracted refugee crises — have the worst quality coverage, according to Javed. He feels well positioned to supplement the internet's English-dominated information troves that train services like Google Translate with his mobile app's more diverse data sets. Tarjimly connects refugees with on-demand interpreters, who can communicate during meetings with social workers, immigration officials and doctors, and records the encounters for AI training. To comply with patient privacy protections, Tarjimly anonymizes the conversations on its app. Javed said the nonprofit also has on option for 'no record' sessions where none of the data is stored for alternative uses. Many of its 60,000 volunteers are multilingual refugees themselves who more intimately understand not only their counterpart's native tongue but also the crisis that brought them there, according to Javed. Among them is Roza Tesfazion, a 26-year-old Eritrean refugee who works professionally as an interpreter for the United Kingdom's government. Fluent in Amharic and Tigrinya, she studied English and Swahili to help her immigrant family overcome language barriers when they first moved to Kenya. Tesfazion said she translates at no cost because she knows 'how emotional it is' for the people on the other side of her sessions. 'You have to have that touch of human emotions to it,' she said. Tarjimly's founders say their mission's sensitive nature lends itself to nonprofit status more than a corporate structure. Users arrive in very vulnerable positions, and the nonprofit works with established humanitarian groups including Catholic Charities, the International Rescue Committee and the United Nations' International Organization for Migration. The work requires a level of trust that would have been difficult to earn in a 'for-profit, competitive world,' according to Javed. 'The underlying engine of our success is the community we've built.' That community, however, also has room for artificial intelligence. A $1.3 million grant from Google.org has enabled a 'First Pass' tool that gives an instantly generated translation for human volunteers to revise. A new information hub will open up its language data for partners, including Google, in early 2025. But refining a more diverse library of languages will require conversational data at a scale much broader than Tarjimly can likely provide on its own, according to Data & Society researcher Ranjit Singh. Singh, who studies the social implications of automation and inclusive digital solutions, said translation services will always need a 'real person in the middle.' 'There is one part of it which is translation and another part of it which is just trying to understand somebody's life situation,' he said. 'Technologies help us do some of this work. But at the same time, it's also fairly social.' Tarjimly was inspired by Javed's time volunteering with Arabic speakers at refugee camps in Greece and Turkey after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and working in Silicon Valley. A Muslim American whose family immigrated to the United States in 2001, Javed said he was reminded of his own childhood translating for his refugee grandmother. His lived experience is one reason why Elevate Prize Foundation CEO Carolina Garcìa Jayaram said her organization awarded $300,000 last year to Tarjimly. That 'proximate leadership' helps nonprofits better understand developments like artificial intelligence that 'can be both cause for excitement and trepidation,' Jayaram said. The risk-averse philanthropic sector may be slow to catch up with disruptive new technologies, she noted, but shouldn't ignore their positive applications. 'It's a great example of how not to get stuck in that bogeyman complex about AI,' she said. 'To go to leaders who are closest to those issues and say, 'How would AI unlock the possibilities and opportunities for your organization?''	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd-volunteer-network-of-interpreters-hopes-to-make-refugees-languages-more-accessible-via-ai/7793003.html	2024-09-21T00:27:20-07:00	
Congo struggles to contain mpox; here’s why	KAVUMU, Congo — Health authorities have struggled to contain outbreaks of mpox in Congo, a huge central African country where a myriad of existing problems makes stemming the spread particularly hard. Last month, the World Health Organization declared the outbreaks in Congo and about a dozen other African countries a global health emergency. And in Congo, scientists have identified a new strain of mpox that may spread more easily. It has reached areas where conflict and the displacement of a large number of people have already put health services under pressure. Overall, Congo has more than 21,000 of the 25,093 confirmed and suspected mpox cases in Africa this year, according to WHO's most recent count. Has Congo seen cases of mpox before? Yes, Congo is one of the African countries where mpox has been endemic for decades. Mpox, once known as monkeypox, comes from the same family of viruses as smallpox but causes milder symptoms such as fever. People with more serious cases can develop skin lesions. More than 720 people in Africa have died in the latest outbreaks, mostly in Congo. Mpox is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread to humans from infected animals. In the global mpox outbreak of 2022, the virus spread between people primarily through sex and close physical contact. What changed in Congo? In September 2023, mpox spread to Congo's eastern province of South Kivu; it had previously been seen in the center and far west. Scientists then identified a new form of mpox in South Kivu that may be more infectious. The WHO said that from the outbreak in South Kivu, the virus spread among people elsewhere in the country, arriving in neighboring province North Kivu. Those two provinces — some 2,000 kilometers from the capital, Kinshasa — face escalating violence, a humanitarian crisis and other issues. What are the problems in eastern Congo? More than 120 armed groups have been fighting each other and the Congolese army for years in the eastern part of the country over the control of minerals. That has forced millions of people fleeing violence into refugee camps or nearby towns. That means mpox is hitting already-stretched health facilities. Dr. Musole Mulambamunva Robert, medical director of the Kavumu hospital in eastern Congo, said it is 'truly a challenge' — sometimes treating as many as four times the facility's capacity for patients. With more than 6 million displaced people in the east, authorities and aid agencies were already struggling to provide food and healthcare, while fighting other diseases such as cholera. Many people have no access to soap, clean water or other basics. Some eastern Congo communities are out of reach of health clinics — roads are unreliable, and hourslong risky boat trips are sometimes the only means of transport, said Mercy Muthee Lake of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent. People can be more susceptible to severe mpox cases because of malnutrition and undiagnosed HIV, she said. She also said health workers in eastern Congo have requested more mpox training as medications to treat fever and ease pain run out. Health authorities 'are up against it because it's such a complex area,' said Chris Beyrer, of Duke University's Global Health Institute. What about vaccines? Africa has no capacity to produce mpox vaccines. Around 250,000 doses have arrived in Congo from the European Union and the United States, and more are expected. Congolese authorities say they need around 3 million vaccines. It will likely be weeks before any vaccines reach people in eastern Congo. For now, the vaccine is approved only for adults. There's limited evidence of how it works in children. Vaccines are desperately needed, but they're just 'an additional tool,' said Emmanuel Lampaert, the Congo representative for Doctors Without Borders. The key, Lampaert said, is still identifying cases, isolating patients, and executing grassroots health and education campaigns. Local conditions make that trying — Lampaert noted it's almost impossible to isolate cases among poor, displaced people. 'Families with six to eight children are living in a hut, which is maybe the space of the bed we are sleeping in,' he said. 'So, this is the reality.' Why are critics blasting the mpox response? Unlike the millions of dollars that poured into Congo for Ebola and COVID aid, the response to mpox has been sluggish, many critics say. Health experts say the sharp contrast is due to a lack of both funds and international interest. 'Ebola is the most dangerous virus in the world, and COVID wiped out the world economy,' said professor Ali Bulabula, who works on infectious diseases in the medical department at Congo's University of Kindu. 'While mpox is a public health emergency of international concern, there is a lack of in-depth research and interest in the virus, as it's still seen as a tropical disease, localized to Africa with no major impact on Western economies.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-struggles-to-contain-mpox-here-s-why-/7792992.html	2024-09-21T00:26:42-07:00	
As traces of Pakistani megacity's past vanish, flamboyant pink palace endures	KARACHI, Pakistan — Stained glass windows, a sweeping staircase and embellished interiors make Mohatta Palace a gem in Karachi, a Pakistani megacity of 20 million people. Peacocks roam the lawn and the sounds of construction and traffic melt away as visitors enter the grounds. The pink stone balustrades, domes and parapets look like they've been plucked from the northern Indian state of Rajasthan, a relic of a time when Muslims and Hindus lived side by side in the port city. But magnificence is no guarantee of survival in a city where land is scarce and development is rampant. Demolition, encroachment, neglect, piecemeal conservation laws and vandalism are eroding signs of Karachi's past. The building's trustees have fended off an attempt to turn it into a dental college, but there's still a decadeslong lawsuit in which heirs of a former owner are trying to take control of the land. It sat empty for almost two decades before formally opening as a museum in 1999. The palace sits on prime real estate in the desirable neighborhood of Old Clifton, among mansions, businesses and upmarket restaurants. The land under buildings like the Mohatta Palace is widely coveted, said palace lawyer Faisal Siddiqi. 'It shows that greed is more important than heritage.' Karachi's population grows by around 2% every year and with dozens of communities and cultures competing for space there's little effort to protect the city's historic sites. For most Pakistanis, the palace is the closest they'll get to the architectural splendor of India's Rajasthan, because travel restrictions and hostile bureaucracies largely keep people in either country from crossing the border for leisure, study or work. Karachi's multicultural past makes it harder to find champions for preservation than in a city like Lahore, with its strong connection to the Muslim-dominated Mughal Empire, said Heba Hashmi, a heritage manager and maritime archaeologist. 'The scale of organic local community support needed to prioritize government investment in the preservation effort is nearly impossible to garner in a city as socially fragmented as Karachi,' she said. Mohatta Palace is a symbol of that diversity. Hindu entrepreneur Shivratan Mohatta had it built in the 1920s because he wanted a coastal residence for his ailing wife to benefit from the Arabian Sea breeze. Hundreds of donkey carts carried the distinctively colored pink stone from Jodhpur, now across the border in India. He left after partition in 1947, when India and Pakistan were carved from the former British Empire as independent nations, and for a time the palace was occupied by the Foreign Ministry. Next, it passed into the hands of Pakistani political royalty as the home of Fatima Jinnah, the younger sister of Pakistan's first leader and a powerful politician in her own right. After her death, the authorities gave the building to her sister Shirin, but Shirin's passing in 1980 sparked a court fight between people saying they were her relatives, and a court ordered the building sealed. The darkened and empty palace, with its overgrown gardens and padlocked gates, caught people's imagination. Rumors spread of spirits and supernatural happenings. Someone who heard the stories as a young girl was Nasreen Askari, now the museum's director. 'As a child I used to rush past,' she said. 'I was told it was a bhoot (ghost) bungalow and warned, don't go there.' Visitor Ahmed Tariq had heard a lot about the palace's architecture and history. 'I'm from Bahawalpur (in Punjab, India) where we have the Noor Mahal palace, so I wanted to look at this one. It's well-maintained, there's a lot of detail and effort in the presentations. It's been a good experience.' But the money to maintain the palace isn't coming from admission fees. General admission is 30 rupees, or 10 U.S. cents, and it's free for students, children and seniors. On a sweltering afternoon, the palace drew just a trickle of visitors. It's open Tuesday to Sunday but closes on public holidays; even the 11 a.m.-6 p.m. hours are not conducive for a late-night city like Karachi. The palace is rented out for corporate and charitable events. Local media report that residents grumble about traffic and noise levels. But the palace doesn't welcome all attention, even if it could help carve out a space for the building in modern Pakistan. Rumors about ghosts still spread by TikTok, pulling in influencers looking for spooky stories. But the palace bans filming inside, and briefly banned TikTokers. 'It is not the attention the trustees wanted,' said Askari. 'That's what happens when you have anything of consequence or unusual. It catches the eye.' A sign on the gates also prohibits fashion shoots, weddings and filming for commercials. 'We could make so much money, but the floodgates would open,' said Askari. 'There would be non-stop weddings and no space for visitors or events, so much cleaning up as well.' Hashmi, the archaeologist, said there is often a strong sense of territorialism around the sites that have been preserved. 'It counterproductively converts a site of public heritage into an exclusive and often expensive artifact for selective consumption.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-traces-of-pakistani-megacity-s-past-vanish-flamboyant-pink-palace-endures/7791582.html	2024-09-21T00:26:00-07:00

Residents of Springfield, Ohio, wait for political firestorm to blow over	SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — In the quiet corners of Springfield, Ohio — out of sight of the drumbeat of politicians and journalists, troopers and newly installed security cameras — the people who live here are taking a breath, praying and attempting to carry on. Between the morning bomb sweeps of Springfield's schools and the near daily afternoon media briefings, a hush comes over the city of 58,000 that residents say is uncanny, haunting even. It's fear. It's confusion — dismay at being transformed overnight into a target for the nation's vitriol. Pastor Andy Mobley, who runs the Family Needs Inc. food pantry on the city's south side, said people are hunkered down out of the public eye. He said they're hoping the attention sparked by former President Donald Trump spreading unsubstantiated rumors about the city's legal Haitian immigrants eating house pets during last week's presidential debate will blow over. Trump and his vice presidential running mate, Ohio's junior Sen. JD Vance, have used the cat-eating rumors to draw attention to the city's 15,000 Haitian immigrants, whose arrival to fill manufacturing, distribution and warehouse jobs has put a severe strain on local resources. Since the Republican candidates' initial comments, more than two dozen bomb threats — mostly from foreign actors seeking to sow discord — have prompted the state to send in additional state troopers and install surveillance cameras around the city in order to reopen schools and government buildings. 'We've got good people here. Republican, Democrat. They're good people,' Mobley said Tuesday, as the pantry tended to a steady stream of clients seeking clothing and food. Resident Josh Valle said the situation is unsettling. 'We definitely need answers,' said the 35-year-old tool and die repairman, who has lived in Springfield for decades. 'It's affecting my kids and my community and my neighbors. With the bomb threats and the influx, it's something new every day. And this used to be a really chill town, you know, it used to be just a small town Ohio.' The area around Springfield City Hall, where Valle spoke, sat largely silent Tuesday afternoon, until a news conference with state and local officials prompted a brief swarm of activity. Local families are avoiding schools in the wake of earlier bomb threats, even though dozens of troopers have fanned out across the Springfield City School District to stand guard. Some 200 of 500 students were absent Tuesday from a single elementary school, officials said. Still, there are signs of hope. 'Home Sweet Springfield' tea towels adorn the window of Champion City Guide & Supply on a downtown block that bustles with activity over the lunch hour. One line of mugs and clothing items reads: 'Speak a Good Word for Springfield — or say nothing.' Across town, a small group of kids whose parents kept them home on Tuesday horsed around together at a makeshift lemonade stand they set up to make a few bucks. They delighted in the revving motor of a passing muscle car and, when sales were slow, swigged back the merchandise. David Graham, who visits communities in crisis as The Praying Cowboy, positioned himself in Springfield this week to show support. 'Agenda: Pray, worship, witness, smile, honor, esteem,' he wrote in a Facebook post from the city, accompanied by his hands holding an open Bible with a newly installed surveillance platform in the background. He added lines with black electrical tape to a small heart placard he posted nearby, to represent Springfield hearts being broken. He wasn't the only one trying to help. A bipartisan group of area mayors met with Springfield Mayor Rob Rue on Monday to figure out how they can help — including with resources to address the traffic, health care, social services and housing needs prompted by the increase in the Haitian population and their language barrier. Andrew Ginther, the Democratic mayor of Ohio's capital, Columbus, and president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said in a statement: 'Mayors across America will continue to stand by Springfield and all cities working to responsibly address an increased number of migrants, which we can do without losing sight of our shared humanity.' Years ago, Family Needs Inc. was designated one of President George H.W. Bush's 'thousand points of light,' honoring its dedication to volunteerism. The organization has helped Haitians arriving in Springfield for years now, Mobley said — providing them translation services and co-signing their rental agreements. He recalled working with Haitian immigrants as far back as 2016, the year Trump was elected — though census figures show the population remained at only about 400 until a few years ago. 'In 2016, we started signing contracts. Through the pandemic, we were doing things for the Haitian community,' he said. 'Has that all been forgotten? They have been here, and we've been dealing with this, and we've been asking for help through two different administrations. And no administration has helped us, until now this thing has become public.' As she walked downtown, one resident who declined to give her name said she's not letting the situation get her down. 'It's childish. It's stupid. It took one stupid person to get on a debate and ruin the reputation of a community. I think you know exactly who I'm talking about,' she said. 'He should never have said that. There's no truth to those allegations whatsoever. I was born and raised in this town, I'm staying here, and I have no problem with nobody.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/residents-of-springfield-ohio-wait-for-political-firestorm-to-blow-over/7791540.html	2024-09-21T00:23:21-07:00	
Faces of transgender people adorn an artwork in London's Trafalgar Square	LONDON — An artwork featuring the plaster face casts of hundreds of transgender people went on display Wednesday in London's Trafalgar Square, where their features will be worn away by London's wind and rain over the next 18 months. Mexican artist Teresa Margolles' 'Mil Veces un Instante (A Thousand Times in an Instant)' is a 3.3-metric-ton cube covered in face masks of 726 trans, nonbinary and gender nonconforming people. It's the latest artwork placed atop the 'Fourth Plinth,' a large stone pedestal in the central London square. Margolles, who trained as a forensic pathologist and once worked in a morgue, has used blood and material from crime scenes in artworks exploring death and conflict. The new sculpture evokes a Tzompantli, a rack used in Mesoamerican civilizations to display the skulls of captured enemies and sacrifice victims. It pays tribute to one of the artist's friends, a transgender woman named Karla who was killed in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico in 2015. The crime remains unsolved. 'We pay this tribute to her and to all the other people who were killed for reasons of hate,' the artist said. 'But, above all, to those who live on, to the new generations who will defend the power to freely choose to live with dignity.' Organizers of the project say the work will 'naturally age' while on display, with the detail of the faces slowly fading as the plaster is exposed to the elements. One of London's main gathering spots for tourists and protesters, Trafalgar Square was named for Admiral Horatio Nelson's 1805 victory over the French and Spanish fleets. A statue of the one-armed admiral stands atop Nelson's Column at the center of the square, and statues of other 19th-century military leaders are nearby. The fourth plinth — 7-meter-high stone pedestal — was erected in 1841 for a never-completed equestrian statue, and since 1999 has been occupied by a series of artworks for about 18 months at a time.

How three US men ended up facing death penalty over Congo coup attempt	KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo — A military court in Democratic Republic of Congo, one of Africa's largest countries, has convicted three Americans and dozens of others of taking part in a coup attempt and imposed 'the harshest penalty, that of death.' The court convicted the 37 defendants, including the three Americans and imposed the death penalty in a verdict delivered by presiding judge Maj. Freddy Ehuma at an open-air military court proceeding. The defendants, a majority of them Congolese but also including a Briton, a Belgian and a Canadian, were charged with terrorism, murder, criminal association and illegal possession of weapons, among other charges. The lawyer who defended the six foreigners said they would appeal the verdicts. The U.S. State Department strongly discourages travel to Congo, warning of violent crime and civil unrest. Here's how the three Americans ended up in the middle of the coup attempt. What happened during the coup attempt in May? In Congo's capital Kinshasa, a ragtag group including three Americans tried to unseat the country's President Felix Tshisekedi. They were led by a little-known opposition figure, Christian Malanga, who sold used cars and dabbled in gold mining before persuading his Utah-born son to join in the foiled coup. The coup attempt began at the Kinshasa residence of Tshisekedi's close ally, Vital Kamerhe, a federal legislator and a candidate for Speaker of the National Assembly of Congo. His guards killed some of the attackers, officials said. Christian Malanga, meanwhile, was live-streaming video from the presidential palace in which he is seen surrounded by several armed men in military uniforms wandering around in the middle of the night. He was later killed while resisting arrest, Congolese authorities said. Dozens, including Malanga's son and two other Americans, were arrested and brought to a high-security military prison in Kinshasa. Family members said the young men have been sleeping on the floor, struggling with health issues and have had to pay for food and hygiene products. Christian Malanga, the unlikely coup leader Malanga, who was born in Kinshasa, had described himself as a refugee who thrived after settling in the U.S. with his family in the 1990s. He said he became a leader of a Congolese opposition political party and met high-level officials in Washington and the Vatican. He also described himself as a devoted husband and father of eight. Court records and interviews paint another picture. In 2001, the year he turned 18, Malanga was convicted in Utah of assault with a firearm, which resulted in a 30-day jail sentence and three years of probation. That same year, he was charged with domestic violence assault in one incident and battery and disturbing the peace in another, but he pleaded not guilty and all counts in both cases were dismissed. In 2004, he was charged with domestic violence with threat of using a dangerous weapon, but he pleaded not guilty and the charges were again dismissed. Since 2004, records show several cases related to a custody dispute and a child support dispute. How three young Americans got involved in a coup attempt The three imprisoned Americans are Malanga's 21-year-old son Marcel Malanga, Tyler Thompson Jr., 21, who flew to Africa from Utah with the younger Malanga for what his family believed was a free vacation, and Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun, 36, who is reported to have known Christian Malanga through a gold mining company. Marcel Malanga is a U.S. citizen and was born in Utah. He told the court his father had threatened to kill him and Thompson if they did not take part in the attack. His mother, Brittney Sawyer, has said her son is innocent and was simply following his father, who considered himself president of a shadow government in exile. Thompson was his high school friend and football teammate in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Jordan. He was the only former teammate to accept Marcel Malanga's invitation to travel to Congo, according to several other players who told The Associated Press they had been invited to what the younger Malanga pitched interchangeably as a family vacation or as a service trip to build wells. Other teammates alleged that Marcel Malanga had offered up to $100,000 to join him on a 'security job' in Congo. Thompson's family maintains he had no knowledge of the elder Malanga's intentions, no plans for political activism and didn't even plan to enter Congo. He and the Malangas were meant to travel only to South Africa and Eswatini, his stepmother, Miranda Thompson, said. Here's what happens next All of those convicted have five days to appeal the verdict. Richard Bondo, the lawyer who defended the Americans and three other foreigners, said he plans to do so. Congo reinstated the death penalty earlier this year, lifting a more than two-decade-old moratorium, as authorities struggle to curb violence and militant attacks in the country. The men convicted in the coup attempt would likely be executed by firing squad. The U.S. State Department has not declared the Americans wrongfully detained, making it unlikely that U.S. officials would try to negotiate their return.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-three-us-men-ended-up-facing-death-penalty-over-congo-coup-attempt-/7790062.html	2024-09-21T00:19:05-07:00

New Zealand pilot Phillip Mehrtens freed from captivity in Indonesia's Papua	JAKARTA, Indonesia — New Zealand pilot Phillip Mehrtens has been freed more than 19 months after being kidnapped by armed separatists in Indonesia's Papua, authorities said on Saturday. Mehrtens was freed and picked up by a joint team in the Nduga area and was undergoing health check-ups and a psychological examination in Timika regency, the Indonesian police said in a statement. A faction of the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB), led by Egianus Kogoya, kidnapped Mehrtens on February 7, 2023, after he landed a small commercial plane in the remote, mountainous area of Nduga. 'We are pleased and relieved to confirm that Phillip Mehrtens is safe and well and has been able to talk with his family. This news must be an enormous relief for his friends and loved ones,' said New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters. A range of New Zealand government agencies had been working with Indonesian authorities and others toward securing Mehrtens' release, Peters said in a statement. Indonesian Brigadier General Faizal Ramadhani, head of Cartenz 2024 Peace Operations, said, 'We are prioritizing approach through religious leaders, church leaders, traditional leaders and Egianus Kogoya's close family to minimize casualties and maintain the safety of the pilot.' Indonesian police said they would hold a press conference later Saturday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-pilot-phillip-mehrtens-freed-from-captivity-in-indonesia-s-papua/7793082.html	2024-09-20T23:39:31-07:00	
Souls of Ancestors' display stirs new interest in Cambodian antiquity	PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA — Nhem Liza made her first visit to the National Museum of Cambodia after learning about the August return from the United States of dozens of looted Cambodian artifacts, including important Hindu and Buddhist masterpieces dating from the ninth to 14th centuries. 'Those artifacts are amazing,' said 15-year-old Nhem, a 10th grade Phnom Penh high school student. The return of the statues — viewed as divine or containing the souls of ancestors — has given younger Cambodians like Nhem an opportunity to embrace the country’s cultural heritage and history. 'I am excited to see these artifacts our government is trying to get back,' she told VOA on September 16 after viewing some of objects now on display at the museum. Cambodia has worked for years to identify and secure the return of culturally and historically important relics from private collections and museums overseas, many of which were lost to the country because of war, theft and the illegal artifact trade. Cambodia faced continuous civil unrest from the mid-1960s until the early 1990s and archeological sites from the ancient Khmer Empire, such as Angkor Wat and Koh Ker, suffered serious damage and widespread looting, Cambodian officials told VOA Khmer. In August, Cambodia celebrated the return of 70 items from museums and private collections overseas, including 14 from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The objects include priceless stone statues such as one depicting a mythical warrior from the Hindu epic Mahabharata. There are also statues of Hindu deities Shiva and Parvati, and one of the Hindu god Ardhanarishvara from the ancient capital of Koh Ker, according to Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts. Presiding over the return ceremony, Prime Minister Hun Manet said the 70 returned objects symbolically reunited the Cambodian people with their 'ancestral souls,' adding that the government will continue working to bring more artifacts home. From 1996 to July of this year, 1,098 artifacts had been returned to Cambodia — 571 from private collections and 527 from foreign institutions and governments, Hun said. 'It is the soul of our nation,' Doeun Sokun Aly, 18, told VOA at the museum. 'The heroes of our country built those artifacts for the younger generation to know about those antiques. … I will visit museums more to see more artifacts.' National Museum Director Chhay Visoth told VOA the display is meant to stir new interest from Cambodians, especially younger Cambodians. 'Recently, we have seen a surprising increase of Cambodian visitors to the museum, especially youth,' he said by phone this week. The authorities, he said, are now planning to conduct a 'mobile exhibition' to display the artifacts at museums in provinces such as Siem Reap, Battambang and Pursat, in the northwestern part of the country. Chhay said the museum also hopes the display will send a message to private collectors and museums overseas that 'those artifacts are greatly important' and 'not for beautifying gardens, kitchens, living rooms, residents or offices of the rich.' 'For Cambodians, they are meaningful indeed. Those artifacts are the souls of Khmer ancestors,' he said. Chhay added that the museum is already planning to expand its display area to accommodate more returned artifacts. Over the years, Cambodia has received dozens of statues from the families of wealthy collectors, such as George Lindemann, a U.S. businessman and philanthropist who died in 2018. In 2021, after three years of negotiations, the family of the late British art collector Douglas Latchford agreed to return more than 100 Cambodian artifacts, according to the government. Latchford, who co-authored three books on Cambodian art and antiques, died in 2020 facing accusations that he had illegally trafficked the artifacts to his homes in Bangkok and London. In November 2019, federal prosecutors in New York charged Latchford with falsifying the provenance, invoices and shipping documents to transport valuable Khmer-era relics to private collections, museums and auction houses around the world. Other cultural objects that have found their way back to Cambodia went through processes including voluntary returns, negotiations, seizures and legal proceedings. The United States has helped secure the return of well over 150 antiques to Cambodia so far, Wesley Holzer, a U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Phnom Penh said. 'The United States is proud of its longstanding contributions to preserving and restoring Cambodia’s cultural heritage,' he told VOA in an email, adding that Cambodia is the first country in Southeast Asia to establish a bilateral property repatriation memorandum of understanding with the U.S. 'Through this MOU, the United States and Cambodia have trained heritage professionals, prevented pillaging of antiquities, and facilitated the return of looted artifacts. This agreement also makes it illegal to import certain Cambodian archeological and ethnological material into the United States,' he added. Bradley Gordon, a lawyer representing Cambodian government, said there were 'many more' that his team are searching for. 'To be clear, Cambodia does not want to empty out museums around the world, but wants many important and precious national treasures to come home. Cambodia also is open to long-term loans which they are exploring with a number of museums,' he added. A member of Gordon’s restitution team, Cambodian researcher Kunthea Chhoun, said getting the artifacts back is not easy. 'We need to investigate and collect testimonies from looters, villagers and brokers. It takes a great amount of patience and many interviews. We have used different approaches to get back our artifacts and it has taken many years,' she told VOA in a September 20 email.	https://www.voanews.com/a/souls-of-ancestors-display-stirs-new-interest-in-cambodian-antiquity/7793071.html	2024-09-20T21:57:52-07:00
